 Previously on "God Friended Me" Oh! 
  Take that, old man! 
  Old? 
  I'm the youngest member of the board of your daddy's church. 
  Yeah, that building's gonna be a game-changer. 
  And everyone in the community is pulling for you, Terrence. 
  - [ALL CHEERING] 
  - Oh, my God! 
  Just want to thank everyone for coming out and helping celebrate my aunt and uncle on their 25th anniversary. 
  [ALL CHEERING] 
  I thought you were enjoying yourself. 
  I was just putting on a good face for our family. 
  I have it under control. 
  Everything's gonna be fine. 
  [LIVELY ELECTRONIC MUSIC] 
  We're gonna rise, rise, rise, rise, rise Till we fall Sunday morning. 
  It means something different to everyone. 
  Church, brunch, football, hitting the snooze button and waking up an hour later. 
  Truth is, it doesn't matter how you spend your Sunday. 
  What matters is who you spend your Sunday with. 
  The people in your life. 
  Your village. 
  Your friends. 
  Your family. 
  They're the ones behind you. 
  The ones you count on that are always there for you. 
  Have faith in them. 
  Because when you do, good things happen. 
  Having faith in each other is the true meaning of God. 
  That is the reason this church stands firmly. 
  The reason we can build towards a better tomorrow. 
  The reason, I am proud to say, that Harlem Episcopal has finally raised enough funds to build our Children's Center. 
  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  Oh, bam! 
  Mmm. 
  Arthur, that Children's Center is a major accomplishment. 
  I'm sorry that Lena couldn't join us today. 
  She's feeling a little under the weather. 
  Everything okay with you two? 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  I mean, I know what you saw at the party, but we're good. 
  - Hey, guys. 
  - Hey. 
  There he is. 
  - What's happening? 
  - Hey. 
  Miles, you are just in time. 
  I am one move away from checkmating your uncle. 
  Your king is unprotected. 
  No, sir. 
  See, what you call that - is a strategy, okay. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  How's the marketing class going? 
  Oh, it couldn't be better. 
  I was, uh, unaware that you were back in school. 
  Oh, it's it's an extension course, Dad. 
  Uncle T hooked me up with one of his professors. 
  Uh-huh. 
  - No, no, no, no! 
  - Check. 
  Mate. 
  - Every time - [PHONE RINGING] 
  You're lucky. 
  I got this, excuse me a second. 
  Yep? 
  Look, Dad, I was gonna tell you about the class. 
  Yeah. 
  Of course. 
  No, no, no, no, no. 
  That is not what we discussed. 
  All right. 
  I'll be right there. 
  - Is everything okay? 
  - Yeah, just just gotta head down to the construction site and handle a couple things. 
  Y'all keep playing. 
  Don't let this man win, okay? 
  It's bad for his ego. 
  He seems stressed. 
  Your uncle's always got a million things going on. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm sure he will be fine. 
  [PHONE BUZZING] 
  - - Everything okay? 
  So how'd dinner go with Eli? 
  Uh, awkward at first, but then kinda great. 
  You gonna see him again? 
  Uh yeah, I don't know. 
  I'm still figuring it out. 
  You know, it's nice to be able to talk to you about this kind of stuff. 
  It's nice to be here and listen. 
  Care Bear. 
  Dad? 
  Surprise. 
  I would have called, but this is more Hello, Jeffrey. 
  Susan. 
  [SIGHING] 
  God, you should have seen his face. 
  - And her face. 
  - I'm surprised you didn't tell your dad, I thought you two were close. 
  Yeah, well, we are. 
  But could you imagine that phone call? 
  "Hey, Dad, remember the woman who "Left us and never came back, "Broke your heart into, like, a million little pieces? 
  "Well, actually, we've been hanging out "And like, totally bonding. 
  How are things with you?" I wouldn't lead with that. 
  Can I just say something here? 
  It is truly refreshing to see someone else spiral. 
  So thank you. 
  Oh, by the way, I sent the God account's new firewall to this old friend of mine. 
  If anybody can help crack it, it's her. 
  Good, because whoever's behind the God account really upped their game. 
  I got a new friend suggestion. 
  It's for my Uncle Terrence. 
  Thing is, we're already friends. 
  God account's getting personal. 
  This is the first time you've gotten a suggestion for someone you know. 
  Do you have any idea why they would have sent you his name? 
  No. 
  Terrence is one of the most important people in my life. 
  And yet, somehow the God account knows something is wrong before I do? 
  Well, it's a good thing you got his name, then. 
  You could figure out how to help him. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Nephew. 
  Ha ha! 
  You in the big leagues now, Uncle T! 
  Pretty impressive, huh? 
  It looks amazing, really. 
  For the people who live here built by the people who live here. 
  Money stays right here and it's all good for the community. 
  What's happening, baby? 
  Uh You, um, remember I told you about the God account? 
  Yeah. 
  Well. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  You gotta be kidding me. 
  Uncle T. 
  You and me, we have always been honest with each other. 
  Is there something you want to tell me? 
  We should talk. 
  So how does this usually work? 
  Well, it's different every time, but you're the first friend suggestion I actually know. 
  And they sent you my name when? 
  Right after you took off from the park. 
  Hey, you got a phone call right before that, something about work and you seemed pretty stressed. 
  Is everything okay? 
  That was a permit issue. 
  I mean, that's already been fixed. 
  But truthfully, things have been really stressful at work. 
  Terrence. 
  Conrad. 
  Ah, meet my nephew, Miles Finer. 
  Reverend Finer's boy, of course. 
  Your father's been a role model in our community since I can remember. 
  Oh, well, thank you, man. 
  Yeah, your uncle here ain't too far behind. 
  That high-rise he's building, that's gonna change things. 
  If you ever need anything, - give me a call. 
  - No doubt. 
  All right, you two enjoy your Sunday. 
  You as well. 
  Who's that? 
  This dude I grew up with. 
  Listen, I want to talk to you, though, about something, and I want to make sure that you hear it from me directly. 
  - Hmm? 
  - Your Auntie Lena. 
  She's asked me for a divorce. 
  Wait, I'm I don't understand. 
  You guys just celebrated 25 years together and now all of the sudden she's asking for a divorce? 
  It's my fault. 
  Spend way too much time at the construction site and not enough time with my wife. 
  Then just talk to her. 
  Okay, let her know that things got away from you and that you're going to spend time with her. 
  I plan on doing more of that. 
  But I gotta get this construction complete. 
  No. 
  No, you can't wait. 
  I know it sounds crazy. 
  It's selfish, I know, because it is. 
  But listen. 
  I've been working my entire life to get here. 
  This is my shot at a seat at the table. 
  I got a chance to make my mark on this city. 
  To build something that will stand the test of time. 
  Look, I just have to see this through completion. 
  And I know I can I know I can get Lena back. 
  So your friend suggestion or not, I gotta do this my way. 
  Yeah, I'm sorry you had to find out about Mom like that. 
  Well, to be honest, um I knew the two of you have reconnected. 
  It's sort of why I'm here. 
  You read my article. 
  Why didn't you say anything? 
  Well, I figured since you didn't bring it up you weren't ready to talk about it. 
  And I wanted to give you the space you needed. 
  But I couldn't stop worrying about you. 
  Hey, I'm I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
  I guess it's just when I tell you things, that's when they become real. 
  And I wasn't really sure I was ready for that. 
  You know, when you were growing up I would ask you every question under the sun. 
  But I never brought up your mother. 
  And that's on me. 
  I want you to know you can talk to me about her. 
  I'm glad. 
  But I do need to ask you something. 
  Okay? 
  Is Susan sober? 
  Dad. 
  Yes. 
  For a long time now. 
  I had to ask. 
  I know how much she hurt you. 
  The both of us. 
  So I know you'll never really be okay with this unless you talk to her. 
  See for yourself how much she's changed. 
  Maybe we could all have dinner or something? 
  Fine. 
  But make it lunch. 
  I want dinner to be the two of us. 
  They can't be splitting up. 
  I mean, they're Aunt Lena and Uncle T. 
  That's what I said. 
  I'm gonna head over to Lena's tomorrow and check in on her. 
  Hey, well, what am I supposed to do, Al? 
  Uncle T said that he does not want my help. 
  But I cannot turn my back on family. 
  Are you asking your sister - or the therapist? 
  - Both. 
  Well, your sister would say you should stay the hell out of it. 
  I mean, Miles, they've been married for 25 years and don't need their nephew solving their marriage problems. 
  Okay, so what does the therapist say? 
  She says you've put your uncle on a pedestal your entire life. 
  Now you're scared of finding out he's anything but perfect. 
  Marriages don't end on a whim, Miles. 
  Your point? 
  That there's obviously some things going on that we don't know about. 
  Things maybe they don't want us to know about. 
  I mean, some things just can't be fixed. 
  But why did the God account send me Terrence's name? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe there's something else in his life you're supposed to help him with. 
  Well that's all the time we have here today. 
  Oh, and don't forget the ceremony for the new Children's Center. 
  Dad would love to see you there. 
  Yeah, I'll be there. 
  All right, bro, see you later. 
  Okay. 
  [THOUGHTFUL MUSIC] 
  So did your hacker friend give you some insight on the God account? 
  - Over email? 
  - Yeah. 
  Are you insane? 
  Hackers are a paranoid bunch, bro. 
  - Not sure why. 
  - Maybe because they're engaged in criminal activity? 
  Not all hackers are involved in something illegal, Cara. 
  Some of us just enjoy coding. 
  Right. 
  Sorry. 
  I'm just tense about lunch with Mom and Dad. 
  Mom and Dad. 
  That is so weird to say out loud. 
  Hey, you're doing the right thing, you know? 
  Don't worry about it. 
  Maybe you're right. 
  But how are you holding up? 
  I mean, your aunt and uncle splitting must be tough. 
  Well, Ali said that I should stay out of it. 
  Right, but you're not going to. 
  Definitely not going to. 
  No, no, Terrence has always been there for me. 
  And I know how much he loves my aunt. 
  This must be the reason why the God account sent me his name. 
  Here you go. 
  So who are you guys waiting for? 
  Rakesh's hacker friend, that's if she ever shows up. 
  Yeah, how do you know her again? 
  Uh, we met at MIT. 
  And trust me, she's legit. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Wait, there she is right now. 
  Let me do the talking, okay? 
  She can get intense. 
  So no eye contact. 
  No sudden moves. 
  None of that. 
  Ramen-Rakesh. 
  Lemonhead-Lucy. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  I was just messing with you guys. 
  - This is Cara, that's Miles. 
  - Hey. 
  Rakesh said he had "friends. 
  " I had to see it with my own eyes. 
  - Ha-ha. 
  - So were you able to crack the firewall he sent you? 
  No. 
  Whoever designed it has some serious game. 
  You ever hear of Falken? 
  Uh, yeah. 
  He's only the most badass hacker ever. 
  He was developing a new computer language known as predictive code. 
  It's basically the building blocks of real AI. 
  And then, about ten years ago, he just vanished. 
  Went off the grid. 
  So you think the code was written by this Falken guy? 
  It's possible. 
  Give me a day. 
  Let me put out a few feelers. 
  Maybe someone knows what rock he's been hiding under. 
  What is it? 
  That's my Aunt Lena. 
  I'll be right back. 
  - Aunt Lena. 
  - Miles. 
  - What are you doing here? 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  I came down to speak with Ali. 
  I was gonna find you next. 
  Is everything okay? 
  I'm gonna be, uh, staying with my sister for a while. 
  I'm headed upstate tomorrow. 
  Look, Aunt Lena, Uncle knows that it is his fault. 
  Okay? 
  He still loves you. 
  And I love him, but sometimes that's not enough. 
  I know you've always looked up to him, Miles. 
  Aunt Lena. 
  Please. 
  Please. 
  He can fix this. 
  No. 
  He can't. 
  He's made decisions that have jeopardized everything we built together. 
  I'm sorry, Miles. 
  Oh. 
  Take care, sweetheart. 
  Hey. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  Listen to me. 
  The problem was with payroll. 
  Okay? 
  Your guys are gonna get paid. 
  I just need a little more time. 
  That's what you've said for two weeks. 
  I'm putting them on another job. 
  Come on, Tom. 
  Tom. 
  Y-You can't do this to me. 
  You Tommy! 
  Uncle T, what's going on? 
  Miles, now is not the time. 
  Yeah, I can see that. 
  Come on, talk to me. 
  Uncle T, I just talked to Auntie Lena. 
  Now whatever is going on, you can tell me. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm broke. 
  I'm broke. 
  I mean, I put every dime I have into this. 
  I've mortgaged my house Maxed out every line of credit. 
  And the problems just keep coming. 
  And coming and coming and coming. 
  I can't make the next bank payment. 
  It's over. 
  Well, maybe there's something else you can do. 
  You can take out a loan Oh, no, no, no. 
  I'm so far underwater, I mean, nobody wants to touch me. 
  That call I got this morning was from the bank. 
  I asked for an extension and no. 
  They're gonna take it. 
  You know, after everything that I've done, after all the sacrifices with Lena It's gone. 
  [SOFT MUSIC] 
  - How's Uncle Terrence doing? 
  - Devastated. 
  - So what's he gonna do? 
  - I don't know. 
  I mean, the bank is gonna foreclose today. 
  And I can't just sit back and do nothing. 
  There must be something I can do. 
  I know you want to help him. 
  But the kind of trouble that he's in, you can't get him out of. 
  Then why would the God account send me his name? 
  There has to be a way. 
  Maybe I can go talk to the bank. 
  See if they would give him another loan. 
  There is someone you need to talk to. 
  But it's not the bank. 
  I'm sorry to drop in on you like this, Dad. 
  Please. 
  To what do I owe the pleasure? 
  Hey. 
  There he is, my favorite nephew. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Terrence is helping me out with some last-minute permits. 
  We start construction on the Children's Center in a week. 
  And I want everything to go according to plan. 
  Is something wrong? 
  I don't know. 
  Something the two of you want to tell me? 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Your son came to visit me yesterday. 
  I'm sorry, I got him worried about nothing. 
  Nothing? 
  I was having a bad day. 
  On top of that I was having a ton of construction problems. 
  It was a temporary setback. 
  Look, I-I apologize. 
  I should not have dumped all my woes onto this young man. 
  Don't worry about it, baby. 
  I woke up this morning feeling like a champ. 
  I went down there, boom! 
  Got them straight at the bank. 
  But you said that wasn't possible. 
  Well, that's exactly why I don't talk to y'all folks about my business. 
  Come on, you know I almost lost this project a dozen times? 
  It's par for the course. 
  I apologize for all the dramatics. 
  But I promise you. 
  I promise you, I'm good. 
  I really think my uncle is hiding something. 
  Why would he lie about everything being okay? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe he doesn't want my dad to know how bad things are. 
  Yeah, or maybe he fixed everything. 
  I mean, you said he's a good businessman. 
  Yeah, she's right. 
  Yesterday could have just been about him feeling bad for himself. 
  No, no, I don't think so. 
  So what are you gonna do? 
  How hard would it be to dig into my uncle's finances? 
  Just to see what's going on with his business? 
  On a scale of one to ten, like a two. 
  - All right. 
  - Miles. 
  Are you sure? 
  That's an incredible breach of trust. 
  Cara, what other choice do I have? 
  Okay, if I find out that things have turned around for him, great. 
  But if they haven't, I need to know what's really going on. 
  Okay. 
  I gotta go to lunch, but you'll text me what you find? 
  I'll walk you out. 
  I have to head down to the groundbreaking ceremony. 
  Yo, you can use my computer. 
  If you find anything, please call me. 
  Well, that's great, uh I got nothing to do. 
  I thought we should talk about things before Cara arrives. 
  There's nothing to talk about. 
  If Cara wants to forgive and forget, that's her choice. 
  I can't stop her from having a relationship with you. 
  The only thing I hope is that you really have changed. 
  I have. 
  If being sober has taught me anything, it's the need for honesty. 
  Jeffrey. 
  Cara's finally opening up to me. 
  We could have a real relationship. 
  I can't jeopardize that by lying to her about the past. 
  You're not gonna jeopardize anything because she's never gonna find out. 
  Hey. 
  Is everything okay? 
  Yeah, everything's fine. 
  Let's eat. 
  So what looks good? 
  Not sure. 
  Me either. 
  So what were you guys talking about before I came in? 
  Nothing. 
  Mom? 
  Okay, well someone needs to tell me what's going on. 
  Look, Cara. 
  Um Things were difficult after your mom left. 
  And it was a long time before you were happy again. 
  And one day, when you were in the eighth grade, she came back. 
  Yeah. 
  Wait, how do you know that? 
  Because she came to see me first. 
  And she claimed that she had stopped drinking and that she wanted to be part of your life again. 
  And you told her no? 
  How could you do that? 
  Because I had heard it before. 
  The promises to stop, the assurance that things would be different. 
  They never were. 
  You You don't remember all the times she never came home. 
  I do. 
  And I knew that if she came back into your life and left it again, it would destroy you. 
  Yeah, well, that wasn't your decision to make. 
  It was mine. 
  I'm your father. 
  It was my job to protect you. 
  Oh, protect me? 
  From what, the truth? 
  - Cara. 
  Listen. 
  - No, no, no. 
  You know, I spent my entire life thinking that my mother didn't want me. 
  You know, that she didn't love me enough to even try. 
  My whole life I thought that she was the cause of that pain but it turns out I was blaming the wrong parent. 
  Cara Uncle T. 
  Hey, hey, hey. 
  You showed up. 
  Oh, I'm so glad you could make it. 
  It's a great day, all right? 
  I need you to be straight with me. 
  Is your business really okay? 
  Come on, I told you. 
  We're good. 
  All right? 
  The bank came through with the loan. 
  No need to worry about this, all right? 
  Just drop it. 
  Enjoy this day. 
  [PHONE BUZZING] 
  Rakesh. 
  Please tell me my uncle got that loan from the bank. 
  Not quite. 
  He wired money out of the Harlem Episcopal Church's bank account. 
  Almost 600 grand. 
  Maybe your dad lent him the money? 
  No. 
  No, he stole it. 
  Hey, baby boy. 
  So your idea of saving your dream is stealing from the church? 
  How could you? 
  Man, what are you talking about? 
  Where you getting that from? 
  I know you transferred that money from Harlem Episcopal. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  I know what it looks like. 
  I know, I know what it looks like. 
  I know what it looks like, but it's just a loan. 
  A loan means someone lent you the money and we both know my father - did not sign off on that. 
  - Shh, do not do that right now. 
  Okay? 
  It's no big deal. 
  Listen to me. 
  I'm going to put the money back before anybody even knows it's missing. 
  Okay? 
  Hey, guys. 
  What's going on? 
  Tell him. 
  Or I will. 
  - Terrence? 
  - [SIGHS] 
 
 
 
  Uh, my business had a little financial hiccup and I needed to get a little something to get my guys back to work. 
  So probably should have asked you first, but I took a little loan from the church. 
  You did what? 
  It's from the Children's Center. 
  The money is just sitting there in an account. 
  We don't have to make a payment until the end of the month. 
  Okay? 
  I will have it back by then. 
  What were you thinking? 
  - Do you trust me? 
  - Trust. 
  You've already broken that trust. 
  With the board, with the congregation, - with the community - I understand that. 
  But, look, I had to protect my future. 
  Your future! 
  Arthur. 
  I will fix this. 
  No. 
  You know what, see, I've heard that before. 
  You know what? 
  You have actually left me with no choice. 
  Because I have to tell the board everything. 
  Then I'll go to jail, and No, no. 
  Dad, Dad, Dad. 
  Let's talk about this. 
  Maybe we can figure something out together. 
  Could you listen to your son, please? 
  Okay? 
  Arthur, if you do that, they might blame you. 
  I am well aware of the consequences. 
  I just wish to God that you had been. 
  Miles, I know I messed up. 
  Look, I'm gonna make this right. 
  I'm gonna get the money back. 
  How? 
  You said there was no bank - that would give you a loan. 
  - I know. 
  There are other options. 
  [SIGHING] 
  I just need a little more time. 
  Can you just talk to your father and calm him down? 
  I-I Miles. 
  You've always had faith in me. 
  Don't lose it now. 
  [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] 
  Let me guess, you're here - to plead your uncle's case. 
  - No. 
  No, I'm worried about him, but I'm not here to defend his actions. 
  I still can't believe he would do something like this. 
  Yeah, well, I wish I could say the same. 
  Wait, what do you mean? 
  A few years back, he was trying to get another project off the ground, and I discovered that he had taken a loan from the church. 
  It wasn't a lot of money. 
  He put it back before anyone else found out. 
  Of course I confronted him and he said it was just, you know, a lapse of judgment that would never happen again. 
  I believed him. 
  [CHUCKLING SADLY] 
  - So. 
  - You didn't say anything. 
  You know, you are not the only one that loves him, Miles. 
  Right, but, Dad, if you go to the board - Uncle T could go to jail. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - And you could lose everything. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  So please, please. 
  Just give him some time to put the money back. 
  He always comes through. 
  I'm sorry, Miles. 
  I am not going to repeat past mistakes, and I have to honor the faith that my congregation placed in me. 
  No matter the outcome. 
  So what are you gonna do? 
  No idea. 
  What are you gonna do? 
  No idea. 
  I never should have insisted on that stupid lunch. 
  Yeah, because now you'll never look at him the same. 
  You think your uncle will ever get that money back? 
  I don't know how. 
  He's desperate. 
  He said something about another option. 
  And what if he's gonna do something he shouldn't? 
  I mean, what could be worse than - stealing from the church? 
  - I don't know. 
  I just wish I knew what was going on in his head. 
  I mean, you could talk to your Aunt Lena. 
  - No. 
  - Trust me, spouses keep secrets they don't tell anyone else. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Yeah, you're right. 
  And she's heading upstate. 
  I need to catch her before she goes. 
  Hey, I know that you're mad at your dad, but sometimes we would do anything to protect the ones we love. 
  I'll talk to you later. 
  Oh, Miles? 
  - What are you doing here? 
  - Lena. 
  I need to talk to you. 
  Uncle T is in trouble and I need your help. 
  He took money from the church and he can't pay it back. 
  He's done it once before. 
  I know. 
  It was when he was just starting his business. 
  But he put it all back. 
  How? 
  Where did he get the money from? 
  An old business associate. 
  He's not the kind of guy you want to borrow money from. 
  But thankfully it wasn't much. 
  And he paid him back before things got dangerous. 
  This time he borrowed more than just a little. 
  I need to know who he borrowed the money from. 
  His name's Conrad Taylor. 
  He lives in the neighborhood, but I don't know where he is. 
  - I think I do. 
  - Wait. 
  Miles. 
  If he's desperate enough to take money from Conrad again he's not gonna listen to you. 
  Listen to me, Terrence. 
  If you go down this road, there may be no turning back. 
  Are you sure you want to do this? 
  What choice do I have? 
  There he is. 
  Reverend. 
  Conrad. 
  You mind if I, uh, have a word with my brother-in-law? 
  - Alone? 
  - Not at all. 
  I gotta do it, Arthur. 
  I gotta make this right. 
  Not like this. 
  Borrowing money from a man like Conrad is not the answer. 
  - You don't pay him back - I know how this goes. 
  It's the only thing I can fix. 
  Uncle T. 
  Do you remember the promise you made to me after my mom died? 
  - Miles - You said that no matter what happens you would never leave me. 
  That family was a bond that could not be broken. 
  And that no matter what we would figure it out together. 
  Now are you gonna break that promise to me? 
  To my dad? 
  To Ali? 
  To Auntie Lena? 
  We need you, Uncle T. 
  What about the money? 
  The only thing that matters is where we go from here. 
  But we can't do that until you get up out of that chair and walk through that door with us. 
  Please, Uncle T. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Thanks for meeting me. 
  Yeah, well, you're not the one who lied. 
  Cara, he was trying to protect you. 
  Yeah, well, it should have been my decision. 
  I understand. 
  But you have one to make now. 
  You can either live in the past or decide to move forward. 
  You know, he's always been the one person that I can count on. 
  That I could trust to always put me first. 
  I mean, growing up he was my hero, but now it's like it's like I don't even know who he is anymore. 
  All right, I'm gonna say something, and I really hope you don't take it the wrong way. 
  But in the spirit of total honesty - that's ridiculous. 
  - What? 
  Your father is the same man you've always known. 
  The same man who was left to raise a little girl in an impossible situation. 
  Why are you defending him? 
  Because he was strong enough to do something I couldn't. 
  I've been granted a second chance to get to know an amazing young woman who I'm lucky enough to call my daughter. 
  You said he was your hero. 
  Heroes have it easy. 
  Heroes aren't real. 
  Being a dad? 
  That's real. 
  Have you spoken to Uncle T? 
  I've been a little busy trying to figure out a way out of the mess that he made. 
  Is there a way out? 
  Honestly, I'm not sure. 
  I mean, if I can give the board assurances that the money will be back in the account before we break ground, then maybe I can persuade them not to press charges - against Terrence. 
  - Wait, what What assurances? 
  And how do you plan to replace the money? 
  You're sitting in it. 
  You're gonna sell the house? 
  No. 
  No, you can't do that. 
  There has to be another way. 
  There isn't. 
  And I won't send your uncle to prison. 
  Let's just hope the board feels the same way. 
  I've got to get down there. 
  You mind if I tag along? 
  I'd like that. 
  Um thank you for meeting with me. 
  I stand before you with a heavy heart. 
  Something has come to my attention that I think Sorry I'm late. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  What are you doing here? 
  Fixing this. 
  Reverend Finer has asked you all to meet here today to inform you that I've embezzled money from the church. 
  [CONCERNED MURMURING] 
  And my brother-in-law had no knowledge of anything I've done. 
  I take full responsibility. 
  So if you want to press charges, then I completely understand. 
  And I will be, um, cooperative. 
  But before that, I just ask that you look at this. 
  You'll see that all the funds have been returned to the account. 
  Now, this does not excuse my poor behavior, nor replace the trust that you all have instilled in me. 
  But at least it's a step toward making amends. 
  Arthur. 
  We'd like a moment to continue to discuss this further with Terrence. 
  Would you mind waiting outside? 
  No. 
  Well, the board decided they don't want to press charges. 
  And they don't want to hold you accountable for my stupid ass mistake. 
  How did you replace the money? 
  And please don't tell me that you went to Conrad. 
  - No. 
  - Then how'd you get it? 
  I sold my last little remaining stake in the complex back to the bank. 
  Guess I should have done that a long time ago. 
  Arthur, I'm sorry. 
  I just hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. 
  The board wants to talk to you. 
  "Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven. 
  " I'm proud of you, Uncle T. 
  You know, you did the right thing. 
  You gonna be okay? 
  I've just been so focused on getting my seat at the table, I forgot that I already had one with the people that count the most. 
  Yeah, but you still do, Uncle T. 
  I sure hope you're right. 
  So what's next? 
  Uh, I'm gonna go upstate. 
  See my wife. 
  I'm gonna convince her I'm still the man that she married. 
  Look, I, uh I know you've always looked up to me as a father figure but let me tell you something. 
  You got a great man in there. 
  So I think it's time you start looking to him. 
  And whoever started this God account, you should if you ever find out, you thank them for me. 
  And let them know that they chose the right man. 
  I love you, boy. 
  Come here. 
  I love you too, Uncle T. 
  So what's the plan? 
  I thought none of your contacts knew where Falken is. 
  How are we gonna find him? 
  Pop that in for me. 
  Okay. 
  That's, ah, that's the piece of the God account code I sent you. 
  Exactly. 
  We use it as bait. 
  You want to find Falken? 
  Post it on the Internet. 
  Lure him out of whatever hole he's been hiding in. 
  Make him come to us. 
  You ready for this? 
  Launch it. 
  Going somewhere? 
  I guess that's up to you. 
  You lied to me. 
  I know. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I told myself that I was trying to protect you. 
  But the truth is What? 
  I was protecting myself. 
  After your mother left, I didn't know if I could go on. 
  For all the anger I felt. 
  But more than that, I I felt so alone. 
  And terrified at the thought of raising a little girl on my own. 
  I'm sorry. 
  No, don't be sorry. 
  That look from my little girl is what got me through it. 
  Wanting to be invincible for you. 
  I don't need you to be that anymore. 
  I know. 
  I can't believe you were willing to do that for Uncle T, Dad. 
  Well, it was a price I was willing to pay. 
  Besides [CLEARS THROAT] 
  I owe him a debt. 
  Uh, what debt? 
  After your mother died I thought seriously about leaving the ministry. 
  I still believed in God, but being able to believe, uh, and stand at that pulpit on Sunday and preach and tell people that everything was okay? 
  I wasn't sure I could. 
  So I prayed. 
  And I prayed. 
  And one day while I was praying, your uncle walked in. 
  And I told him all of this, and bared my soul. 
  And you know what he said? 
  "Fake it until you make it. 
  " [BOTH LAUGHING] 
  He did not. 
  He most certainly did. 
  "Fake it until you make it. 
  " But It was sage advice. 
  He told me I had to go back up there and if I started feeling lost or angry, that I should look down and he would be right there. 
  And every Sunday from that day forward he was right there. 
  So After everything that's happened, everything that he's done, I can't imagine giving a sermon and him not being right there. 
  Smiling. 
  To Uncle T. 
  [GLASSES CLINKING] 
  BOTH: To Uncle T. 
  Life has a way of turning things upside down when you least expect it. 
  It tests our resolve. 
  Makes us question everything we take for granted. 
  But sometimes that's a good thing. 
  It's the only way to move forward. 
  To usher in a new adventure. 
  And yet, it can come at a cost. 
  But that cost is a reminder of what's truly valuable. 
  What's worth fighting for. 
  [PHONE BUZZING] 
  [UPLIFTING PIANO MUSIC] 
  - - We are all tested. 
  But it is in our response that we discover who we truly are. 
  And who is willing to stand by us In our darkest hour. 
  And sometimes it shows us what was there all along that we just couldn't see.
