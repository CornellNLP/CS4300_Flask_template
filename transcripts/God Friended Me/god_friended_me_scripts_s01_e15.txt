 Previously on "God Friended Me"  
  The diocese has decided to send us a new assistant rector. 
  His name's Reverend Andrew Carver. 
  Arthur's tenure here at Harlem Episcopal might be coming to an end, and we think you would make an excellent replacement. 
  So, who are we here to find? 
  Hi, I'm Fliss, you must be Miles. 
  Can I have everybody's attention? 
  IdentitySeal has been sold. 
  - To who? 
  - Simon Hayes. 
  I'm head of Mobile App Design. 
  You have caught the attention of Mr. 
  Simon Hayes, and he has asked to meet with you. 
  I can't believe Simon Hayes wants to meet with me today. 
  You're gonna be great. 
  But what am I supposed to say to a tech billionaire who might be behind the God Account? 
  And wait, what if he knows that I've been fishing inside of his servers, and he just wants to look me in the eye before sending me off to, like, the IdentitySeal office in Siberia? 
  Or, maybe he knows that you're working on an important project, and he wants to introduce himself. 
  Dude, I am on the phone. 
  I wish you were coming this weekend, 'cause that way you could've just come to the IdentitySeal mixer. 
  Ray, you should, uh, you should get that. 
  Dude, I am on the phone, and I don't even live here. 
  You're just gonna wanna trust us. 
  Fine, whatever. 
  Jaya, I am sorry. 
  Surprise! 
  Ja what are you doing here? 
  I couldn't risk you going to a work mixer alone. 
  I know how those get. 
  Oh. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Okay. 
  I'm suddenly feeling very single. 
  Yeah, I would leave, but this is my place. 
  - Hey, guys. 
  - Welcome back. 
  Thank you for keeping it a surprise. 
  Hey. 
  He has been insufferable the last six months. 
  I have. 
  Oh, got a Friend Suggestion. 
  I can't believe I show up and you get a Friend Suggestion. 
  Just like old times. 
  "Vivian Hall. " - Wait, Vivian Hall? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Yeah, I know her well, sort of. 
  I wrote an article about her and her fiancÃ©, Aiden. 
  Great, then we have a way in. 
  It should be easy to figure out what her problem is. 
  I know what her problem is. 
  Vivian's in a coma. 
  Vivian and Aiden were set to get married ten months ago, but on the morning of the wedding she had a brain aneurysm. 
  They never made it down the aisle, and he's been waiting on her to wake up ever since. 
  No offense, but that's, like, a really depressing article. 
  Or a beautiful, if tragic, story of love and hope. 
  Well, maybe this is about the fiancÃ©. 
  Well, Vivian's at University General. 
  I know Aiden went down there on his lunch breaks all the time. 
  - Maybe we could catch him. 
  - Yeah. 
  You guys mind taking this one yourselves? 
  No problem. 
  I'm sure you guys wanna catch up. 
  Oh-ho-ho, not here. 
  Mm-mm, they ain't "catching" up here. 
  Hey, Ali, I'm Andrew Carver. 
  We met after Sunday Service last week. 
  Of course, Reverend Carver, nice to see you again. 
  I hear you make one of the best cups of coffee in New York City. 
  You came all the way down here, to a bar, for a cup of coffee? 
  - Not buying it, huh? 
  - No. 
  Let me guess, this has something to do with my father? 
  Let's just say I'm having trouble cracking the impenetrable Arthur Finer, and I hear you're an expert on the subject. 
  Yeah, he takes a little while to warm up. 
  Plus, my enthusiasm to share some of my ideas about modernizing things did not go over well. 
  He's just being protective. 
  Harlem Episcopal is like his third child. 
  I understand. 
  I was supposed to lead the 3:00 p. m. service today, but Arthur changed his mind at the last minute. 
  Have you thought about asking him for his advice on one of your sermons? 
  I know how to write a sermon. 
  Not at his church. 
  Let him know he has a voice in what his congregation's gonna hear. 
  Not to mention he always likes an idea better when he thinks it's his. 
  So, my internship at the Mayo Clinic is almost up, and I've been offered an amazing opportunity to do my residency. 
  Residency, isn't that like like three years? 
  - Yeah, but it's gonna - Wait, Jaya. 
  Did you come all the way back here just to break up with me? 
  Rakesh, the hospital's here in New York, and I'm taking the job. 
  You're serious? 
  Oh, this is the best day of my life. 
  Oh, my God, we need to celebrate. 
  I'ma take you to the fanciest lunch in town. 
  - Rakesh. 
  - Fanciest lunch I can afford. 
  Aren't you forgetting something? 
  Your meeting with Simon Hayes, which starts pretty soon. 
  Right. 
  New plan. 
  Fanciest dinner I can afford. 
  Sounds perfect. 
  That's for luck. 
  You think Aiden is still visiting her every day? 
  I mean, it's been ten months. 
  Well, he never left Vivian's side for the few weeks I was writing the article. 
  Few weeks? 
  I've seen you crank out an article overnight. 
  Yeah, but Vivian and Aiden's love story came with a mystery. 
  Mm-hmm? 
  Like, the night before the wedding, she left the rehearsal dinner early saying she was tired and going to bed. 
  Which is where Aiden thought she was until the next morning she showed up at the hotel wearing the same clothes from the night before. 
  Where was she? 
  Well, that's the thing, no one knows. 
  She entered the lobby, had a conversation with the doorman, who said she seemed in good spirits, and then when she was walking to the elevator, she collapsed. 
  Well, maybe the God Account wants us to solve it. 
  I covered all the bases when I investigated it ten months ago. 
  Besides, it's not like we can just ask her. 
  Right? 
  Maybe we can. 
  - Hi, Aiden. 
  - Cara. 
  I can't believe it. 
  What a great surprise. 
  Viv, this is Cara Bloom. 
  She wrote the article about us. 
  - It's so nice to meet you. 
  - Oh, you too. 
  I read the story you wrote, it was lovely. 
  Thank you. 
  This is my friend, Miles. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  - Cara has told me all about you two. 
  So, when did you wake up? 
  Three weeks ago. 
  Viv's made an incredible recovery. 
  She's actually being discharged tomorrow. 
  Are you here to write a follow-up? 
  Uh yeah. 
  Yeah, I am. 
  Everyone loves a happy ending. 
  Not to mention a great mystery. 
  I am dying to know what happened that night. 
  Actually, Vivian doesn't remember a thing from that night. 
  The doctor said memory loss is common, especially the hours leading up to the coma. 
  Any chance you'll get it back? 
  - They don't know. 
  - I'm so sorry. 
  It must be frustrating not knowing what happened. 
  Honestly, I'm just happy to be alive. 
  Vivian struggled with it. 
  I don't need to know what happened. 
  I already lost six months of my life. 
  I just wanna move on, start our life together. 
  And we will, I promise. 
  Maybe there's something that we can do to help. 
  You know what? 
  I think there is. 
  Um I found this in Viv's purse three weeks after you wrote the article. 
  Wasn't sure what it was, and at the time, I didn't really care. 
  It looks like some kind of claim chip. 
  So, you don't recognize it? 
  No. 
  Which means you probably got it that night. 
  It's a start. 
  Really, I don't wanna waste your guys' time. 
  Viv, come on, I know this has been bugging you. 
  How could it not? 
  Let's just try to fill in the blanks, put that night behind you and move forward. 
  So what do you say? 
  Will you guys help us figure out what happened that night? 
  Absolutely. 
  Rakesh? 
  How you doing? 
  Simon Hayes. 
  Pleasure to meet you, man. 
  Yes, sir, a pleasure. 
  I mean, you meeting me me meeting you, not you meeting me. 
  Sorry. 
  - Little nervous. 
  - Oh, come on, don't be. 
  Ignore the suit, I'm just a coder at heart. 
  Investors like CEOs that look like CEOS, you know what I mean? 
  Been a fan of your coding for a really long time. 
  Especially the early work, it was stunning. 
  Thanks, I appreciate that. 
  I'm a fan of your skills, you know? 
  In fact, your coding reminds me of an old pal of mine, one of the best I ever knew. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  Who's that? 
  You wouldn't have heard of him. 
  His name was Henry Chase. 
  - He was an old college buddy. 
  - Hmm. 
  Is this the same Henry Chase you won the Everett Award with at Columbia with someone named Pria Amar, right? 
  Hmm. 
  That's fun you do your homework, I like that. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I like it. 
  So, uh, so so, what happened to him? 
  We lost touch, yeah, a long time ago. 
  We set out to, uh, to save the world, and the world fought back, which it so often likes to do. 
  Um, but I'm not done fighting. 
  In fact, that's why I wanted to meet you. 
  I'm working on something Something I think could be pretty revolutionary. 
  What? 
  I can't tell you I mean, not yet, anyway. 
  What I can tell you is that it's just gone through a trial phase, and we're about ready to do a beta launch and that's where you come in. 
  - Me? 
  - Yeah. 
  Your initial algorithms for the mobile application were really good. 
  And your extracurricular activities around here the past few months demonstrate you're clearly resourceful. 
  I'm sorry about that. 
  Don't be sorry, that's why you're sitting here, man. 
  Seriously, I've been looking for someone like you, Rakesh. 
  I really yeah. 
  Someone who could help me oversee this launch, kinda be my right hand. 
  What do you say? 
  And she doesn't remember anything from that night? 
  Nothing after the rehearsal dinner. 
  Yeah, that's common with cases like that. 
  If the memories do come back, it's usually in pieces and even then, people often feel disconnected - from them, emotionally. 
  - I don't know. 
  I mean, it felt like more than that with Vivian. 
  It felt like she didn't want to remember what happened. 
  But why wouldn't she want to remember? 
  It's a good question. 
  So, how are you gonna figure out where she was that night? 
  Hopefully with this. 
  - What is it? 
  - It's a claim chip. 
  Hopefully, Rakesh can do his image-matching thing and figure out where it's from. 
  I never took you for a speakeasy guy, Miles. 
  What are you talking about? 
  That's a coat-check chip from a place called Josephine's. 
  - How did you know that? 
  - I'm in the bar business. 
  Plus, my friend used to manage the place. 
  Wait, why would Vivian go to a speakeasy - the night before her wedding? 
  - Let's find out. 
  Hey, hey, hey. 
  How did your meeting with Simon Hayes go? 
  Did he confess to being behind the God Account? 
  Not in so many words. 
  What do you mean? 
  Well, he told me he's been in trials on a top secret project. 
  Do you think these top secret trials could be the God Account? 
  No idea. 
  When I tried to press, he, uh he offered me a job to oversee the project. 
  Come on, that's amazing, man. 
  - Congrats. 
  - I'm so proud of you. 
  Uh Job's in Palo Alto. 
  - Wait, you're moving? 
  - No, I mean He told me to think about it. 
  It just happened. 
  All I know is I'm freaking out. 
  Go. 
  I got this. 
  Hey, why are you freaking out? 
  This is a good thing. 
  Because the job's in Palo Alto, I'm here. 
  We are here. 
  I get it. 
  The timing really sucks. 
  But Rakesh, I can't be the reason why you say no. 
  Why not? 
  Because that wouldn't be fair to either of us. 
  Uh, this is it. 
  Can I help you guys? 
  Yeah, we're looking for Josephine's. 
  Oh, through this door here. 
  Thank you. 
  Excuse me, could you help me? 
  This from last night? 
  Actually, it's from ten months ago. 
  Do you mind taking a look, seeing if it's in the lost and found? 
  - Can't promise anything. 
  - All right. 
  You don't accidentally wander into here for a drink. 
  You have to know this place exists to be able to find it. 
  Which means it wasn't random that Vivian ended up here that night. 
  Look, if I had an entire night of my life missing, I would wanna know what happened. 
  - I would have to know. 
  - But Vivian doesn't. 
  It's your lucky day. 
  Thank you. 
  Gonna check the pockets? 
  Who's Noah? 
  It was in the pocket of the jacket you were wearing that night. 
  You left it at a bar called Josephine's. 
  Oh, I knew this was a mistake. 
  I should have never let you guys look into this. 
  You remember what happened, don't you? 
  I think that I I might have fallen in love with someone that night. 
  When I first woke up, everything from that night was a blank. 
  But then after a few days, I started to remember some things, just bits and pieces. 
  Like, images, really Feelings, like, from a dream. 
  I don't remember how we started talking, but I remember we ended up at this Thai place that he said was his favorite and then the speakeasy. 
  That's all I remember. 
  Look, Vivian, feeling like you fell in love with someone doesn't mean that you did. 
  He might have just been someone that you met and that was it. 
  Yeah, I've been trying to convince myself of that, and maybe I could, except for one thing. 
  I know why I left the rehearsal dinner early, and it wasn't because I was tired. 
  I was having cold feet. 
  Did Aiden know? 
  No, of course not. 
  But I thought that if I could just take a walk and clear my head, that the feeling would go away. 
  But instead, you met someone. 
  That's why you lied about not being able to remember anything, to protect Aiden from the truth. 
  He waited ten months for me to wake up, he deserves the life we were supposed to have. 
  But how can I marry Aiden when I know what I did? 
  Yeah, but you don't know what you did. 
  And until you do, how can you make a decision for you or for Aiden? 
  Even if I wanted to find Noah, I don't even know his last name. 
  Well, we have his favorite Thai restaurant. 
  It's a start. 
  Figuring out what really happened that night is all we're talking about. 
  Okay. 
  I'll go get my coat. 
  Oh, shoot, I have my follow-up interview with Aiden. 
  So, what are you gonna tell him? 
  Well, there's nothing to tell. 
  His fiancÃ© met someone the night before their wedding, who she thinks she may be in love with. 
  You seem determined for her to find him. 
  Well, she's our Friend Suggestion, we have to help her. 
  So, what about the guy who stood by her side for ten months? 
  Does he just lose out because she met some random guy on the street? 
  - No, it's not that simple. 
  - Okay, then explain it to me. 
  I know what she's going through. 
  Okay? 
  I went through it with Eli. 
  You think she wants to be having these feelings, these doubts? 
  You don't think she wants to feel the same way that he does about her? 
  Yeah, it sucks, but it's not her fault, Miles. 
  She needs to know what happened. 
  They both do. 
  Andrew, come on in. 
  Sorry I'm late. 
  I was talking to Lester, he sends his hello. 
  - Everything okay? 
  - Fine. 
  Just wanted to check in, see how I'm doing. 
  So, how am I doing? 
  Just finished reading your sermon. 
  Oh, great. 
  Any thoughts you have I'd be happy to try to incorporate them before sharing it with the congregation. 
  Those are a lot of thoughts. 
  Yeah, but this is part of the process. 
  Why don't you read through my notes. 
  We can discuss them in detail later. 
  Sound good? 
  Sure. 
  Look, it's a good start. 
  And once I feel once we feel that it's ready, then we can talk about when you might deliver it to the congregation. 
  I'll get to work on it right away. 
  Thanks. 
  Viv? 
  You think I'm a terrible person, don't you? 
  No, no. 
  Well, that makes one of us. 
  Look, Vivian, you're not a terrible person, okay? 
  It's just I've been that guy standing there when someone else swoops in. 
  You know, I know how that feels. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Aiden and I met my freshman year at Rutgers. 
  And then after graduation, we moved to New York, and we got engaged. 
  And like, just everything seemed to move so fast with us. 
  And then the night before the wedding it was like time finally slowed down. 
  And I panicked. 
  Well, that can happen when you're thinking about the rest of your life. 
  Can I ask you something? 
  Yeah. 
  Do you believe in soul mates? 
  You sound like Cara. 
  But no, I believe in love. 
  Soul mates, it feels too easy, like we're supposed to just sit back and wait for something to happen. 
  No, love is more than that. 
  It's a collection of shared experiences that lets you know they're the one. 
  Hey, there it is. 
  So what do we do now? 
  Well, I mean, this is New York. 
  So, if this is his favorite spot, then he definitely orders takeout, which means they will have his address on file. 
  They're not just gonna give us a customer's address. 
  All right. 
  Hello? 
  Hi, this is Noah. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Can I get an order delivered, please? 
  Yeah, yeah, the usual. 
  All right, thanks. 
  So now, we wait for the delivery person to walk out and follow them straight to Noah. 
  Hey, thanks for coming down. 
  No problem. 
  So, have you guys figured anything out about that night? 
  Uh, nothing concrete. 
  Can I ask you something? 
  Did you meet up with Vivian today? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, just to follow up on a few things. 
  Are you okay? 
  I don't know, you tell me. 
  I went by the apartment today to check on Viv. 
  She wasn't there, but I I found this on the table. 
  Did she meet someone that night? 
  That's why she was so hesitant about looking into it. 
  Hey, look, she doesn't know what happened. 
  She has some other guy's number, obviously something happened. 
  I knew that something was wrong when she left the rehearsal dinner and that, you know, maybe she was even having second thoughts. 
  - Why didn't you say anything? 
  - You don't know Viv. 
  She second guesses everything. 
  The only thing she ever answered quickly was when she said yes after I proposed. 
  When she left the rehearsal dinner early, I thought that that was just Vivian being Vivian. 
  You know, that she needed to think it all through one last time, but now that I know she was with someone else, obviously it was more than cold feet. 
  No, Aiden you need to talk to her. 
  No, I can't, not now. 
  Don't they usually have, like, a ten-block radius on deliveries? 
  Here we go. 
  Uh, excuse me, sir. 
  Pardon me. 
  Excuse me. 
  - Uh, Very Thai? 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - Is that for Noah? 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh, we live across the hall. 
  We can take it up to him. 
  Okay. 
  Oh. 
  Five. 
  All right, here it is. 
  - You okay? 
  - Not even a little bit. 
  I have no idea how I'm gonna feel when he opens that door or how he's gonna feel about me. 
  But I have to find out. 
  He's not there. 
  He moved out a few weeks ago. 
  - Miles? 
  - Fliss? 
  Are you a delivery guy now? 
  It is so good to see you, Miles. 
  How is Cara? 
  Aw, she's great. 
  I'll tell her you said hi. 
  Oh, this is Vivian. 
  - Hi, Fliss. 
  - Hi. 
  So, you said Noah moved? 
  Do you know where? 
  Oh, sorry, no. 
  Um, why? 
  It's a long story. 
  Oh, I love long stories. 
  Uh Well, I met Noah ten months ago. 
  And I only knew him for one night, but I really need to find him. 
  Say no more. 
  You think Noah is your soul mate, and Miles is gonna help you find him. 
  I know that look. 
  I had that look the last time that I was with Miles and Cara. 
  And while I have not yet found my soul mate, fingers crossed. 
  Right. 
  Well, I don't really know if Noah's my soul mate. 
  Is there anything that you could tell us about him? 
  Well, he's easy on the eyes, that's for sure, but you already know that. 
  I don't know his last name, but I do know that he was a photographer, and I think someone mentioned that he was moving out to open his own studio. 
  Yeah, he was a photographer, that's right. 
  He took my picture that night. 
  Yeah, we were in Central Park, and the sun was just coming up, and I remember when he took my photo I felt like What? 
  Truly happy. 
  Could I have decided to leave Aiden that night? 
  There's an Aiden? 
  Who's Aiden? 
  My fiancÃ©. 
  Oh. 
  Oh. 
  Listen, if Noah's opened his own shop, then maybe we can track him down. 
  Oh, it's Cara. 
  Hey, Cara, you're never gonna guess who I'm with. 
  Miles, listen to me. 
  Aiden knows about Noah. 
  Just meet me at Honeysuckle, I'll explain everything. 
  Yeah, we'll meet you there. 
  What what is it? 
  I think you need to call Aiden. 
  Finished the second draft already? 
 
 
 
  - I did. 
  - Great. 
  Just, um, leave it on the desk, and I'll look at it this afternoon. 
  More notes? 
  If need be. 
  This is my church, and I need to make sure that things are done my way. 
  With all due respect, that's not why I came here. 
  You know how much I respect you, Arthur, respect this church. 
  But I have my own voice, my own message to share. 
  And I believe if you let me, I have something to offer. 
  Something that will resonate with those open to hear it, but I need to do it my way. 
  And I need you to trust that I can learn from you without having to emulate you. 
  - Finished? 
  - Yes. 
  Good, because I agree. 
  When I first came to Harlem Episcopal, I had a difficult relationship with the head priest. 
  He would push me day in and day out to do things the way he wanted. 
  It wasn't until I spoke up for myself and showed him that I had confidence in my own voice, that he let me use it. 
  As you just have. 
  What are you saying? 
  I'm saying that it's time for this congregation to hear your sermon this Sunday, prime time, and as it was. 
  You're right, my job is not to mold you into some version of me. 
  My job is to give you the courage and confidence to be who God wants you to be. 
  Well, so this whole thing was a test? 
  Your words, not mine. 
  Thank you, Arthur. 
  And for the record, becoming a version of you would be a very high bar to clear. 
  That's like the fifth phone call she's made to Aiden. 
  What do you think she's gonna do? 
  - I don't know. 
  - Well, we need to find Noah's studio before she gets through to him. 
  Fliss, have you ever typed "photography studio in Manhattan" into Google? 
  You know, with, um, all this talk of soul mates, I was just wondering if you and Cara have, uh if you're still friends. 
  Yes, we are still friends. 
  Great, that's great. 
  You mind me asking why? 
  It's just I mean For someone who finds himself cruising around the city helping people find love, you seem to have a bit of a blind spot. 
  I don't have a blind spot. 
  Have you even thought about asking her out? 
  - As a matter of fact, almost did. 
  - Really? 
  Yeah, the night we reunited you with Beaker, we were walking home and her ex-boyfriend walked by, and let's just say the moment was ruined. 
  I imagine it would be, yeah. 
  They started dating again soon after. 
  Oh. 
  I am so sorry. 
  I didn't know she was seeing someone. 
  I'll just you know No, it's fine. 
  They broke up. 
  - She's single? 
  - Yeah. 
  And lookee here. 
  Right when I came back into your life. 
  I think that this is the universe reminding you of that night. 
  Oh, Cara. 
  - Fliss. 
  - Hi. 
  It's so good to see you. 
  You're like a full-fledged New Yorker now. 
  Thank you. 
  I yelled at a cab the other day, and it felt totally normal. 
  - You didn't get ahold of Aiden? 
  - No. 
  I tried his cell, his work, I left messages with friends. 
  Don't think he wants to hear from me, not that I blame him. 
  I'm sorry he found out like that. 
  No, it's not your fault. 
  I should have been honest with him from the start. 
  Aiden really deserves to be with someone who sees how amazing he is. 
  That's exactly what I'm gonna tell him, soon as he lets me. 
  Um I found Noah. 
  That's him, I can't believe it. 
  I don't think I can do this. 
  Hey, yes you can. 
  You will never be able to move on until you know. 
  And neither will Aiden. 
  Look, if I was in his shoes, I wouldn't wanna be second place to anyone Maybe this is about both of you finding the person you were meant to be with. 
  I would have never even thought of doing that. 
  You're the man, Rakesh. 
  Nah. 
  I mean, if you say so, but nah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. 
  - It's a team effort. 
  - That's right. 
  - Cheers. 
  - Cheers, guys. 
  Hmm? 
  - I am so proud of you. 
  - What? 
  No, Tom would have figured out how to float the ISB on his own. 
  I just gave him a little nudge. 
  No, I meant how much your team respects you. 
  I can see why Simon Hayes says as well. 
  Everything's gonna be okay, Rakesh. 
  You know that, right? 
  You need to tell Simon Hayes you're gonna take the job. 
  Mm-mm. 
  I don't think I can do that, Jaya. 
  - Rakesh, this is - Okay, wait look. 
  Please, let me just say this. 
  The last six months have been hard. 
  Like, really hard. 
  And we talk and FaceTime each other and email and pretend like that's the same thing as being together, but come on, it's not. 
  And we both know that. 
  I'm just scared that eventually I'm gonna lose you. 
  You waited six months for me, you don't think I'll do the same for you? 
  We'll be fine. 
  Jaya, you can't make that promise. 
  Yeah, I can. 
  How can you be so sure? 
  Because I love you. 
  Hey, Rakesh, there you are. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Simon Hayes. 
  - Jaya Desai, nice to meet you. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  You mind if I steal him? 
  I'll be right here waiting for you when you're done. 
  - Okay. 
  - Come on. 
  Can I help you find something? 
  Yeah, as a matter of fact, you can. 
  - I'm looking for Noah. 
  - Oh, he's not here right now. 
  Do you know when he'll be back? 
  - Ma'am, it's super important. 
  - Guys you're gonna wanna see this. 
  That's the photo he took of me at the end of the night. 
  Well, you were wondering if he remembered you. 
  I think this is his way of saying that he does. 
  I remember I remember how the story ends. 
  Oh, I can't believe it. 
  Vivian? 
  Aiden. 
  I can explain. 
  No, you don't have to. 
  I think I have my answer. 
  Aiden Aiden, wait. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I got your message. 
  You said you were at Honeysuckle Row, so I went down there, 'cause I thought we still had something to talk about, to save. 
  - Aiden - And when I got there, you were leaving, so I followed you, and, uh I'm glad I did, because I don't wanna be someone's second choice. 
  And as painful as this is, I still love you, and I want you to be happy. 
  So, you deserve to be with someone that makes you smile like that. 
  I'm glad you think that. 
  Because that someone is you. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - Seeing this picture, my memory of what happened that night finally became clear. 
  We ended up in Central Park. 
  I wanted to see the sun rise, and I knew the perfect spot: Belvedere Castle. 
  And that's when I realized I was standing in exactly the spot where you proposed. 
  It was like the universe was trying to tell me something. 
  Something I knew all along. 
  I didn't fall in love with someone else that night, I realized how much I love you. 
  - Viv - Do you know what I was thinking about when that photo was taken? 
  I was thinking about you, about us, about the life we were gonna have. 
  That's what I was coming back to tell you that morning, that I love you, that you're my Soul mate. 
  Hi, I'm Fliss. 
  Fliss. 
  I don't think that I can just pick up where we left off. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  I know, but maybe we can get back there. 
  I don't care if it takes ten months or ten years, I'm not going anywhere. 
  I think I just need some time to take a walk to try to figure this out. 
  Do you wanna come with me? 
  More than anything. 
  Thank you, both of you. 
  Well, I think those two are gonna have their happy ending after all. 
  Looks like our work here is done. 
  We deserve a drink. 
  Fliss, you coming? 
  I would love a cocktail. 
  Noah? 
  Hey, didn't you used to live across the hall from me? 
  Uh-huh. 
  What brings you here? 
  Oh, that's a very long story. 
  I love long stories. 
  So, Rakesh, you made a decision? 
  It's an amazing opportunity, Mr. 
  Hayes Simon's fine, and I've been in enough negotiations to realize when someone's about to flip a card, so what is it? 
  Okay, um, well According to you, I'm the best coder you've got, and the project would be way better with me on board. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  So here's what I propose: move the project here to New York, and you won't be disappointed. 
  Okay, just so we understand each other Instead of me moving you to Palo Alto, you want me to move my entire team to New York? 
  Yes. 
  I assume this is a deal breaker? 
  I'm afraid it is. 
  Wow, I'm impressed. 
  It takes a lot of courage to stand up to the boss. 
  You mind me asking what's so important here that you're willing to give up the opportunity of a lifetime? 
  Love. 
  Okay, well, I have to think about it. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Okay, then. 
  Hey, um It's a good answer. 
  That was fast. 
  Please tell me you didn't turn down the offer. 
  I turned down Palo Alto, not the offer. 
  What do you mean? 
  Well, I told him if he wants me on the project, then the project needs to relocate to New York. 
  What did he say? 
  He needs to think about it. 
  And that's it, you just left? 
  I had somewhere to be. 
  I realized I forgot to tell you something. 
  What? 
  I love you, too. 
  I feel like we just survived a romantic comedy. 
  I know, right? 
  Hey, who knew love stories would be so exhausting? 
  I have to admit, I was pulling for Aiden the whole time. 
  I think it is nice to see two people realize that they're right for each other all along. 
  I couldn't agree more. 
  Though, weren't you the one that said "love is one of the few things in life we cannot choose"? 
  When did I say that? 
  After we helped Beaker and Fliss. 
  Okay, I see, using my own words against me, well played. 
  Wait, didn't we end up on this same street the night we helped Fliss? 
  Yeah, yeah, you're right. 
  Wow, that's weird. 
  I was just talking to her about that night. 
  Why? 
  Um Before Eli showed up I was gonna ask you out on a date. 
  Really? 
  If I had, what would you have said? 
  You could ask me now and find out. 
  Okay. 
  - Cara Bloom - Mm-hmm. 
  Will you go to dinner with me? 
  I'd love to. 
  Stepping into the unknown is never easy. 
  There is always that inner voice telling you to hold back from making a big commitment Aiden, I'll understand if you wanna wait on the wedding. 
  You know, I've been thinking about that. 
  If we don't get married, then we're gonna have to give back all those gifts. 
  Or moving into the next chapter of your life. 
  You all right? 
  First sermon at Harlem Episcopal, I'm a little nervous. 
  So was I. 
  You'll be fine. 
  Sometimes you just need to be reminded of what you already have. 
  And trust that it is worth fighting for. 
  New York, it is. 
  Oh, thank God. 
  So I'll be relocating the team here, and um, you know, I'll be staying for awhile until things get up and running. 
  I guess the only thing left is for you to tell me what this top secret project is. 
  Let's just say that we're gonna be helping out a lot of people, okay, Rakesh? 
  Because when you do, you'll be amazed at the results. 
  Wow. 
  You look absolutely beautiful. 
  I thought we were meeting at the restaurant. 
  I thought we could walk together. 
  I can do that.
