 Horace. 
 Horace. 
 Wh-- what the hell? 
 Hey. 
 Horace, good morning. 
 Marsha, what are you doing here? 
 I want to talk to you. 
 Marsha, you can't just come into my bedroom. 
 Yes, I can. 
 This used to be my bed, you know. 
 Me and your father's. 
 I guess it was your mother's bedroom, too, huh? 
 You sleep in your panties just like your dad. 
 Marsha, this is really weird. 
 Can you please go out into the living room and I'll... 
 (Marsha laughing) 
 How old are you now? 
 49. 
 Oh. 
 How old are you? 
 Marsha, I need-- I need to get dressed, so... 
 Go ahead. 
 (Marsha laughing) 
 (door shuts) 
 Morning. 
 Hey. 
 Brought your coffee up. 
 Thank you. 
 You're up early. 
 Yeah. 
 Trying to get up earlier. 
 I started thinking that... you know, I'm getting older, not gonna live forever. 
 In fact, I'm getting, you know, deep into the second half here. 
 And I was thinking that, you know, how, like, in the first part of my life, I slept a lot. 
 I mean, when I was in the hospital, that's all I did. 
 So I was thinking that, uh, you know, life experienced is life lived. 
 And so if I get up earlier, right, from now on, and I sleep less, then I'm making, you know, the second half of my life longer than the first. 
 Yeah, that makes sense. 
 I'm kind of doing the opposite. 
 I'm trying to sleep more and wrap it up. 
 You see, except, I don't know when I'm gonna die, right? 
 So if I get hit by a truck today, then the halfway point was like 26 years ago. 
 Pete, you're not gonna get hit by a truck. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause you don't leave this building. 
 If a truck was gonna hit you, it'd have to come in the front door. 
 Well, that's true. 
 Still, there's plenty of ways for a guy to die. 
 Sure. 
 And then after that, that's it, once that happens, right? 
 I mean, I don't think there's anything after. 
 Do you? 
 Hey, man, I just-- I just woke up. 
 Hey, the beer guy is coming today. 
 f*ck. 
 Well, you gotta talk to him about prices. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 He drove Budweiser up five bucks a barrel. 
 Yeah, no, I got it, I got it. 
 Just tell him maybe-- 
 All right, you know, Pete, get the f*ck off my back, please. 
 Okay, okay, Grumpy Gus. 
 Jesus. 
 Sorry. 
 Whatever. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know, there's a bad pattern here where you treat me like sh1t and then you say you're sorry, rinse, lather, repeat. 
 I'm kind of sick of it. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 So what do you think happens after you die? 
 I don't know. 
 If you're good, you go to some place where you get to drink lemonade out of a giant pussy. 
 Hey, what-- Why do you say things like that? 
 Jeez Louise. 
 You asked me what happens after you die. 
 That's if you're good. 
 Wow. 
 Well, I dated this girl, it was back in junior year, I mean, before all the sh1t hit the fan. 
 I don't know if you met her-- Vanessa. 
 Black girl. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 She was super cool. 
 Anyway, she said that her daddy told her that when she dies, if she's been bad in her life, after she dies, she's gonna go to wherever he is, and he's gonna beat her ass forever and ever. 
 That's... 
 What-- what religion is that? 
 I think they were Baptists. 
 I wonder if that's where I'm gonna go. 
 Well, you're not gonna go to the other place with the... 
 With the... 
 ...lemonade. 
 (Horace laughing) 
 Wow, look at these poor f*cks. 
 What? 
 The refugees. 
 Oh, f*ck, that mess. 
 They'd rather drown than stay in their own country. 
 Or they get killed by pirates. 
 The whole world is going back in time, you know. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, also, now that Europe let these people in their country, it turns out they rape. 
 A bunch of raping refugees, apparently. 
 Well, it's not like they all rape. 
 I mean... 
 I mean, it's wrong that it happens, but you can't say every one of those people is raping. 
 I mean, if everybody was raping, there'd be no one to be raped. 
 I want to take some of those sentences back. 
 The weird part with these refugees is they're fleeing to Germany, you know? 
 And then they get there and they get put in a camp, like, a German camp. 
 Yeah, yeah, that's like before. 
 Yeah, what if, uh, what if Germany just starts exterminating them out of, like, habit? 
 They're like, guys, we're so sorry, like, we just thought this is how camps are done. 
 You know, don't talk about that. 
 Why? 
 You don't know-- you don't really know what happened. 
 You weren't there. I know a guy who was there. 
 He liberated one of the camps. 
 Yeah? 
 He's walking into the camp with his platoon and they see all these people starving and dying, you know? 
 And the whole platoon starts crying, only he can't cry. 
 He's not crying 'cause he's, you know, he's stunned. 
 He can't get a tear out. 
 And everybody's, you know, crying their eyes out and the camp prisoners are all just looking at these people crying and he still can't cry. 
 So he feels, like, self-conscious and guilty, you know? 
 So he starts trying to think about things, like his mother or his kids, you know? 
 Still can't cry. 
 Finally, he thinks of "Bambi." 
 "Bambi"? 
 Yeah, it came out in 1942, you know, right before he shipped off to war. 
 So he's thinking about how Bambi's mother was shot, you know? 
 Cries like a baby. 
 I did the opposite. 
 How so? 
 I was watching "Bambi" with this girl I was seeing, she was a ballerina. 
 And when Bambi's mother got shot, she started crying, the ballerina. 
 And I wanted to cry with her, you know, to show her I had feelings, but-- but I didn't care. 
 Wait, so what, you used the Holocaust so that you could cry about Bambi? 
 It's sad. 
 Isn't it sad? 
 Which one, "Bambi" or the Holocaust? 
 It's sad that it's so hard to show your feelings when you really want to. 
 Hey, Pete. 
 Marsha, how you doing? 
 Can we get a couple of whiskeys? 
 Yeah, whiskey's good. 
 Couple of whiskeys, please. 
 You got it. 
 Pete, this is Dennis. 
 Dennis. 
 Pete, how you doing? 
 He owns the tire store over on Atlantic. 
 That right? 
 Yeah, unless he's lying to me. 
 I got four tire stores in Brooklyn. 
 I got six tire stores across Long Island. 
 Yeah? 
 You must be tired. 
 Is that your place on Atlantic and 17th? 
 Oh, that place us bogus, bullshit. 
 They do retreads, and they'll rape you with their prices. 
 I'm over by Flatbush and Atlantic, by the Jewish bakers? 
 The Kosher guy? 
 Are your tires Kosher? 
 What? This f*cking guy. 
 Dennis, Leon. 
 Nice to meet you, Leon. 
 Oh. 
 He don't shake. 
 Anyway, that's me over by the Jewish bakers. 
 Come over and see me if you need tires. 
 I don't need tires. I don't have a car. 
 Last car I had was a Plymouth. 
 f*cking Plymouth? 
 Nah, forget it, this is on the house. 
 Marsha : Thanks, Pete. 
 Mind if I tell you again? 
 You look beautiful. 
 I don't mind, I like it. 
 Well, you are. 
 I never seen a woman look like you. 
 I have. There's a bunch of me. 
 Nah, you're exceptional. 
 Thank you, Dennis. 
 You want another one of these? 
 Yeah, yeah, okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Can we get a couple more, Pete, over there? 
 Hi, Pete. 
 f*cking asshole. 
 Horace. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Hi. 
 You worried I'm gonna see your nipples? 
 No, it's fine. 
 Horace, what is wrong with you? 
 I'll go put a shirt on and-- 
 Yeah, good idea. 
 Okay. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Hi. How are you? 
 I'm all right. 
 I have breast cancer. 
 What? 
 It's all right, you know, Mom had it and beat it and now it's my turn, you know. 
 It's f*cking stupid. It's my fault. 
 How is it your fault? 
 I should have had 'em out when Mom had it. 
 I like my tits so I held on, it's just f*cking arrogant. 
 Anyway, you know, I'll beat it. 
 Your kids know yet? 
 I'm not telling them. 
 You're not telling your kids... 
 I'm not. 
 ...that you have cancer? You're not gonna tell 'em? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 Because they're little narcissists and they're gonna make it about them, then I'm gonna have to manage their feelings about it instead of my own when I'm the one who needs support, so... 
 Where are you gonna go for support? 
 You, dummy. Here I am. 
 Oh, hey, come here. 
 No, no-- I'm okay, I'm okay, I just-- 
 I'm-- You know. 
 Okay, I mean... 
 What can I... what can I-- 
 Tell me what I can do. 
 You're doing it. 
 You're listening, okay? 
 Okay. 
 (sighs) Look, Horace, you have a real capacity for listening to people and I depend on it. 
 I always have. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Yeah, it's true. 
 And I guess this is a good time to tell you that it really means a lot to me that you have always been there and you've been an ear for me. 
 Sylvia... 
 Hello? 
 Do you remember when Mom first moved out of here and, um, the three of us were living in that-- the tiny apartment on 72nd Street? 
 Yeah, not much, but I do. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 Yeah, and she was working those crazy hours and we would just be home alone, we didn't have a TV, and, uh, you know, we would just talk, you know. 
 Yeah. 
 You were the first person I opened up to and talked to, like, in my life. 
 And, uh, those were tough times and I built a dependence on you. 
 I... I had no idea. 
 Yeah. 
 And, uh, you've always been there, Horace, you know, just to listen and to-- 
 Just be a witness and be a pair of ears. 
 Wow, I don't know... 
 I don't know what to say, you know... 
 And that's why it is so hard to be in conflict with you. 
 It's really painful. 
 It's like being in conflict with a part of myself. 
 Are-- are we in conflict? 
 Of course we are. 
 About what? 
 About the bar, about this place. 
 Oh, f*ck, Sylvia. 
 Who gives a sh1t about that? 
 We gotta get rid of this place, Horace. 
 Sylvia, I know-- I don't-- 
 I'm not upset that you want to get rid of this bar. 
 I don't care-- I mean, I get it. 
 I can't go along with you, but I do-- 
 That's got nothing to do with... with you and me. 
 When do you... when do you start treatment? 
 You know, the only reason you go along with this sh1t is 'cause you can't stand up to your uncle. 
 And you're worried that he's gonna end up on the street. 
 But Ma got out, she got us out. 
 And it kills me to see that you're back here, back in it. 
 Why are we talking about this right now? 
 Do you know what this building is worth? 
 Even just to knock it down, the air rights. 
 Wha-- Air-- What the f*ck is that? 
 Air rights, what is that? 
 Horace, Horace, listen. 
 Brooklyn is growing, right? 
 More and more people are coming here and there's no room to build. 
 So people are buying and knocking down and building up. 
 The air above this building is worth millions. 
 You want to sell the air. 
 Yes. 
 Sylvia... do I have to say it? 
 This is Horace & Pete's. 
 And I'm Horace... 
 No, f*ck! 
 It's been here for 100 years, you don't just-- 
 It doesn't make any money! 
 Well, who cares? 
 Does everything-- does every business have to make a profit? 
 Does that have to be the point of everything? 
 Can't any place just be a place? 
 People come here and it's just a place... 
 This place-- this place is a cancer on our family. 
 Wow, you really throw that word around, don't you? 
 No, hey, Horace, you know... 
 You know, you come in here, Sylvia, and you tell me that you have cancer. 
 You stood there and you told me that you have cancer. 
 You just told me that. 
 Yes. 
 And that you want my support. 
 And now you're talking about air rights and that you-- that you want money. 
 And, uh, I guess I feel a little bit used. 
 Well, yes, Horace. 
 I came here to say to you that I have cancer. 
 And that I need your support and that I need money because I have cancer. 
 So, yes, I want to use you. You are my brother. 
 Please let me use you so that I don't die. 
 Because cancer, Horace, is f*cking expensive. 
 It's expensive. 
 Oh... 
 Oh, hey, Sylvie. 
 Hi, Pete. 
 (Sylvia sighs) 
 How long was I asleep for? 
 About an hour. 
 sh1t. 
 Yeah, you're eating into that second half there, buddy. 
 (Pete yawns) 
 Hey, I gotta... 
 Okay, I'll see you later. 
 See ya. 
 Bye, Sylvie. 
 See you, Pete. 
 Hey, Sylvie. 
 I was just thinking... 
 You know, f*ck your mother, Pete. 
 f*ck your mother. 
 Whoa, oh, oh, in other words, f*ck your grandmother? 
 That's right. 
 f*ck my grandmother. 
 Is this all right? 
 Um, yeah. 
 I don't usually go to bars. 
 Oh? Well, I do. 
 So... 
 Yeah, whatever, I do. 
 Is this okay, really? 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Oh, I'll get us a drink. What do you want? 
 Uh, just water. 
 You're gonna drink water? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, come on, that's not fair. 
 I don't really drink a lot of alcohol. 
 Okay. 
 Hi. 
 Yeah, what can I get you? 
 I'll have a Jameson's, and, uh, and a water. 
 There you go, hon, it's on me. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Here you go. 
 No, no, no, it's all right. 
 It's on me. 
 Oh, well, thanks. 
 Here's your water. 
 Thanks. 
 So do you live in Brooklyn? 
 Yeah, in Bushwick. 
 Me, too. 
 I mean, live in Brooklyn. I just moved here. 
 Listen, Charles-- 
 Is that what you like, Charles? 
 Yeah, people call me Charles. 
 Well, Charles, you're making me drink alone, but you're also making me do all the small talk. 
 It's kinda rude. 
 Sorry. 
 It's all right, I forgive you. 
 (chuckles) 
 So... why'd you swipe me? 
 Did you think I was cute? 
 You like the stuff I wrote about myself? 
 Come on, you... 
 I was the first one that came up and you don't really give a sh1t so you just swiped and now you just want to go pound it out and get back to your video games. 
 You're bumming me out, Charles. 
 You're just, like... you're ruining my life. 
 Like, could you... 
 I wish you could just say one nice thing. 
 Well, I believe in honesty. 
 I don't believe in saying fake things because that's just fake, so... 
 Yeah, I just say what I mean. 
 Really? Well, you might want to check that attitude because that's kind of just mean. 
 I'm not mean. 
 Do you have any idea at all how to talk to a girl? 
 What? 
 You're a woman. 
 You're an adult. 
 We're equals, so it should just be normal and honest. 
 Oh... oh, okay. 
 Ugh, so you're just gonna have your water and then you want to just go f*ck? 
 That's it? 
 You probably have a roommate, huh? 
 I have two roommates. 
 So that means I have to take you up to my place. 
 Well, if this is how it's gonna be, Charles... 
 I'm sorry, you're gonna have to watch me drink for a while. 
 And you're gonna have to talk to me. 
 I mean, you don't have to be nice to me if you're so f*cking allergic to that, but you have to talk to me. 
 Okay. What about? 
 Well... 
 Who are you? Where are you from? What are you doing in Brooklyn? 
 What are you trying to do with your life? 
 I'm from Western Massachusetts. 
 I plan on being a stand-up comedian. 
 f*ck. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Where you going? 
 I gotta-- I'm having lunch with Alice. 
 Oh, nice. 
 You guys doing okay? 
 Yeah, just trying to sort of just do one day then one day then one day, you know? 
 Lunch one day, coffee one day, and just... just let it feel normal, you know, just build like normal. 
 That's... good. 
 Don't forget to bring her some elephant food. 
 What's that? 
 I'm just saying, don't forget to bring your fat daughter some elephant food. 
 We hooked into a marlin, it must've been 30 pounds. 
 Marlin? It's a fish. 
 Oh, you bet. 
 It's a big f*cking fish. 
 Pardon my French. 
 Big f*cking fish, that's f*cking fine with me. 
 Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy there. 
 What's the matter? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 You're fine. 
 Sure. 
 Do you know that you got a smile... like... 
 I've never seen one like it. 
 Yeah? 
 You need to get out of the tire store more often, Dennis. 
 Okay, do you remember after my junior year at Hunter when I went to the Middle East? 
 Yes, that was terrifying. 
 No, it wasn't. 
 For me, it was. 
 Oh, well. 
 Well, you don't know. 
 You don't, I hope you-- I hope you never know how that feels, having your own kid at some wild place. 
 Yeah, but how do you think that, like, imagine how parents feel who live in a place like that all the time? 
 I don't care, I don't have to. 
 I don't-- That was the worst time in my life. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 You don't-- You weren't calling us. 
 There was people on YouTube cutting off people's heads and you're not getting in touch. 
 Oh, God. 
 We didn't know-- It's not f*cking funny. 
 It really wasn't. 
 You know, one night, I decided you were dead. 
 Jesus, Dad. 
 I'm serious. 
 You weren't calling me and I'm, like, praying it's 'cause you hate me. 
 I'm like, "She hates me, she's not calling." 
 So I call your mom, you're not calling her either. 
 And then we start-- we get in a fight, me and your mom, sorry. 
 And then I'm laying awake at night and I'm-- 
 You know when you hear about a parent who, like, their kid dies somewhere else and they just know it right away, so that's what happened. 
 I'm laying awake in bed and I get this cold chill over me and I just knew you were dead. 
 Except I wasn't. 
 Yeah, I was wrong. 
 I'm not a good dad, see? 
 Well, I had a good time there, so... 
 Good. 
 Hey, uh, if I tell you something, can you keep it to yourself? 
 Yeah, from who? 
 Particularly your cousin Brenda, who I know you're close to. 
 Okay, sure. 
 So your Aunt Sylvia, um... she has breast cancer. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 You do? 
 Yeah, I mean, Brenda told me. 
 And she's going to the doctor with her and she made her check herself. 
 She's-- she's taking care of her, so why would I have to keep it from her? 
 You know, she's gonna be fine, Dad. 
 I know that cancer scares the sh1t out of people your age, but she is actually gonna be fine. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 That used to be the "C" word. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I gotta go to work, so... 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 But-- Thank you for lunch. 
 This was nice. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 You know, I think that this is the most time we've ever spent together since-- 
 Yeah, at least the last couple weeks. 
 Yeah, this has been-- Yeah. 
 Well, I'm glad that it's been positive, for you, I mean, you know? 
 Yeah, yeah, well-- 
 I'm glad. 
 It is, it's positive for me to spend time with my dad, you know, so... 
 Good. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, oh, um, how's Rachel? 
 Um... 
 What? 
 Rachel moved out. 
 Oh. 
 I'm-- I'm sorry. 
 Yeah, no, I asked her... 
 Wait, you did? 
 I asked her to move out. 
 Wait, so you kicked her out? 
 Well... 
 Dad, why? 
 Why? She was nice to you. 
 She was actually good for you. 
 Well, I... 
 Oh, my God. 
 I guess I thought that you-- If you wanted-- 
 Dad. 
 I just wanted-- 
 Dad, what the f*ck? 
 What? 
 Because you kicked out your good girlfriend and now you're putting that on me. 
 No, I didn't say that. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I thought-- Look, I thought-- 
 Oh, my God, what is wrong with you? 
 I thought of it as an upgrade, okay? I did. 
 I thought that you would have a place. 
 What's so wrong with that? I wanted to make it-- you comfortable. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Look, I liked Rachel. 
 Yeah, and she loved you and she was nice to you. 
 She was-- she was, like, taking care of you. 
 Okay, well, I guess I thought I'd rather than have her be there for me, I thought I'd rather be there for you. 
 Yeah, but now none of us are there for any of us. 
 Jesus f*cking Christ. 
 Why is this so hard? Why is it so complicated to you? 
 This is-- To me, this is not complicated. 
 I am trying-- I want to be close to you. 
 I am your father. I want you in my life. 
 Why is that not a simple thing to you? 
 Okay, but how do you think that feels, to have someone going like this, you know, when I don't want that? 
 Like, I-- I feel awful. 
 I'm not going like this, I'm not going like this. 
 Yes, you are. 
 I'm going like this. 
 No. 
 I'm trying to be here. I can't be here. 
 I'm just trying to get here. 
 God. 
 Why do you, uh... 
 Why do you spend any time with me? 
 I don't know. 
 It'd be helpful to know why you-- 
 I don't know. 
 I don't think you like being with me. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I think you have-- 
 Please. 
 You know... 
 My brother is so miserable and I don't want to be like him, you know? 
 And I'm trying... 
 I'm trying to spend time with you, and I tried, already, not speaking to you for three years and it didn't work, so I'm trying this. 
 Didn't work how? What's-- what are you trying to accomplish? 
 I'm... 
 I'm trying to be able to think about you without puking. 
 (Horace exhales sharply) 
 And this is me trying. 
 That's why you-- that's why you're spending time with me now. 
 That's why. 
 I'm... just sick of being alone. 
 And... 
 I'm alone all the time. 
 All the f*cking time and I always hated it. 
 I always hated being alone. 
 And I know that I'm the one who chose to study law, but it's just me and the f*cking books and the f*cking law students who are more boring than the books. 
 It's the same as being alone. 
 And I f*cking hate it. 
 It's just-- it's miserable. 
 And even with David, I was alone. 
 So... it sucks. 
 And it just... like, it hurts, you know? 
 I think I'm gonna leave right now. 
 Just so that we can leave this on a good note. 
 That was a good note? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that was good. 
 You did good. 
 I'll see you. 
 
 
 
 ♪♪ 
 (man humming) 
 ♪ Horace &... ♪♪ 
 From the time he was a baby, he was like in a parade, marching behind his dick. 
 (laughter) 
 So this one time, he was-- he was playing, uh, Little League, you know, when he was about six. 
 And I was the coach of his team, you know, and Horace was out there in right field, so right away you know how good he was, right? 
 'Cause how many kids can hit away to right? 
 So every day, he's out there picking his nose and staring off, you know? 
 And this one day, he comes running over to the dugout and he says, "Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, I gotta make a pee-pee!" 
 (laughter) 
 I said, "Get the f*ck back on the field! What are you doing?" 
 He says, "Time-out, Uncle Pete, I gotta make a pee-pee!" 
 I said, "I don't care if you gotta make a doo-doo, Horace, you little prick. Get back out there on the field!" 
 So he starts crying, like... (mimicking Horace crying) 
 So I, you know, I called time-out. 
 I go to the ump, time-out, you know, and then I go over to Horace and I say, "Okay, I called time-out, now you can go take a leak." 
 I mean, what am I gonna do? 
 He's my nephew, you know, and he's crying and everything. 
 I say, "Okay, honey, you gotta go to the toilet? 
 You go ahead." 
 (laughter continues) 
 He's still crying, so I said, "What the f*ck is the matter with you? You said you wanted to make a pee-pee, now go make a pee-pee." 
 And he says, "Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!" 
 And he's covered with piss all over his pants. 
 Leon, I'm telling you, he was covered and it was all smelly. 
 You remember that? 
 Horace, remember that, when you pissed your pants in Little League? 
 (laughter continues) 
 That was a killer. Leon, I'm telling you. 
 Hey, what about little Pete? Did he play? 
 Yeah, yeah, Pete played. 
 He was the best you ever saw. 
 He got varsity baseball in high school, freshman in high school. 
 He had a girlfriend, straight A's. 
 He's a good kid, too. 
 Hi, there. May I have a Budweiser, please? 
 4.50. 
 Oh. 
 "Oh"? 
 I thought I heard you charge that guy $3 for a Budweiser. 
 Don't worry about what I charge him. 
 Well, I just don't get why I have to pay more. 
 You don't have to pay more, you can also get the f*ck out. 
 Um, you can't just charge different people different prices, that's not-- 
 Hey, hey, kid. 
 You gonna pay for this beer or you gonna wear it? 
 Um... 
 Listen, you mumbling little f*ck, you say "um" one more time-- What? 
 What, what did I do? 
 Pete. 
 Just let me get it. 
 I got it. 
 Hey, sorry. 
 It's all right. 
 You all right? What's up? 
 Yeah, uh, I was charged 4.50... 
 Yeah. 
 ...for a Budweiser and that guy was charged $3. 
 Just not sure why the discrepancy. 
 He's been coming here a long time. 
 Oh, so is that a privilege for just that one guy or is-- 
 Like, more people that get to pay-- 
 Some people pay 4.50, some people pay three. 
 Okay. 
 Um, how do you decide that? 
 Is there, like, a list, or... 
 If he looks like him, he pays $3. 
 If he looks like you, he pays 4.50. 
 So just out-and-out discrimination? 
 Um, are you aware how totally unfair and not okay that is? 
 I'm not sure what group... 
 I mean, I'm Jewish. I'm gay. 
 Here's the thing-- you're getting more for your money than he is. 
 How so? 
 Because, well, see, you come here and you make fun of the place 'cause it's an old Brooklyn dive bar, so you and your friends get to enjoy that part of it and then also you get to have a beer. 
 But he just gets the beer. 
 See, you're here ironically, but he's really here 'cause he just lives on the corner. 
 So it's like a douche tax? 
 Yeah, kinda. 
 Acceptable. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm gonna go upstairs for a minute. 
 Hello, Horace. 
 Hello, Marsha. 
 Ugh. 
 I'm so tired. 
 Oh... 
 Do you mind if I take off my sweater? 
 Because it's warm in here. 
 My arms-- I have such nice arms. 
 Arms. 
 It's a funny word, isn't it? 
 Arms. 
 Hey. 
 Do you want to hear something funny? 
 (giggling) 
 I always wear a bikini under my clothes. 
 Do you think that's funny? 
 I just think it's easier, you know? 
 What if I want to just take all my clothes off and be in a bikini? 
 I can do that this way. 
 I bet you never thought of me as someone who would do that. 
 Jesus, what is wrong with you, huh? 
 What? 
 I mean... ha! 
 This is your fantasy? 
 How is this a s*x fantasy, huh? 
 I mean, we're talking. What, is that gonna get you there? 
 No. 
 Well, then, come on, let's get to the f*cking or whatever, huh? 
 I don't know. 
 Why? Why are you hesitating? 
 Because this is weird. 
 This is-- this is f*cked up. 
 It's a s*x fantasy. 
 Yeah, but why can't I have normal ones? 
 Why can't I have normal s*x fantasy-- 
 Why am I, like-- like just jerking off to the tits on the Internet. 
 Why can't I be one of those people? 
 Why-- why am I sitting here having this sick fantasy about my dead dad's... 
 Cum Dumpster. 
 Yeah. 
 And why am I thinking about you saying that? 
 That's... that's wrong. 
 Because it's sexy. 
 I mean, it's weird, but... 
 I mean, you're weird. 
 I mean, if you can't have, you know, whatever s*x fantasy you want to have, then, I mean, really, what is the point in anything? 
 I guess this is the thing, right? 
 I wish I was one of those people that's, like, has clean s*x. 
 Nice, clean boners, do you know what I mean? 
 About good things, about love. 
 People that get boners for people they love and they have s*x. 
 And the whole time they're having s*x, they just smile at each other. 
 (Marsha laughing) 
 What, like Obama? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 So do you want me to be Michelle Obama right now? 
 No, no. 
 Oh. 
 No. 
 No. 
 I just-- I bet when Obama has s*x with Obama, I bet they-- it's really nice. 
 I bet it's really nice and clean. 
 And full of love. 
 And then when they're done, he goes and he's president and she goes and, you know... 
 Why do me and Clinton have to be such pigs? 
 Well, I mean, all hard-ons are gross, right? 
 Do you get-- do you have, like, gross fantasies? 
 What? 
 Why don't you go down and ask her? 
 Oh, yeah, you're me. 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, where did you get this idea that, you know... that there are nice, clean hard-ons? 
 Huh? 
 I mean... s*x is dirty, you know? 
 It's dirty. 
 It's really, really dirty. 
 And wrong and gross... and messy... and, um, smelly... and bad and... 
 I just came. 
 Really? 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 All right. 
 Do you want to play some cards or something? 
 Yeah. 
 What do you say? Let's get out of here. 
 What for? 
 Let's go somewhere. 
 I mean, these drinks are good and everything, but let's hit the town. 
 Hit the town? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 Take you to a nice dinner. 
 Let's-- let's paint it red. 
 Why don't we just paint it red right here? 
 Oh, no, listen. 
 I'm a well-heeled guy. You're a doll. 
 Let me show you how a guy can treat a gal. 
 Yeah, I'm sure you know how. 
 I do, you'd have a ball, let's go. 
 I know a great little joint out by the ocean. 
 We can walk in the waves afterward. (chuckles) 
 I'm fine right here. 
 You don't like me? 
 No, I like you fine, I like you fine, stay, you know... 
 Stay here and drink with me. 
 Yeah, I don't want to do that, Marsha. 
 It's not my thing. 
 Well, then, go home. 
 I can't do that, my wife is there. 
 (Marsha laughing) 
 Ah, Jesus. 
 Uh, excuse me? 
 Uh, excuse me? 
 Yeah, doll, what can I get you? 
 Can I get a white wine? 
 We don't have that. 
 Beer, hard drinks. No wine, no mixed drinks. 
 Oh, that's fine. I'll just have a beer, then. 
 All right. 
 Oh, uh, what kind? 
 All's we got is Budweiser. 
 Oh, that makes it easier, then. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, are you Uncle Pete? 
 Yeah, who's asking? 
 I thought that was you. 
 I never met you before, but I'm a friend of your nephew, Pete. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah, is he around? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Hold-- hold on. 
 Hey, Pete. 
 Look at this broad who's coming here asking for you. 
 She looks nice. 
 Huh? 
 Horace, look at-- look at this chick who came in asking for Pete. 
 Oh, is that Trisha? 
 Who's Trisha? 
 Yeah, I knew her at the hospital. 
 Well, how come you knew her? 
 'Cause I used to visit him at the hospital when you didn't. 
 We were in the same, uh... 
 I knew her at the hospital. 
 What, is she a wacko, too? 
 Shut up, man. 
 No, what? 
 I mean, she don't look like a wacko, but maybe she was in for something else, like drugs or syphilis or something. 
 Anyway, she's cute, she looks good. 
 Go say hi, go ahead. 
 Nah. 
 Pete, go say hi to her. 
 I don't want to. 
 Hey, Pete! Hi, Horace! 
 Hi, Trisha. 
 Hi, Trisha. 
 I'm gonna go upstairs and take a nap. 
 No, come on, what are you doing? 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 Go say hi to her. 
 Yeah, come on, get in there. 
 I don't want to. 
 I mean, we were friends at the hospital. 
 I'm not in the hospital anymore. 
 I don't care where you met her, you don't get in there and get her clothes off her, or you're a fag. 
 Oh, shut up. 
 Pete. 
 (Trisha shouting, banging on table) 
 Holy f*ck. 
 She's got Tourette's. 
 What's that? 
 It's a disorder. 
 Well, that's why he don't like her. 
 No, it's not. 
 It's got nothing to do with it. And I like her fine. 
 So go talk to her. 
 Pete, I remember Trisha, she was really cool. 
 Just go say hi to her, she's cute. 
 Come on. 
 Hey, Trisha. 
 Hi, Pete. 
 How you been? 
 I'm really well, thanks. 
 Uh, how are you? 
 I'm all right. 
 Good. 
 You look good. 
 Thanks. 
 You, uh... It's nice to see you. 
 You know, I think about you sometimes. 
 I called you but you never called me back and I-- 
 I remember you telling me about this place and I loved hearing you talk about it. 
 Anyway, I just moved close to here and I thought, what the hell? 
 I'll just go by and see him. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Pete, um... you know, when we were in the hospital, you were such an important-- 
 Okay, well, uh, I'll see you around. 
 f*ck was that? Make an effort. 
 What? 
 Come on, she's a wacko, but she's very nice. 
 And anyway, she obviously likes you. 
 And you know, anyway, you're-- 
 I mean... 
 What? 
 I'm what? No, what? 
 What, you think just because she's got a disorder and I've got my thing that I have to be with her? 
 What the f*ck is that? I gotta stick with my own kind? 
 "Just stay away from the normal girls, Pete. 
 Just stay with your own f*cked up kind, Pete." 
 No, I'm not saying any of that. 
 I am. 
 Makes sense. 
 I mean, you two wack jobs should go together. 
 Just don't have any babies. 
 What I'm saying is that she's cute and she's nice and she likes you and you're 52, so how many more times is that gonna happen for you? 
 Look, I knew her at the hospital, we're not there anymore, that's that. 
 Trisha : f*ck your mother! 
 Oh, hey, whoa. 
 Watch your tongue there, Trisha. 
 Nigger cock! Nigger cock! 
 I think I'm in love. 
 Hey, Trisha, those are some pipes you've got on you. 
 Sorry. 
 No, no, that's all right. 
 It's all right. Forget about it, it's a free country. 
 Look, I'm gonna give you another beer. Free beer on the house. 
 Hey, could I ask you a question? 
 Oh, sure. 
 Hi, how you doing? 
 Hi. 
 So, like, you have Tourette's, right? 
 Yep. 
 So, like, how do you... live? 
 I mean, like, you look like you're doing okay, but can you, like, suppress it when you have to? 
 No, in fact, if I have to suppress it, I can't even more. 
 It's like the worst outcome of the tics, the more they want to come out. 
 That's why I'm... I'm really sorry I yelled that. 
 It's like this itch you have to scratch and I can only get to it by saying the worst thing that I could ever say sometimes, depending on where I am, so you-- you being here made that come out. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's all right. 
 I know by the way you said it, you didn't have any hatred behind it. 
 Also, it helped that you said "cock" at the end. 
 I wasn't offended, either. 
 But, like, how do you live with it? 
 Like, can you hold down a job? 
 I-- I haven't kept a lot of them. 
 I get fired a lot and have to pound a lot of pavement to get a job in the first place 'cause I have to tell them when I interview. 
 But, um, you know, it's trial and error. 
 But I found a nice place. 
 It works out, so far. 
 I work really hard and they gave me a private space, so it's not so bad and I have to be a really nice person when I'm not yelling things to make up for it. 
 I like you both ways. 
 f*cking little faggot! 
 Hey. 
 I'm not a faggot. 
 Hey, if you don't mind my saying so, I think it's pretty brave of you, the way you handle that. 
 Like, that cannot be easy. 
 Thank you. 
 She doesn't have to live with it. 
 You could take that Divolactin stuff and then your symptoms would go away. 
 Yeah, but then I'd be asleep half the day and I couldn't work. 
 I mean, not like I do now. 
 I mean... it's not easy. 
 People stare at me. 
 They-- they just think I'm awful. 
 People lecture me, insult me. 
 And people who know what's wrong with me just look away. 
 I would. 
 But I'd rather rough it and deal with all that and have a life rather than just take Divolactin and shut down. 
 So far, it's worth it. 
 Yeah, well, I can't do that, Trisha. 
 I go off my meds, I lose my f*cking mind. 
 I can't do anything without Probitol, so I don't have the luxury of that choice. 
 I know that, Pete. I know that. 
 You knew Pete in the hospital? 
 Yeah, he... he really helped me. 
 It's really scary in there. 
 It's a scary place. 
 But Pete wouldn't let anybody bother me and he was a friend when I needed one. 
 He still hasn't let me thank him. 
 He used to tell me stories about Horace & Pete's and he would really crack me up. 
 He told me really funny stories about you, Uncle Pete. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I feel like I know you. 
 Well, you're all right, Trisha. 
 You're welcome here anytime. 
 If anybody looks at you sideways, I'll punch 'em in the f*cking mouth. 
 Thanks. You don't have to do that. 
 It's just looking. 
 Who cares if people look at me? 
 If I cared, I wouldn't live much. 
 Hey, Pete. 
 Can I-- 
 Dirty applesauce tit fucker! 
 Jesus. Can I get a whiskey?
