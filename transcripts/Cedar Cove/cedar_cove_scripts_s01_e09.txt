 What're you doing? 
 I am being strong bold, and confident. 
 Bob :  Will Jeffers, you are sold! 
 Does your ex often call you like that? 
 We're just friends. Nothing more. 
 I'm at your house... Just wondering where you are. 
 [♪] 
 Stan : After all these years, the lake was exactly the way I remembered it. 
 I'm glad you went. 
 Well, thank you for coming with me. 
 Made a big difference, having you there. 
 Time helps you choose the memories you want to hold on to. 
 Well, it's like this house. 
 I mean, everywhere I look, there's something that takes me back. 
 Right over there, Justine took her very first steps. 
 I remember that day. 
 She was standing by the couch, and I got up to answer the phone, and when I turned around, she was walking across the room. 
 I remember that day like it was yesterday. 
 That was the last day she ever crawled. 
 She was always in such a hurry to grow up. 
 And Jordan was perfectly content to take it slow. 
 By the time he took his first step, Justine was running circles around him.

Originally Aired September 14, 2013 
 Oh! [Laughing] 
 You put a hole in my boat. 
 Oh, no! [Laughs] 
 Alright, try it again. 
 Why don't you do it and I'll just watch? 
 Oh, you're gonna get this. 
 Okay... 
 Thumb on the reel... 
 Release the spool... 
 And elbows... in? 
 Don't overthink it. Just cast it. 
 That was too much arm. 
 It's too much something. 
 Hey, at least it landed in the water this time. 
 And what do I do now? 
 Now we wait. 
 Fishing's about patience. 
 Sometimes, it takes hours before you get a bite. 
 I got one! 
 Or a few seconds. Okay! Okay. 
 If he's running, don't reel. 
 What does that mean? 
 Okay, you're pulling too hard, you're gonna break the line. It's gonna... 
 Oh! [Laughing] 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine! 
 Okay, maybe that's enough for today. 
 Are you kidding? That was amazing. 
 I almost got him. Let's go again. 
 Alright. 
 Delilah :  Kelly writes to me tonight on my Facebook page telling me of a relationship that's now over, what she regrets. 
 Kelly, you can learn from your mistakes, and when your heart is ready to love again, love fully and with no hesitations. 
 You're listening to Delilah. Whoa! What's your hurry, mister? I'm catching a ferry. Oh! I'm off to Seattle. For how long? At least a couple weeks. I'm consulting on a new energy startup. Oh, that sounds exciting. I'm happy to hear you're gonna be around for a while, so I can take you out for that dinner I owe you. No. You saved me from looking like a complete loser at that bachelor auction. I will take you to dinner. Fine. When and where? Captain's Galley. Tonight. 8:00? I was kidding. Seriously! You do not need to take me out for dinner. I know how busy you are. Oh, I want to. Plus, I need you to catch me up on all the town's gossip. See you later tonight. Okay. Well... Hey! I called you. You didn't return. Yeah, I've been a little busy. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry, and explain to you that... I know that you were with Stan last night. Okay? I was worried about you. I drove by the house and I saw you together. It wasn't like that. Stan came by to bring me a birthday present... My son's model boat. He had saved it all these years. So, we decided to go down to Starkwater Lake. Stan hadn't been back... You don't have to explain. Yes, I do. It was a very emotional experience for both of us. As parents. There is nothing between me and Stan. There hasn't been for years. You and Stan, you have history. That's something that you and I haven't established yet, and I can't even begin to compete with that, Olivia, and I really don't even want to try. All Stan and I have are memories. He's remarried, and I am so lucky to have found you. [Chuckles softly] So what do you say? Are we still going steady? Well, I don't know. Let's get together after school and we can talk about it at the malt shop. [Olivia laughs] [♪] Seth : Alright, you're looking good. Nice and slow. Alright, you're coming in a little fast. Reverse. That's good. Good. Now easy to port. That's the right side? No, left. Why don't you just say that? It's okay, you're doing fine. You're doin' fine. Good. Now... Take it out of gear. How was that? It was perfect. Didn't even bang into the dock this time. Much. I gotta say, I am loving this boat. The boat's loving you. [♪] Hey! Hey, hey. Cliff! Hey! I didn't... I didn't see you there. How are you? Olivia told me what she had planned at the bachelor auction. I am so sorry. I went and ruined everything by bidding on her brother. Her married brother, by the way. If I had known what you two were up to, I would... No. No worries. No, and then I went looking for you, because I wanted to explain the whole thing, but... Grace. It's not a problem so whatcha doing? Well, it's a... A little business idea I got going. Is this yours here? Yeah. "Join a professional guide for a horseback trail ride along the beach shore." Oh, that sounds wonderful. You know what you should do is, uh, talk to Jack, maybe take an ad out in "The Chronicle." You know what? Maybe I will. Yeah. I would love to go on one of these rides. Well, you know what? You're in luck. I know the owner. And I think Miss Annabelle's been missing you. Really? And just how would you know that? She gets a little forlorn. Oh! Well, give her my best and tell her I am really looking forward to that ride on the beach. Really? Yeah. How's Wednesday? I-I'll bring the sandwiches. Okay. I'll see you then. Yeah. [Laughs quietly and sighs] You want to build a boat? Yes. Why not? How many reasons do you need? You don't go from a birdhouse to a picture frame to a boat. That's like skipping a hundred steps. How about bookshelves? How hard can it be, Bob? I can figure this out, I know it. Look, I live in a cove. I could use a boat. Then buy one. Try ebay. Why would I do that? I am perfectly capable of building this. Remember our last outing? Clearly, I'm made to be on the water, Bob. If you were stranded on a desert island and the only way back to civilization was by building this? I would tell you, get comfortable on the island. Oh, ye of little faith. I want to do this, Bob, okay? I mean it, I want to build this boat. [Sighs] Far be it for me to stand in the way of impulsive, naive bravado. [Laughs] Thank you. Oh, excuse me a sec. I'll be right back. Excuse me, John Bowman? Hi. You're the new chef here, right? I love what you've done with the menu here. Thanks. And-and I notice that your photographs are in the gallery all the time. I'm next door at "The Chronicle." My name's Jack Griffith. You're a reporter? Yeah. Well... I'm sort of the editor, photographer, journalist. I'm like a one-man Swiss army knife. [Jack laughs alone] Listen, uh... I would love to do an article about you and your many talents. What do you say? Are you up for an interview? No. I don't think so. No? See you around. Nice talking... Okay. Ahem! Boat? Wow! Look at you. You must be really looking forward to this date. It is not a date. I'm going out for dinner with an old friend. But, be honest, what... what do you think about this dress? Does it look like I'm trying too hard? No, I... Oh, yes, it does! And now I do have to go and change it. You're right. Why are you so nervous? I'm not nervous! Clearly. Well... I do have a date. What? You mean to tell me you finally have a date with John? Well, I had to buy him just to get the date, but, yes, we have a date. I'm a little nervous. Oh, sweetheart, don't be, just be yourself, and he will love you. That means a lot, coming from my mother. It is not just me. Everyone loves you. I hear it every day. "Oh! I love that Maryellen, she's just like her wonderful mother." Thanks. I think. Where are you going? Galley? I suggested Remy's in Seattle. That's very nice. He suggested another place. [♪♪] [Sizzling, bubbling] I love your place. Thanks. Sorry it's such a mess. No, it's great. It's just I haven't had much time to unpack, what, with the gallery and work and everything. I understand. It takes a while to make a new place feel like home. Are you originally from Tacoma? No. Where are you from? I mean, where were you born? New York. New York? Ohh... Wow. I love New York. I always wanted to live there. I like it better here. So, what brought you so far west? Change of pace. Well, there are certainly plenty of photo opportunities out here. It's true. Everywhere you look. Mountains, water... Islands. It's like an endless canvas. Sorry. I didn't mean to... No, it's fine. It's just a mess, like I said. So come, take a seat. Dinner's almost ready. [♪♪] [♪] So I come home, and they've knocked down the wrong wall. [Laughs] What? I mean, really? Did they actually think that we wanted a 500-square-foot bathroom? I could never build a house. Way too many decisions to make. I can barely pick the right color for my guest towels. But how satisfying! Look at you. You have your dream home. Sure. I was fine with the way the house was in the first place. I guess when you don't have kids to put through school, you find stupid ways to spend your money. Do you regret that? Not having kids? Yeah. I don't know. Georgia never wanted to have kids, so... I never pushed it. Thank you. That was great. I guess your kids are all grown-up now? Oh, yes, they are. It doesn't matter how old they get, they're still my babies. I guess you heard about me and Dan, huh? I did. A lot of years together. Mm-hmm. What happened? I get asked that all the time, but there's really no simple answer. We were kids when we got married. Too naive to recognize how different we were and naive enough to think it wouldn't matter, but those differences caught up with us. This one night, I brought home travel brochures. I wanted to talk about going on a nice little romantic getaway. I mean, I wanted to try something, anything, to get that spark back. You know what he said? "You're blocking the TV." [Deflating] Oh... Next day, he calls me from work and said he wasn't coming home. He wanted a divorce. I'm so sorry, Grace. The guy's a fool. Thank you. But, hey, I got two beautiful daughters out of this deal, so I have no regrets. Don't worry. You're gonna find someone else. You're a beautiful woman. I mean, a catch and a half. Yes, yes, I tell myself that every morning in the mirror, but believing it is a whole other thing. You know, I might've had a... ahem... A little crush on you in high school. Oh, get out. Seriously. Well, that's funny, because I had a crush on you, too. I know. What? Olivia told me. Oh! [Laughing] So then why didn't you do something about it? Oh, you were with Dan, the... So? Star of the basketball team. He towered over me! I was just a little geek in the science club. What was I gonna do? [♪] Anyway. That was a long time ago. Yes. Another lifetime. [Clink] I could get used to this. Pretty sweet, huh? That thing you were saying about freedom, about only having two ropes keeping you from wherever you want to go? I think I'm starting to get it. Well, good, 'cause I got an idea. Why don't you stay? Like, for good. You mean move in? Yeah. Give it a try. See how it feels. Look, I just thought things have been going so well. Things have been great. And you are saying you love the boat. I do, I just... I don't know if I could live here. I mean, it's so small, and the constant motion... It might get to me. Well, no pressure. Just think about it, okay? Okay. This is almost ready. Yeah, first thing I ever built Peggy was a table. She loved it. Bob. I'm building a boat... And that's all there is to it. [Bob chuckles] Listen, uh... You knew Olivia back when she was married to Stan, right? I did. Were they a happy couple? Yeah. Until... you know. Then it all fell apart. Biggest mistake Stan ever made was leaving her. Then again, it was another time. [♪] Dad wants to take me to Starkwater Lake. He wrote me this long email. Are you going to go? I think it's a bit late for that particular father-daughter moment. I needed him to take me back there years ago. Now I can go myself. It's taken him a lot longer to get to where we are. At least he's trying to be a good father. He wants to be a good father now that I'm grown-up. There're just so many changes in my life right now. What do you mean? Seth asked me to move in with him. I know! It's crazy. Can you imagine me living on a boat? Wow. That's a really big step in a relationship. You don't think I should do it? I didn't say that. You don't have to, it's written all over your face. Here's what I think. When you make a decision like that, you just want to be sure it's the right one for both of you. How was your date? [Gasps and sighs] I didn't even hear you come in. You're like a ninja. "Ninja-librarian! She fights late fees by day, crime at night." Wah! You are so weird. So? Don't keep me waiting. How was it? It was okay. He made me this amazing dinner. Ooh! And...? It felt like he was finally opening up to me a little. Well, that's a good sign. Yeah, it was... Okay. What happened? [Sighs] Well, he had all these boxes lying around. I-I... accidentally opened one... You were snooping? No, I wasn't. But I couldn't help but notice it was full of all these unopened letters. Unopened? They were addressed to some guy named "Kirkland." Okay, letters in a box, that's odd. What do you think it means, Nancy Drew? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just feel like there's something he's not telling me. It takes time for some people to open up. Just go slow with this guy and don't get too involved until you know who he really is. I just want to jump into one of his pictures and find out everything about him. And you say I'm weird? Seriously, Maryellen, just trust your instincts, but go slow. [Text alert chimes] [Grace chuckles] Might be faster if you just wrote a letter and mailed it. I am getting good at this. "Hashtag L-O-L." 
 
 [♪] Hey, I spotted coho a couple of miles off the point. Wanna go out and catch dinner again? Not right now. I've been thinking... about us moving in together. You're starting to come around, aren't you? Maybe. That's great! Whoa! Before you get too excited... I have another idea. How about you move in with me? I know you love living on the boat... Okay. Okay? Yeah. Let's do it. Okay! Let's do it! [♪♪] This is gonna be great. Mm-hmm. Jack : Okay. Here it is. Really? You're going to build that? Well, don't sound so surprised! I'm not. It just seems a bit ambitious. Why a canoe? So I can take you out onto the water, that's why. You know, find a secluded cove, build you a romantic fire on the beach. That's why. We can do all that without you building a boat. Oh, come on, where's the fun in that? Actually, I do know a few secluded beaches I could take you to. Oh, good. I'll build faster. I like how decisive and strong-willed you are. Was that code for "impulsive and stubborn"? You've had a couple of woodworking lessons and you've decided to build a boat. That is not stubborn. That is determined, and dare I say, courageous. My misunderstanding. Yeah. Mm. I have to go to court. Mm. Come on, they can start without you. It doesn't work that way! Doesn't? No. [Reluctant sigh] Fine. Fine. Meet me for dinner later? Sounds wonderful. Oh, you should really consider wearing that robe. It's very sexy. I'll have to think about that. [♪] All those years, I avoided coming back here. I thought I'd completely fall apart. I had to come back. I didn't want to forget him. His face. The sound of his voice. He loved this place. I'm glad your mom brought me out here. She was so great. So strong. She is. But there were some dark days. Years. She seems like she's in a... in a really good place right now. And Jack seems like a nice guy. Is that why you wanted to see me? To ask me about Jack? No, of course not, sweetheart. I'm back here for you, and that's the truth. I want to be a part of your life again. And what about mom? I just want both of you to be happy. We are, but it took us a long time to get here, and it wasn't easy. And I should've been here. I know that now. I'm sorry. I just hope you'll give me another chance. You've always been my dad. [♪] [Phone chimes] "It beats... another... frozen... [Knocking at door] meal." Don't worry. I'll get it. [Knocking] Did you know he was coming? [Microwave beeping] John. Hi. What're you doing here? I'm headed out to the Quinault Rain Forest tomorrow. That's great. I can't wait to see what you come back with. I was wondering if you want to come with me. [Quiet gasp] Oh! Really? Y-you want to take me on one of your shoots? It's my favorite place. I thought maybe you'd like it, too. Wow. Uh... This is, um... I don't know what to say. How about "Yes"? How about "Yes"? Yes. That sounds great. That's all you brought? I figure if I can't fit my whole life in one bag, it's getting too complicated. [Both chuckling] Wow. You know, every time I'm in this place, I can't get over how massive it is, the size of it. It's tiny. Compared to my boat, it's a mansion. This is gonna be great. My favorite spot. [Flops onto bed] Hey... you're on my side of the bed. All this space, and you want to fight over sides? You're crazy, you know that? Yes, I do. [♪ ♪] [Seth sighing fitfully] [♪♪] [Knocking] Will! What are you doing here? I was in your neck of the woods and thought I would drop in. Is everything okay? Do you have a minute? I just wanted to... Yes! Of course. Please, come on in. Oh, man... this is harder than I thought. I'm usually the one that's never at a loss for words. Oh, that's okay. [Will sighs] [Clears his throat] My marriage is over. I moved out a few weeks ago. Oh, Will. And no one knows. Just, uh, me and Georgia. Truth is, it's been on rocky ground for a few years now, and... Boy. That sounds familiar. Well, yeah. That's... that's why I thought you might understand. Well, I'm sorry. Please, keep this to yourself. I'm not ready to tell Olivia yet, and it would break my mother's heart. Of course, you have my word. I've always been the one with the rock-solid marriage, the perfect son married to the perfect wife. But these last few years... [Phone rings] Oh. Just hang on a sec. Excuse me. Hello? Hey! I got a bit of a problem here. Miss Annabelle's developed thrush on her right hind frog. On her frog? That's part of the hoof. Anyway, I'm thinking about saddling up nero for you. He's got a bit more spirit,  but you can handle him. You okay with that? Uh... actually, um... Something's come up. Are you okay if we reschedule? Oh. Yeah, sure. Well, how about the weekend? You know, Saturday or Sunday? Yeah. No problem. I'm sorry. Ah, don't worry about it. And you know what? Maybe Miss Annabelle's "frog" will be better by then. Absolutely. Alright. I'll call you tonight, okay? Sure. [Click] [♪♪] Maryellen gasps : Oh... wow. Pretty breathtaking, huh? It's like this peace just washes over you. [Maryellen sighs happily] Yeah, I love out in here. Just being alone... away from everybody. But you're not alone. You brought me. You're different, Maryellen. What do you mean by that? Well, in case you haven't noticed by this point, I'm a loner. Pretty tough to let people into my life. I have trust issues, I guess. But when I'm with you... I haven't felt this way about anyone for a really long time. What way? [♪] "Join a professional guide for a horseback trail ride along the beach shore." It's kind of wordy. Well, I need people to know what I'm offering. How about "Horseback rides on the beach"? Much better. Okay. Just give me your contact info here, and I will get this in next week's edition. I think it's a great idea you have. Yeah, well, hopefully, the tourists do as well. I heard Olivia and Grace had a great time that day, going for a ride with you. Well, Olivia's a natural. Has Grace been back since? One time, but it was just to check up on Lenny Wilson. Oh, I thought that, uh, you and Grace were... Yeah, I did, too, but, um, I think she might be interested in someone else. Really? I, uh, I didn't know that. Yeah, some guy from way back when. Did she tell you this? She didn't have to. When two people have that kind of history, it's tough to compete with. My experience? When it feels like there's still something there, well, usually, there is. Well, I'll get this in the paper right away. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. You bet. [Door opens and closes] [Knocking] Come in. Hello again. Hi! I've seen you more in the last few weeks than I've seen you in the last five years. Are those for me? Yes, they are. I wanted to say thank you. I've been feeling happier and healthier than I have in years, and a big part of that is because of you, because of your support. I'm just glad you're finally open to getting help. And I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me. You've been really great to me, Olivia. You've taken time away from... Well, you have a whole new life now, and you're happy, and I'm happy for you. Thank you. Anyway, I'm gonna stay at the Thyme And Tide tonight, and then head home in the morning, so... Well, I hope you'll come back often. I know it's been so nice for Justine. She is so happy to have her dad back in her life. Yeah, and I will always be there for her. I promise. Well, I, uh, I should go. You take care. You too. [♪ ♪] [♪] Grace! I stopped by the library, you weren't there yet. No. I was doing a bit of work from home. Want to get together tonight? You know what? I would love to, but I can't. Previous plans. What's up? Everything okay? Stan dropped by to see me again. Well, he's been doing that a lot. Brought me flowers. He wanted to say thank you for being there for him. Stan is your past, Jack is your future. [Sighs] I know. You know, for so many years, my life was just about getting through the day. Now, with Jack, I have something to look forward to. [♪♪] [♪] Seth? Oh... hey. You look exhausted. You didn't sleep at all last night. I couldn't get comfortable. Was it my bed? No. No, the bed's fine. It's, um... You're gonna think this is really stupid... I haven't slept on land in a long time. You kind of get used to the motion of the water. Give it time. I'll get used to it. Thank you. [Key turns in lock] I had a great time. Yeah. Me too. So what happens now? What happens now is I'll call you. If that's alright? I'd like that. Oh! Hey, John Bowman. Thought any more about that interview? Answer's still no. Okay, fine. I was just thinking you might want some... Snaps : Look, I said no! Okay. Take it easy. Just leave me alone. [Engine fires up] [♪] Thanks. Will? I'm so sorry I am late. I was just closing up when this person came in, wanting this specific book... Thank you. Of course, did not know the author or the title, just that it was about a murder somewhere a rooming house, somewhere in Europe... Sounds interesting. Yeah, well, I guess they thought so. Would you like a drink? Yes, please. Let me get the waiter. [Dialing] [Line ringing] Host :  Good evening. Fire Water Grill, Tacoma. Hi. Could I please speak to the manager? One moment, please. Doug speaking. How can I help you? Hi. I was actually calling about a chef who used to work there. John Bowman? What about him? I was just wondering, why was he let go? He lied on his application. What did he lie about? You should ask him. [Line clicks, dial tone buzzes] [♪] [Jack laughs] Wow. What is with you? If you could do anything tonight, what would it be? Ooh... Jack! You asked the question! I heard on the news that the Phillies were in Seattle tonight. They said it was a pretty big deal. Yeah. They're in separate leagues, so they only play each other one game maybe every four years. That's just what they said. Ah. Are you saying that we can skip dinner out and watch the game on TV? Better than that! I got two tickets! [Giggling] These are box seats. That's good, right? These are the best seats in the house, Olivia. How did you get these? Oh, I know a guy who knows a guy. [Laughs] Oh! You are incredible! Wow! Now I just have to figure out who I'm gonna take. Uh... [Laughs] I can't believe you did this. You are amazing. Mm! We need to get going. Mm! We're going to the game! Thanks for saving me from another boring dinner alone. Well, I could say the same thing. I was about to reheat my leftovers again. Listen to me. Whatever happens, no matter how tough things get, everything always works out in the end. You're a great friend. Yes, I am. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... What just happened? I don't know, but I have to... I have to go. Have to go. [Exhales tensely] [Will's car starts] [♪ ♪] This... was a very special night. Because the Phillies won? [Chuckles] Because I was with you... and the Phillies won, yes. [Both chuckling] How did this happen? What? How did I get to be so lucky? How did I find you? We found each other. I'm not used to things working out. I haven't been this happy in a long time. Me too. And I think I'm falling in love with you. You are? Yeah.
