 Previously, on Cedar Cove... 
 Guess who's moving back? 
 Who? 
 Colin McFadden. 
 From now on, I'm giving you authority to sign checks and invoices. 
 Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? 
 Justine : I love Seth. 
 I can handle it... the job, Jeri, all of it. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 If you and Cliff aren't busy tomorrow night, why don't we have dinner? 
 Can't. Cliff has a date with "the killjoy." 
 What? 
 A 1,500-pound bull, from his P.B.R.A. days... 
 Pacific bull riding association. 
 Wow! 
 So he's gonna do his best to try and stay on the back of an obese angry bull, and I'm gonna try to avoid steaming piles of cow poop. 
 Wanna come? 
 Uh... no! 
 [Laughs] 
 And I thought Cliff retired from the rodeo circuit? 
 He did, but this is some kind of, I don't know, "champions" thing. 
 Isn't bull-riding kind of dangerous? 
 Yeah. And stupid. 
 But he's a guy. 
 The only time they're ever having fun is when their life is at risk. 
 Hello, miss Allison. 
 I'll see you in a bit. 
 Then there's girls. 
 A new emotion every hour. 
 Ah, those teenage years. 
 Doesn't she have school? 
 Ah, it's a teacher workday. 
 Zach's out of town, Rosie's working, so she's gonna hang with me today. 
 Grace... 
 I'm worried about Jack. 
 Why? What's wrong? 
 Well, it's his new job in Seattle. 
 Is he not liking it? 
 He loves it. 
 He's working round the clock... writing, researching. 
 I've never seen him this... happy? 
 Intense. 
 This worries you? 
 Yeah, it does. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Slams phone down] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 You got that? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. 
 I can't believe you're leaving. 
 You just got here. 
 I don't want to miss any classes. 
 I don't think it's about the classes. 
 Eric, please. 
 I'm sorry about Rebecca. 
 [Troubled sigh] 
 Look. 
 Adele... 
 Complicates us. 
 What are you saying? 
 We'll always be Adele's parents. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Good day. 
 Hey! Debbie! What are you doing back here? 
 Oh, Moon, you know I couldn't stay away from Cedar Cove that long. 
 Well, welcome home. 
 I'll talk to you in a bit. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 So? 
 It's official. 
 Yeah? 
 Dr. Carmen just confirmed that I'm pregnant. 
 Wow! 
 I used another word. 
 Not a good word. 
 Well, we should celebrate. 
 I need a drink. 
 Well, you can't, and we're at Moon's. 
 Chocolate cake? 
 Hey... the whole cake. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Oh! I had the worst night, but I'm having the best day. 
 How so? 
 I couldn't write, I couldn't sleep. 
 I was just staring at my computer screen until 2:00, but then... 
 I couldn't stop writing. 
 I could think of so many more interesting things for you to do at 2:00 in the morning. 
 [Chuckles] I'll bet you could. 
 [Sighs wearily] Oh... 
 Jack, is this job too much for you? 
 Writing all night, working all day? 
 This is what loving to write looks like. 
 Olivia, I feel so alive again. 
 As opposed to...? 
 I-I like working for a big paper, I like the big stories, I like having a big audience. 
 Okay. 
 Hey... 
 I like those things, but I love you. 
 So lunch? 
 [Sighs] 
 I have to go to Seattle again. 
 Again? 
 Yeah. I pitched this new section for the Sunday edition to my editor and he wants to sit down with me right away. 
 Okay. Dinner? 
 Sure, yes, if I'm back. 
 I will be back. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Look, Peggy, I want to help you, but if you don't tell me the whole story, I don't know what else I can do. 
 There's nothing anyone can do. 
 Peggy... 
 What did Colin do to you? 
 [Frustrated grunt] 
 Forget I called you. 
 Forget the whole thing. Okay? 
 [Bob, chuckling]: Oh... 
 Hey! 
 Hey. Someone's in a good mood. 
 Well, I blame it all on the love of a good woman. 
 And... the return of an old friend. 
 Look who's back, huh? 
 Hey there. 
 Colin. 
 How long are you in town for? 
 Don't know. 
 Well, if I have my way, he'll make this visit permanent. 
 I keep telling him Cedar Cove misses him. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 Hey. Excuse me a minute. 
 Convince him to stay, huh? 
 Make your best argument. 
 As the great William Shakespeare once wrote, "what is past is prologue." 
 Okay... 
 Past behavior predicts future behavior. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What are you trying to say? 
 Oh, I think you know. 
 And you know that I know. 
 So we both know. 
 Let's take that coffee to go, huh? 
 That's a good choice. 
 There something I don't know here? 
 Well, to be honest, it's about a woman. 
 Really? Who? 
 I never kiss and tell. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hi, Allison. Where's your mom? 
 Oh, um, she just dropped me off. 
 Is that okay? 
 Sure. 
 [Phone chimes] 
 So? Do you want to come and help? 
 Uh, no, thanks. 
 You always used to love to help me in the kitchen. 
 [Phone chimes, Allison grumbles] 
 Oh. Want to be with your friends, huh? 
 Tersely : No. 
 Uh, I want to be here, I just don't want to help in the kitchen. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Ahh, you see, I know what "fine" means. 
 "Fine" means fine. 
 How's that boy, the one that likes you? 
 What's his name again? Is it Liam? 
 He doesn't like me anymore. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 I just found out they're making my position permanent. 
 Well, we need to celebrate. 
 Although, you did lose me the office pool. 
 I had next week. 
 Oh, well, sorry to disappoint. 
 Jack... you never disappoint. 
 Alright, let's see. 
 Uh, we'll just have two of whatever you've got on tap. 
 Uh, Jack, you just ordered a beer. 
 Two, actually. 
 Turns out you were right. 
 I can handle drinking in moderation. 
 Good for you. 
 Really. 
 No lecture? 
 Me? Not my style. 
 So... 
 I am going to have my own column in the Sunday edition. 
 So tell me, why did I help you get this job again? 
 [Both laughing] 
 Oh, seriously... 
 Congratulations, Jack. 
 It's nice to see you out among the living again. 
 To you. 
 Cheers. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey! What's up? 
 I got your message. 
 Uh... thanks. 
 I was looking for that. 
 But I don't think returning that constitutes an "emergency." 
 Shelly broke up with me. 
 Okay. 
 Because of us. 
 There is no "us." 
 There never was an us. 
 Then why was this in my bed? 
 Because I was in your bed. 
 Did you leave that for Shelly to find? 
 Oh... 
 I get it. 
 It's my fault she dumped you? 
 Yes! 
 She dumped you because she realized what you refuse to acknowledge. 
 Which is? 
 That you and Shelly have nothing more in common than Adele. 
 It's true and you know it, which is why you're so angry. 
 If you feel guilty about that, or if you feel guilty about us, then stop blaming everyone else, because you're the one to blame. 
 I think I'm sorry I ever met you. 
 That's the only truthful thing you've said since you walked through the door. 
 Goodbye, Eric. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 You all packed up and ready for the killjoy? 
 Yep. Mm. 
 Well, as soon as Rosie picks up Allison, I'll hit the road, and I'll be there in time for dinner. 
 Okay. Maybe we could go out with Alex? 
 Oh? Alex is coming? 
 Yeah, she's competing. 
 Ah. 
 And she's meeting up with her boyfriend. 
 Her boyfriend? 
 I knew you'd like that part. 
 [Laughs] 
 I'll see you soon. 
 Okay. 
 [Door shuts] 
 Can I help you? 
 I'm looking for Warren. 
 Uh, well, he's not here. 
 Thank you, captain obvious. 
 You're Dick. 
 "Mr. Turnbull." 
 Mr. Saget's partner. 
 Geez. 
 Well, Warren's not here, but I'll see what I can do. 
 Yeah. You do that. 
 And while you're trying to prove your usefulness... double-double. 
 Excuse me? 
 Coffee. Double sugar. Double cream. 
 Yeah. I'm one of Warren's associates. 
 [Chuckles dryly] 
 Not if you don't get me my coffee. 
 Not if you don't get me my coffee quickly. 
 Warren doesn't like people in his office when he's not here. 
 You're funny. 
 And you're not moving. 
 Coffee. Now. Chop-chop. 
 [Door thuds] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey. 
 Hi! 
 Thought you didn't like doing that? 
 Wanna see what I've got so far? 
 "I hate this." 
 What? 
 You know that I like you. 
 Yeah. 
 And last night... 
 Don't smile. 
 This is harder when you smile. 
 Despite what my lips did, all I have to offer is friendship. 
 This about Seth? 
 Yes, and no. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means that you're in the middle of some pretty intensive therapy, and I don't think it's right of me to be messing with your head, and I think that's what I'm doing. 
 You're not. 
 I am, and it's wrong. 
 I don't want all of your hard work to be for nothing, just because I'm confused. 
 Confused? 
 I have Seth on one side and you on the other. 
 And in the summer where I'm supposed to be finding myself, I'm more lost than ever. 
 So I just got dumped by someone who I wasn't even dating because you think that I'm... 
 Mentally unbalanced? 
 This isn't about you or Seth... it's about me. 
 I can't believe you're hiding behind the P.T.S.D. as an excuse to stay away from me. 
 I'm just trying to do what's right. 
 Not only for you, but for me. 
 No, Justine. 
 You're trying to do what's easy. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Will you just be reasonable? 
 This is me being reasonable. 
 I told you! You did not have to come. 
 Dick, I've got everything under control here. 
 Then why are all your other partners getting pinched by the F.B.I? 
 I have no idea! 
 It has nothing to do with me. 
 So you keep saying. 
 Just consider this a... 
 Fact-finding trip. 
 And what facts are you looking for? 
 I've got a friend in the bureau. 
 Tells me there's someone on the inside giving up names. 
 I run a tight ship here. 
 Yeah. 
 Who's the kid? 
 Ho! Come on. [Chuckles] 
 Come on. Eric is not working with the F.B.I. 
 His father is a reporter. 
 So what? He's a washed-up reporter. 
 Still, I've got my eyes on you and him, and if it turns out that you're the source of the leak, well... [chuckles] 
 You're in construction. 
 You know what we do with leaks, right? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Rodeo announcements crackling] 
 How's she doing? 
 Aw, her leg's still bothering her. 
 Grace here yet? 
 Ah, tonight. 
 I'm glad she's not missing your date with destiny and "the killjoy." 
 It's silly, isn't it? 
 No! 
 It's not the bull, really, as much as being able to share what I love with her. 
 Well, when she sees you do your thing, I guarantee the "hunky cowboy" factor is gonna double. 
 Hunky, huh? 
 Well, I think when your boyfriend sees you racing around those barrels tomorrow, your "hunky" factor's gonna double, too. 
 Yeah. I don't think it's gonna happen. 
 She needs to rest her leg. 
 I think I'm going to have to pull out. 
 Aw. I'm sorry to hear that. That's too bad, Alex. 
 Ah, it's okay. 
 I'll be the cheering section. 
 But for who? 
 Ah. My boyfriend, thank you very much. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 I really enjoy having you back in my life. 
 I didn't think we could really make this work, but we are. 
 Well, we were friends before everything else. 
 [Chuckles] So... 
 I've been thinking. 
 About? 
 Getting a place here in Seattle. 
 Wow. 
 Hmm. 
 Wait. Did you and Olivia break up? 
 No! No. 
 Does she want to move to Seattle? 
 It's not about her or us, it's more about me. 
 Huh. 
 Yeah, I mean, it'd be nice if I didn't have to run back and forth all the time with the ferries, you know? 
 Yeah. I get that. 
 Are you gonna tell her? 
 You know, for a man who never wanted to get married again, you seem pretty married. 
 [Laughs] What? 
 It's true. 
 Which is why I think you definitely need to get your own place. 
 Personally, I wouldn't tell the little lady, if I were you. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 You hungry? Brought your favorite. 
 What are you up to? 
 Can't a friend just bring you lunch? 
 Only if the friend tells me what his angle is. 
 I need a favor. 
 Clearly. 
 They lost the night court judge in Cooperton. 
 The governor's office called and asked if I knew anyone, and I was thinking you might want to help me out. 
 It's just one day a week, on Thursdays. 
 Depends. 
 On? 
 Whether it's temporary or permanent. 
 Why? 
 Oh... 
 I'm thinking about scaling back. 
 Spending more time with Jack, less time in the court. 
 You can't be serious. 
 I am. 
 It looks like he wants to spend more time in Seattle, with his job. 
 And so? 
 Well, three-day weekends is not gonna cut it with night court. 
 You wouldn't have done this a year ago. 
 I wasn't in love a year ago. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Phone chimes multiple times] 
 Allison. It is a beautiful day. 
 Come on, come help me outside. 
 Are you just gonna mess around on that phone all day? 
 I have to go. 
 But I thought you... 
 My mom's home, she... she called, so it's okay. 
 Alright, well, just wait a minute. Here. 
 Take these tomatoes to your mom, please? 
 Honey, I know that something's wrong... 
 [door shuts] 
 [Phone chimes] 
 _ 
 [Groans sadly] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, Allison. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We're heading home. We missed the first ferry. 
 Where's Eric? 
 He's at work, he dropped us off, but I... 
 I thought it was best if we just had a clean break. 
 Aw, Shelly. 
 Do you want to talk about it? 
 Honestly, there really isn't that much to talk about. 
 Alright, I'll tell you what. 
 Why don't I buy you some ice cream here from the pier, and you can catch the next ferry? 
 Best ice cream in all of Cedar Cove. 
 Thanks, but we had lunch while we were waiting. 
 I need to get back. 
 He loves you. You know that. 
 He has a really strange way of showing it. 
 I know it's not the same, but... 
 He mentioned that maybe you had found someone, too? 
 I lied. 
 What do you mean? 
 I told him that I met someone because I knew... [Sighs] 
 That was the only way that he'd finally let go of me. 
 He's bound to me by commitment, not love. 
 But... he can see Adele whenever he likes. 
 And me? 
 As long as you're not drinking. 
 My dad. 
 The smell is so familiar. 
 The breath mints and the beer? 
 Shelly, I was... 
 Stop! Don't say anything. 
 I don't want you to lie to me. 
 I won't tell Eric. 
 But you need to get yourself together. 
 You're a grandfather now, and... 
 Adele needs you, and so do I, and so does Eric. 
 [She sniffles] 
 
 
 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hi, Peggy. 
 [Peggy gasps] 
 [He chuckles] I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to startle you. 
 I know these are your favorites. 
 Some things never change. 
 You and your gardening, Bob and his woodworking... 
 This place, come a long way in 20 years. 
 And Peggy, you are still a beautiful woman. 
 Bob is one lucky man. 
 [Exhales] 
 I want you to know, that what happened between us, stays between us. 
 It was a long time ago. 
 I don't want Bob to know. 
 I'll never say anything. 
 We were different people. 
 And I don't blame you. 
 It was as much my fault as it was yours. 
 [Throws flowers down] 
 [Voice shaking]: What do you want? 
 Everything okay here? 
 I just came by to... to get some of your green tomatoes, Peggy, I... 
 I need 'em for the cafe. 
 Peggy and I were just talking about old times. 
 Weren't we? 
 Peggy? 
 Are you okay? 
 It's okay, Moon. 
 Well, I'll leave you to it. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Door opens] 
 Hi! 
 Oh, hi. 
 Look what I got you. 
 I couldn't resist. I got me one, too. 
 Oh! 
 How was Seattle? 
 Oh, it was great. 
 I-I think the editor loved my pitch. 
 Oh, careful. Um... 
 I think I, uh, I actually caught a cold. 
 Since this morning? 
 Yeah. I know. 
 Um, listen... 
 Can we, um, catch up later? 
 I have just got so much work I have to get done. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 I mean, I'm on a deadline. 
 Oh. Well, what about dinner? 
 Uh... probably, yeah. 
 Probably? 
 [Awkward chuckle] 
 I just need to rough out a first draft. 
 That's all. I... 
 I... 
 I understand. 
 Alright. 
 I'll call you later. 
 [Door opens and shuts] 
 [Troubled sigh] 
 You need to tell Ian. 
 When he gets back. 
 When he gets back, he'll be a father. 
 If everything goes okay. 
 It'll be fine. 
 That's what they said the last time. 
 I'm such a cliche. 
 Pregnant and eating ice cream. 
 And chocolate cake. 
 And three chili dogs. 
 Four. 
 I eat when I'm upset and when I'm pregnant. 
 By the way, I have a favor I need to ask you. 
 It has to do with Luke. 
 We're not in a great place. 
 What happened? 
 No, you've got enough to worry about. 
 Are you kidding? 
 I would kill to hear about someone other than me screwing up their life. 
 I'm not screwing up anything. 
 You're kind of screwing up. 
 I am, aren't I? 
 Yes... 
 But it isn't too late. 
 You haven't let things go too far, have you? 
 So what's the favor? 
 Every year, there's a big Navy benefit held to raise money for wounded soldiers. 
 This year, they asked Luke to be their guest of honor. 
 I'm not up to it. 
 Well... you know why. 
 Anyway, I was thinking... 
 I don't know. 
 Come on! It's for a good cause, and, frankly, if someone doesn't go with Luke, I'm not so sure he'll go. 
 [Rodeo announcer crackling over audience din] 
 And you can bring the horses... 
 [laughs giddily] 
 There she is! 
 Put me down, you lug. 
 Cliff, this is my boyfriend, Hugh. 
 Hugh, this is Cliff. 
 You're riding against me. 
 No, you're riding against me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I gotta say, I was a little surprised to see your name on the roster. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah, I mean, you're getting a little... good? 
 I was going to say "retired." 
 Now, now, boys, let's save it for the bulls. 
 Good idea. 
 [Background cheering] 
 Grace... 
 What's wrong? 
 I found out what's wrong with Allison. 
 Oh! 
 That's horrible. 
 Looks like they took it when she was changing. 
 And whoever did this I went online... they posted it on her wall. 
 [Gasps] 
 Scroll down. There's more. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 It isn't turning out like you said. 
 Dick and his partners, they mean business, and I don't want anything to do with it. 
 Do me a favor. Lower your voice. 
 [Muffled shout]: I want out! 
 Just calm down. 
 I did my part. Now I'm done! I'm done! 
 Warren : Look at me! You are not. 
 You are not done. You wanna know why? 
 Because you're in this as long as I'm in this. 
 You got it? You understand what I'm saying? 
 You're in this as long as I'm in this, okay? Now look. These documents, I got Eric to sign, okay? To protect us. Now if someone comes looking, whose signature are they gonna see on the dotted line? Not yours, right? Not mine. Eric's. Right? Listen to me. I can handle Dick Turnbull. But you gotta understand something. Eric is our own private little insurance policy. You just gotta trust me. Hey! Wow. Rebecca, what're you doing here? Someone forgot we're meeting for a late lunch? Oh! Right. Um, sorry. Uh, just give us a moment, I gotta walk Tyler out, finish up some business. Hey, you look great. Mwah! I'll be right in. Yup! Over this way. Warren : So listen... [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] What are you doing? I think I left my lipstick here the other day. Did you find it? Uh, no. No. No, I didn't. Are you ready? I've been ready... and waiting. [♪♪♪] [Knocking] Hi. Oh! Great. Thank you. My mom would've killed me if I lost this. Did you see what was on my phone? I did. And did you show judge Lockhart? She did. Am I in trouble? You're not in trouble, but whoever's doing this to you is in trouble... legal trouble. It's really not a big deal. Honey, this is very serious. No! It's high school. That's what happens when the guy who likes you is liked by the most popular girl in school. She's mad, but it'll pass. The girl that is doing this to you... please. Can you just forget you saw this? Thanks, but I have to go. Wow. She's totally being bullied. I'm a judge. There isn't anything I can do unless she reports it, tells someone, or files an official complaint. My hands are tied. Mine aren't. Hey. Bob told me where to find you. [Takes a deep breath] You okay? I am now. Okay, so what's going on? Well, I'm both an emotional eater and I have a little bit of a nervous stomach, and, well, I'm nervous. What? About this stupid function we're going to tonight? Luke... I'm pregnant. What? Confirmed just hours ago. Well, just call those people at the thing, tell them I'm not going. I spoke to Justine. She's going to go with you. I know you don't like to go to these things alone, and she's free. No, I just don't think that we're talking. She thinks I'm, uh... No. She doesn't. She just knows this isn't the time for you to dive into a complicated relationship. But your bruised male ego won't let you see that she has your best interests at heart. So you're pretending to be mad at her, when, really, you're in love with her. Be the good guy you are, and take her to the benefit as a friend, nothing more. 'Cause she is a friend. So do a nice thing for her and back off. Roger that. Did you come to apologize? No. I came here to warn you. Warn me? There's something going on with Warren. [Laughs] Please. You're gonna warn me about Warren? Be smart. Listen to me. What do you think you know? I know that whatever document you signed is Warren's get-out-of-jail-free card. Thanks, but I got this under control. The captain of the Titanic had more control over things than you do. Do you like insulting me? Yes! But that's beside the point. The point being? He set up this corporation with you as the only officer so that nothing can be traced back to him. You, on the other hand, are on the hook! If you could look past whatever messed-up feelings you have for me, you'd see that I'm right. Wake up, Eric... Before it's too late. [♪♪♪] [Knocking] Justine : Hey, Luke! Come on in, it's open. Uh, take your time. I'm early. I have this thing. My father always said "if you're on time, you're late," which I hated, but somehow, it must've gotten into my head, because I'm always that annoying guest who shows up first at the party. Hi. Wow. [Chuckles] You clean up pretty nice, too. Are we still fighting? I was never fighting with you. I was just being honest. True. So, could we maybe just go to this thing and not talk about you and me, or Seth, or therapy, or P.T.S.D., or whether or not I'm mentally fit? Yeah. I can do that. Good. [♪♪♪] Hey, Roy. Bob. Thanks for taking the time to meet with me. Anytime. So what can I help you with? It's Peggy. What about Peggy? Well, someone sent Peggy flowers about a week back. Now, whoever did that has brought flowers by the house. Now, I didn't think anything of it at the time, but Peggy has gotten so... Well, jumpy and... and nervous, I mean, whoever's doing this has been to our home. You understand? I really need you to look into it for me. I didn't tell her anything, but, uh, well... I-I-I'm worried. Okay. I'll check it out. Good. I'll call you tomorrow. I appreciate it. I'm so sorry. Hey, Allison needs you. Grace : She does. You know, you're not competing until tomorrow, so... Hey, you are where you need to be. I'll be fine. I can't believe I'm going to miss the rodeo and your big moment with killjoy. I'll have Alex take some pictures. Grace : Okay. You know I love you. I love you, too. [Rodeo commentator crackling over P.A. System] [Commentating continues, crowd cheers] These are the guys and the girls that keep this show goin'. If you like it, you love it... Tearfully : Yeah. Just some boyfriend-girlfriend stuff, it's okay. And be a part of this great show, as we celebrate our 26th year next year. [Door bangs shut] You went behind my back? You talked to my mom and the school? Oh, honey, I was worried about you. I'm only trying to help. Well, you didn't! You made things a lot worse! What is happening to you, Allison, is wrong. Bullying, cyber-bullying, is against the law. All you need to do is file a complaint and this will all get better. Olivia and I will help. Like that makes a difference to the girls who are making my life a living hell? Oh, Allison. I could barely hold it together before, but now... honey, come on. Grace! If you want to help, just stay out of my life. I don't want your help, and I don't want you. Allison! And I quit. I'm not gonna help you at the library anymore. [♪♪♪] [Music playing faintly] [Cafe buzzing with chatter] Whoa-ho-ho. Look at you guys! [Justine chuckles] We're starved! What, they don't feed you at these fancy benefit things? Not nearly enough. Well, find a seat, wherever you can. [♪♪♪] Is it just me, or are we overdressed? Not at all. When I used to work here, we served decorated veterans in full Navy dress all the time. Oh, really? [Chuckles] Well... I think I should lose this jacket 'cause I feel like some fries and ketchup. You might be waiting a while. Moon doesn't have a fryer. No fryer? No. [Laughs] Well, then I guess I will leave the jacket on. You look great in that dress, by the way. Can I say that, friend? Yes. And, thank you. You're like no friend I've ever had. [♪♪♪] I had fun tonight. Yeah. Me too. I'd forgotten what real fun was like. Can I tell you something? Yeah. I got into grad school. Yeah? [Both laughing] Congratulations. You're the first to know. You want some coffee? Yes, please. [♪♪♪] Hi, Justine. You and I need to have a talk. Get in. Don't make me repeat myself, kid. I'm about out of patience. [Door opens and shuts] Jack? Hey! Mm. Mm... I don't care if you have a cold. It's okay. I think it was just allergies. Mm. What was that for? I missed you today. I think I need to go away to Seattle more often. And I think I should go with you. What? Come here. I want to talk to you. Okay. Sit down. So I've been thinking. Yeah? Let's get an apartment together in Seattle. That way, you could use it for work during the week and I could spend more time with you there. But what about your work? I can fit my docket into a four-day week. Then we could have three-day weekends. I could come on Thursdays, leave on mondays. I see how much your work means to you, and you mean so much to me... I think it's time I put us before everything else. Okay... [Uneasy chuckle] Jack? Do you not want me in Seattle? [♪♪♪]
