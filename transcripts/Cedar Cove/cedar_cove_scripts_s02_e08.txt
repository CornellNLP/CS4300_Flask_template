 Previously on Cedar Cove... 
 [Smack] 
 You're a great friend. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Bob : Looks like you've got a secret admirer. 
 [Peggy scoffs] 
 Oh, Bob! 
 Huh? 
 Olivia : Who would send you that? 
 "From Jeri... your friend and colleague." 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 I saw Cliff on the way out. Where's he headed? 
 Oh, horse auction. 
 Well, Jack is having a boy's night in with his beloved Phillies, pizza and his couch. 
 We'd better hurry up, Grace. 
 We're gonna miss our reservation. 
 I'm going to miss this house. 
 I'm going to miss you in this house. 
 Well, you don't have to. 
 I am not moving to Cliff's cabin. 
 I love this place. 
 I thought you couldn't afford it. 
 Well, I contacted the bank, and I'm looking to refinance... so that way, if something comes up, I can pay for it without going broke, and then stay on top of the repairs. 
 So what's Cliff think about this? 
 He gets it. 
 And... 
 He told me he loves me. 
 [Exhales] Wow... 
 That's big! 
 It is! 
 And what did you say to him? 
 I told him I loved him, too. 
 I'm just happy to see you with someone like Cliff. 
 Yeah. 
 Earrings! I'll be back. 
 So... 
 Something happened with Jack. 
 Yeah? 
 I met his ex-wife. 
 Oh? Eric's mom? 
 No. 
 His other ex-wife. 
 Excuse me? 
 Jeri. The reporter that was here for the trial. 
 No! How did Jack bring that up? 
 He didn't. 
 She did. 
 Oh... I think we need to talk. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hey, you know what? That's probably Maryellen. 
 We've been playing phone-tag all day. 
 Can you just pick it up, will ya? 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Hello? 
 Grace? 
 No. 
 Who is this? 
 Sorry. Wrong number. 
 Wait. 
 Will? Is that you? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Okay. Was that Maryellen? 
 Why is my brother, Will, calling you? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Grace sighs] 
 He contacted me a few weeks back. 
 Will and I are just friends. 
 You know, he apologized about everything. 
 In fact, the first 10 phone calls, all he did was leave apologies on my voice-mail. 
 He felt really bad about that whole thing with Georgia. 
 So exactly how did he try to apologize for trying to date you while he was still married to Georgia? 
 He's not perfect. I'm not perfect. 
 I've made mistakes. He's made mistakes. 
 [Sighs] 
 Will is one of my oldest friends. 
 He just happens to be the brother of my best friend. 
 I didn't want one stupid indiscretion to get in the way of a 25-year friendship. 
 I have a lot of history with Will, with both of you, and it's good history. 
 What if Cliff finds out? 
 There's nothing for him to find out. 
 I have no intention of a romance whatsoever. 
 Besides, Will's hands are pretty full with Georgia. 
 What's going on with Georgia? 
 He asked me not to say anything. 
 Just talk to Will. Let him tell you. 
 He wants to. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 No, the flowers were beautiful, but I'd like to know who sent them. 
 There's no card. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Oh. Internet order, huh? 
 You mean you have no name or number? 
 [Sighs] Okay. Thanks. 
 [Beep] 
 [Wheezing] You know, jogging is just walking with cramps, so you know, can we just, like... 
 Stop? 
 Oh... are you training for a competition I don't know about? 
 Two weeks ago, you could hardly keep up, and now... now I can barely keep up. 
 See? Progress! 
 [Laughs] 
 So, have you talked to Jeri? 
 No. Why would I? 
 She sent you that bottle of vodka. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Jeri has an interesting sense of humor. 
 So... 
 What has got you so energized this morning? 
 Well... 
 Grace is talking to my brother, Will. 
 Wow. 
 After everything last year? 
 Took a while, according to Grace, a very long while, but he worked his way back into her life. 
 Is he still married? 
 Last time I checked. 
 And Cliff? 
 Well, she swears that she and Will are just friends. 
 I don't think Cliff's gonna see it that way. 
 I have to admit Will and Grace were really close in high school. 
 Will was her first crush and the first man to crush her. 
 I hate to say it, though... 
 I do not trust my brother. 
 No, I think that Grace is just too naive to see the truth. 
 The truth being? 
 She shouldn't trust him. 
 Come on. Let's race. 
 Oh... 
 Let's go! 
 No... 
 Come on! 
 Okay. 
 You and Bob are the best. 
 The center can really use these sheets and towels. 
 I'm glad we can do our part. 
 So how's your work on the base going? 
 Great. 
 Yeah? 
 Most days, I spend helping out at the store, but what I really love is working with the social workers and therapists who work with the vets with P.T.S.D. 
 Oh, that's great, honey. 
 [Door thuds] 
 Uh, I think I'm just gonna go bake something. 
 Can we talk? 
 Or better yet, can I apologize? 
 You got one hell of a right-hook. 
 It was a slap. 
 Which I needed. I was out of line. 
 You were. 
 I'm with Seth. 
 I know. 
 Can we go back to the way things were before? 
 Miss hanging out with you. 
 You miss me, too? 
 Huh? Just a little? 
 You keep your lips in check and we'll be fine. 
 See, I wanted to hug you right there, but I didn't. 
 I'm a man of my word. 
 I will never make a move on you ever again. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Door closes] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 So, you, uh... 
 Get your one-year A.A. Chip soon. 
 You know, your "sober anniversary" would be a really good time to get up and tell your story. 
 I bet Olivia would agree. 
 [Jack exhales] 
 I didn't tell her. 
 I'm kind of keeping this on the down-low. 
 I think she'd want to know. 
 No. She wouldn't. 
 She loves this Jack. 
 I don't want her knowing about the "old Jack." 
 You are in a relationship. 
 Honesty's the best way to play it. 
 Bob, I am honest. 
 I go to the meetings. 
 I work the program. 
 That should be enough. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey, I'll grab yours. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Moon. 
 Two large coffees, one with cream. 
 Coming up. 
 So, uh... 
 Who's your new friend? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 That's, uh, that's Rebecca. She's the new A.D.A. 
 You know... [chuckles] 
 As a mice-divorced, I may be in no position to comment... ah, but then again, maybe I am. 
 Women... 
 Get over a lot of things. 
 Lying about being with another woman... 
 That's not one of them. 
 I'm not lying. 
 I'm not with another woman. 
 So then you've told Shelly about your, uh, budding friendship with Rebecca there? 
 Well, if you haven't, you'd best ask yourself why not. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 [Grumbles quietly]: Yeah. 
 Good morning. 
 Grace! 
 Will? 
 Two iced teas. 
 Great. Thank you, Peggy. 
 Mm-hmm. Well, that's the last you'll see of me. 
 You've got the place to yourselves. 
 Alright. Let's see... 
 You recording this? 
 Uh, this is just for my notes. 
 [Recorder beeps] 
 Okay. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Tell me about the day that your unit was ambushed. 
 I don't know. It was like any other day. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um... 
 Your best friend was one of the soldiers killed. 
 I don't want to talk about him... 
 Or the mission or my problems. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I don't even know where you're from. 
 Where did you grow up? 
 Gresham, Oregon. 
 Okay. 
 Was your family in the military? 
 Your dad? Your mom? 
 Do I need to talk about my family? 
 Nope. 
 No. Not if you don't want to. 
 Can I take a break? 
 Uh... 
 [Sighs] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Grace : So what are you doing here? 
 Well, after Olivia and the phone call, I caught the first flight out. 
 I have to face my family. 
 Although I hear my mother's in Florida again? 
 Yeah. 
 So it's just Olivia? 
 I am so sorry. 
 I'm sorry that I put you in the middle of this. 
 It's okay. 
 I guess they have to find out eventually, right? 
 Yeah, but I also understand sometimes you just want to keep your problems private. 
 Have you told Olivia anything? 
 No. 
 How much does she know? 
 I haven't told her anything. 
 Mr. Graham, it's my understanding that you and your brother both live and work on the same farm. 
 A few years after we inherited it from our dad, my brother and I both built houses on the property. 
 Let me take a wild guess... as far away as possible from each other? 
 I've been seeing a lot of you and your brother in my courtroom, and I understand the need to work out your family problems in public, but most people do that at Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
 He watered the field, but he didn't roll up the pipe. 
 It's not my fault. 
 The water main's... on your part of the property, not mine. 
 Okay! That's enough. Sit down. 
 I know you have your differences... 
 But you need to learn to work together. 
 You're brothers! Goodness' sake! 
 [Door shuts] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 We're gonna take a short recess. 
 [Gallery murmuring] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey, Jill. You got a second? 
 I'm not here to do your work for you, so stop asking. 
 I'm Warren's assistant, not yours. 
 Look, I found something. 
 Now, I checked the foreman's log, and none of these invoiced construction materials showed up on site. 
 The accountants will figure it out. 
 This is the second time this week. 
 Just leave it alone. 
 Okay. 
 There is nothing going on with Grace outside of friendship. 
 See, I have a hard time believing that... 
 Again. 
 I'm serious. 
 So am I. 
 So what does Georgia think about this renewed friendship with Grace? 
 She's your wife, Will. 
 Not anymore. 
 We're divorced. 
 Since when? 
 A couple of months. 
 Really. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. We... [Sighs] 
 We fell out of love. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 Because I'm tired of being the family screw-up. 
 Will... 
 Look. 
 Grace and I are just friends, okay? 
 Well she's dating Cliff now, and he's really good for her. 
 I know. 
 I also know that I don't have the best reputation, but I care about Grace. 
 I would never do anything to hurt her again. 
 Or you. 
 Okay? 
 [Sighs] Oh. 
 Adoption? 
 I know you're afraid of losing another child, and losing me, but I also know you want kids as much as I do, so I got to thinking. 
 Adoption? 
 The first step is a "home study." 
 Yeah, and where in all these steps is the step that says you and I need to talk about this before we do these steps? 
 You want kids. 
 I want kids. 
 You don't want me to get pregnant, I get it. 
 You're scared we could lose the baby again. 
 Adoption is a great solution. 
 Don't you think? 
 No. I don't. 
 Please... just stop this. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey, boss. 
 Architect sent this over. 
 She wants you to have a look. 
 See, Eric? This is the fun part. 
 After all the negotiations and the financial headaches, once these plans go through, everything falls into place. 
 Why are you still standing in my office? 
 No. We can talk about it tomorrow. 
 But you've already aggravated me. 
 Okay, this... you know, it might be nothing... 
 All these construction materials, you're paying for them, but they're not showing up on site. 
 Well, maybe they're in transit. 
 No, I checked with the distributor. 
 There's nothing in the system. 
 Now, I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but why would Tyler be ordering supplies he doesn't need? 
 [Sighs] 
 Alright. Thanks for letting me know. 
 Um... 
 I will deal with Tyler. 
 [Thud] 
 Hey, Bob. 
 Hey. 
 You're early. 
 Luke's still at therapy on the base. 
 Ah. 
 Yeah. 
 He still having problems opening up? 
 [Chuckles dryly] 
 The kid is like a mime. 
 But, uh, I feel for him. 
 Well... rehashing the past is not easy for vets with P.T.S.D. 
 I can vouch for that. 
 Yeah. 
 I just really want this to be a great article, you know? 
 Not for me, but for him, for other vets. 
 Feeling the weight of a lot of souls counting on your words to be the right words? 
 Yeah, I guess I am. 
 But he just won't talk. 
 Well, then you two have something in common. 
 He doesn't want to share his story, and neither do you. 
 Not with Olivia. 
 Not with the group. 
 How is it that you can bring everything back to my sobriety? 
 I'm a really amazing sponsor. 
 Yes, you are. 
 I just don't think it's fair for you to ask Luke to delve into and talk about his past, when you won't do the same. 
 I'm just saying. 
 What're you writing about? 
 It's private. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, they try to make us to do that in therapy. 
 Journal? 
 Yeah, I hate it. 
 I love it. 
 Actually, I need it. 
 When my head is full of things, it helps to write them down. 
 Sometimes, I just make lists. 
 I like to check things off, gives me a sense of order in chaos. 
 Is everything okay with you? 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 Just trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. 
 And you? 
 I'm supposed to be at an interview with Jack. 
 But you're here. 
 You know what I miss most about being over there? 
 Getting there. 
 I don't understand. 
 We have all sorts of ways of getting to missions... on helicopter, plane, sub... 
 That's how I met Ian... but my favorite mode? 
 Destroyer. 
 You get out there on that deck in the middle of the ocean... 
 It's the only time I've ever really felt peace. 
 The only time I feel peace is when I'm on my way to war. 
 I am messed up. 
 [Laughs] 
 No, you're not. 
 Hey... 
 You want to take a ride? 
 Okay. Why not? 
 
 
 
 [Machinery rumbling] 
 Wasn't expecting you till tomorrow. 
 We're making good progress, though. 
 Ran into some delays with the foundation work over on section "C", but should be back on track by the end of the week. 
 Well, that's not why I'm here. 
 Foreman's log. Signed by you. 
 Eric double-checked the construction invoices. 
 Now he knows that nothing has arrived on site. 
 He actually thinks you're stealing from me. 
 Oh, that's rich. 
 You should've covered your tracks better. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Will : Hi, Grace. 
 Hey! I was just thinking about you. 
 You were? 
 I most certainly was. 
 And I was also thinking why don't we try  that new Italian restaurant by the art gallery? 
 I hear it's really good. I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight. Oh, is everything okay? Yeah, uh... Just work stuff. I'm really sorry. Oh, Will, that's fine. I mean, work is work. Is there something else you want to tell me? Uh, just that I have to leave tomorrow. Okay. Um... Do you need a ride to the ferry? No. Thanks, though. Um... It was really good to see you, Grace. Yeah. Yeah, you too. Bye. [♪♪♪] Hi! How you doing? [♪♪♪] Hey, peg... [Gasps] Oh! Moon! Sorry. No, it's not you, it's me. I'm sorry. You okay? Sure. Great! Never better. Bye. [Paper crumpling] You're a sight for sore eyes. I am? Yes, of course. [Grunts] I've been trying to get Luke to open up to me about his P.T.S.D. He is so closed off, and he's as jumpy as a feral cat. I don't think he trusts me. Well... I don't think you trust me. What is that supposed to mean? I've been waiting patiently for you to come and talk to me about the fact that you were married to someone and I knew nothing about it. Jeri is from another time in my life... a time I want to forget. Sorry, that's not good enough. Olivia, I don't ask you to tell me every detail of your past. I would tell you anything. Ask me any question. I love you. That's what you do when you love someone. You share life's stories... the good and the bad. Yeah, but you see, that's all I have, right, is bad. All you have is good. That's not true. Oh, come on, Olivia! Our pasts couldn't be more different. This isn't about judgment. This is about trust. What, you don't trust me? I didn't say that, but as this conversation goes on, I'm starting to wonder what else you might be hiding from me. I'm not hiding anything. A lie by omission is still a lie, and in some cases, it's worse than a lie. Not telling me about Jeri is a lie. And not wanting to talk about it is a big red flag. Okay, look, this is getting out of hand... No, Jack. This is a relationship. Okay, yes. Yes, I was married to Jeri Drake. Who cares? Obviously, you do. And you don't care enough about me to share the whole truth with me. I can't be with someone who only wants to share the parts of them they think are okay. I have to be with someone who wants to share it all, everything good and everything horrible. That's what I do with you! Not because I have to, but because I want to. I was married to a man who kept things from me because he thought he was protecting me. I don't need to be protected. I can take care of myself. What I need, what I can not live without, is total and complete honesty, and if you can't give me that, then I don't know what we're doing. Olivia... Don't tell me you love me. What? Don't say you love me. Show me you love me. [♪♪♪] ♪ Slow it down ♪ 
♪ Everyone's been slowing down ♪ 
♪ But I've been up all night... ♪ So whose boat is this, really? It's this admiral I know. Ran into him the other day. He's stationed here in Cedar Cove... Told me I could take this baby out whenever. You okay? Just feeling a bit guilty, I guess. How come? Being in a boat out here... It's something I only ever did with Seth. I miss him. So he has a boat? He did. But then he sold it. He's back out here, where he belongs. And where do you belong? I'm not sure. You know, I had this high school gym teacher... Basically taught me that sports is 90% mental, 10% physical. He also taught me to control that voice in my head... You know, the one that always tells you you can't do something. In that last week of seal training... All I could feel was pain, but all I could hear was the voice of my coach. Justine, you can do anything that you put your mind to. You're amazing. You know, you just need to believe that you're amazing. Grace : Thanks to you, he canceled dinner. You told Will not to see me. No, I didn't. Oh, come on! I know you're not happy we're friends. That is not why I'm not happy. Oh? Well then, what is it? Every time my brother comes to town, you lose your mind. I do not. Yes, you do. You're my friend, and I love you, so I have to tell you that I think what you are doing with Will is foolish and dangerous. He may be single, but you're not. And you say you're just friends, but have you told Cliff? No. And you have to ask yourself why? If what you have with my brother is so innocent, what is there to hide from Cliff? Justine : Can you tell me why it's hard for you to talk to Jack about what happened to you? I don't know. See, I think you do. [Laughs] You don't let me get away with anything. I like that. I guess it seems like I just don't want to build myself up, make it seem like I'm riding on the backs of those who didn't make it back. I mean, those are the real heroes, but no one's talking to them, because they're dead... and forgotten. Jack's a really good guy. You should give him a chance. Trust him. Let him tell your story. [Knocking] Yes? Hi, Bob! What are you doing here? Picking you up. But I don't want to go anywhere. Well, trust me... You want to go where I'm taking you. [Door slams] Hey, boss. You wanted to see me? I did. Tyler's still here. Yes, he is. But he's stealing from you. You know, Eric, last time I checked your job description, I didn't notice "accountant" next to your name. Sit. You know, as a developer, I... operate on a very thin profit margin. Crews, land, equipment, materials... it's all very, very expensive. And sometimes... okay, all the time... look, all my projects, big or small, I need to do whatever I can to make sure I bring home a decent profit. Tyler didn't steal from you. "Steal," that's such a negative word. I prefer "allocate" or "redistribute." [Exhales] Eric. No one is getting hurt here. We're not doing anything wrong, okay? I take care of myself, and... I take care of my employees. What is this? I don't know. Depends on you. It could be a severance check, or it could be a bonus check, for understanding that my business, and what I do with my business... Is my business. Eric, I like you. I see big things with you here at Saget Development. But you see, today... today is graduation day, and you are either in business with me, or you're not. You understand? Luke : Jack. Hey. I got your message to meet you here. I want to apologize. For what? And where're we? I'm sorry for asking you to do something that up until now... I haven't been willing to do myself. Hey. Uh, Luke... Why don't we wait inside, huh? Okay. What's going on? It's my anniversary, and I want to share it with you. Today, I'm one year sober. I didn't know. No, of course, you didn't know. I didn't want you to. Olivia, I haven't shared everything in my life with you because I'm afraid that if you know all the darkness in my past, you're not gonna want to be with me anymore. That's not true. But that's how I felt. "Felt?" Past tense? Yeah. You see, you're not the only one that I haven't shared my past with, and, well, to celebrate this milestone, I thought you needed to be here when I share with the group. This is me showing you... How much I love you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hi. Um... where to start? Um... First of all, I'm a writer, I'm not a speaker, so... I apologize in advance... Um... [Deep breaths] The truth is that I've been avoiding this moment for a long time. But I realized something this week... That sharing my story isn't all about me. It's about you. We learn from each other, don't we? Our successes and our failures... And each week, one of you brave souls, you stand up here, and you tell your story. And today, I think, um... It's time that I do the same thing. [Emotional breaths] So as I stand here holding my one-year chip. I think I need to back up here a little bit and tell you how I ended up here. [Exhales] So let's start from the beginning. My name is Jack... And I'm an alcoholic. Group : Hi, Jack. Hey! Hey. You did good. Huh? I know I'm not the easiest guy to sponsor. Oh, there are harder cases than you. [Laughs] Really? Yeah. You're looking at one. I don't think I've ever met your sponsor. Yeah, well, he, uh... quit. Sometimes, when you fall off the wagon, you don't get back on. Yeah. So, I'm going to hit those cookies. Don't tell Peggy. [Chuckles] Hey. Thanks. Well, it's, uh, not a pretty story. It's got a good ending. More like a work in progress, I think. Drinking is what you did. It doesn't define who you are. I could say the same to you... About war... soldiering... How about we try that interview again? Yeah? Yeah. You know, I thought maybe this time, I'd actually talk. [Chuckles] You know, that's not why I invited you here. Yeah, that's why I want to do the interview again. You know, you haven't lied to me. You haven't played me. You haven't manipulated me. Not once. All you've ever done is help me. Okay. [Clears throat] Well? I am so proud of you. Thank you. You know, what I said in the meeting... It's not everything. There's more. But it's a start. For me? For us. I do love you. And I love you. Even after everything that I said? Because of everything you said. Oh, Jack... No more secrets. By omission or not. Truth, always. Okay. Deal. Hey! We agreed to split it. I got it. I just got a big bonus at work. Okay, you're getting it. I'm just a lowly civil servant. Or you could say thank you. I mean... Thank you. So... What do you want to do now? Hm Oh, Justine's here. Hey, honey! Hey, Justine. Hey! You look happy. I am. I figured something out today. What's that? I want to get my master's in social work. I'm applying to Washington pacific university. Grad school. I want to turn my volunteer job into my "real" job. I love the work that I've been doing, and I realized that I just... I want to keep doing it. So if that means going back to school, I'll go back... Because I finally figured out what I want to do. You're gonna make a great social worker. Yeah, I second that. Aw, honey! It's exciting! [Grace and Will laugh] I'm glad you called. Yeah, ll, you shouldn't have canceled. Not for the reasons you did. I didn't want to complicate your life this time. Mm... You weren't. We're friends. Good friends. You know that Olivia never told me she got in trouble. And I was the one who talked her into staying out late that night. She didn't want to make you feel bad. I know. She was always looking out for me, even back then. You two were like sisters the day you met. Mm-hmm. Do you remember when I gave myself that home perm? I so wanted hair like hers. [Laughs] You looked like a poodle. Oh, nice. Thank you. But I did! I looked like a poodle. You don't look like a poodle now. Thanks. See, I'm so glad you changed your mind about dinner. Me too. Look, poodle or not... Yes? You were beautiful then and you're beautiful now. Why, thank you. Do you want me to take my hand back? I don't know.
