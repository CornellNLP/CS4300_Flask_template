 Olivia :  Previously, on  Cedar Cove... 
 Allison! If you're looking for your mom, she's... 
 She's in court, divorcing my dad. 
 I know that I haven't been around that much. 
 No. You haven't. 
 I'm gonna try very hard... 
 To change that. 
 Why don't you come with me? 
 On your job? 
 It's one night in Seattle. It's not a marriage proposal. 
 [♪♪] 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Ringing] 
 Judge Lockhart. 
 Has court adjourned? 
 Just now. 
 How are you? Hey, I'm covering the Mariners game tomorrow, and spending the night  in Seattle with you. I'd say I'm pretty excited. Me too. My buddy recommended a seafood restaurant right down on the water. Just me and you and a couple of very unlucky lobsters. Unless you don't like lobsters? No. I love them. - Can I call you back? -   Yeah, of course. May I help you? You don't remember me, do you? I lost the beard and cut my hair. Lenny... Leonard Wilson. You're probably wondering why I'm here. Well, most people I sentence to prison don't come back to visit. When were you released? Last year. Time off for good behavior. Can I, uh, come in? Yes. Of course. So how are things going for you? Not good, actually. I've been able to find work here and there in Seattle, but I can't land anything permanent, not if I'm honest on the job applications. I'm sorry to hear that. Nobody trusts a guy with a record. That must be frustrating, but I commend your efforts. I don't need a pat on the back, judge. What I need is a job. I-I'll take anything... restaurant work, house-painting, landscaping... You're asking me to find you a job? They'll listen to you. That day in court, you said if I worked hard and turned my life around, doors would open for me. I remember that, and I stand by it. Okay, so I did what you said, 'cept the doors are still closed. All I'm asking is for you to open one for me. I'll see what I can do... But ultimately, it's up to you. I can't make people trust you, Lenny. You have to earn that. I will. [Sighs] [♪] Cedar Cove 01x07 
Help Wanted 
Originally Aired August 31, 2013 [♪] Scoffs : Really? What? Do you remember Mrs. Hotchkiss from high school? Sure. Our dowdy old English teacher? What about her? This is exactly the kind of dress she used to wear. Oh, honey. You have got to loosen up. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself. You're gonna have a nice little romantic getaway with a really great guy. [Excited sigh] [Phone rings] Hello? Oh! Hi, Elaine. Thank you so much for getting back to me. Look, I was thinking you could use a hand at the market. You're always so... Are you sure? I understand. How is it that news travels so fast around here? Lenny Wilson committed his crimes in Cooperton. He's not even from Cedar Cove. Doesn't matter. Folks don't want a convict on the payroll. Ex-convict. He served his sentence. For burglary. Second-degree burglary. Weren't there other convictions? Shoplifting, arson, vandalism? Probably even picked up a few more tricks of the trade while in the joint. The "Joint"? [Amused chuckle] Look, I called his parole officer. He was a model prisoner. Even got his G.E.D., which is something I suggested. Very few people actually take that advice. [Knocking at door] Mocking fear : Wah! Go. Go, go, go, go. [Olivia giggles] Deep breath. Ooh... Who is ready for Seattle? She needs to find a different dress first. Not to mention a job for that felon. Grace! How is Lenny ever gonna catch a break if people refer to him that way? That's right. I heard you've been making calls on his behalf. Which I think is great. If anybody understands the importance of a second chance, it's me... [Gasps when elbowed] Thank you. Don't you two have a ferry to catch? As a matter of fact, we do. Are you ready? Ready. [♪♪] [Horn honking] Hey! Hey. And remember, your dad will pick you up later, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks, okay? Oh, and please, don't let your dad leave a stack of dirty dishes for me to contend with. It's enough that I have 50 loads of laundry to deal with when I get back. Okay, mom. She'll be fine. Huh? We'll see you later. See you later, mom. Love you. Love you. So, how's it going? Ah... [scoffs] That good, huh? Hey there! Dad! What're you doing here? Well, I stopped by the house, to hopefully speak to your mom, but she wasn't home. She's in Seattle. Oh. What for? Jack got a freelance assignment covering the Mariners game, so. She went with him? He seems like a nice guy. She really likes him. Well, it, uh, looks like you've settled in nicely here. It's been a long time trying to figure out what it is that I wanted to do with my life, but... Feels like this is where I belong. [Words catch] I wish I'd been around more. To help you. Give you advice. Could've used it. I'm not going to lie. Those first few years were tough. I lost a brother... And a father. [Takes a breath] Well, I'm back. And I promise, you will never lose me again. I hope not. [Gulls crying] Thank you. [Exhales] So good to be back in the city again. You want to go for a walk? Pioneer Square, Pike Place... We could do that. Or we could just, oh, I don't know, we could stay right here. Or we can go out, too. Hey, whatever makes you happy. No. Let's stay here. Yeah? Yeah. [♪] What? You're so beautiful. [Phone rings] [Groan of protest] Oh, it's just the stadium. Yeah? Jack Griffith. [Sighs] Really? Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. Yeah. Bye. [Sighs heavily] The Mariners have called an early press conference. I don't know why. Well, you'd better get going. I am so sorry. No, no, Jack. It's your job. Don't worry about me. I'll... Go window shopping. Well, hopefully, it'll be a very quick game. Yeah. Yeah. [Exhales deeply] [Door opens, closes] Looks lovely, honey. Thanks. I put some in the Birch Room, too. The guests have a late check-in. Oh! And, um, that couple from Portland was asking about boat rentals, so I recommended Burt Walker's place. A born concierge. Hey. [Bob inhales and sighs] Mm... Hey... Didn't you already do that this morning? Oh. Yeah, but it's dusty again. Ahh. I like dusty. I think you've done enough for the day. What do you say I drive you home? No! I mean... um... My... my friend, Anson, can pick me up. No, I don't mind. I'll get my car keys. Uh-uh! [Bob chuckles smugly] Bob! [♪] Has she called you yet? No... why would she call me? To let you know how things are going. I'm sure everything is going well. Well, maybe I should call and check in with her. Charlotte! Don't you dare. You'll embarrass her. I've always embarrassed her. Why stop now? [Grace laughing] May I help you? Uh, yeah. Is this where people post stuff about work? Sometimes, but there's nothing up there right now. Are you new around here? I used to live in Cooperton. Oh. And they don't have any work for you there? Well, times are tough. Do you know anybody who's hiring? Afraid not. 'Kay. Well, thanks, anyways. Radio host :  Saturday night is date night, a night full of fun. Thank you for making us a part of your Saturday evening, wherever you may be... On the way home from the movie, or at home, holding the hand of the one you love. [♪♪] [Phone rings] Hello? Jack :  I'm stuck. What happened? Aw, the Yankees came out strong, but our boys rallied. Now the game's gone into extra innings. Yay, Mariners! Yeah... Thing is, I could be awhile. Well, do what you have to do. I'll be here waiting. I like the sound of that. [Bat cracks] Ah! Uh, I gotta go, okay? Bye-bye. [Stadium crowd roaring] [Chuckles] [Sighs] [♪] I can't believe you got vanilla. So boring! Vanilla's dependable. Never lets me down. Mm-hmm. My dad wants me home. Wish I could sail away in one of these boats. It's that bad? I thought things would get better after the divorce, that at least the fighting would stop, but it's only gotten worse. I mean, all they do is complain about each other, and how hard it is to deal with me and Eddie. Wish there was something I could do. I know something I can do. I'm asking Bob and Peggy if I can move in with them at the Thyme And Tide. Live there? It's the only place I can breathe. I guess you could try. But for now, don't go getting your dad all angry at you... And... I don't want him angry at me, either. Alright. I'll see you later. See ya. [♪] [Door closes] [Whispers] Olivia? Hey... [Jack sighs heavily] [♪] [Sighs] Please, Jack... It's not your fault the game went extra innings. But  seven? [They both laugh] You know? I mean... Okay, two, maybe three, but rarely do they go  seven. At least the Mariners clinched it. Yeah, finally. Then I had to file my article, and traffic was a nightmare around the stadium. Truly, I get it. Who keeps a gorgeous woman like you waiting, though, huh? Who falls asleep waiting for such a handsome man? We'll find another time. You promise? Guaranteed. I'll call you later. Okay. I could run errands, handle maintenance... I'm sorry. We... we just really don't need any help right now. Mom. Hi. You're her mother? Yes. I didn't know you were interested in art. I'm not, but I am interested in finding a job. I've been trying every place in town. Well, I'm back from Seattle, so let me see what I can do. I appreciate that. Thanks. What was that all about? He's the guy I heard about, isn't he? The ex-con that you sentenced? Yes. I thought that you were on his side, trying to help him. I am. Then what are you so worried about? [♪] I wanted to believe in him... Give him the benefit of the doubt... But when I saw him in the gallery alone with Justine, I panicked. I just wanted him outta there. That's understandable. I mean, he's got a lot of baggage in his history. None of his crimes were violent. That's true. Still, with his track record, a lot of people have a hard time letting go of that. He had a difficult life. I mean, a lot of his problems were self-inflicted, but... growing up, he was bounced around from foster home to foster home. The odds were set against him from the start. Hey... at least you're trying, right? I, for one, commend you on your compassion. It's very sexy. Oh, yes. Very sexy. Very sexy, huh? Let me show you how very sexy it is. Buenos tardes, amigos!  Hey! Hope you come by for lunch today. The special is chimichangas. Ooh... Moon... Did you fill that position that Justine left? Because, if you haven't, I know someone... Oh, pfft. I know where you're going with this, judge, and it's really good karma, for sure, but I like to maintain a kinda... A chill at my place, and I just can't have a dude like that harshing the vibe, you know? I'm sorry, man. "Harshing the vibe." [Jack laughing] Even Moon won't give the guy a break! Don't harsh the man's... What was it? Vibe? "Vibe." Vibe. Where were we? Ahem. Oh. That's right. [Both laughing] [♪♪] [Door swings open] Hey! Ah! Look who brought the sunshine in. Are we busy today? No busier than usual. Good. Um... Do you think I can ask you and Bob something? Sure. Bob? Allison's here! Bob : Hello, young lady. This is your lucky day. I hope so, because I wanted to ask you guys something. Um... Mom? Surprise! I thought you were in Tacoma. I was, but Bob and Peggy generously offered to let me stay here. Bob : You know, all this bouncing around doesn't make sense. Not when we have a free room for her. Not free. We agreed... When I have a steady job, I'm paying you back. So you're going to live here? When it's not my turn with you and Eddie at the house, then I get to see you whenever you come to work. Isn't it great? [Awkward chuckle] Yeah, that's awesome. Afternoon, Cliff. Charlotte. What a nice surprise. How goes it with your father's memorabilia collection? Well, selling like gangbusters. And I have you to thank for that. Well, your father had so many fans. It doesn't surprise me that people would jump at the chance to own something of his. Hey, mom! Olivia. Hey, Cliff. Uh, you're not planning on doing any home repairs yourself? Relax, mom. I'm just checking to see if Hank has any job openings. Oh. Olivia has taken it upon herself to find employment for a local ex-con. Right! I heard about that. I heard he even asked for a job at the gallery with Justine. Is there some kind of briefing I'm unaware of? A secret hotline to call and find out everybody's business? No, but that's a wonderful idea. I gotta run, mom. Nice to see you, Cliff. You too. Wait! How'd it go in Seattle? Allison : So, um, I updated the address book, and created a special group of former guests, so now you can send out mass e-mails, letting everyone know about upcoming specials or events in town. That's great! Seriously. It's genius. So, how you doing? I'm good. I mean... I... I just have a lot going on right now. I'll... I'll show you how to access the group. Okay, wait. Let me write this down. Rose : At first, he was fine with it. He liked that I was volunteering for the P.T.A., the school, but when I wasn't at home, he didn't like it. Bob : Well, you can't win with people like that. Believe me, I've tried. Whatever I did, it wasn't right. The good news is, you don't have to worry about what he thinks anymore. [Inhales sharply] Do you mind if we finish this later? No. Of course not. Okay. Thanks. Would you like some tea? Yes. Great idea. There's that look. Quietly : I'm worried about Allison. This whole situation... it can't be easy for her, Bob. Honey... It's gonna take time. This is a big adjustment. For all of them. 
 
 [♪] It's a beautiful day. Any day outside is beautiful. I was just over at the hardware store. Now you see what I'm up against. Listen to me. It's tough, it doesn't seem fair, but you've got to keep trying. I still believe, if you work hard, eventually someone's gonna give you a break. Be patient. You're doing the right thing. It doesn't matter. You know, I've tried to do the right thing, play by the rules, but what's the point, if people just assume you're gonna break them? [♪♪] [♪] [Knocking] Come in. I'm sorry to disturb you, Judge Lockhart. Oh, Olivia, please. What can I do for you? That guy you're trying to help find work... Lenny Wilson. I got a place for him at my ranch. I got fences that need maintaining, horses to be fed and watered. There's a spare room for him, too, if he's interested. I'm not sure he's got that kind of experience. Well, it's not rocket science. Just honest, hard work. [Laughs] That's exactly what he needs. Thank you, Cliff. Okay. Was there something else? You tell Grace I said hello. I will. [♪] It's been a long time since I had my own classroom. Permanent positions are hard to come by. I guess I'll have to substitute-teach for now. In the meantime, we'll have to rely on Zach for support. It's not like I'm asking for anything unreasonable, but raising kids is expensive. I know he resents it. Well, you just make sure that he holds up his end, and remind him that deadbeat dads get taken to court. He's not a deadbeat! This is hard on him, too! You're taking sides with your father? It's not all his fault. Oh, it's my fault, then? No! Mom, I don't care whose fault it is. Why can't you just stop fighting and just talk to each other? Wait! Where are you going? Anywhere but here! Allison! You know what? If Eddie and I are such a burden, let me get out of your way. Honey! Wait! [Door opens and slams] Yoo-hoo! In here. You ready to get your heartbeat up? Absolutely. Cliff Harting says to say hello. What'd he do, pass you a note in study hall? He likes you. Of course he does. I am very likeable. Do you like him? Honestly, I haven't thought about that. And don't you even think about giving me that "Judge" face. Excuse me? You know exactly what I mean! That "Oh, I know you're lying to me" expression. Well, he's a gentleman. And he gets a gold star in my book. Cliff's the only person in Cedar Cove to give Lenny Wilson a break. What do you... He's working on Cliff's ranch. Grace! It's a good thing. Yeah, for Lenny, maybe. Forget spin class. I've got a better idea. What? Horseback riding. [♪♪] Dryly : So what's the game-plan here? Try to protect Cliff from the dangerous ex-convict? No, I just want to make sure that everything's okay. But I did bring along some mace in my purse, just in case. He can protect himself. Oh, I know that. It's just... What? Deny it all you want. You like him. Ladies! Okay, just act natural. Hi, Cliff. Hey! Well, this is a nice surprise. Yeah. We had a sudden urge to go horseback riding, and you did say that we would be welcome anytime. And you are, indeed. Well, Grace... ahem. I think Miss Anabelle here'd be a good match for you. Feisty, takes her time warming up, but once she does, she is all heart. He's doing fine. Fast learner. Hard worker. And the silverware's all accounted for. I don't know what you mean. Grace. Cliff, we're sorry to intrude. I'm the one who insisted we come here, but it was out of concern. For me? For anyone that he's working for. But things are going well? No complaints. Meanwhile, seeing as you came all the way out here. If you insist. Miss Anabelle! Look at you. Listen, you, you had better be nice to me, or I will show you feisty, remember that. I'll go and saddle her up. Could you be any more obvious? [Laughter] We should get going. Why? Well, it's gonna be dark soon, it's getting cold. [Grumbles in protest] Hey, we could go back to my place, but that's where my family is. Can't be as bad as my house. You don't want to get into a "who's got the more messed-up family" contest with me, 'cause I got you beat every time. Can't we stay a little longer? Sure. [♪] [Weary grunt] We should've attempted something simpler. Oh, come on! Where's your sense of adventure? We can't let a little chicken cacciatore defeat us. This is so much better than Seattle. Taste. Alright. Straining : Oh. That's good. It's awful, isn't it? Am I under oath? See? I'm a terrible cook! I should just stick to the courtroom. [Clears his throat] Oh! Yeah. I happen to think you are amazing in the kitchen. [♪♪] Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do. [Phone rings] [Grumbles bitterly] Tell 'em nobody's home. Tell 'em nobody's home. Don't do it. Don't... [sighs] Hello? Hey, Troy. Yeah. What? [Radio crackling] Troy : Great. That's all we need to know. Troy. Jack. Well, they managed to save most of it. Quick response. What happened? Someone started a fire in the trash can. How do you know it's intentional? Pergolas don't self-combust. Just have to figure out who would do something like this. Lenny Wilson? What, the guy who did time up at Coyote Ridge? Why would he do this? No, I'm not saying that he did. It's just that, well, folks around here haven't exactly welcomed him to Cedar Cove. Does he have a history of arson? Well, it was a long time ago, but just a misdemeanor. You know where I can find him? He's working at Cliff Harting's ranch. Troy : 'Kay. Hey, Cliff. Sheriff. What can I do for you? I just came down to see Lenny. I need to talk to him about something. Hey, Lenny! The sheriff wants a word. Sheriff. Lenny. Listen. There was, um, trouble in town last night. I'd just like to talk to you about it. What kind of trouble? Somebody burnt down the pergola. Why would I do that? I'm not saying you did, but, uh... Well, old habits die hard. I don't do stuff like that anymore. So where were you last night? Downtown for a little while after work. I got back around 10:00. I can't say I know when Lenny came home, but if you're asking me, you're barking up the wrong tree. Ah. So what'd you go into town for? To walk around. Is that a crime? Where in town? Well, nowhere near the park. [Sighs] Anybody see you "Nowhere near the park"? No. Most people in town who see me coming look the other way. Look, sheriff. I've done my time. I'm making a fresh start. Ask Judge Lockhart. She'll tell you all about me. I did. She was the one who told me where to find you. [♪♪] It's a shame. I worked hard building this. Better part of a month. Jack : Aw, it was beautiful work too, Bob. Bob : And it will be again. Make it even better next time. Listen. You mind if I give you a hand? Yeah, I'll put some of those woodworking lessons to good use. [Laughs] Yeah. Sure. You can be my apprentice. Alright. You got a deal. You can be my Jedi Master. [Laughs] Yeah, well, we can't let him win. Now, hopefully, Troy'll get enough evidence and lock him up. Make him think twice next time he wants to come back to this town. You know, Bob, we don't know that Lenny Wilson did this. Don't you think we should maybe give him the benefit of the doubt for the time being? Yeah, I suppose. But you know the saying... A leopard doesn't change its spots. Hey, Stan. This a bad time? Not at all. What can I do for you? Well, uh, as you know, I've been spending more time with Justine. It's still awkward for her, for both of us, but, hopefully, we can get to the relationship we should've had for all these years. Give it time. Be patient with her. I'm so happy you're back in her life, Stan. Well, I'm working at it. Working on a lot of things, actually. I've been seeing a therapist. Wow. You have? For about a month. Wow. It's better late than never. I know, you were after me for years to go, but you know me, I'm just... I'm not good at confronting the problems in my life. "Ignore them and they'll go away." Exactly. Except all the things that I should have dealt with a long time ago are still there, so... It's time for me to untangle them. I think it's great, Stan. Thanks. It's nice to hear a positive response. Why? Who's being negative? Well, some people believe that therapy only stirs up trouble. Like your wife? Hmm. I just want you to be happy, Stan. [♪♪] Did the sheriff arrest him? No, not yet. At least, I don't think so, but... He's the prime suspect. I don't like this, Anson. I don't either. Don't worry. I'll think of something. I didn't do it! I didn't set that fire. I didn't say you did. I've been minding my own business, busting my back at the ranch, and the minute that there's trouble, you point your finger at me? That's not true. The sheriff wanted to question you, I simply told him where you were. I had nothing to do with it! Keep your voice down. You told me to have faith in people, that I would get a second chance if I turned my life around, and I have! Hey! What's going on here? It's okay, Jack. It's not okay. She thinks that I'm a criminal, just like the rest of you! Lenny... listen to me. You have to go. Now. [♪] Right. I'm not your problem anymore. [♪ He didn't do it. How can you be so sure? Because I believe him. I'm not sure what you're hoping we can find here that the sheriff and the arson investigator didn't. I don't know. Anything. You know, I interviewed every person that was either in or near the park that night, and there's just... there're no witnesses. And yet the entire town is ready to lock up Lenny Wilson and throw away the key! It was me. I-I did it. Folks think that guy started the fire, but he didn't. It was me. What happened? I was in the park... alone. I wasn't in a hurry to go home, it's not exactly fun at my house. I-it was cold, so I lit a small fire in the trash. It got out of hand. I tried to put it out with my jacket, but it spread really fast. I panicked and ran away. I did a stupid thing. I'm sorry. [♪] Anson... Your recklessness has damaged something very dear to this town. I know. I wish I could take it back. You can't. But you have taken responsibility for it, and I believe that your remorse is genuine. Yes, ma'am. I'm sentencing you to one-year probation. In addition, you will pay for the restoration of the pergola. Thank you, your honor. I'm not finished yet. You're also going to help rebuild it. Court adjourned. [Whacks gavel] Hey. Sorry. Took me awhile to sneak out. My dad's been watching me like a hawk, along with everyone else in this town. You okay? No. This is so messed up. At least it's over. No, it isn't. I can't do this. I can't keep quiet. Yes, you can! We talked about this. We agreed. I don't care. I have to tell the truth. I have to tell them what really happened that night. How you said we should leave, but I just couldn't handle going home. You said lighting the fire was a stupid idea, but I wouldn't listen. You tried to put it out, but I freaked. I can't sit back and let you take the blame. Listen to me. The last thing you need right now is your parents flipping out like you're some delinquent... Like they already think I am... So everything's cool. The judge just gave me probation. It's gonna be okay. Don't worry. That boy is a problem. He's been a terrible influence on Allison. I wouldn't go that far. Well, she's not seeing him again, that's for sure. Rosie. The kid made a mistake, but he is very good to Allison. Honey, I know this is a difficult time... But you've been so wrapped up in your own problems with Zach, complaining and casting blame... that you don't even notice Allison hears everything. She's in a lot of pain, Rosie. We all need to be a little more mindful of that, and, as difficult as it may be, I'm afraid you and Zach have got to start dealing with your issues with respect and in private, or you know what? We're all going to lose her. [♪] Lenny? Can I talk to you a second? You were right. There were a few moments that I doubted you. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry about that. But you proved yourself. You've turned your life around. For that... I'm really proud of you. You should be proud, too. Judge Lockhart? Thank you. [♪] Alright, you make your cut... Right where I marked it here. Okay? Yes, sir. Alright. [Jack laughs] Jack. Do you have much construction experience? Do legos count? [Laughs] [Jack takes a breath] Listen, I really like the website for the Thyme And Tide. Allison told me you helped her design it. Yeah, it was fun. Think you could, uh, make an online edition of  The Chronicle? Are you, like, offering me a job? Well, that's, like, the idea. [Jack laughs] Listen, I need to bring the paper into this century, and, uh, well, you'd earn enough to pay for these repairs. Interested? [Scoffs] Yeah. But... Why are you helping me? Look, Anson, you screwed up. But... everybody deserves a second chance. Keep at it. You're doing great. Thanks. Thanks, Grace, but after the week I've had, I'm looking forward to a night at home. You, too. [♪♪] [Knock at door] Somebody called for take-out? That would be me, and I ordered enough for two. Oh. Is that an invitation? Depends. Did you turn off your phone? Radio silence. Tonight... it is just you... and me. I definitely like the sound of that. [♪♪]
