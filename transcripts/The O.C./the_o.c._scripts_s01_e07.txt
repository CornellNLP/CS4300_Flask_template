 Teaser  
 Seth : The plan is undeniable.  
 Ryan : I'm denying it.  
 Seth : We have my mom's ranger, we have a perfect alibi as i go to  
 this  
 comic book convention every year and we also have my entire life  
 never doing  
 anything wrong. Which completely allows my parents to give a false  
 sense of  
 trust.  
 Ryan : And you want to give that all away for Summer in a wet t-shirt  
 doing body shots.  
 Seth : (pause) Sorry, i thought that was a rhetorical question. Yes,  
 Ryan,  
 yes. On the last weekend before school, one goes to Tijuana, it is  
 tradition, it  
 is a right of passage, and you know what else? What happens in  
 Mexico, stays in  
 Mexico.  
 Ryan : What happens in Mexico?  
 Seth : I don't know, because it stays there, that's why we must go.  
 Ryan : ahh.. I don't know about lying to your parents.  
 Seth : Okay, i can respect that. I will lie to them.  
 Ryan : Why can't we just go to Comic-con?  
 Seth : Okay, Comic-gon is just a bunch of pathetic virgins ogling  
 some  
 p0rn star dressed as Cat Woman.  
 Ryan : I thought you went every year.  
 Seth : (bites lip) Listen, Tijuana's a big town, i bet you won't  
 even see  
 Marissa.  
 Ryan : I don't care about seeing Marissa or not seeing Marissa.  
 Seth : Okay, therefore you should have no problem coming to Mexico.  
 Ryan : Well, won't you be hanging out with Summer?  
 Seth : No, because she'll probably be shacked up with Luke.  
 (pause)  
 Seth : Yeah, I'm sorry. That's probably a bit painful.  
 (sandy enters kitchen)  
 Sandy : Hey ya, fellas. You all excited about Comic-con? Seth's been  
 going  
 since he was ten. It's the highlight of his year.  
 Seth : Thanks, highlight's a bit overstated. Check you out, big  
 pimpin'.  
 Sandy : Yeah, I got a meeting with a private law firm today.  
 Ryan : Why, you suing one of their clients?  
 Sandy : No, it's a job interview.  
 (kirsten enters kitchen, opens refridgerator)  
 Kirsten : Which he'll never take. They like to flatter him every  
 once in  
 awhile.  
 Sandy : But i go for the free meal.  
 Ryan : But I mean, you'll still be a public defender, right?  
 Kirsten : After 15 years? There's no way he's selling out.  
 Sandy : Well, it'd have to be one hell of a free meal.  
 Seth : And that's what they call a call-back in comedy, Ryan.  
 Sandy : So, how soon until you two are leaving on your trip ?  
 Seth : I don't know. (looks at Ryan) How soon?  
 Ryan : Tomorrow.  
 Seth : Don't you mean El maf1'f1'61f0 na?  
 (end of teaser)  
 credits  
 (Seth walking into the pool house with a mexican hat. He puts it on  
 Ryan's head  
 then steps back)  
 Seth : Looks good.  
 Ryan : I don't wear hats.  
 (seth doing the "what's wrong with you" move.)  
 Seth: Ryan? you mean sombreros. You really need to brush up on your  
 Spanish.  
 (holds out spanish book)  
 Seth : There's over 500 useful phrases.  
 Ryan : (reads from book) "May i please see a lady's worsted nylon  
 bathing  
 suit?"  
 Seth : (nods head) Yeap, but did you know that one?  
 Ryan : What's this? (takes out some brown piece of paper)  
 Seth : Our iteninary for our trip.  
 Ryan : Seth, it's over 12 pages long, we're going for two days.  
 Seth : Right. Well, if you're going to get over Marissa, somebody  
 needs  
 activities.  
 Ryan : I don't need to get over Marissa. I'm over Marissa.  
 *turns to leave*  
 Sethf1 f0 : Ryan? Ryan. Look at me, this is me here, okay? Amigo.  
 Now I  
 know you're hurting, and i think you need to unburden your soul.  
 *sits on bed, and pats the bed space next to him*  
 Seth : Anytime, i'm here to help.  
 Ryan : Trust me, my soul is fine. It's just that-  
 (cuts to Marissa and Summer)  
 Marissa : -I don't know, it never would have worked out.  
 Summer : No kidding, it is so much better this way. He's all like,  
 brooding, wounded, somebody save me.  
 Marissa : I thought you liked that.  
 Summer : It is just too hot to save anyone. Speaking of hot, I can't  
 believe you and Luke. That you guys did it! You have to tell me  
 everything, i've  
 been waiting for this forever.  
 Marissa : You have?  
 Summer : you've seen it before  
 Marissa : C'mon  
 Summer : touched it?  
 Marissa : Summer! It's a secret act between two people,  
 Summer : It was a letdown, right? Kinda hurt? totally awkward?  
 Marissa : Well, it's not like I had anything to compare it to.  
 Summer : So? do it again, it is way better the second time.  
 Marisaa : Well, i'm supposed to go over to his place this afternoon.  
 Summer : Trust me, Coop. Get back on that horse. You got to giddy up!  
 (stands up and does that giddy up thing).  
 Marissa : shh. my dad's home!  
 (both laugh)  
 (cut to jimmy on the phone)  
 Jimmy : well, you're right. i don't understand. you promised me that  
 the  
 apartment will be ready tomorrow. Yeah. i'm moving out this weekend.  
 I  
 don't-where am I supposed to stay? *sighs* well, you don't have to  
 apologize,  
 it's just that you know, i-alright, you know what? thank you, i -  
 forget it.  
 yeah bye.  
 Summer and Marissa enter.  
 Marissa : Dad?  
 Jimmy : Hey, girls.  
 Marissa : So, Summer and I are going to -  
 Jimmy : Oh right, you're going to Palm Springs. Yeah...  
 Marissa : We're not leaving until tomorrow... for Tijuana?  
 Jimmy : Oh yeah, right. that's it. i meant-ah-  
 (marissa looks concern)  
 Marissa : You, okay? Because i was going to go over to Luke's but if  
 you  
 want, i could stay here.  
 Jimmy : nono, i'm-i'm fine, sweetie. yeah, go to Luke's. Luke's  
 great.  
 Isn't he, Summer? He's a really-really great kid.  
 Summer : Sure..  
 Jimmy : Anyway, i gotta...  
 Marissa : Right, i know, yeah. kay. Alright bye.  
 (they leave).  
 Summer : cya  
 Jimmy : cya.  
 (cut to doorbell ring at the cohen's kirsten goes to open it)  
 Kirsten : Hey!  
 Jimmy : Hey. Is now a bad time?  
 (cut to them in the living room)  
 Kirsten : i don't know why you come to me in the first place.  
 Jimmy : I-i *shrugs*  
 Kirsten : I'll call my realtor, Gloria. I'm sure she'll be able to  
 help  
 you find something.  
 Jimmy : Thanks, you know. Yeah, thank you.  
 Kirsten : So, how did the girls take the news?  
 Jimmy : Well, uh. Julie and i decided to uh, table that conversation  
 until  
 Monday.  
 Kirsten : You haven't told them yet?  
 Jimmy : Julie's at her mom's with Caitlin and Marissa's going to  
 Mexico  
 this weekend so, we thought'd it'd be easier, cleaner if we did it  
 that way.  
 They come back i'm gone, and then we tell them.  
 Kirsten : I'm not so sure about this.  
 Jimmy : *sighs* well, Neither am i but, the thought of having them  
 watch  
 me pack up my life, move out, it's hard enough as it is. I'd never  
 thought i'd  
 be that guy that, *sighs* that divorced guy.  
 (cut to Marissa and Luke making out).  
 Luke : When we go to Tijuana, it's going to be so romantic.  
 Marissa : It's kind of gross there.  
 Luke : So what, we won't leave the hotel room.  
 Marissa : I don't know.  
 Luke : It'll be way better the second time.  
 Marissa : No, i mean i don't know about Mexico. TJ. I don't think I'm  
 going to go, i think my dad's having a meltdown.  
 Luke : You're thinking about your dad right now? Cmon, babe.  
 Marissa : I don't know if I can leave him alone.  
 Luke : Warissa, he's like 40.  
 Marissa : We can go to like Mexico whenever. I feel like i should be  
 with  
 him, right now.  
 Luke : Okay, fine. Gotta go meet the guys anyway.  
 (Cut to Seth and Ryan at the Crab shack place, with Summer and her friends at another table. Ryan is working, Seth is at the bar, drinking godknowswhat. Seth motions Ryan over)  
 Seth : Was she looking at me?  
 Ryan : (looks at Summer) Still no.  
 Seth : You know what she's doing? And it's textbook. She's playing  
 hot and  
 cold, trying to pretend our little kiss didn't happen.  
 Ryanf1 f0 : There were no witnesses. I mean, I didn't see  
 anything.  
 Seth : Well, i guess i'll just have to make magic happen again,  
 won't I?  
 (Ryan nods sarcastically)  
 (Luke and Marissa enter, Luke waves to Ryan and Marissa and Ryan um,  
 talk)  
 Ryan : Hey, how you've been. Haven't seen you in awhile.  
 Marissa : Yeah, Well, the last time i saw you, you kinda had your  
 hands  
 full.  
 (Ryan and Marissa have this intense glare)  
 Summer : Coop, c'mon!  
 Ryan : Well, don't let me keep you.  
 Marissa : I won't  
 Ryan : Good.  
 Marissa : Uh huh  
 (Marissa looks away and walks to Summer's table)  
 Holly : Hey Coop.  
 Marissa : Hey Holly.  
 Summer : You don't make those freshmen watch real donkey shows, do  
 you?  
 (marissa looks at ryan, luke and them laugh)  
 (Cut to sandy in the waiting room, turning off his cell phone)  
 Rachel : Sandy Cohen! How'd you get pass security?  
 Sandy : How are you, Rachel? (stands up)  
 (they have this hug)  
 Sandy : Well, you look great! Being a slave for the Man agrees with  
 you.  
 Rachel : Six seconds until the first insult! You're getting soft!  
 Still  
 surfin'?  
 Sandy : Every morning, it helps me keep a clear mind, that and not  
 working  
 at a joint like this.  
 Rachel : (nods) Yeah, decent hours, appropriate compensation. I  
 don't know  
 how i ever left the DA's office.  
 Sandy : Well, if i remember correctly, you kept losing. None of this  
 roguish brilliant...  
 Rachel : Conceited.  
 Sandy : That's right. It was me.. So, what are the good folks at  
 Parcher  
 and Con doing.  
 Rachel : I gotta tell ya' you made some noise with that Jimmy Cooper  
 case.  
 Sandy : Ahh, i didn't do anything.  
 Rachel : you still got your work cut out for you. But heading the  
 fed's  
 office for a pass, negotiating a restitution deal, calling in a high  
 powered  
 security attorney in the spend of a weekend.  
 (walks to elevator)  
 Sandy : god, damn, i'm impressive.  
 Rachel : And conceited.  
 Sandy : So you keep saying.  
 Rachel : Truth be told, no one was going to touch that guy. The fact  
 that  
 you did, made the partners think and made me think. Is sandy cohen  
 really ready  
 to come down off his high horse? Is he finally getting tired of  
 being a martyr?  
 (walks into elevator)  
 Sandy : geez, i was just hoping for a free meal.  
 Rachel : Sorry to disapoint you. All you're getting is a really good  
 sales  
 pitch.  
 Sandy : Sounds delicious.  
 (elevator closes)  
 (cut to the crab shack place, again, seth and ryan are talking).  
 Ryan : What are you uh-  
 Seth : Shh, eavesdropping, I hear like a wolf.  
 Summer : What do you mean you're not going?  
 Marissa : I just, I don't know Summer. I can't.  
 Summer : But how am I supposed to get there? The guys are going down  
 tonight for that stupid freshmen hazing . Holly's car is full.  
 Marissa : I'm sorry.  
 Summer : ugh, I'm totally stranded.  
 (Seth bites lip.)  
 (Cut to Luke and Holly behind the aquarium)  
 Holly : You know, what happens in Mexico stays in Mexico.  
 Luke : Holly, I can't. I just got back with me and marissa are back  
 together.  
 Holly : I'd give it a week. You'll miss me.  
 (Ryan overhears and gives him a suspicious look, luke stops smiling  
 and walks  
 away).  
 Luke : C'mon babe. (to marissa) Let's get you out of here before the  
 road  
 trip starts.  
 Marissa : (shrugs to Summer)  
 (they leave)  
 (Seth walks up to Summer's table)  
 Seth : Hello Summer. Seth Cohen. I believe you remember *winks at  
 her*  
 Nothing? Um, i heard you needed a ride tomorrow.  
 (Cut to the next day, Sandy, Seth and Ryan walking to the outside)  
 Sandy : Remember all the numbers?  
 seth : Yes, dad, i remember our phone number.  
 Sandy : Did you get any water? Huh? Extra batteries? Did you get  
 some air  
 in the tires? Did you put gas in the tank?  
 Seth : (exasperated) It's amazing I turned out so normal.  
 (walks out, see summer)  
 Seth : Hey! Let me get that (tries to lift her suitcases and falls)  
 Sandy : Hey, Summer. Sandy Cohen, I'm Seth's dad. (shakes her hand)  
 I had  
 no idea you were into comic books.  
 Summer : Comic books? Ew.  
 Seth : She goes for the anime.  
 Sandy : Anime..  
 Summer : I'm going to say bye to Coop, don't touch my stuff.  
 (summer leaves)  
 Seth : This is going to be awesome.  
 Sandy : She's hot stuff, son.  
 Seth : And now, it's ruined.  
 (cut to Marissa's house)  
 Marissa : I can't go.  
 Summer : C'mon Coop. I got us a ride, just grab some stuff and let's  
 go.  
 Jimmy : Hey, what are you guys still doing here?  
 Marissa : Well, I thought I'd stay home this weekend.  
 Jimmy : What, why? I thought you were looking forward to this trip.  
 Marissa : Well, I was, but you know, I thought that we could spend  
 some  
 time together.  
 Jimmy : We can't i'm sorry. I thought you were going so, i-uh. made  
 other  
 plans.  
 Marissa : I was, I just thought..I mean, are you sure? Cuz' i thought  
 maybe we could.  
 Jimmy : Look, please c'mon. I can't take care of both of us.  
 Marissa : Okay. I'll go pack my stuff.  
 (turns and walks away)  
 Summer : Coop...  
 (Cut to Marissa and Summer walking out the door and going into the  
 car)  
 Marissa : So, who's going with us?  
 Summer : You'll see.  
 (opens door)  
 Summer : Great news! I got Coop to come along.  
 (Marissa finds Ryan in the backseat)  
 Marissa : oh.  
 Summer : Vamanos! We're going to TJ!  
 (car drives.. away)  
 (commercial)  
 (cut to kirsten and jimmy painting his apartment.)  
 Kirsten : I can't believe you talked me into doing this, we could've  
 brought somebody in.  
 Jimmy : Where's the fun in that? It only took us a couple hours to  
 paint  
 my dorm room, remember?  
 Kirsten : Your dorm room was the size of a prison cell.  
 Jimmy : well, we might be painting one of those as well.  
 (Kirsten looks at him with the, shut up look)  
 Jimmy : sorry. Listen thank you so much. I was thinking about being  
 home  
 when julie and the kids come back.  
 Kirsten: you haven't told them yet.  
 Jimmy : Well, not exactly, I was going to tell Marissa, but then, it  
 seemed so impossibly hard.  
 Kirsten : Because it is! Jimmy, Marissa isn't a little girl anymore.  
 And  
 if she comes home and finds you gone, she'll never forgive you. Call  
 her, she'll  
 still love you. I promise.  
 (cut to Marissa, Seth, Summer and Ryan on the car)  
 Summer : We should be there in, like, 3 hours?  
 Seth : The GPS says the ETA's three and a half.  
 Summer : Well, that's because someone drives like an old woman.  
 Seth : I'm going 70 in a 65 zone.  
 Summer : 80 is the new 70.  
 Seth : What? Who talks like that?  
 Summer : Who gets passed by a van full of nuns? Oh wait, who? Cohen  
 does.  
 Seth : Well, they have God on their side, okay Summer? I'm not going  
 to  
 beat jesus.  
 Summer : I'm going to call Holly and see how far ahead of us she is.  
 And  
 she's a girl.  
 Seth : That's weird being insulted here.  
 Summer : Not as insulting as being here with you.  
 Seth : Point taken.  
 (ryan reaches into the bag to get water and offers it to Marissa)  
 Marissa : no, thanks.  
 Summer : I'll take it. I'm so dehydrated. What is up with the AC? My  
 hair  
 is frizzing out, i look like Howard Stern!  
 Seth : See? You know, strangely, I think my JewFro benefits from  
 this.  
 Summer : You're Jewish?  
 Seth : Yes, that's why I feel so comfortable in this desert heat.  
 Summer : This is a nightmare. I'm sweating to death, driving 10  
 miles an  
 hour, on like a rickshaw listening to this...music.  
 Seth : HEY, do not insult Death Cab.  
 Summer : It's like one guitar and a whole lot of complaining.  
 Seth : This reminds me of someone else who's doing a whole lot of  
 complaining, Summer. YOU. Listen to me, I am driving this vehicle,  
 and i will  
 drive at the speed i feel comfortable, okay? It's my music, it's my  
 snacks-  
 Summer : Kudos and goldfish? what are you, 8?  
 Seth : Ryan, Marissa, say goodbye to Summer.  
 Summer : What are you doing?  
 Seth : I'm dropping you off.  
 Summer : No you won't!  
 Seth : Don't touch the wheel.  
 (seth and summer struggle to control the wheel while marissa and  
 ryan panic in  
 the backround. )  
 Summer : Stop!  
 (they drive into the grass and the car axel breaks down.)  
 (cut to the hotel)  
 Summer : Ew.  
 Seth : It's not exactly the honeymoon suite.  
 Marissa : Well, it's only for one night. Until the axel's fixed.  
 Summer : That's nothing to brag about. Sweet, do we have to pay  
 extra for  
 the pubes ? This is so gross, i can not stay here.  
 Ryan : well, unless you feel like hitchhiking again.  
 Summer : No thank you. I've had enough time in a truck full of  
 chickens.  
 Marissa : well, we're really lucky that guy stopped for us.  
 Summer : Well, we'd be even luckier if Coletrickle here hadn't  
 driven us  
 off the road.  
 Seth : Who the hell is coltrickle?  
 Summer: Tom cruise, Days of thunder?  
 Marissa : Hey guys can we try to be positive, here?  
 Seth : Yeah, okay, i am positive that this is Summer's fault.  
 Summer : I am positive that i am leaving this place with a rash.  
 Seth : so you're planning on making some extra money tonight?  
 (summer glares at him and walks into the bathroom)  
 Summer : Ew. This bathroom is so...ew..  
 (Seth puts his head his hands, exasperated by summer's complaining.)  
 (Cut to Kirsten and sandy in the kitchen)  
 Sandy : Hello  
 Kirsten : Hey  
 Sandy : What happened to you? Were you finger painting in the  
 backyard?  
 Kirsten : Well, i was at Jimmy's. Helping him paint his new living  
 room.  
 Sandy : Julie kicked him out?  
 Kirsten : mhmm. is it okay that i'm helping him?  
 Sandy : yeah. yeah i guess. *sees the new surfboard* whoa honey! You  
 shouldn't have.  
 Kirsten : I didn't. It washed up about an hour ago. Who's Rachel?  
 Sandy : She works at the law firm i met with yesterday.  
 Kirsten : Wow, the meeting must've gone well. You never said. You  
 must've  
 let them down, so they sent you a gift.  
 Sandy : You know with a private practice, i could do more normal  
 work than  
 i do now.  
 Kirsten : Sandy, you're not seriously considering the job, are you?  
 Sandy : The salary the offered me, it's outrageous.  
 Kirsten : Since when have you been swayed by a paycheck? This family  
 has  
 all the money it needs.  
 Sandy : Yeah, except of course, it's your money.  
 Kirsten : It's our money.  
 Sandy : Not really.  
 Kirsten : Well, unless you want to bye the Lakers and own a Carribean  
 island.  
 Sandy : It's not about buying stuff, well it'd be nice, it's about  
 contributing. and i have an oppurtunity.  
 Kirsten: it's working for people who you hate. you always referred  
 to  
 those places as evil empires. controlled by coprorate interest.  
 Owned by the  
 Man.  
 Sandy : well, it goes with the territory.  
 Kirsten : But PD's office is your life! I don't want to see you give  
 that  
 up so you can buy groceries next week.  
 Sandy : i don't believe this, i think balance is important.  
 Kirsten : you don't think we have balance?  
 Sandy : No we don't. you have all the money  
 Kirsten : and you have all the ideals.  
 Sandy : You like that I don't make a lot of money.  
 Kirsten : What?  
 Sandy : That's what makes us different from all the other families.  
 Kirsten : Ugh.  
 Sandy : All these other women, you never wanted to be, married to  
 their  
 investmen bankers and CEOs, as long as i haven't sold out, you  
 haven't sold  
 out.  
 Kirsten : So not true.  
 Sandy : C'mon face it, the only reason that keeps you feeling from  
 julie  
 cooper is me.  
 (kirsten looks at him like.. i can't believe you said that)  
 Sandy : but hey, it's just an offer.  
 (cut to ryan and marissa at a vendor)  
 Ryan : So, i have to pick wisely, ding dongs and cheese sticks?  
 Marissa : I don't know, pick whatever.  
 Ryan : I don't care either, so...  
 Marissa : So i, guess we'll all just starve.  
 Ryan : Are you ever going to stop being mad at me?  
 Marissa : I'm not mad at you.  
 Ryan : Right.  
 Marissa : Well, why would i be mad at you?  
 Ryan : Because you walked in on me with another girl?  
 Marissa : Actually, i think she was a woman. But why would i care  
 about  
 that?  
 Ryan : I don't know. shouldn't be a problem  
 Marissa : There's no problem.  
 Ryan : Cept' ding dongs or cheese sticks.  
 Marissa : I don't care, Ryan. I don't care about cheese sticks, i  
 don't  
 care about ding dongs and i really don't care that i walked in on  
 you with some  
 girl, or woman, whatever.  
 Ryan : The only reason i was with her was because you were clearly  
 back  
 with Luke.  
 Marissa : I was not back with luke.  
 Ryan : But you are now right?  
 Marissa : right.  
 Ryan : good  
 Marissa : great, so we'll just go to mexico split up so we don't  
 have to  
 talk to each other over again.  
 Ryan : Sounds like a plan. By the way, you could've knocked first.  
 Marissa : Did you ever wonder why i went to the pool house to find  
 you?  
 Ryan : Everyday. Here's your chance. Clear the air. Tell me.  
 Marissa : Cheese sticks, i hate ding dongs.  
 
 
 
 (cut to seth in the hotel room turning on the tv)  
 Seth : Hey static, that's awesome.  
 (summer comes out of the bathroom wearing her nightgown)  
 Summer : What're you doing?  
 Seth : Almost watching tv. This is either Spongebob Squarepants or  
 Jag.  
 Summer : Get off the bed. The sooner i go to sleep, the sooner it'll  
 be  
 morning and the sooner this nightmare will be over. ... I'm not  
 sleeping on that  
 couch. It's stained and smells foul. You sleep there.  
 Seth : After you made it sound so appealing, yeah, right, okay, good  
 night.  
 Summer : C'mon get off the bed!  
 Seth : Nope.  
 Summer : Be like, a gentleman?  
 Seth : Chivalry's dead, sugar.  
 (Summer releuctantly gets into bed)  
 Summer : (glares at seth) You make a move, I rip out your jugular.  
 Seth : Hey, pillow talk.  
 (cut to ryan and marissa walking back to the hotel room, ryan opens door, Marissa's cell phone rings, it's her dad)  
 Marissa : Hello? oh hey dad.  
 Jimmy : Hey. You gotta a minute, kiddo?  
 Marissa : Uh, yeah. Is everything okay?  
 Jimmy : Uh well, no, uh, not exactly.  
 Marissa : Well, what is it?  
 Jimmy : This isn't uh, easy to say. When you get home, I'm not going  
 to be  
 there. Your mom and I are...  
 Marissa : You're going to get a divorce. I just can't believe you're  
 telling me this over the phone.  
 Jimmy : I was going to tell you, before you left, but then i'd knew  
 you'd  
 stay so and i just couldn't let you watch me pack up my life.  
 Marissa : *crying*  
 Jimmy : i'm sorry, i'm so sorry, kiddo. I didn't want to ruin your  
 whole  
 trip. it's good-it's good that you went..  
 (cut to ryan in the hotel room on the pull out bed. Marissa comes  
 in, clearly  
 crying. She sits down. )  
 Ryan : I can sleep on the floor.  
 Marissa : no, it's okay.  
 (she lies down)  
 Ryan : I'm sorry.  
 Marissa : Thanks  
 (ryan moves to the other side of the bed, they turn in opposite  
 directions going  
 to sleep, camera pans out of them all sleeping)  
 (the next morning)  
 (ryan and marissa are sleeping, the only thing that changed is that  
 Ryan is  
 cradling her from behind)  
 (marissa wakes up and realizes this)  
 (ryan wakes up and realizes what he's doing)  
 Ryan : Sorry, i didn't mean to uh-  
 Marissa : i know.  
 Ryan : You want to go home?  
 Marissa : I just- i just don't want to stay here. I'm going to go  
 take a  
 shower.  
 (cut to seth and summer having breakfast reading newspaper)  
 (they trade newspaper in unison)  
 (seth pushes toast to summer, while summer takes a bite of it)  
 (summer and seth both pick up their tea/coffee in unison, freezing  
 when they  
 realize what they just did, they both put down their newspapers)  
 Seth : So...Tijuana.  
 Summer : Yea.  
 Seth : You think we should've woken up Ryan and Marissa?  
 Summer : no, they looked so cute together. Vomit.  
 Seth : Hey it's a real sentimental streak you got there, summer.  
 Summer : Trouser it, Cohen. It's too early for your so called  
 comedy.  
 Seth : You enjoy my comedy.  
 Summer : *raises eyebrows*  
 Seth : You know what else i think you enjoy? Me.  
 Summer : Well, that's because you're mentally unstable.  
 Seth : Be that as it may, i think that facts speak for themselves.  
 May i  
 remind you of a little something I'd like to call, the time you  
 kissed me by the  
 pool at my grandfather's birthday party.  
 Summer : What're you talking about?  
 Seth : okay, i know that denial is a very powerful coping mechanism.  
 But i  
 just think Summer, that it's time that we paid lip service to our  
 lip  
 service.  
 Summer : Two words: no tongue.  
 Seth : Well, you did agree to take this little trip down to mexico.  
 Summer : I needed a ride.  
 Seth : We shared the same bed.  
 Summer : I wasn't going to sleep on the couch, it smelled like these  
 eggs  
 Seth : You ate my toast, Summer.  
 Summer : I like crusts, Seth.  
 Seth : Face it, our chemistry is undeniable.  
 Summer : You know what else is undeniable?  
 Seth : What?  
 Summer : the pain this fork is going to cause when i jam it into  
 your EYE.  
 (seth looks at her)  
 Summer : (apologetic smile) I suffer from rage blackouts.  
 Seth : i'm just, uh, check. (waves the waiter)  
 (cut to hotel room)  
 Summer : Where's Coop?  
 Ryan : Taking a shower.  
 Summer : I hope she's wearing shower shoes  
 Seth : I brought you some breakfast and the chariots are prepared out  
 front. You ready to go?  
 Ryan : I'm not sure we're going.  
 Summer : What?  
 Ryan : Marissa's dad called. Some bad news.  
 (marissa comes out of the bathroom)  
 Summer : What's going on? *sighs* they're getting divorced.  
 (hugs Marissa)  
 Summer : Baby, I'm so sorry. Whatever you want to do, Coop. But if i  
 may,  
 speaking as a child of divorce, you do not want to be home right  
 now. And this  
 is our last chance for freedom, we get back to Newport and it's all  
 just school  
 and reality. Let's go to TJ, have fun. Life will suck soon enough.  
 Ryan : She might.. actually be right.  
 Seth : there's got to be a first time for everything.  
 *everyone in the room looks at him*  
 Seth : Rage black outs, got it. I'll be in the car.  
 *seth leaves*  
 Marissa : Let's go to TJ.  
 (cut to them in tijuana on some road)  
 Seth : I still don't understand why we needed to get two rooms. I'm  
 going  
 to leave you my key just in case you get lonely.  
 Summer : Or in case, i might smother you with a pillow while you're  
 sleeping.  
 Seth : Whatever turns you on.  
 Marissa : So everyone is probably at Boom Boom.  
 Summer : Oh , just let me run into the pharmacy. You can get  
 whatever you  
 want without a prescription. I need to make a pitstop for my  
 stepmom. I guess  
 she's already taking all the painkillers available in Orange County.  
 Seth : I should probably pop in and get me some antihistamine...for  
 me,  
 allergies.  
 Marissa : (talking to ryan) You know, you don't have to come with  
 us, if  
 you don't want. Cuz' you know, i'm going to go find Luke.  
 Ryan : It's okay, really. It's fine.  
 (Cut to a restuaraunt with Rachel and Sandy)  
 Sandy : So where are the partners? Oh right, I forgot, vampires hate  
 the  
 sunlight.  
 Rachel : They didn't want to appear desperate.  
 Sandy : So they sent you.  
 Rachel : mmhmm  
 Sandy : Desperation was always your strong suit.  
 Rachel : And yours is...I'm drawing a blank here.  
 *both chuckle*  
 Rachel : Look, the partners are pulling the offer first thing in the  
 morning, unless they hear from you.  
 Sandy : well, tell them thank you very much for the surfboard,  
 however, it  
 did kind of freak out my wife a little bit. You had her believing  
 that I was  
 actually considering this job.  
 Rachel : Which you are.  
 Sandy : Nah.  
 Rachel : As much as i like to flatter myself. and think you're here  
 for  
 the sparkling banter and crabcakes, i know you're interested.  
 Sandy : It's not gonna happen, Rachel. I've been in the PD's office  
 my  
 whole life. It's what i do  
 Rachel : And i'm giving you a platform to do it better.  
 Sandy : The sand dabs are great here.  
 Rachel : Don't you want to see what will happen if you really tested  
 yourself? Not just one more overworked, underpaid ADA?  
 Sandy : I always loved being you.  
 Rachel : You know why?  
 Sandy : Why  
 Rachel : Cause' i was excellent. Which is why i left. I wanted to do  
 more  
 and so do you. Clocks tickin'.. so sand dabs, huh?  
 Sandy : Yup  
 *sandy looks a bit convinced*  
 (cut to jimmy and kirsten)  
 Jimmy : Of course she would be. but telling her, you were totally  
 right.  
 Kirsten :it'll take while  
 Jimmy : i guess it'll take while to get used to this. my swingin' new  
 bachelor pad. This is really the first time i've been a bachelor. i  
 went from  
 you to julie and the rest is.. let me ask you something. do you ever  
 had any  
 doubts? about you and sandy?  
 Kirsten : Well, we have our issues.  
 Jimmy : Do you ever think about what it'd be like if you and i ended  
 up?  
 Kirsten : Sometimes *nods* ahh finished.  
 (comes down the ladder and stumbles into jimmy, and jimmy kisses  
 her.)  
 Kirsten : mm.. uhh. i should go.  
 Jimmy : yeah, i'm sorry that was totally wrong. i'm sorry, look, just  
 because my marriage is falling apart, it doesn't mean i should be  
 bringing yours  
 down, too, i'm sorry.  
 Kirsten : I'm gonna go.  
 Jimmy : i'm sorry. ahh.  
 *looks troubled*  
 (cut to luke and holly at the "boom boom" place, luke's doing A LOT of drinking)  
 Holly : C'mon Luke. Rock that ass up.  
 Luke : Nah, that's cool.

 song.  
 (Luke more than happily agrees.. and goes with her to dance, while, marissa, summer, seth and ryan enter the club)  
 Seth : I love authentic mexican culture.  
 (they go to get drinks.. they drink, girls come by and squirt beer  
 into their  
 mouths, while marissa and summer drink from the glass)  
 (luke and holly are upstairs dancing intimately. They start making  
 out, while  
 marissa and ryan + summer and seth go to dance, marissa sees Luke  
 and stares  
 with horror, as summer and seth a couple seconds later. Luke sees  
 marissa and he  
 stops dancing)  
 Marissa : What are you doing?  
 Luke : I'm sorry.  
 Marissa : What that you got caught? (to Holly) Don't ever talk to me  
 again.  
 Summer :[to holly] you are such a bitch!  
 Holly : please, he hooks up with everyone,  
 Luke : Shut up  
 Holly : freshmen girls, girls from moderday, girls from UCI..  
 Marissa : Is that true?  
 Holly : Marissa! Everyone knows! Everyone! Now you do too!  
 *marissa leaves..crying*  
 Summer : You're so mean!  
 Holly : Summer, I am honest.  
 (Summer starts to run and kick holly's ass but Seth pulls her back)  
 Summer : Her parents are getting divorced, you stupid slut!  
 Seth : She suffers from rage blackouts. (pulls her away)  
 (luke tries to go after Marissa only to be stopped by, guess who,  
 Ryan)  
 Luke : This isn't about you.  
 Ryan : It is now.  
 Luke : Get out of my way.  
 Ryan : You don't deserve her.  
 *ryan punches him in the face*  
 (luke hits someone else and the whole club starts a fight)  
 (summer, seth and ryan leave to find marissa)  
 (outside)

 (hotel room)  
 Summer : Thank god, Coop.  
 Marissa : I can't believe I slept with him.  
 Summer: I know, sweetie. I gotta call the guys.  
 Marissa : No, i don't want to see them. I'm just so embarressed.  
 Summer : It's okay. It's just- we'll go home.  
 Marissa : I can't go home, my dad will be gone, my mom will be back,  
 i  
 have- I have no one.  
 Summer : C'mon coop, Let's get out of here. I'll grab our stuff.  
 (summer goes to the bathroom, marissa sees Summer's pills in her  
 purse, takes  
 them out and looks at them)  
 Summer : (in the bathroom calling the guys) Hey it's me.  
 Seth : okay  
 Summer : I found her.  
 Seth : You did? (to ryan) She's at the hotel.  
 Summer : You guys have to get here fast.  
 Seth : Okay.  
 (summer turns off cell phone)  
 Summer : (to Marissa) Hey Coop, you want to get some dinner? what're  
 you  
 in the mood for? (silence) Coop? Coop!  
 (goes out the bathroom and finds her gone. goes outside and meets  
 the guys)  
 Summer : bad news, she's gone. And she took my stepmom's  
 painkillers.  
 (they look at each other as if saying "sh1t" silently)  
 Summer : Should we split up?  
 Ryan : No, let's look together.  
 (all go find her)  
 (Marissa at a bar, drinking, takes out the painkillers and eats like half of the bottle)

 Sandy : So if I did take this job...  
 Kirsten : You've already taken it, haven't you?  
 Sandy: I can still get out of it if you wanted me to.  
 Kirsten : *shakes head*  
 Sandy : To a new season.  
 *clinks glasses*  
 (back to marissa after taking the pills, she's having a really hard time looking, and shaking, and finally leaves the bar)  
 (scenes of Ryan, Summer and Seth, still looking)  
 (marissa staggers all over the place until she finds this alleyway  
 to collapse  
 and falls unconscious)  
 (When Ryan, Summer and Seth finally see her, she's on the ground,  
 and Ryan runs  
 and picks her up, while seth and summer stand there stunned until  
 summer  
 realizes what happens and starts crying on seth's shoulder)  
 (The camera fades while Ryan is still holding her)
