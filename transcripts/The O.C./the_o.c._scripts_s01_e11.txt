 Opening scene - The Cohen's kitchen. Sandy, Kirsten, Seth & Ryan are in there, and there is food everywhere! Kirsten is looking at recipes which Seth isn't happy about, lol  
 Seth: (to Kirsten) mom-mom no-no recipes, put them away!  
 Kirsten: (ignoring him) this is Ryan's first thanksgiving in the house and we're gonna make this meal as a family  
 Seth: (following her) ah-ha ok seriously where's Rosa  
 Kirsten: no Rosa, just us. I for one-am ready-for this challenge  
 Seth: dad the take out menus  
 Kirsten: Sandy!  
 Sandy: (sighs) you sure you wanna do this honey  
 Seth: mom no (desperate) NO we're not ruining thanksgiving  
 Kirsten: who said we are?  
 Seth: I wait for this event every year mom, please thanksgiving is my favourite it's my favourite holiday, everyone knows this  
 Ryan: my...family was never really into the holidays  
 Kirsten: all the more reason to make this special... (unsure) are there pans, are there any pans anywhere  
 Sandy: not inspiring alotta confidence darling  
 Seth: do you know what I dream about when I dream about thanksgiving which is-which is often (dramatic) I dream about eating SO much deliciousness that all the blood rushes to my stomach and I pass out at the table (hits the table) please don't deny me that!  
 Ryan: (looks at him) that's just weird  
 Kirsten: (with a pot in her hand) well I guess we should start with the turkey...uh...um (unsure) do I...uh (grabs the turkeys legs and lifts it)  
 Sandy: (to Seth) aww that's just how she held you as a baby  
 Kirsten: (looks at him) Sandy! um I guess we should just um start...basting?  
 (Seth gives Sandy a 'do something' look)  
 Sandy: I'll tell you what, I'll baste  
 Seth: that's a good idea  
 Kirsten: well, are you-are you sure  
 Sandy: (pushing her out of the way) oh I love to baste you know that  
 Kirsten: ok well next up is cranberries  
 Ryan: (panics) uhhh I got it, big fan of the cranberry  
 Kirsten: well then, I'll peel the potatoes  
 Seth: (panics) no I've got it there's few things as therapeutic (bumping her out of the way) as peeling a potato, I'm sorry  
 Kirsten: (lost) so, what am I suppose to do?  
 Sandy: set the table!  
 Seth: yeah setting the tables important  
 (phone rings)  
 Kirsten: how bout I get the phone  
 Seth: or you can answer the phone, its not gonna answer itself  
 Sandy: you own the phone  
 Kirsten: (picks up) hello...yeah I'll accept the charges...uh yeah he's uh he's right here, hol-hold on a second, uh Ryan it's your brother  
 (Sandy, Seth & Ryan all look suprised)  
 Ryan: (looks up) (takes the phone) I'm just gunoo ah (walks out of the kitchen)  
 Seth: ok  
 Kirsten: (whispers) he's uh-he's calling from jail  
 Sandy: well he's gonna be there for a while he's got an impressive record  
 Seth: hey did you ever meet him?  
 Sandy: (shakes head) no  
 Kirsten: it's just that I've gotten use to Ryan in the family, you jus you kinda forget that he has one of his own  
 CUT TO: Ryan sitting on the stairs, talking on the phone  
 Ryan: (sighs) hey bro...good you? what today its-its thanksgiving Trey...no yeah I know its ben a long time its jus... (sorry can't get this bit)... (sighs) ok...nah I wanna see you too...its ben - too long so...you too, bye (Ryan hangs up and goes back in the kitchen)

 Kirsten: so are you uh...are you gonna go?  
 Ryan: well it's only an hour away um I could help out here, go down be back by dinner  
 Sandy: well great, that'll be great...get to see your brother (Ryan sort of smiles, he looks unsure)  
 Theme Song - California by Phantom Planet  
 Still in the Cohen kitchen, but now its just Seth & Ryan by themselves  
 Seth: (frowning) people actually make stuffing  
 Ryan: what'd you think?  
 Seth: I didn't...so you should probably be headin out soon  
 Ryan: uh I gotta finish the stuffing, then there's the gravy and the candied yams  
 Seth: yeah and if you find enough cooking to last three to five years then Trey'll be out  
 Ryan: (sighs) he's just gonna want something from me favor, money  
 Seth: hey maybe not though maybe he just wants to see his family on thanksgiving  
 Ryan: (half laughs) you don't know Trey  
 Seth: I know we never talk about him  
 Ryan: well not alot to talk about  
 Seth: well...he's your brother (Ryan looks at him) but if you want I'll-I'll go with you I'd like to meet him  
 Ryan: nah you wouldn't  
 Seth: well legally, Ryan we're all like brothers now so I-I  
 Ryan: well someone's gonna have to keep your mom away from the food (raises his eyebrows)...besides you've got Anna coming over  
 Seth: yes I do (smiles)  
 CUT TO: Kirsten & Sandy out the back, Sandy appears to be cooking on the grill  
 Kirsten: you think Ryan's ok?  
 Sandy: I think he'll be ok...I mean he needs to do this  
 Kirsten: ok (getting down from the bench) let me get in there do some flipping (grabs the tongs)  
 Sandy: oh, oh no honey honey (using his arm to stop her getting close) Seth really likes corn  
 Kirsten: how do you expect me to get better?  
 Sandy: I don't I-I'm sorry but the boys an I made a pact  
 Kirsten: (suprised) a pact?  
 Sandy: a solemn promise  
 Kirsten: when!  
 Sandy: you were in the bathroom (Kirsten is shocked) look I am all for you expanding your horizons but not today we have guest who-who-who expect that food'll actually be served  
 Kirsten: speaking of which, did you tell Rachel about Jimmy?  
 Sandy: no did you tell Jimmy about Rachel  
 Kirsten: no he's freaked out enough (sighs) first thanksgiving without his wife  
 Sandy: well I bet he'll have less indigestion this year, unlike your father who will probably be in agony  
 Kirsten: (laughs) I can't believe he is having thanksgiving with Julie Cooper (slightly hurt) cause he's never had it with us  
 Sandy: uh no complaint here  
 (Seth comes to the back door & sees Kirsten near the grill)  
 Seth: mom come on, your uncomfortably close to the corn right now, please can we back up a little bit (Kirsten looks at him, Sandy laughs)  
 CUT TO: Jimmy's house. Marissa & Jimmy are there  
 Marissa: I should've just gone with Caitlyn to grandmas...cause I really don't wanna go to moms

 Marissa: he's dating mom!  
 Jimmy: I'm-I'm-I'm I'm well aware  
 Marissa: well isn't that weird for you  
 Jimmy: look your mom is...shes-shes movin on, but you know what I got news for ya so's your dad  
 Marissa: (big smile) really?  
 Jimmy: well not exactly I mean y'know there's the fraud charges and the whole (sigh) bankruptcy thing an I don't even have a job so I'm not exactly a catch but uh...feel free to disagree (Marissa looks at him) look I know its weird alright, but your mom is still...your mom...she loves you  
 Marissa: (gives him a 'please' look) mm-hmm...come on (walks out)  
 CUT TO: Seth in his room, Ryan comes in  
 Ryan: hey, I've gotta get on the road  
 Seth: (going through a drawer) alright just give me one sec  
 Ryan: Trey doesn't even read comics  
 Seth: (closing the drawer and standing) yeah he doesn't yet but that's because he hasn't seen the new Titans (hands it to Ryan)  
 Ryan: (looking) Titans? (holds it out to Seth) what about Legion that was kinda cooler  
 Seth: the guy is in prison man have you seen Oz I'm sure that'll be fine (Ryan still holding the comic out) but yeah the new Legion is cooler  
 (Ryan walks over to Seth's drawers and picks up what looks like perfume. he sprays it in the air several times & coughs)  
 Seth: hey-hey-hey-hey (hits him with the comic) easy on my adieu toilette please  
 Ryan: (puts it back) since when did you start wearin cologne  
 Seth: (fake offence) I'm-I'm-I'm sorry for tryin'a step it up a notch (Ryan looks at him) since today

 Seth: (giving in) ok I need t-I need to ask your advice on something but you have to promise me ok you have to promise me that you will not tell anybody ok  
 Ryan: (puts his hand up) promise  
 Seth: promise  
 Ryan: promise!  
 Seth: the other night on my grandfathers yacht Summer attacked me with her lips (Ryan is suprised) and she swore if I told anyone she would kill me, and she's got a interesting take on romance  
 Ryan: yeah  
 Seth: yeah so the first sixteen years of my life I have no woman, now I have two  
 Ryan: (sarcastically) yeah yeah I feel really bad for you  
 Seth: oh, hey thanks buddy  
 Ryan: no seriously man tough, tough problem to have (smirking)

 Summer: what? do I have lipstick on my mouth?  
 Seth: no uh no (kisses her) (stops again)  
 Summer: what (laughs)  
 Seth: (laughs, and stares like he can't believe he's kissing her) this is happening (kisses her again)

 Seth: (falls on the floor) ahh ooow  
 Summer: no you know what th-this cant be happening  
 Seth: yes it can come on it just was I was just expressing awe and delight which now will be replaced with a severe bruise on my ass  
 Summer: ok I need to think, or eat something I'm feeling a little headed, can we go inside  
 Seth: no actually um I think that its best then (doing up his shirt) if I go inside because I'm the host an I-I bring food to you cause your the guest an I think that's really the most polite thing to do, also you probably don't wanna go in there right now cause my moms cooking and that's something that-that nobody should witness and plus my dad is wearing an apron so that also falls into the same category and my grandpas talkin about politics in there and (getting faster, puts on his vest) nobody likes politics not when he talks about it he's very intense and you don't wanna get all tensed out right now so stay here where the relaxation is, I'll be right back (leaves)  
 (Summer sighs, and looks kinda sad)  
 CUT TO: Julie & Jimmy talking in the kitchen. Kirsten, Sandy, Rachel & Caleb are also there  
 Julie: this is your fault because you allowed her to go with Ryan  
 Jimmy: I had no idea she was doing this  
 Julie: well that's encouraging  
 Caleb: what sort of a father doesn't know what his daughter is up to?  
 Kirsten: oh you're not serious!  
 Caleb: I may be alot of things but never a bad parent  
 Sandy: destroyer of the environment  
 Rachel: tyrannical land baron  
 Julie: (to Rachel) you stay out of this I don't even know what you're doing here  
 Kirsten: (drunk) oh she's our guest, unlike some people  
 Julie: oh so suddenly you have standards about who you let into this house  
 Kirsten: what'does that mean  
 Julie: Marissa wouldn't be in Chino if she hadn't met someone from Chino  
 Sandy: Ryan's not the problem  
 Caleb: your right it's the over zealous tree hugger that brought him in  
 Julie: or the irresponsible parent whose to busy tryin'a get laid on thanksgiving  
 Jimmy: well excuse me for making up for lost time  
 Rachel: well excuse me  
 Jimmy: sorry I was...heat of passion  
 Julie: don't expect that to happen very often  
 Sandy: oh people please feel free to share

 CUT TO: Seth's room. he goes back in to see Anna  
 Seth: (leaning against the wall) hey Anna, what's up

 Seth: it's gettin a little weird in here  
 Anna: (sitting up) well you left me alone for so long I guess I was going a little...crazy  
 (they lay back on his bed, Seth is on top of Anna)

 Anna: (laughs) I got it (helping him pull it off)  
 (it gets stuck and Seth ends up falling on the floor)  
 Anna: oooh Seth  
 Seth: (laying there with the vest over his head) ok that's two bruises today  
 Anna: (frowns) two?  
 Seth: (getting up) yeah the first one was from cooking (putting the vest back on properly) sweet potatoes just aren't as sweet as they use to be anymore speaking of which I have left them un-attended I'm very neglectful so I'll be right back and uh what is that captain oats, he wants a rematch, do that (rushes out)

 Ryan: what the hell are you doin?  
 Marissa: I followed you
