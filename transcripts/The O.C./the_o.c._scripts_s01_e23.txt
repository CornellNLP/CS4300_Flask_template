 Opening scene - Cohen backyard - Ryan and Luke are walking to the pool house. this is set the morning after Marissa ran out of the pool house upset  
 Ryan: (sighs) think, where else could she be  
 Luke: (sighs) (shrugs) I don't know...man we've ben all over town twice...i'm sorry I jus don't know what to do at this point  
 Ryan: we're not givin up we jus gotta figure this thing out (Luke looks at him) alright when she left she was upset so she probably went somewhere she was-she was she would feel safe right  
 Luke: yeah well somewhere no ones even gonna think to look for her  
 Ryan: including us apparently  
 Luke: (sighs) well maybe she called, where's Cohen  
 (they are now entering the pool house)  
 Ryan: yeah maybe she called an he went after...her  
 (we see Seth curled up on Ryan's bed sound asleep)  
 Luke: maybe he's asleep, hey Cohen (kicks Seth) get up!  
 (Seth jumps awake)  
 Seth: it's my precious you can't have it (Ryan & Luke both look at him) hey what's wrong  
 Luke: you were asleep that's what's wrong  
 Seth: I was adjusting my back (Luke looks at him)  
 Ryan: did Marissa call?  
 Seth: no man I would'a heard the phone ringing even if I was sleeping (grabs for the phone) which I wasn't, I was adjusting my back (looks at the phone) there's a missed call though which is weird c (Ryan snatches the phone from him) ok  
 Luke: meanwhile Ryan an I are drivin round all night like idiots  
 Seth: really? well none'a this would'a happened in the first place if it wasn't for you  
 Luke: shut up Cohen, it was an accident  
 Seth: i'm sorry did you accidentally sleep with Marissa's mom, or did you accidentally tell Marissa about it  
 Luke: i'm in no mood Cohen  
 Seth: good keep it in your board shorts next time, y'know what I mean  
 Ryan: (hangs up) that was her  
 Seth: what'did she say  
 (we see Julie coming towards the pool house in the background)  
 Ryan: uh not much just that she's ok an not to try ta follow her  
 Julie: where is she?  
 Ryan: she's not here  
 Julie: (walks in) why don't I believe you...Luke  
 (Julie looks at Luke, Luke looks at Seth, Seth looks at Julie)  
 Julie: what's goin on in here?  
 Ryan: Marissa took off last night when we got back from L.A, she-she ran away  
 Julie: why what'did you do to her  
 Ryan: I didn't do anything you did  
 Julie: what're you talking about?  
 Luke: they know  
 Julie: shut up Luke  
 Luke: they saw us outside the motel...Marissa knows to (Seth nods)  
 (awkward silence)  
 Julie: will you boys excuse us please, Ryan an I need ta have a talk  
 (Seth and Luke leave)  
 Julie: whatever you think you know about me  
 Ryan: I don't care about you, I jus wanna get her back home safe  
 Julie: (worried) you really don't know where she is  
 Ryan: we know she's ok, she left a message saying not to look for her  
 Julie: so what am I suppose to do, last time she took off she almost died...i'm gonna call the police  
 Ryan: yeah what're ya gonna tell em when they ask why she left  
 Julie: I have to at least call her doctors  
 Ryan: why so you can try'ta have her locked up again  
 Julie: if that's what it takes yes, I will not have her hurting herself anymore  
 Ryan: (moves closer to her) maybe you should'a thought'a that before you slept with her ex-boyfriend  
 Julie: (glares at him) I would love to stay an chat with you Ryan but I have'ta find my daughter (leaves)  
 Ryan: not if I find her first
