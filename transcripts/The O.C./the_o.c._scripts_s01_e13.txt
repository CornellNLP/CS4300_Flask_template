 Scene opens to Seth staring at Ryan intently, holding up a candy cane and a menorah.  
 Seth: So, what's it going to be, huh? You want your menorah or a  
 candy cane, hmm? Christmas or Hanukkah?  
 Ryan: Um… I'm not-  
 Seth: Ah! Don't worry about it buddy, because in this house, you  
 don't have to choose. Allow me to introduce to you a little  
 something that I like to call… Chrismukkah.  
 Ryan: Chrismukkah?  
 Seth: That's right. It's the new holiday, Ryan, and it's sweeping  
 the nation.  
 Sandy and Kirsten walk in, carrying a Christmas tree.  
 Sandy: Hey fellows. We go the tree.  
 Seth: Or atleast the living room.  
 Sandy: Guys, a little help?  
 Ryan walks over to help Sandy.  
 Seth: I saved a spot for you right there. Put your muscle into it.  
 Excellent. To the right a little. To the right, don't hurt it. Those  
 needles are brittle. That's perfect. (Starts clapping) You guys… you  
 guys… "A+". "A+". I love the holidays. I love them all.  
 Kirsten: We didn't really know how to raise Seth.  
 Seth: Yeah, so I raised myself, and in doing so, I created the  
 greatest super holiday known to mankind, drawing on the best that  
 Christianity and Judaism have to offer.  
 Ryan: And you call it Chrismukkah.  
 Seth: (He gasps) Just hearing you say it makes me feel all festive.  
 Allow me to elaborate.  
 He walks over to Sandy.  
 Seth: You see, for my father here, a poor struggling Jew growing up  
 in the Bronx, well, Christmas meant Chinese food and a movie.  
 He now walks over to Kirsten.  
 Seth: And for my mom over here – WASPy McWASP – well, it meant a  
 tree, it meant stockings and all the trimmings. Isn't that right?  
 Sandy: We're very proud.  
 Kirsten: I'm not a WASP.  
 Seth: Sure, you're not. Other highlights include eight days of  
 presents followed by one day of many presents. So, what do you think?  
 Ryan: Uh, sounds great for you guys.  
 Sandy: For you, too.  
 Seth: Hey, dip a toe in the Chrismukkah pool. There's room for all  
 of us.  
 Kirsten: Isn't there something in the Atwood family tradition that  
 you would like to incorporate into Seth's uber holiday?  
 Ryan: Atwood and holidays is not a good combination.  
 Sandy: What did you guys do?  
 Ryan: No, seriously, thanks, but uh…  
 Seth: Come on, man. There's got to be something.  
 Ryan: My holiday memories pretty much consist of my mom drunk and me  
 getting my ass kicked.  
 Seth and Kirsten fall silent.  
 Sandy: Well, this year will be entirely different.  
 Kirsten: New memories. It'll be great.  
 Ryan: Yeah. Well, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  
 Seth: That's the spirit. Come here.  
 Seth holds his arms open for a hug as Ryan walks right past him.  
 Seth: Oy, humbug.  
 Kirsten: It's a big holiday for anyone.  
 Sandy: Yeah, I'm still wrapping my head around it. Just give him  
 some time.  
 Kirsten: Why don't we trim the tree?  
 Seth: You know what, you guys? Soon, Ryan will learn the magic of  
 Chrismukkah. Worry not. I will convert him.  
 Seth closes his eyes and rings a little bell.  
 Opening credits.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Open to Seth sitting on a bed in the pool house, surrounded by  
 wrapping paper and other things. Ryan walks in.  
 Ryan: I was in the shower for five minutes. How did this place turn  
 into Santa's workshop?  
 Seth: I see someone took down the wreath I hung on the door.  
 Ryan: It fell. What are you wrapping?  
 Seth: Two Seth Cohen starter packs. We got Death cab, we got Bright  
 Eyes, we got The Shins, we got Cavelier and Klay, and we got  
 Goonies. It's not just for kids, Ryan. It's not. I don't care what  
 they tell you. Summer and Anna are going to love them both equally.  
 Ryan: You're getting Summer and Anna the same thing?  
 Seth: Yes, I am. Sometimes I'm so crafty, I surprise myself.  
 Ryan: No good can come of this. You know that, right?  
 Seth: Uh, nope, I don't.  
 Ryan: You're going to have to choose, man.  
 Seth: Hey, not on Chrismukkah I don't, okay? There's no choosing in  
 Chrismukkah.  
 Ryan: Well, you didn't get me anything, right?  
 Seth: No.  
 Seth turns away from Ryan and starts whistling tunelessly. Ryan  
 gives him a look.  
 Seth: Come on, man. Lighten up.  
 Ryan continues to look at him.  
 Seth: Okay, fine. Stay dark. Dark works, too.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Kirsten is writing on a notepad in the kitchen as Ryan and Seth walk  
 in, the latter of the two whistling.  
 Kirsten: Oh, Ryan, what is your show size?  
 Ryan: Why?  
 Kirsten: No reason.  
 Seth: Mother, might that be a Chrismukkah list?  
 Kirsten: No. Why do you ask?  
 Seth: Okay. Let me just see it then, real fast.  
 Kirsten: It's work.  
 Seth: Okay, I love your work. It fascinates me.  
 Ryan: I thought you guys said no gifts.  
 Kirsten: Well, we did, as in no gifts for us.  
 Sandy walks in, having just finished talking on his cell phone.  
 Sandy: Well, Chrismukkah's ruined.  
 Seth: Ah! Don't even say it, man. Come on. Chrismukkah is  
 unruinable. It's got twice the resistance of any normal holiday.  
 Sandy: Your father just refused out latest settlement offer. He  
 wants to go to trial.  
 Kirsten: That's not what he said yesterday. He said that if you met  
 his offer…  
 Sandy: Yeah, well as of this morning, Ebenezer Scrooge decides he  
 wants to go to court, which means I'm going to have to spend the  
 holidays going through file boxes and preparing for trail. With  
 Rachel out of town…  
 Kirsten: Chrismukkah is ruined. Sooner or later, we will get through  
 a holiday around here.  
 Seth: Stop it, right now, okay? Don't give up on the miracle that is  
 Chrismukkah. What is happening to you…? You'll see. You'll see, too.  
 You'll all see. You'll all see.  
 He sips at his drink.  
 Ryan: You're really starting to scare me.  
 Seth: I'm okay with that.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Jimmy comes bounding down the stairs to where Marissa is in the  
 living room.  
 Jimmy: Okey dokey, here we go. Which tie? What are you thinking?  
 This one? All right? Or…  
 He holds each tie up to him.  
 Marissa: Uh, the second one, definitely.  
 Jimmy: All right.  
 He starts to put on the tie.  
 Marissa: So, you have a job interview today?  
 Jimmy: Well, it's just a meet-and-greet. Who knows what will come of  
 it, but we've got to dress for success, right? Look, I'm working on  
 it, kiddo. I'll find a job. I know there's a lot of extra pressure  
 around the holidays.  
 Marissa: There doesn't have to be any extra pressure because there  
 doesn't have to be any holidays. Really.  
 Jimmy: What are you talking about?  
 Marissa: We can skip Christmas. I mean, it's not like it's not going  
 to happen again next year, and holidays just make people depressed.  
 Jimmy: Are you? Depressed? I mean you were supposed to go to therapy  
 after Mexico, and you never really…  
 Marissa: I'm great. I'm just saying.  
 Jimmy: Ok, good, because we're not skipping Christmas. Come on. I'm  
 going to find a job, we're going to figure out a way to make this  
 whole thing work, and we're going to have lots to celebrate about,  
 okay? Come on, skipping Christmas. You sure about this tie?  
 Marissa: Yeah, definitely. You look great.  
 He walks upstairs.  
 Jimmy: Skipping Christmas – what are you, the Grinch?  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Ryan and Seth are walking through the halls of school together.  
 Ryan: So, Summer and Anna are both coming to this party.  
 Seth: Yeah, but neither one's my date.  
 Ryan: And they know?  
 Seth: Oh yeah. They both know that. Come on, man, relax. Look, it's  
 a big party, okay? You might be all doom and gloom, but me, check it  
 out: I'm snowflakes. I'm latkes. Chrismukkah is coming.  
 Ryan: And when Chrismukkah ends?  
 Seth: (He gasps) I hate when Chrismukkah ends.  
 Summer: Cohen. Hi, Ryan. Um, I wanted to know what the deal was for  
 tonight – if you were driving…  
 Anna: Hey, Seth. So, what time are you thinking for tonight? (She  
 sees Summer.) Oh. Hey, Summer.  
 Summer: Hey, Anna.  
 Seth: You guys. I was thinking we should all probably meet there.  
 How about that? At whatever time you so choose to get there, by  
 whatever means.  
 Summer: Sounds great.  
 Anna: Yeah, perfect.  
 Both girls walk away.  
 Ryan: You better pray for a Chrismukkah miracle.  
 Ryan walks away.  
 Seth: I've got Jesus and Moses on my side, man.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 We look down from the top of a white Christmas tree to see Julie  
 standing by. Caleb's house. Julie is giving the guys orders on how  
 the tree should look when Kirsten walks up to stand beside her.  
 Julie: Hey, Kirsten. What do you think?  
 Kirsten: It's really something.  
 Julie: You don't like it?  
 Kirsten: It's not that. It's just that… my mom used to put the  
 Christmas tree in the foyer. It's just a tradition that we have.  
 Julie: Yeah, Caleb told me. But then I thought you know what? The  
 holidays are hard enough. Your father doesn't need to be reminded of  
 the past. Caleb needs to enjoy this Christmas. Oh, and did Caleb  
 tell you we need to borrow your office? We're doing the Santa thing  
 for the kids, and we need a holding area for the elves. What are you  
 doing here? Your father said you were working from home.  
 Kirsten: He did? He's just full of surprises.  
 She walks away.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Caleb and Kirsten walk into a room.  
 Caleb: I changed my mind. If the land trust can come up with $200  
 million, then surely they can come up with $300 million.  
 Kirsten: I just… I thought this was over.  
 Caleb: You can always get a little more blood out of the stone.  
 Kirsten: But the stone is my husband.  
 Caleb: Well, I was thinking we could spend the holidays working.  
 Kirsten: That sounds good. You have fun.  
 Caleb: What are you talking about?  
 Kirsten: I'm going to do something that I haven't done in… ever. I'm  
 taking Christmas vacation.  
 Caleb: Don't be ridiculous, Kiki. You hate sitting around the house.  
 Kirsten: Well, not as much as I hate fighting with you. So you spend  
 the next two weeks buried in legal documents. I'm going to be  
 wrapping gifts.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Marissa and Ryan walk through a hall at school, up to Marissa's  
 locker.  
 Marissa: I hate Christmas.  
 Ryan: Yeah, well Christmukkah's not much better. You don't want to  
 know. Yeah, but holidays make what's bad even worse.  
 Marissa: I just wish my dad would drop the act. I don't need it. And  
 I don't need Christmas.  
 Ryan: Who do you have to spend it with?  
 Marissa: Christmas Eve with my dad, Christmas day with my mom. Plus,  
 she's making me go to this stupid Newport Group holiday party  
 tonight.  
 Ryan: The Cohen's are going too, so…  
 Marissa: So, at least we'll be miserable together.  
 Ryan: Deal?  
 Marissa: Deal. So, am I seeing you after school?  
 Ryan: I got some stuff to do… some shopping. South Coast Plaza.  
 Marissa: You're going to South Coast Plaza? Alone? I don't think  
 you're ready for that. No, I think you need a seasoned expert to  
 protect you.  
 Ryan: Well, you know someone?  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Marissa and Ryan travel up the escalator and they make their way  
 around the mall, going into various shops. Marissa tries on lipstick  
 and shoes, while Ryan looks at a watch at the glass counter.  
 Ryan: So no luck, huh?  
 Marissa: There's a 99-cent store down the street. I guess I can't  
 really afford this place anymore.  
 Ryan: Then why did we come?  
 Marissa: I know it sounds stupid, but I like it here. Everything is  
 so perfect. You walk around feeling like all your problems can be  
 solved by the right nail polish or a new pair of shoes.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Marissa and Ryan walk through the parking garage to Marissa's car.  
 When she gets to the driver's side, a security guard grabs her arm.  
 Guard: Miss. I'm going to have to ask to see your purse.  
 Ryan: What are you doing?  
 Guard: I can't let you leave the premises. If you don't hand over  
 your purse right now, you'll give me no choice but to call the  
 police.  
 Ryan: Why don't you just back off, all right?  
 Marissa: Ryan, it's okay.  
 Ryan: No, it's not.  
 Guard: Your purse. Now.  
 She slowly hands her purse to him. He empties it out on the hood of  
 her car, and a cell phone, watch, earrings, and a few other things  
 fall out. Ryan looks to Marissa, who nervously looks back at him.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Two presents sit on the table in front of Kirsten, who is looking  
 over some papers from work.  
 Seth: Hey, what are you doing? Working from home?  
 Kirsten: I'm on vacation.  
 Seth: Ah, yes, clearly.  
 Kirsten: I find reviewing end-of-the-year accounts to be very  
 relaxing.  
 Seth: I hope that's a recessive gene.  
 Kirsten: You should be so lucky. Look, I haven't taken a vacation in  
 a while, and I'm… easing into it.  
 Seth: Oh, yeah. I don't judge, okay? I only mock.  
 Kirsten: That you get from your father.  
 Seth: Oh, my God. They're coming in?  
 He checks his eyebrows.  
 Seth: Oh, that's… I got you. (He sees the presents) What are those?  
 Kirsten: They came for Ryan from his mom and his brother.  
 Seth: You know what he said about the holidays? When he talks like  
 that, I have… I have no idea what to say.  
 Kirsten: Me, neither. You just have to be yourself.  
 Seth: Yeah, ‘cause that always works so well.  
 Kirsten: Well, being a family is hard under any circumstance.  
 Creating a new one —that's got to feel weird sometimes.  
 Seth: Well, feeling weird is right in my…  
 Kirsten studies something on a sheet of paper.  
 Seth: What? What is it? Is Grandpa going crazy with the company  
 credit card again? What is it this time? Hookers? A little blow,  
 perhaps? Grandpa likes to dance with you, white lady.  
 Kirsten: (Smiling) What are you talking about?  
 Seth: I don't know. What is it?  
 Kirsten: Hopefully, it's nothing. You should go get ready, ‘cause we  
 have to be there soon.  
 Seth: I'll go put on my face.  
 He walks away. Kirsten takes out her phone and dials a number.  
 Kirsten: Hi. This is Kirsten Cohen from the Newport Group. My father  
 ordered a survey of the Balboa Heights, and I've lost my copy, and I  
 really need to see the document, so I'm wondering if it's possible  
 for you to fax it over to me.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Jimmy and Marissa are sitting in their living room, talking. Julie  
 walks through the front door, angry.  
 Julie: I cannot believe this. Marissa.  
 Jimmy: Julie.  
 Julie: Look, I have to host the most important event of my  
 professional career tonight.  
 Jimmy: Well, atleast your priorities are in order.  
 Julie: You know, it's amazing how all these calamities keep  
 happening under your watch, Jimmy.  
 Jimmy: Oh, so I'm to blame for this one, too?  
 Julie: Where do you think she learned to steal?  
 Marissa: Okay, stop it. I'm the one who stole, remember? I'm the one  
 to blame, not Dad.  
 Jimmy: Look, we're lucky the store is not pressing charges. Okay?  
 Now, Marissa and I were just trying to decide what an appropriate  
 punishment…  
 Julie: Oh, really? Well, way to rule with the iron fist, Stalin, but  
 it's not up to her. No car, no allowance, no weekends.  
 Marissa: So I can stay home tonight?  
 Julie: Starting tomorrow. I won't have my party ruined by your  
 little sticky fingers. Look, sweetie, I know that this time of year  
 makes everything bad seem worse, but why did you do this?  
 Marissa: I thought it would be… Look, I wasn't… it was stupid.  
 Julie: Well, I called the therapist on the way over here.  
 Marissa: Mom.  
 Jimmy: She's right, kiddo. Therapy was part of the deal of you  
 moving in here.  
 Marissa: Okay, look, I've been doing way better since Mexico. 4.0  
 first quarter, Charity League, Social Chair…  
 Julie: I've scheduled you an appointment tomorrow morning with Dr.  
 Milano. He's supposed to be great.  
 Marissa: I'm sorry, but I can handle it. This. I… I won't do it  
 again, I promise.  
 Julie: Honey, I love you. But I don't believe you.  
 Jimmy: You might actually find it helpful.  
 Marissa: Yeah. Whatever. I need to get ready.  
 She walks toward the stairs.  
 Marissa: And Mom, you have your big party to throw. I'm sure you  
 don't want to keep Caleb waiting.  
 She goes upstairs.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Seth knocks on the door of the pool house, where Ryan is just  
 finishing getting dressed.  
 Seth: Hey. What's up, man? You're back. So, that's pretty cool,  
 right? Your mom and brother got you something.  
 Ryan: Yeah, except now I have a total of eight gifts to buy, and I  
 only saved enough for one.  
 Seth: Ryan, that sort of reminds me of the story of Hanukkah, dude.  
 Check it out. The lamp. You know what? I think you get the gist. How  
 was the mall?  
 Ryan: Weird.  
 Seth: Yes. You've really painted a picture for me. I feel like I was  
 there.  
 Ryan: Marissa picked up a few things without paying for them.  
 Seth: What, as in…  
 Ryan: Shoplifting.  
 Seth's mouth opens in shock.  
 Ryan: Yeah.  
 Seth: Yeah, that's weird.  
 Ryan: It's that time of year, and with everything that's going on  
 with her family…  
 Seth: Yeah, no, no. I'm sure it's got to be hard for her.  
 Ryan: Yeah. I just wish there was something I could do or say.  
 Seth: Um… Oh, I got you something.  
 Ryan: No, no, no. We had an agreement.  
 Seth: Yeah, but this is different. This is a requirement.  
 Seth pulls out a red stocking with Ryan's name on it in white  
 letters.  
 Seth: I know, it's a bit minty, but uh… you know, we all have one,  
 so we just thought...  
 Ryan: No. That's cool.  
 Seth: Well, good. Maybe it'll meet a kinder fate than your wreath  
 did, but if not, we still wanted you to have it.  
 Ryan: (Smiling slightly) Thanks.  
 Seth: All right. I'm going to go make magic happen. I feel like my  
 hair is working for me tonight.  
 Seth leaves the room as Ryan continues to stare at his stocking.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Kirsten is sitting at a desk in her bedroom, with a sheet of paper  
 and a flute of champagne before her. She's already dressed for the  
 party as Sandy comes jogging in.  
 Sandy: I'm late. I know, I know. I'll hurry.  
 He kisses her on the forehead and proceeds to get dressed for the  
 party himself.  
 Sandy: So, you're not going to believe this, but your father and I  
 reached a settlement today. He gouged me a little. Well, you know,  
 he gouged me a lot.  
 Kirsten: He asked you for more money?  
 Sandy: Oh, just $250 million. But we closed the deal, and he claims  
 that he did it because of you.  
 Kirsten: Is that what he told you?  
 Sandy: And it seems your little vacation today really hit him hard.  
 Because he says he wants to spend the holidays as a family. You  
 know, maybe… maybe he's changing. Or maybe he is a truly fantastic  
 liar. What's wrong?  
 Kirsten: I found something today. And I don't know if I can give it  
 to you, but I don't know if I can't.  
 Sandy: Okay, well…  
 Kirsten: He's going to know that I gave this to you. And he's going  
 to have every right to fire me.  
 She pushes the paper closer to him and he takes it and reads it.  
 Sandy: You have got to be kidding me. This changes everything.  
 Kirsten: And I'm going to have to learn how to relax, because I'm  
 going to have a lot of free time.  
 Sandy: I'm sorry, honey.  
 Kirsten: Not as sorry as he's going to be.  
 Sandy: You still want to go to the party?  
 Kirsten: I wouldn't miss it for the world.  
 She leaves as he sits down and stares at the paper.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Seth comes down the stairs as the doorbell rings. He answers it.  
 Seth: Anna. Hey.  
 Anna: Mistletoe.  
 She holds up a piece of mistletoe and kisses him on the cheek.  
 Seth: Oh. Oh, that's very festive of you. Uh, I thought we were  
 meeting there. I'm going with my parents.  
 Anna: Well, I was thinking maybe we could go together.  
 Seth: I would love to do that. You know I would. But don't you think  
 that would violate our little Geneva Convention of dating we have  
 going on? ‘Cause I told Summer that, you know, I'd meet both of you  
 there.  
 Anna: Well, how is Summer ever going to know?  
 The doorbell rings again and Seth answers it.  
 Summer: Mistletoe. What is she doing here?  
 Anna: What are you doing here?  
 Summer: I thought we had a deal, Cohen.  
 Anna: Which you clearly violated.  
 Summer: As did you.  
 Seth: She's got a point.  
 Anna: You're on her side?  
 Seth: No. There are no sides, you guys. There's only um… rides with  
 my parents. We'll all go together. Hmm?  
 Anna: Fine.  
 Summer: Fine.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Seth, Summer, and Anna all sit on the couch, Seth stuck in the  
 middle, all three clearly uncomfortable.  
 Anna: So, I have a gift for you. I'll give it to you later.  
 Summer: I have a present for you, too, also. I'll give it to you  
 later.  
 Seth: (To Summer) I can't wait. (To Anna) For either. (To Summer)  
 For both.  
 Sandy: Seth, you ready? Come on. Let's go.  
 Sandy and Kirsten walk in to see the three on the couch.  
 Kirsten: Hi, Summer. Anna.  
 Sandy: Ladies. (To Kirsten) Oh, this is going to be some party.  
 Kirsten: Mm-hmm.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Ryan is standing behind Marissa, helping her with her necklace.  
 Ryan: You know, maybe this is not such a bad idea.  
 Marissa: What does that mean?  
 Ryan: It'll be good to have someone to talk to.  
 Marissa: You're someone. I can't talk to you?  
 Ryan: You can talk to me. It's just…  
 Marissa: What? I need the help of a trained professional because I  
 stole a lipstick?  
 Ryan: It's not about the lipstick.  
 Marissa: Well, I guess I don't really see what it's about.  
 Ryan: I guess you do what you want.  
 Marissa: I will. If no one's making my parents go to therapy, then  
 no one's making me. You know, I'm the only normal one in this  
 family. Sorry. Hey, you know, I think I left my wrap upstairs. Could  
 you grab it for me? I just need to grab my purse.  
 Ryan: Sure.  
 He leaves to get her wrap. She goes into a cabinet and takes a  
 bottle of alcohol out, stuffing it into her purse.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Sandy, Kirsten, Seth, Anna, and Summer make their way into the  
 party. Sandy and Kirsten leave to go talk to someone they know as a  
 server walks up.  
 Server: Mushroom-leek crescent? Crab and brie phyllo?  
 Seth: Come on, buddy. Change it up a little bit.  
 Server: Enjoy the party.  
 The server walks away.  
 Anna: Come on, Seth. I'm going this way.  
 Seth: Oh.  
 Summer: Oh, well, I'm going this way.  
 She points in the opposite direction as Anna.  
 Seth: Oh, you guys are? I'm going to go look for Ryan.  
 Seth walks forward and away from the girls. Summer and Anna scoff at  
 each other and walk away.  
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*  
 Julie: Kirsten. Sandy. Welcome.  
 Caleb: Hey, Kiki.  
 Kirsten: Hey.  
 Caleb: Good to see you. Did Simon give you our good news?  
 Kirsten: He did.  
 Sandy: I actually need to follow up on a few things with you, Cal.  
 If you don't mind…  
 Caleb: Come, Sanford. It's a party. Think back on your Berkley days.  
 Maybe you can smoke the tree.  
 Caleb walks away.  
 Sandy: (He chuckles) Smoke the tree. Funny. I'm going to nail him  
 now.  
 Kirsten: Uh-huh.  
 Sandy walks off toward Caleb.  
 Julie: So, what do you think?  
 Kirsten: About?  
 Julie: The party. You haven't said anything. Do you like it? I mean,  
 I know how you feel about the tree, but if you can get past that…  
 Kirsten: It's great.  
 Julie: And what did Caleb think? I mean, has he said anything to you?  
 Kirsten: I haven't had a chance to talk to him.  
 Julie: I just want this to be a party that he'll never forget.  
 Kirsten: I think you have a shot.  
 Kirsten walks away.  
 
 
 
 CUT TO: Marissa standing by herself, Ryan walks over and joins her  
 Ryan: you ok?  
 Marissa: yeah, why?  
 Ryan: I don't know today's ben kinda intense an I know you don't really wanna be here  
 Marissa: I wanna be where you are, (smiles) an your here so (kisses him)  
 Julie: (walks over) ah Marissa, oh you wore the chenille how pretty, Ryan (to Marissa) you haven't said hello to Caleb yet  
 Marissa: yeah that's because he was talking to other people mom and I didn't wanna interrupt him  
 Julie: well he's ready now so

 Julie: you are a guest at this party  
 Marissa: only because you made me come here

 Marissa: well then I guess I've got nothin'a lose

 CUT TO: Caleb standing by himself, Sandy goes over to him  
 Sandy: Caleb, you got time to talk?  
 Caleb: nope  
 Sandy: ah come on, make some (pulls out the paper from earlier and gives it to him)  
 Caleb: what is this (reads)  
 Sandy: it's a geological survey of the heights which you commissioned and you somehow mysteriously failed to turn over to my office  
 Caleb: I haven't got time for this  
 Sandy: oh I think you do, allow me to summarise what you know already. the heights are size- malogically unsound, the whole area is uninsurable it's worthless  
 Caleb: as is your theory  
 Sandy: there's no way you would have gotten the building permit...and you knew that  
 Caleb: what'd you want Sandy  
 Sandy: I wanna buy back the heights...for a dollar  
 Caleb: (laughs) you cannot be serious  
 Sandy: (puts the dollar in Caleb's hand) Merry Christmas (walks away)  
 CUT TO: Seth & Anna sitting by some water  
 Anna: huh, so... are you ready for your present?  
 Seth: yeah alright I'm ready, hand me the keys ill figure out how to drive a stick eventually  
 Anna: very funny Seth, always have to ruin the mood  
 Seth: it's what I do  
 Anna: ready  
 Seth: mmhmm  
 (Anna hands him a comic, Seth takes it and you see that it is a handmade comic that says ' the ADVENTURES of SETH COHEN and Capt. Oats!' and there is a drawing of Captains Oats, and Seth - Seth has his mouth open, and Anna is nervously waiting to hear wether he likes it)  
 Seth: the adventures of Seth Cohen & Captain Oats (makes fist) volume 1 confidence (smiles) you made this  
 Anna: no I bought it on eBay  
 Seth: I can't believe you did this, this is amazing (Anna smiles) (reads) hey this Seth in the story seems really handsome and awesome  
 Anna: I guess I took some liberties  
 Seth: you dumbed him down a little bit  
 (they both laugh, and then notice Summer standing on the other side of the way by herself, Anna's smile goes)  
 Seth: this is fantastic  
 Anna: (smiles) thanks  
 (Seth has a huge smile on his face still reading his present)  
 CUT TO: Kirsten & Jimmy dancing together  
 Jimmy: so hows Seth doin  
 Kirsten: he's fine I think, i think it's hard to tell with him sometimes, why?  
 Jimmy: well does he ever do things that sort of... make you question yourself as a-as a parent  
 Kirsten: well there was the model home and Tijuana and a thing with the range rover and an IMAX movie that I didn't quite buy  
 Jimmy: but there kids I mean they-they do...stuff they get in trouble right  
 Kirsten: well our parents would've had a heart attack if they knew half the things that we did (laughs)  
 Jimmy: ah come on we were good kids...we were, weren't we?  
 Kirsten: we were good kids  
 Jimmy: yeah  
 Kirsten: an we have good kids  
 CUT TO: Marissa locking herself in the bathroom. she puts her glass down, goes through her bag and pulls out a bottle of alcohol. she pours some of it into her drink, moves her fringe out of her eyes, then takes 2 big gulps while frowning, puts her fist up to her mouth after swallowing then smiles. she moves her fringe again, looks in the mirror and smiles then takes another gulp  
 CUT TO: Seth & Summer in a room alone. It's dark

 Seth: (smiling & nodding) this is true  
 (Summer unzips her black dress)  
 Summer: Merry Christmas  
 (You see Seth with his mouth wide open, then the camera pans to show that Summer is dressed as wonder woman, complete with gold lasso)  
 Seth: (mouth open) good-lord I think I'm gonna pass out  
 Summer: (throwing the rope over his head) your not going... anywhere (pulls him to her)  
 Seth: ok (they kiss for a second)

 Seth: hold up you guys one second please ok lets not-lets not-lets not have one speed bump derail the whole train ok lets not throw the baby out with the bath water lets not...let's make some more metaphors  
 Summer: look I'm not into talking about like feelings or whatever... (sincerely) but I like you, ok an so does she, if we don't put an end to this soon  
 Anna: someone's gonna get hurt  
 Summer: you gotta choose Cohen  
 (Anna & Summer both leave the room, and turn the light out leaving Seth alone in the dark)  
 CUT TO: Ryan by himself, Marissa grabs his head and kisses him  
 Marissa: (tipsy) did you miss me? c'mon lets dance (grabs him by his tie)  
 Ryan: no you know how I feel about dancing

 Ryan: what's goin on with you today?  
 Marissa: huh what's the big deal, you drink

 Marissa: I'm just having fun  
 Ryan: right, the first night I met you, you were having fun passed out in your drive way, a couple weeks later it was an alley in Mexico, its like- just like my mom all over again

 Marissa: get away from me! (starts to move the car)  
 Ryan: hey, hey (stands in front)  
 Marissa: (brakes) I'm fine  
 (Ryan wont move so Marissa puts it in reverse and backs into a car. she puts her head on the steering wheel, upset. Ryan walks over to her door)  
 CUT TO: Caleb & Sandy making an announcement to a huge crowd  
 Caleb: and so effective immediately I'm transferring the title of the heights to the Balboa land trust for the very reasonable price of one dollar (clapping) and I couldn't have done it without the help of my son-in-law Sandy Cohen  
 Sandy: oh thanks Cal but I can't take credit for this you did this all on your own. to Caleb Nichol the most generous man in Newport Beach (toasts)  
 Caleb: thanks...happy Chanukah Sandy (walks away, Sandy follows)  
 CUT TO: Ryan and Marissa in the car. they both aren't speaking. Marissa pulls the bottle out of her bag  
 Ryan: (looks over and sees) (sighs) great  
 Marissa: what you're driving now  
 Ryan: yeah because you're drunk  
 Marissa: I'm not (Ryan looks at her angry) fine  
 (Marissa tries to put the lid on and it drops on the floor)  
 Marissa: shoot (looking) mm where is it  
 Ryan: come on put it away  
 Marissa: I'm trying  
 Ryan: I'm still on probation  
 Marissa: I SAID I'm trying (still looking)  
 (the sound of a siren, and flashing lights)  
 Ryan: (sigh) of course this is happening  
 (Marissa leans down and puts the open bottle between her feet, then does up her seatbelt. Ryan pulls the car over)  
 Officer: happy holidays, license registration...you got a broken tail light do you know that
