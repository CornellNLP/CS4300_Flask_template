 Opening scene - It opens on a breathtaking view of the water and the coast, then the camera pans quickly along an aerial view lots of houses until finally we are in the Cohen house. Seth is dancing very energetically in his robe & PJ's in the hallway, he makes his way into the kitchen at which point he makes a face, and pretends that he's sick. Sandy & Ryan are both in there  
 Seth: (groans, holds his stomach & touches his head) do I have a fever, I think I might have a fever and or the chills  
 Ryan: (skeptical) since when  
 Seth: since recently  
 Sandy: so you're not feelin well?  
 Seth: (sighs) no I feel fine (really badly fake coughs - lol) (Ryan looks at him) jus my heads a little bit achy and my stomachs kinda weird (holding his stomach) I'm ok  
 Sandy: c'mere (touches Seth's head, Seth turns to face him and swallows really grossly, again Ryan just looks at him with a 'you gotta be kidding' look) huh you don't feel warm  
 Seth: what about cold or clammy (Sandy shakes his head)  
 Ryan: (with his head down) maybe you've got the Summer flu  
 Seth: yeah it's November but it's possible  
 Ryan: maybe you need some (looks at him) Anna-biotics (Ryan raises his eyebrows for emphasis)  
 Sandy: do you not wanna go to school?  
 Seth: (over enthusiastically) NO, no dad no I wanna go to school ok  
 Sandy: ok  
 Seth: (fake concern) I'm jus worried about infecting others  
 Sandy: no you're right we can't take a chance we should just take you straight to the emergency room, just to be sure  
 Seth: (sighs) ok...or I could stay home an-an try an sleep it off  
 Ryan: or you could go to school face Summer an Anna (raises eyebrows) an apologise!  
 (Sandy is smiling)  
 Seth: first of all ah no second of all hmm no, why would I?  
 Sandy: (wide eyed) oh... the SUMMER flu, I just...got it (patting Ryan on the shoulder) that was good  
 Seth: ok look it's not my fault that they both tried to kiss me on thanksgiving (defensively) what was I supposed to do ah not kiss back, say no stop risk hurting their feelings  
 Sandy: well it seems to me you already did hurt their feelings  
 Seth: yeah perhaps I did but what about my feelings ok, hello I was the one who was assaulted I am the victim here (Ryan frowns trying to make sense of it)  
 Kirsten: (walking in, in her dressing gown) (to Seth) hey how come your not dressed your gonna be late  
 Sandy: and so are you or is that what ladies are wearin these days to yogalaties. Taryn called to remind you that today is the first day of your yogalaties workshop  
 Seth: ok mom...yogalaties?  
 Kirsten: ugh I don't know if I'm gonna go, I'm not feeling well  
 Seth: see it's contagious  
 Sandy: you know honey you might still be a little hung over  
 Kirsten: from what?  
 Seth: uh gee I don't know getting drunk and passing out on thanksgiving  
 Kirsten: hey! I had two glasses of wine  
 Sandy: whoa  
 Kirsten: three  
 (Seth holds up both hands to Ryan and mouths 'ten' Ryan smiles)  
 Kirsten: and I'm sure Julie Cooper has spread word around town that Kirsten Cohen now has a drinking problem  
 Sandy: which is why you have to go to yogalaties, cause you know those chatty old newpsies 'll just assume that you're at home sleepin off another bender (laughs)  
 Ryan: (to Seth, smugly) and Summer and Anna will assume your to afraid to face them  
 Seth: hey I'm not afraid of Summer an Anna alright...well I'm not afraid of Anna  
 Ryan: so you're goin to school  
 Sandy: (to Kirsten) an you're goin to yogalaties  
 Kirsten: you just like saying that  
 Sandy: yogalaties (shrugs) I kinda do yogalaties  
 Ryan: yoooogalaties  
 Kirsten: (to Seth) you know what I wanna know  
 Sandy: yogalaties (smiles)  
 Kirsten: is why these two are so smug!  
 Seth: because for once they didn't do anything wrong  
 Sandy: (smiles, stops) that's true (walks over to Ryan) here's to ya!  
 Ryan: back atcha (clink coffee cups)  
 Kirsten: enjoy it boys because knowing the two of you, it wont last long  
 Sandy: yogalaties (Ryan smiles)  
 Theme Song - California by Phantom Planet  
 Harbor school - Ryan, Marissa & Luke are in class  
 Mr. Bendis: your class presentations will account for one third of your final grade, along with your term papers and of course the final-exam. I'll be dividing the class into two person teams (Marissa writes a note to Ryan and slides it to him) each team will be responsible for presenting a detailed account of a pivotal event or period in European history (Ryan looks around before reading the note and inadvertently looks at look Luke, Luke looks away & Ryan looks down at the table uncomfortably) now I've already had quite a few a partnership requests (Ryan reads the note it says 'We could do the crusades?') however in all fairness to the other students (Ryan raises his eyebrows at Marissa & Marissa smiles) I will select the teams myself at random ok (Marissa's smile goes) Lauren and Kenny the French revolution, Ryan an Luke the Spanish inquisition (Ryan looks shocked, and looks at Marissa who also looks shocked, Ryan then looks at Luke who doesn't look happy about it) Stephanie and Bobbie the prodestant reformation, Stephanie are you listening? (Ryan looks back at Marissa, she just shrugs) Stephanie. Miss Savage please  
 CUT TO: Outside at the lunch tables, Seth, Ryan & Marissa are walking together  
 Seth: you an Luke?

 Seth: (laughs) holy UN holy alliances  
 Marissa: see this is why I asked Mr. Bendis a week ago if we could be partners, to avoid a situation like this  
 Seth: (sits down) why who did you get?  
 Marissa: (sits down) oooh Marcie Ross an I are doing Cortez and the Aztecs  
 Seth: hey I like Marcie Ross she's got a good smile on her, its innocent but its knowing  
 Marissa: you goin after Marcie now to?

 Seth: I can only think of one thing (smirks)  
 (Marissa points to herself as if to say 'me'? Ryan just smiles at her)  
 CUT TO: Sandy & Jimmy at Jimmy's house  
 Sandy: so I talked to my guy at the SEC and your clients and they all agree that if you make full restitution by January first (makes a hand motion as if to say' no problems')  
 Jimmy: (opening the door) but that means selling the house  
 Sandy: (walking in) well it also means a avoiding criminal prosecution, and jail time  
 Jimmy: (shutting the door) (sighs) look I can't sell the house now it's almost the holidays...I can't do that to Julie and Caitlyn  
 Sandy: they wouldn't have to move out right away y'know just have the realtor show the house when Julie's out an Caitlyn's at school  
 Jimmy: what if she says no I mean she's got her name on the title to, what if Julie wont sell

 Summer: I cannot believe you, Coop where is your loyalty? what'd he say?  
 Marissa: nothing, I'm not getting involved  
 Summer: oh that means he said something. what'd he say? I'm just curious  
 Marissa: (laughs and rolls her eyes) nothing, I told you

 Summer: (flushing) hellloooo god what did he say?  
 Anna: what'd who say?  
 Summer: (opening the stall) Seth! (realises its Anna) oh, its you  
 (Anna flosses her teeth, Summer looks at her)  
 Summer: you're like, flossing...at school  
 Anna: do you have any idea how much bacteria accumulates in your mouth between lunch an dinner  
 Summer: noo but the fact that you do tells me everything...look if you want him you can have him, I'm done  
 Anna: uh-huh thanks, but that's ok  
 Summer: right because you couldn't possibly be interested in someone that's interested in me  
 Anna: no, because I couldn't possibly be interested in someone who treats women that way  
 Summer: oh (looks at her teeth in the mirror) so how much bacteria, like alot?  
 Anna: (smiles and throws her the floss) alot  
 Summer: (smiles) thanks

 Marissa: what? I didn't tell any-  
 Ryan: (angry) well did Summer? (softer) I asked you not to say anything  
 Marisa: why do you just assume it was me?  
 Ryan: because I'm the only one who knew, and you're the only one I told (sighs and walks away)  
 Marissa: I - didn't - tell - anyone

 Kirsten: of course I do, it's just that it meant - nothing  
 Sandy: well putting my own skepticism about that remark aside for a just a moment if it meant nothing...then why didn't you tell me  
 Kirsten: ...because I knew it would upset you  
 Sandy: thankyou... (hurt) cause I feel so much better having heard it from someone else

 Seth: yes?  
 Kirsten: cut it out!  
 Ryan: I mean how can you be married to somebody for that long an keep that kind of a secret  
 Sandy: oh you'd be suprised (looks straight at Kirsten) but eventually the secrets come out  
 Kirsten: and some marriages can handle the truth an some cant (looks straight at Sandy)  
 (Seth notices and looks at Sandy, then Kirsten)  
 Seth: yeah well I'm sure everyone 'll be so accepting seein as we're such a-a liberal, tolerant bunch (to Sandy) and that was at the expense of Orange County not Luke's dad, his big gay dad

 Seth: hi you guys could I speak to you (their smiles go) for-for one minute please because I owe you both an enormous apology (they both look at him) actually i guess technically I owe two apologies each one tailored to the specific wrongs visited upon the specific person but since you two seem to be sort of a package deal these days I don't know-  
 Summer: Cohen!  
 Seth: right uh (to Summer) I'm sorry ok (to Anna) and I'm sorry. I'm also sorry that I apologised to her first its jus y'know chronologically I'm tryina

 Seth: right stupid I know. well let me start by saying nothing in my life (shakes his head) nothing prepared me for the events of that fateful thanksgiving day but uh I'm not gonna make any excuses for what I did, I just wanna say one little thing in my defense which is, ya cant really blame me for wanting the company of either of you two (Anna smiles) an I know that I hurt your feelings an I feel bad about that I do but please believe me when I say that it wasn't intentional ok (Summer smiles) cause I'd never do anything to ruin our friendship...or ships...so look I know I have no right ask I jus hope that someday you can both forgive me (they both look at him and you can see they both want him again) ok so yeah thanks for your time (walks away)  
 (they both watch him go, with an 'aww expression' then they look at each other and realise the friendship isn't gonna happen)  
 Anna: (packing up) you know what I-I never really liked flash cards they've never really worked for me  
 Summer: (also packing up) oh yeah you know I think I study better alone

 Kirsten: it's like they enjoy it  
 Julie: mm (swallows her beer) well I can't exactly claim that I didn't once see the fun in witnessing the fall of the rich and fabulous... and then I became homeless an suddenly not so funny  
 Kirsten: I don't really think that my dad would let you go homeless  
 Julie: yeah well uh when I even mention that I might have to sell the house he went into a panic, you'd of thought I was asking for a ring  
 Kirsten: (laughs) that's so him

 Kirsten: but when he gets something in his head (smiles)  
 Julie: it has to be his way  
 Kirsten: always  
 (Julie looks at her, and she looks back they both smile and laugh)  
 Kirsten: its just who he is, he jus cant spend longer then three months with the same woman before he freaks  
 Julie: oh he freaked alright  
 Kirsten: an I jus wish that I could tell him that I know what he's doing, he's trying to replace my mom...but he cant...an I just wish that he would... stop trying an be happy, but you cant talk to my dad  
 Julie: (smiles) no I know  
 Kirsten: and the important thing is is that he finds someone to share his life with, enjoy these years...I jus don't know if he's ever gonna figure that out  
 (Julie is thinking and Kirsten drinks her beer)

 Ryan: (smiles) you don't mind  
 Marissa: yeah well you were pretty great with Luke today  
 Ryan: I never shoulda told you  
 Marissa: because I'll tell everyone right  
 Ryan: no, because he asked me not to  
 Marissa: but see the unwritten rule of relationships is you're allowed to tell your girlfriend, because everything you say to me stays with me and vice versa  
 Ryan: so then you didn't tell anybody that I went off on you yesterday when I thought you told  
 Marissa: no...well I mean jus Summer  
 Ryan: (nods) will you tell Summer about this (kisses her)  
 Marissa: (touches his face) no this'll stay just between us (kisses him)  
 (we hear the sound of a car pulling up and the lights shine in their eyes)  
 CUT TO: Carson standing inside near the back door Kirsten comes over to him  
 Kirsten: Carson are you sure that I can't get you anything to eat, scotch zanax  
 Carson: no thankyou (to Sandy who just came in) he's not coming down  
 Sandy: well he's half asleep, y'know maybe it would be a better idea if you guys talked in the morning  
 Carson: (teary) he's not gonna wanna talk to me...I lied to him...I lied to everyone I uh...truth is I love his mom I always have and I love our family an I just didn't uh wanna hurt anybody...an now he's up there hurt  
 Sandy: hey if theres anything we could do  
 Carson: no no I've embarrassed my family enough (walking away) I think the best thing I could do right now is to just disappear  
 Sandy: (follows) noo I think that'd be the worst thing you could do, I mean it's what you ben doin all along y'know but comin out an bein honest with yourself an your family, in this town, it's the bravest thing you coulda done. look its jus my opinion but... you're the kinda father any kid'd be proud of  
 Carson: well I should go (walks away)  
 Luke: (standing around the corner) dad (they stare at each other) jus let me grab my shoes...I'll go with you

 Kirsten: so, while we're being honest  
 Sandy: oh god, there's more?

 Kirsten: are you gonna tell me all yours?  
 Sandy: y'know I don't think I have any  
 Kirsten: really  
 Sandy: yeah  
 Kirsten: you sure?  
 Sandy: I think  
 Kirsten: nothing from your past, no secret fantasies, no hidden p0rn stash (laughs) on the PC  
 Sandy: no cause obviously you already know about that one  
 Kirsten: (walks over to him) (softly) there's no way you can know everything about someone, that's what keeps it interesting  
 Sandy: well it hasn't ben uninteresting  
 Kirsten: at a certain point you have to trust the other person, that's what love is  
 Sandy: ok... so you'll have to trust that you can tell me things that I may not wanna hear we-we can handle it  
 Kirsten: like...Jimmy Cooper kissed me  
 Sandy: (touches her face) trust me (they kiss)  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Ryan, Seth, Marissa & Luke are walking in. they stop and look ahead  
 Luke: this is gonna be weird  
 Ryan: yep  
 Luke: everybody's gonna be starin at me, talkin

 Luke: maybe I can just blow the whole thing off, go hit the beach, give everybody time to get it outta their systems  
 Ryan: oh it doesn't work like that, its ben months I'm still the kid from China that burned a house down  
 Marissa: and I'm still the girl who tried to kill herself in Mexico
