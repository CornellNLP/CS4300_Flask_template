 Scenes from the last episode.  
 TEASER  
 Seth and Ryan are sitting on the couch playing some video game.  
 Seth: (while absorbed with the game) Oh. Oh. (chuckles) Oh really? You think so?  
 Ryan: I do.  
 Seth: Well, we'll see about that, Monkey Pox.  
 On the TV: Player 1 wins. Seth sighs dramatically as Ryan looks at him smugly.  
 Seth: So the pupil has become the teacher.  
 Kirsten and Sandy walk in together. They are both dressed very nicely.  
 Sandy: Hey guys!  
 Ryan : Hey.  
 Seth: (unenthusiastically) Who died?  
 Kirsten: Seth, we need to talk to Ryan.  
 Seth and Ryan look a little guilty.  
 Seth: Okay. If this has to do with the rug though, I just want to tell you that Ryan had nothing to do with it.  
 Kirsten: (looking down at the rug) What about the rug?  
 Seth: I'm gonna go now. (leaves the room quickly as Kirsten is still looking at the rug)  
 Sandy sits down on a chair, while Kirsten stands next to him. Ryan puts down the controller that he's still holding.  
 Sandy: So, Kirsten and I went to child services this morning. And we told them that, uh, that we want you to stay with us. (Ryan looks very hopeful) But there's a catch. Because you're a minor, the only way they'll allow that to happen is if we assume all legal responsibility for you.  
 Ryan: I can't ask you guys to do that.  
 Sandy: Well, you don't have to. We're asking you.  
 Kirsten: We've all talked about it. And we want to be your legal guardians. We want you to be part of the family. If you want to be...  
 Ryan: (looking a little uncertain) What if it doesn't work?  
 Pause.  
 Kirsten: Well, how do you mean?  
 Ryan: Well... what if something happens and... and you guys change your mind.  
 Sandy: Like what? You steal a car? You burn down a house? You beat up the captain of the water polo team? (both Sandy and Kirsten smile) Those ships have sailed, my friend.  
 Kirsten: You just have to promise us you'll stay out of trouble. From now on... no more fights.  
 Sandy: You're still on probation. And child services will be up our ass all the time.  
 Ryan: (looking very grateful) No more trouble. I promise.  
 Kirsten and Sandy smile at each other.  
 Sandy: Well. (Ryan and Sandy stand up; Sandy extends his hand out to Ryan) Welcome to the family.  
 Ryan and Sandy shake hands.  
 Ryan: Thanks, guys  
 Kirsten hugs him a little awkwardly, but with a big smile. Ryan looks as though he's about to cry.  
 Kirsten: (loudly) Okay, Seth. You can come out now. (laughs)  
 Seth pops his head around the corner with a huge grin on his face.  
 Ryan: You knew about this and didn't say anything.  
 Seth: (shrugging) I didn't want to jinx it.  
 Ryan nods a little. They do one of those 'cool' handshakes.  
 Seth: Dude. You're a Cohen now. Welcome to a life of insecurity and... paralysing self-doubt.  
 Ryan: Yeah. (takes a deep breath) Now, all I have to do is... stay out of trouble.  
 Seth: (nodding) Yeah, that could be... difficult.  
 [Opening credits]  
 SCENE 1  
 Kirsten, Seth and Ryan walk into the pool house. Kirsten is carrying a brown paper bag.  
 Kirsten: You're going to need bedding. And towels. Oh, how's the bed, Ryan? Is it comfortable?  
 Seth jumps on the bed and bounces up and down on it.  
 Ryan: Yeah, it's - Huh. It's fine. It's great.  
 Kirsten: (looking a little uncomfortable) We really want you to have your privacy, but this is a pool house - it needs a little warmth. You're going to need chairs, and a desk and a... bookshelf.  
 Seth: Plasma flat screen, a couple of turntables, minibar -  
 Kirsten: (gesturing at a linen shelf) And we should clean all this out, so that you have room for some of your... Right, you don't have any stuff. Which means we have to go shopping for clothes and shoes and underpants...  
 Seth: Mom! Don't say underpants.  
 Ryan: I've got everything I need. Really.  
 Kirsten: I bet you don't have a tux. Cause you're going to need one.  
 Ryan: For what?  
 Kirsten: For cotillion.  
 Cut to the front of the club. Kirsten, Ryan and Seth are stepping out of a black SUV.  
 Kirsten: It's the annual debutant ball. It's Newport's biggest event.  
 Seth: Until whatever's next week.  
 Kirsten: It's the day when Newport's most accomplished young women make their formal debut into society.  
 Seth: Or another excuse for them to get wasted and throw up on themselves.  
 Kirsten: Hey. I was a deb. I made my debut at this very country club not so many years ago.  
 Seth: The year was -  
 Kirsten: Hey!  
 They enter the club.  
 Ryan: You know what. Maybe I should skip it.  
 Kirsten: You have to go. It's a family tradition and you're part of the family.  
 Peggy: Hello!  
 Kirsten and Peggy do that kissing the air thing.  
 Kirsten: Hi, Peggy. Mwah. How are you?  
 Peggy: I'm good.  
 Kirsten: And how's it going?  
 Peggy: It'll be fine. Oh, the fitting area's back there. (she points 'back there')  
 Kirsten: Thank you. Come on, boys. It'll be fun.  
 They walk towards 'back there.' Seth makes a 'riiiight' face, while Ryan just looks apprehensive.  
 SCENE 2  
 The Cohen house. Sandy's black SUV is pulling into the driveway, his surfboard sticking out the back. Sandy gets out of the car, throws his bag on the front steps, then goes to back and removes his swim gear.  
 Jimmy: Sandy!  
 Sandy: Hey, Jimmy.  
 Jimmy walks up as Sandy is removing his board.  
 Jimmy: Got some surfing in, huh?  
 Sandy: Yep. Late court date. Gotta take advantage.  
 Jimmy: Nice to have hobbies. Look, uh... I know you're not thrilled with me. When I borrowed the money from Kirsten, I... should have... asked you. I wasn't - I wasn't going behind your back.  
 Sandy: Look, it's done. Let's move on.  
 Jimmy: I was, uh... I was afraid of what you'd think of me. (pause) Losing this much money as I have is, uh... not an impressive accomplishment. (looks very uncomfortable)  
 Sandy: How much money did you lose?  
 Jimmy: Ah. (waves it away) It's not important.  
 Sandy: (nods. Then shakes his head) How'd you lose it?  
 Jimmy: Look. The important thing is - is I don't know what Julie and I would do without friends like you and Kirsten.  
 They shake hands.  
 Sandy: So everything's okay?  
 Jimmy: Oh yeah. Yeah. Thank you. (moves to leave)  
 Sandy: I'll see you around.  
 Jimmy: See ya!  
 Sandy looks a little unconvinced.  
 SCENE 3  
 At the country club, in the back where they are doing fittings. Ryan is being dragged along by a guy with a measuring tape around his neck.  
 Guy: (pointing at a rack of suits) Okay. Pick whatever you want. We've got Gucci, Armani. (points somewhere else) Versace's over there.  
 Ryan looks out of his element. He fingers the suits, walks forward then stops short when he sees Marissa. She's passing a piece of paper to a woman.  
 Marissa: Hi. Uhm. I'm picking up for Marissa Cooper?  
 Ryan: Hey.  
 Marissa: (turns and sees him) Hey. What are *you* doing here?  
 Ryan: I, uh. (gestures at guy with measuring tape) I had an appointment with my personal shopper.  
 Marissa: But I thought you said you were leaving. With your mom.  
 Ryan: It didn't really work out. So, I'm kind of living with the Cohens.  
 Marissa: For good?  
 Ryan: Is that... going to be a problem?  
 Marissa: No. No! It's great. I mean, I guess now we can be friends, right?  
 Ryan looks uncomfortable. Marissa looks uncomfortable.  
 Summer: (walks up) Hey, Coop! (removing gloves) Oh, these gloves are giving me serious sausage arms.  
 Summer and Marissa laugh. Luke is with her and walks up to put his arm around Marissa's shoulder, eyeing Ryan suspiciously.  
 Luke: (to Ryan) What are you still doing here? I thought you were going back to Chino?  
 Ryan: I had a change of plans.  
 Marissa: Ryan is living here now.  
 Luke: He's WHAT?  
 Ryan: Look. I'm not here to cause problems.  
 Kirsten: (walking up, looking concerned) Is everything all right?  
 Marissa and Luke smile at Kirsten a little uncomfortably.  
 Luke: (to Marissa) I'll be in the truck. (starts leaving but not before sending Ryan one last 'look')  
 Marissa: Great.  
 Kirsten: Marissa. I was going to call you. Since you're lead deb, I - (turns behind) Seth! - I wanted to introduce you to a couple of white knights. In case any of your girls need a last minute escort.  
 Summer: (licentiously) Every girl needs a white knight.  
 Ryan looks scared.  
 Seth: (sidling up) Seth Cohen, white knight.  
 Summer: (glances at Seth then focuses her attention on Ryan) So, uh, you'll be at the rehearsal.  
 Seth: (nods enthusiastically at Summer then Ryan) Yes. Absolutely.  
 Summer: (to Ryan) See you then. (drags Marissa away)  
 Marissa: Bye.  
 Seth: Cotillion ROCKS!  
 Ryan doesn't exactly look like he agrees.  
 In a fitting room. Marissa is sitting down on a chair while Summer is facing a mirror on the wall.  
 Marissa: You want me to fix you up with RYAN? I mean I thought you said he was a 'total psycho.' (she supplies the finger quotes)  
 Summer: (holding up a dress to herself) Well, that was before I got to know him.  
 Marissa: Wait. When did you get to know him.  
 Summer: Just now. Plus I'm into that whole brooding bad boy thing. He's wounded - I can save him.  
 Marissa: I mean have you really talked to him, though? Cause he's not really a bad boy.  
 Summer: Well, he will be by the time I get through with him. (exchanges the dress she's holding for the one on Marissa's lap)  
 Marissa laughs weakly.  
 Summer: What? You're not like... into him are you? I mean, you're with Luke, right?  
 Marissa: (a little too quickly) Right.  
 Summer: Good.  
 SCENE 4  
 At Sandy's office. Sandy is sitting at his desk.  
 Steve: Sandy Cohen?  
 Steve Pearlman from episode 101 enters the room.  
 Steve: I'm with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Division?  
 Sandy: (stands up) Okay.  
 Steve: (doesn't quite close the door, but shuts it a little) I was hoping you could help me out with a case that I'm investigating.  
 Sandy: Sure. What can I do for you?  
 Steve: Were you aware, Mr Cohen, that a cheque your wife made out to a James Cooper for one hundred thousand dollars was not treated as an investment but a direct deposit into his personal account?  
 Sandy: It wasn't an investment. It was a loan. My wife and Jimmy are old... (pauses) What's this about?  
 Steve: Do you know that Mr Cooper is currently the subject of an SEC fraud investigation?  
 Sandy: (softly) No. (things clicking in his brain) No, I didn't.  
 SCENE 5  
 At the Cohen house. Kirsten is walking into the house with Ryan and Seth behind her. They are all carrying bags.  
 Seth: Hey. White gloves (to Ryan) are ready for a comeback.  
 Kirsten: (walking into the kitchen, she sees Sandy pouring two glasses of red wine) Hey! What are you doing home?  
 Sandy: Fellas, do you mind?  
 Seth: Oh. Uh. If this is about the vase -  
 Sandy: Which vase?  
 Seth: Hm. (shakes his head) Nothing. Uh, let's go, Ryan. (jerks his head at Ryan) Come on, buddy.  
 Seth and Ryan leave the room.  
 Kirsten: (walks up to Sandy, leans against the kitchen counter) What's going on?  
 Sandy sets down one of the glasses in front of her.  
 At the pool house, Seth is messing with his suit. Ryan walks in and dumps his suit on the bed.  
 Ryan: Okay. So... I think I'm not going to Cotillion.  
 Seth: (sitting on a chair reading a comic book) Yeah, okay. Except that you are.  
 Ryan: I made a promise to your parents that I'd stay out of trouble.  
 Seth: Yeah, it's a debutant ball. What kind of trouble can you get into?  
 Ryan: I don't know. Why don't you ask *Luke*?  
 Seth: (sets down his comic book on his lap) Ryan. We're white knights, okay. That means Marissa probably already has some sad, lonely girl all lined up for you to escort, so you can't just call and cancel at the last minute. That's a faux pas, buddy.  
 Ryan sits down on the bed, looking not too happy.  
 Ryan: Would you call her?  
 Seth: (looking up from his comics) No. (closes the comic again) If you're going to bail on Marissa and some like poor, pathetic dateless girl, you're just going to have to do that one yourself.  
 In the kitchen.  
 Kirsten: (looking upset) Are you sure?  
 Sandy: Well, according to these guys, Jimmy's been siphoning money out of his clients' accounts to cover his own debts.  
 Kirsten: (sits down on a chair, looks disbelieving) How could we not know something like this?  
 Sandy: Because. We trusted the guy. Everybody did. This entire community wrote him blank cheques and never asked any questions. *You* gave him a hundred grand!  
 Kirsten: It was just a loan.  
 Sandy: WHICH according to the SEC makes us worth investigating too.  
 Kirsten: (looking very upset, rests her forehead on her clasped hands) I'm going to be sick.  
 Sandy: (picks up the cordless and turns it on) I'm going to have to call our friends and let 'em know.  
 Kirsten looks up immediately.  
 Kirsten: Sandy, wait. You're just going to panic people.  
 Sandy scoffs.  
 Kirsten: Don't... do anything until I talk to him, okay?  
 Sandy: Put your personal feelings for this guy aside. Forget about your history -  
 Kirsten: He's one of my oldest friends. If it's true, I just need to hear it from him.  
 Sandy turns off the cordless.  
 SCENE 6  
 At the Cooper house. Ryan is standing at the front door.  
 Marissa: I'm coming!  
 She opens the door wearing a white dress.  
 Marissa: Hey!  
 Ryan is stunned speechless by how good she looks.  
 Marissa: You're, uhm, at my house. (she grabs her top, it looks like it's loose)  
 Ryan: I, uh, well, I wanted to talk to you about Cotillion.  
 Marissa: Oh. Okay. Well, uhm, (tries looking at her own back) I was just trying this on and I can't seem to reach the-  
 Ryan: Did you want me to, uhm - I could. Do you want me to, uh -  
 Marissa: Yeah, you know, actually. (turns her back to him) If you wouldn't mind.  
 He stares at her back for a good, long moment. She's wearing a bareback dress that has three horizontal straps holding the top together. The top strap is undone. He looks really uncomfortable and nervous as he attaches the strap.  
 Marissa: (turning back) Thanks. So, what's up with Cotillion?  
 Ryan: What time did you want me there?  
 She's smiling. He looks shell-shocked.  
 SCENE 7  
 At the Cooper house. Inside Jimmy's study, he and Kirsten are talking.  
 Jimmy: I'm, I'm so sorry. I never meant for you to be dragged in like this.  
 Kirsten: How did this happen? I mean I understand a couple of bad investments, but theft -  
 Jimmy: (laughing) Theft? No, no, no!  
 Julie: Okay, honey. So we're going get - (stops short as she enters the room and sees Kirsten) Oh, Kirsten.  
 Kirsten: Julie.  
 Julie: Jimmy didn't tell me you were coming by.  
 Jimmy: She just stopped by to ask a quick... business question.  
 Julie: A quickie, huh?  
 Jimmy: (unimpressed) Julie.  
 Julie: I'm kidding! So, we're off. Kaitlin needs new shoes for Cotillion. Then we're test-driving the CLK. And then I have to re-up Marissa's tennis lessons at the club, so which credit card should I use?  
 Jimmy: (looking harassed) Uh, the Mastercard.  
 Julie: What about the Amex?  
 Kirsten is watching this exchange with great interest.  
 Jimmy: Uh, no, don't use the Amex. We, uh, get the miles.  
 Julie: (softly) Okay. (leans forward to give Jimmy a quick kiss on the cheek, then turns to leave) You two have fun.  
 Jimmy: (when Julie's gone) Well, now that the how and why have been accounted for. Look. I - I was not... *stealing*, I was - I was *borrowing* to pay back my debts and then the market took a turn and you know, I, uh - there we are.  
 Kirsten: You were stealing.  
 Jimmy: I - I can't say no... to my family. I'll pay everything back. I just need that one stock. That one stock -  
 Kirsten: Jimmy, you need help.  
 Jimmy: (scoffs and looks defeated) Yeah, well, who's going to help me. (get up and turns away)  
 SCENE 8  
 At the club. Ryan and Seth are walking together.  
 Ryan: So, uh, what exactly happens at this rehearsal?  
 Seth: Just, uh, stupid Cotillion stuff. Bowing, Curtsying...  
 They walk into a hall where people are dancing. Ryan grabs Seth's arm. Peggy (from Scene 1) is counting and dancing around a little while some young couples dance together stiffly.  
 Peggy: One two three. One two three. Try to enjoy this please. One two (continues in background)  
 Ryan: Dancing? You didn't tell me there was dancing.  
 Seth: Well, if I told you there's dancing, I would be here by myself right now.  
 Ryan: Because I really... don't... dance.  
 Seth: Uh huh. Nether do I. I just move well. (does a really weird dance, then whispers) I'll teach you that one. Huh? Maybe later. You ready?  
 Ryan gives Seth a 'you're weird' look.  
 Marissa: (talking to some couple, holding a clipboard) Take your places. (walking over to where Seth and Ryan are sitting) Hey guys. So, can I introduce you to your debs?  
 Summer: (sidling up to Ryan from behind) We've... already met.  
 Marissa: Oh well, actually, Summer, Ryan's already been promised to someone else.  
 Summer: I can't believe this! You *gave* him to someone else? Who? Who's pathetic enough not to have a date the day before Cotillion?  
 Anna: (coming up from behind Marissa) Actually, at this point, that would be you.  
 Marissa: So, Anna Stern. This is Ryan Atwood. Guys, Anna just moved here from Pittsburgh.  
 Summer: Pittsburgh? Ew.  
 Anna: (looking a little uncomfortable) Can we just get this over with?  
 Marissa looks proud of herself.  
 Seth: (to Ryan) Caliente.  
 Ryan gets up and walks next to Marissa.  
 Marissa: Hey, it's not that bad.  
 Ryan: You haven't seen me dance. (grimaces)  
 Marissa: Well, I can help you.  
 Ryan and Marissa head over to where Anna is (at the other end of the dance floor)  
 Summer: (shouting after Marissa) So, like, what am *I* supposed to do?  
 Seth: (coughs) Over here.  
 Summer rolls her eyes. Seth starts whistling and swinging his legs.  
 Summer: Fine! Let's go.  
 Seth: (very excited) Are you sure? Because if, if, if you're not totally sure  
 Summer: Just! Don't. Talk to me.  
 Seth: All right. I get it. Our - Our connection is a little bit deeper than words.  
 Summer looks nauseated.  
 Seth: That's it. I'm done. I'm sorry. A chockfull of quiet now. (offers his arms out to her meekly)  
 Marissa is with Ryan and Anna.  
 Marissa: Okay. So you guys will be over here. (nudges Ryan onto the dance floor next to Anna) If you wanna go ahead and get into waltz position. (Anna and Ryan look completely lost) Which means Anna, you put your left hand on Ryan's shoulder.  
 Anna places her palm on Ryan's shoulder.  
 Marissa: Uhm. No. Not like that. (nudges Anna aside and stands in front of Ryan) Here. Watch. (places her hand correct) Okay? Now, Ryan, you put your right hand on my back.  
 Ryan places his hand on her shoulder blade.  
 Marissa: (laughs) Lower.  
 He slides his hand down to her waist and they have a *long moment*.  
 Marissa: (looking suddenly uncomfortable) Okay. Good. Good.  
 Luke walks up with a guy and Holly.  
 Luke: I'd be pretty jealous right now. (Ryan and Marissa are still in position, but turn to look at him) If Chino wasn't gay.  
 The guy with Luke laughs. Marissa breaks out of Ryan's arms and gives Luke a look.  
 Luke: What? No. It doesn't bother me. I mean he's born that way right.  
 Ryan: (softly to Marissa, without looking at Luke) Thanks. I can take it from here.  
 Marissa: Okay. (gestures for Anna to return)  
 Ryan watches Marissa walk away.  
 Anna: (whistles lowly) You're into her, huh? (Ryan looks down at her) Man, are you in trouble.  
 Ryan: (with resignation) I know.  
 Anna: Yeah. (lifts her arms) Come on.  
 Luke and Marissa are standing together. Luke is putting on his jacket. Marissa helps him adjust his collar.  
 Peggy: All right, darlings. Listen up. Let's review the classic waltz step. (gestures to a good looking young man) Phillip? (they start waltzing) Aaaaand One two three. One two three. One two three. One two three. Smile please.  
 Seth and Summer are dancing stiffly. Luke and Marissa are dancing quite comfortably.  
 Luke: (to Marissa) That kid is stalking you.  
 Marissa: He is not! He's my neighbour. And he's not going anywhere, so you're just going to have to get used to him.  
 Luke: What I'm never going to get used to is that kid macking on you every time I turn my back.  
 Marissa: So, you don't trust me?  
 They stop dancing.  
 Luke: No. I... I don't trust anybody else. Not around you.  
 They kiss very chastely. Ryan is watching them out of the corner of his eye. Anna is eyeing Ryan, then narrows her eyes.  
 Anna: Wait. Are you the kid from Chino who steals cars and sets people's houses on fire?  
 They stop dancing.  
 Anna: So, you're saying, I'm making my debut into society with Newport's most wanted?  
 Ryan: Is that going to be a problem?  
 Anna: (smiles) I can't wait.  
 Ryan shrugs and then resume dancing.  
 SCENE 9  
 At Sandy's office. Kirsten and Sandy are talking, a table between them. Sandy is flipping through some files.  
 Sandy: Absolutely NOT! As happy as I am that you came ALL the way out to my office to visit me. (walks around the table and gives Kirsten a kiss on the cheek) The answer is no. (calls out the door) Corey! I need that file on Nerodner vs. Caplin. And I, I do need that INS report on my four-thirty. (walks back to the other side of the table. Then to Kirsten) I got a two time drug offender they wanna deport. Fifteen years old.  
 Kirsten: Sandy. He needs help.  
 Sandy: Jimmy Cooper? He stole from his clients. He stole from his friends. And then he had the nerve to borrow a hundred thousand dollars from us to cover it up.  
 Kirsten: He was trying to provide for his family!  
 Sandy: Yeah. Boats. Ponies.  
 Kirsten: So, you'll defend a two-time drug offender, but you won't defend -  
 Sandy: Yes! My clients are kids. Who have no hope! No guidance. Nothing. (Kirsten turns her back to him) Jimmy Cooper is just another spoiled Newport brat (she turns back at this) who had everything handed to him.  
 Kirsten: Like me?  
 Sandy: No. Not like you! *You* would never lie. *You* would never steal.  
 Kirsten: I would like to think that. But the truth is - there isn't anything I wouldn't do for my family. (picks up her bag) See you at home.  
 SCENE 10  
 At the club. Seth and Ryan are walking out of the dance hall.  
 Ryan: (sounding exhausted) Three hours of dancing.  
 Seth: (happily) I feel like I could go for three more.  
 Marissa: (coming out of the hall) Ryan! So, Anna seemed nice. I mean, I just figured - she's new and you're new, so...  
 Ryan: Yeah.  
 Marissa: Great. Good.  
 Holly comes up to them and hugs Marissa.  
 Holly: Hey, Rissa!  
 Marissa: Hey, Hol. I was just going to tell them about the cookout tonight.  
 Holly: Yeah. It's at my house. I do it every year for Cotillion.  
 Seth: You didn't do it last year.  
 Holly: Yeah, we did.  
 Seth: (dawning upon him) Ouch.  
 Holly: (to Marissa) See you tonight. (walks away)  
 Seth: See you there!  
 Ryan: Uhm. You really think that's such a good idea. (looking at Luke who's talking to the guy from before)  
 Marissa: Yeah. I do. I mean you're living here now and there's no reason we can't all hang out, right? (starts backing away, then turns and leaves)  
 Seth: (staring at Ryan) I can think of a reason.  
 Ryan: Yeah. I'm not going.  
 Seth: Wait. Dude, I don't want to go alone.  
 Ryan: Summer's going to be there.  
 Seth: Yeah. I'm still *going*, I'd just prefer not to go alone. Listen to me. We're like brothers now. (Ryan crosses his arms and listens intently) Okay? That means we do stuff for each other. For instance, if you do this for me, somewhere down the line, I'm going to be able to do something for you. I don't know what it's going to be yet, but it's going to be *awesome*! (Ryan looks unconvinced) Please?  
 SCENE 11  
 Holly and her dad, Greg, are at a restaurant. They're picking up many bags of food.  
 Greg: Here we are. Thank you very much. Okay. (gives Holly some bags) Here we go, sweetheart. You got that? Check, make sure we got everything.  
 As they are walking out, Jimmy walks in.  
 Greg: Hey! Jimmy Cooper!  
 They shake hands.  
 Jimmy: Hey.  
 Greg: Just the man I wanted to see.  
 Jimmy: Hey, Greg. Hey, Holly.  
 Holly: Hey, Mr Cooper.  
 Jimmy: (looking at bags) Somebody's having a party.  
 Greg: (looking proudly at Holly) Yeah. Holly's hosting this thing for the debs out at the beach house.  
 Jimmy: That's right. Marissa's going. Have a good time. (walks away to the pick up station of the restaurant)  
 Greg: (gives Holly all the bags and his car keys) Honey. Take these out to the car, I'll be right there, okay?  
 Holly: Okay.  
 Jimmy: Hi. I'm picking up for, uh, Cooper.  
 Greg is walking up to Jimmy.  
 Greg: Listen, Jimmy. Uh, I haven't heard back from you. Did you get my messages?  
 Jimmy: Oh yeah, I'm sorry. You know, work is - has been so crazy. But what's going on?  
 Greg: Well, I've been asked to invest in this commercial real estate property. It could be a nice second income for us. Might end up our only income the way the pharmaceutical industry's going.  
 Jimmy: That sounds - That sounds promising.  
 Greg: Yeah. So, uhm, we're going to have to pull two hundred and fifty thousand dollars out of the investment account.  
 Jimmy: (looks flustered) Well, I... Are you sure you want to do that? I mean, uh, with the market about to turn around.  
 Waitress: Sir. I'm sorry, but your credit card's been declined.  
 Jimmy: Huh. Uh.  
 Greg is watching this with interest.  
 Jimmy: Oh. Oh, it's a new care. You know, I forgot to activate it.  
 Waitress: Did you want to use another card? Uh -  
 Holly: (walking back in) Dad! I'm going to be late to my own party!  
 Greg: Okay, honey. (then to Jimmy) Uhm, listen. I'll call you tomorrow about the details, all right? Just bring the cheque to the, uh, the Cotillion. (starts walking away) Enjoy your meal.  
 Greg and Holly leave.  
 Jimmy: (to waitress) Uhm. I'll just pay it with - I'll just pay it with cash.  
 SCENE 12  
 Holly's beach house. The party is in full swing. Ryan and Seth walk in.  
 Seth: Give me ten minutes to find Summer. Lock it down for tomorrow. See where the night takes me.  
 Ryan: It'd better take you right back here in ten minutes.  
 Seth: (walking away) Okay. Don't wait up.  
 Summer and Holly are standing over the barbeque.  
 Summer: Come on, Hol. I'll trade you two tickets to Jack Johnson, a massage at Burke-Williams and all the money I have on me (digs in her purse) which is... eleven dollars.  
 Holly: Mmm. Sorry, Summer. I don't want to trade escorts.  
 Seth: (walking up to them) Hey, Summer. Holly.  
 Summer: What did I say about talking to me?  
 Seth: Okay. I just - God - I just wanted to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow night.  
 Summer: (in a pissy voice) I guess.  
 Seth: (frustrated) Could you even pretend to be a little bit stoked?  
 Summer glares at him.  
 Seth: Fair enough. (to Holly) Wow, you're a really good... barbeque-sionist.  
 Inside, Ryan is alone. He finds a couch and sits down.  
 Luke and the guy from before are standing at the kitchen counter. They slap some pesto/dip on a chip and Luke tries to feed it to the guy, but the guy bats his hand away and the pesto/dip falls onto the floor. Marissa is watching this, unimpressed. She's sitting on a counter nearby. Scanning the crowd, she sees Ryan and Ryan sees her. She motions for him to come over to her. He shakes his head, so she walks over instead. He gets up and meets her halfway.  
 Ryan: So, you sure you want to be seen with me?  
 Marissa: Hey. I'm glad you came. I mean how could you possibly miss all this?  
 Ryan smiles, then he looks over Marissa's shoulder and sees Luke glaring at them.  
 Ryan: I'm going to go.  
 Marissa: Hey. We're not doing anything wrong.  
 Luke walks up to them.  
 Luke: Well, now that you've moved in, I see you're making yourself right at home.  
 Marissa: Luke, come on. You said you were going to try.  
 Luke: I'm trying. I - I'm trying to understand why there's all this people here and you only want to talk to her.  
 Marissa: Hey, I wanted to talk to him.  
 Luke: Look, babe, why don't you go talk to Summer, all right? She looks kind of lonely.  
 Marissa: Or you can. And I'll just stay and finish talking to Ryan.  
 Ryan: It's okay. I'm just going to go.  
 Marissa: No. Stay.  
 Luke: (angrily) What are you doing? Don't tell him he can stay!  
 Ryan: Don't tell her what to do.  
 Luke: Thought you were leaving. (grabs Ryan's arm roughly) Why don't I just help you out?  
 Ryan turns around and they stare each other down.  
 Ryan: I'm not going to fight you.  
 Luke: (looks at him) Even if I do this? (punches Ryan in the gut)  
 Ryan falls to the ground.  
 Marissa: (rushing forward) Luke! (crouches over Ryan) Oh my God! Are you okay? (stands up and advances on Luke) God. Luke. You're such an idiot.  
 Marissa leaves in a huff. Luke takes off after her. Seth is next to Ryan.  
 Seth: Wow. You just got your butt kicked. You didn't even fight back. Dude, you really are a Cohen. (Ryan glares at him, still clutching his tummy) Yeah. Let's just get you home.  
 Seth helps Ryan up.  
 SCENE 13  
 At the pool house. Ryan is sitting on his bed, reading a magazine. Seth enters the pool house, already in his tuxedo.  
 Seth: What are you doing? Why aren't you dressed yet?  
 Ryan: (not looking at Seth) I'm not going.  
 Seth rolls his eyes.  
 Ryan: Will you let Anna know. She'd probably be relieved.  
 Seth: Are you just not going to go because you're afraid of Luke?  
 Ryan: (still not looking up) That's not what I'm afraid of. (he looks up at Seth, who gives him a 'so what are you afraid of' look/hand gesture) Look. Your parents taking me in, it's like the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'm not going to lose it just to kick some guy's ass.  
 Seth: But you could though. You could kick his ass, right?  
 Ryan: Oh yeah.  
 Seth: Cool. (clears his throat) All right. Well. Have fun. (leaves)  
 SCENE 14  
 At the Cooper house. Marissa is in her bedroom, dressed in a robe, looking at her Cotillion dress that is laid out on the bed. Julie knocks on the door, then enters.  
 Julie: Sweetie, I need to borrow your lip-gloss. (stops when she sees the dress) Oh. I love this dress. (bends down to pick dress up)  
 Marissa: Really. Maybe you should wear it.  
 Julie: Hah. You're sweet. (moves in front of the mirror, holding the dress in front of her) But I think we both know that I'm no longer a size zero. Give me a few more months on the zone.  
 Marissa: I don't think I want to go.  
 Julie: (turns to her immediately) I'm sorry. I thought I just heard you say you don't want to go to your own Cotillion.  
 Marissa: Look. Luke and I got in a fight last night, okay?  
 Julie: (turning back to the mirror) So, you got into a fight. You've had fights before. You guys have been together forever.  
 Marissa: Maybe... that's the problem. (stops) I mean what if there's someone else out there?  
 Julie: (looks scandalized) Like who? That boy from *Chino*?  
 Marissa is looking like 'maybe...'  
 Julie: (lowering dress and walking towards Marissa) Marissa. Do you want to end up like your Aunt Cindy? With four kids in a trailer park? She broke my mother's heart. I will not let you break mine.  
 Marissa: Oh, so now this is about you?  
 Julie: (softly) No, sweetie. It's about you. What kind of future do you think you could have with that boy?  
 Marissa: Mom! I'm *sixteen*!  
 Julie: And the choices that you make when you're sixteen can affect your entire future. Marissa, Luke comes from a good family. If you stay with him, you'll always be comfortable.  
 Marissa: I'm comfortable now!  
 Julie: Nothing in life is certain.  
 Marissa: (taken aback) What does that mean?  
 Julie: It means that you'll put on this dress, do your hair the way I showed you and make your debut into Newport's society with Luke.  
 Marissa: (sighs) I can't. (Julie looks livid) I'm sorry.  
 Julie: No, you're not. But you will be.  
 Julie hands Marissa back the dress and then leaves.  
 SCENE 15  
 At the Cohen house. Sandy is sitting on a pool side lounge chair, drinking a beer. Kirsten walks out, in an evening gown.  
 Kirsten: What are you doing? Why aren't you dressed?  
 Sandy: I'm not going.  
 Kirsten: What do you *mean* you're not going?  
 Sandy: Oh. I don't feel like getting all dressed up and having to pretend that Jimmy Cooper is the O.C. golden boy. Any community that makes that guy a hero is not one I feel like being a part of right now.  
 Kirsten looks tired. Seth walks out of the pool house.  
 Kirsten: (to Seth) You're not going either?  
 Seth: I wanted to leave twenty minutes ago.  
 Kirsten: Let's go.  
 Seth: Dad, why aren't you -  
 Kirsten: Seth! Now!  
 Seth gives Sandy a 'what's up?' look. Sandy just jerks his head for Seth to follow Kirsten.  
 SCENE 16  
 At the Cooper house. Jimmy is sitting at his desk in his office. The phone is ringing in the background.  
 Jimmy: Oh, I don't know. Maybe I... shouldn't go either.  
 Julie: (very upset) What? What is wrong with this family? This is Cotillion. The most important event of the year. (looking on the verge of tears) Am I the only one who gets it?  
 Kaitlin walks in, dressed in a pink evening gown.  
 Kaitlin: I get it, Mommy. (she's holding a cordless) Daddy, it's Mr Fisher again. He's called like three times.  
 Julie: (shaking her finger at Jimmy) No! We do not have time for you two to talk business. (to Kaitlin) Tell Greg, daddy will see him at the Cotillion. (to Jimmy) *Right*, Jimmy?  
 Jimmy: (sighing heavily) All right. Come on. (stands up) We're going to be late.  
 SCENE 17  
 At the club. Seth is walking into the fitting area. There are lots of dressed up couples milling around. He walks up to a small group.  
 Seth: Do you guys know Anna Stern?  
 The girl starts to shake her head.  
 Anna: Seth!  
 Anna walks up, adjusting her glove. Seth is taken with her beauty.  
 Seth: Wow.  
 Anna: (excitedly) You think?  
 Seth: (walking up to her) Yes. I do. Which makes this... even harder to say. Anna, just know, that in life, there are peaks and -  
 Anna: (disappointed) Ryan is not coming, is he?  
 Seth: You kind of took the wind out of my sails there, but yes.  
 Anna smiles and shrugs.  
 Seth: Are you okay?  
 Anna: I'll survive.  
 Seth smiles.  
 SCENE 18  
 At the Cohen house. Ryan is reading a magazine while walking to the kitchen. Inside, Sandy is just closing the fridge.  
 Sandy: Hey!  
 Ryan: Hey. Thought you were going to Cotillion?  
 Sandy: I thought you were.  
 Ryan: Yeah... No.  
 Sandy: (eats a chip) Yeah. Me neither.  
 
 
 
 Cut to them playing a video game together.  
 Sandy: Wait. Which one is sword?  
 Ryan: The one you're hitting.  
 Sandy: Oh. Got it. Right.  
 Ryan: Okay. Now you're stabbing me. Just don't touch any of the buttons. Follow me through the forest and, uh, maybe we'll both make it out of here alive.  
 Sandy: So, you didn't feel like going, huh?  
 Ryan: (a little distracted by the game) Yeah... No. Not really for me.  
 Sandy: What - Waltzing and orchids? What could be more you?  
 Ryan: Guess I don't really fit in, huh?  
 Sandy: Oh. I got news for you. Nobody does. I guarantee you, every single person at that Cotillion feels like a fraud. They've all got secrets and they're all terrified that the guy next door's going to find them out.  
 Ryan: What's your secret?  
 Sandy: (shrugs) Sometimes, when the sun's coming up and the surf is good... and I haven't pissed my wife off quite as much as I have today, I kind of like this place.  
 Ryan: (turns to look at him) You just stabbed me again.  
 Sandy: Ooh. (looks at his controller) Sorry.  
 SCENE 19  
 At the club. Summer is on the cell.  
 Summer: I can't believe you're not coming.  
 Marissa is still at home in her robe.  
 Marissa: It's just... after the whole Luke and Ryan thing last night... (shrugs) I don't feel...  
 Summer: Coop. (softly) Ryan isn't even here.  
 Marissa: He's not? (recovers) Ah well, even so. I'm just not up for it.  
 Summer sighs, turns off the cell phone and swivels around to where Luke and Julie are standing together.  
 Summer: She's not coming.  
 Luke: So what did I get all dressed up for?  
 Summer gets a 'welllll' look.  
 Marissa is sitting on her bed, playing with her dress.  
 At the club. Anna and Seth are sitting together.  
 Anna: I mean, whatever you think of the whole superhero movie genre, at least it's getting people to read the original source material.  
 Seth: I can not believe that you read comic books. I... you're a girl!  
 Anna: What is that supposed to mean? And I call them graphic novels. (Seth does a 'I know' gesture) In fact, if more people did maybe the form wouldn't be so marginalized.  
 Seth: I couldn't agree more.  
 They both laugh lightly. Summer walks up and Seth stands up to greet her.  
 Seth: Hey, Summer. You ready. You look just... great.  
 Summer: So, listen, uhm. (looks uncomfortable)  
 Seth: You, uhm. You found another date.  
 Summer: Yeah. It's kind of an emergency, but you're off the hook. Sorry.  
 Seth: No, it's, it's, uhm -  
 Summer's already walked away. Seth looks very upset.  
 Seth: (mumbling) It's fine.  
 He storms off, with Anna looking at him leave.  
 SCENE 20  
 At the Cohen house. The doorbell rings. Ryan answers it and finds Marissa at the door.  
 Ryan: Hey.  
 Marissa: Hey.  
 Ryan: You - You're not at that Cotillion.  
 Marissa: Neither are you.  
 Ryan does a 'well, no, I'm not' thing with his eyes.  
 Marissa: Look. I hope you didn't not go because of last night or... because of me.  
 Ryan: (doesn't quite know how to respond to that) How come you're not going?  
 Marissa tries to answer, then just shrugs.  
 Ryan: So, you think just hiding out, staying home, is going to make everything better?  
 Marissa: Seems to be working for you. (then she gets a mischievous smile) I'll go if you go.  
 Inside, Sandy is still playing the video game very excitedly.  
 Sandy: Ryan, come on! Check this out! I have totally annihilated all the other ninjas!  
 Ryan and Marissa walk in together.  
 Sandy: I'm already on to the... (trails off when he sees Marissa) Marissa. Hello.  
 Marissa: Hey.  
 Ryan: (looking nervous) So, we're going to go... to Cotillion.  
 Sandy just stares at him. Ryan does a little head jerk.  
 Sandy: Well, I'll get the car.  
 SCENE 21  
 At the club. Lots of adults in evening outfits are hanging around. Jimmy is reading a program. Greg walks up to him.  
 Greg: Hey, Jimmy! There you are.  
 Jimmy: Hey, Greg. How are you doing?  
 They shake hands.  
 Greg: I'll be a lot better once I get that cheque. Get this property deal close. Get my wife off my back.  
 Jimmy: I don't have it.  
 Greg: What do you mean you don't have it? What? Did you forget it?  
 Jimmy: Look. This isn't really the time or place. Why don't you stop by the office tomorrow and we'll talk about it?  
 Greg: (confused and upset) Talk about it? Talk about *what*?  
 Jimmy sees Marissa walking in with Ryan and Sandy.  
 Jimmy: Excuse me. (takes off after Marissa)  
 Greg: Jimmy -  
 In the fitting area. Julie is talking to Summer and Luke. She sees Marissa walking in.  
 Julie: I don't believe it.  
 Ryan talks softly to Marissa and gestures like he's going to go change. Marissa nods and smiles. Luke stalks towards Marissa.  
 Luke: You told Summer you weren't coming. Now you're here with him!  
 Marissa: No. Ryan and I aren't here together -  
 Luke: (cutting her off) No. No. No! I'm not an idiot!  
 Ryan: (walking up to them) Then listen to her and stop acting like one.  
 Luke: What did you say?  
 Ryan: Look, I -  
 Luke: No, no! (shoves Ryan in the chest, Marissa tries to placate him) What did you say!? Come on. Tell me what you said!  
 Marissa: Stop it!  
 Luke: (looking like he's going to cry) I'm over this. We're done. (takes off)  
 Shortly after, Julie and Marissa are talking while Ryan is watching them from afar. Anna walks up to Ryan.  
 Anna: Hey! Look who decided to show up. Oh, don't worry about it. Your hit man already took care of it. I didn't feel a thing!  
 Ryan: (looking sincerely sorry) I'm here now. If you want to, uh -  
 Anna: (sniffles dramatically) No. Too late. You missed your shot. (looks at Marissa and Julie) I guess you'll have to go with Princess Mononoke over there.  
 Ryan: What are you going to do?  
 Anna: Oh, so *now* you care? (winks at him) Go!  
 Julie: (to Marissa) Ugh, Marissa, if you'd just stuck to the original plan. (Marissa sighs) I'm sorry. Do you want me to have Daddy go find -  
 Marissa: No, Mom!  
 Julie: You can't make your debut without an escort.  
 Ryan: (walking up) I hear there's a white night available.  
 Julie: (looking at Ryan condescendingly) Well, it's very nice of you to offer, but... I don't think it's appropriate.  
 Marissa: (smiles happily at Ryan, then declares) I'll go get dressed. (takes off)  
 Ryan leaves too, leaving Julie simmering unhappily.  
 Outside in the hallway. Seth is sitting on the floor, curled up with his arms around his knees.  
 Anna: (walking up to him) Could you *be* any more pathetic? A lone figure, sitting on the floor, wondering if he's going to be lonely for the rest of his life.  
 Seth: (gets up, crossing his arms in front of his chest defensively) Oh. Your sensitivity it's really, uh... non-existant.  
 Anna: (stalks up to him) You know what your problem is? You're not a man.  
 Seth: (nods) Again. Not appreciating the brutal honesty.  
 Anna: Do you know what girls find sexy?  
 Seth: (sarcastically) Uh. Wait. Let me guess. Dudes who play water polo?  
 Anna: Confidence! Watch this. (slides up real close to him) Seth.  
 Seth: (nervously) Yes?  
 Anna: I don't have a date to the Cotillion. Would you be my escort?  
 Seth: (totally nervous) I - I mean - I, uh -  
 Anna: (brushing imaginary lint off his shoulder) Confidence, Cohen.  
 Seth: (nods) Let's do this.  
 In the back, all the girls are lined up. Julie is walking down the line.  
 Julie: Hair's good. Make up's good. Very nice. Stand up straight. Gum please.  
 Summer is complaining to Holly.  
 Summer: How did this happen? How did I go from having three dates to Cotillion to having none?!  
 Holly: (barely paying attention, adjusting her gloves) I'm sorry, girl. That blows.  
 Summer sighs, then catches sight of Seth walking in with Anna.  
 Summer: (walking up to Seth with a bright smile on her face) Good news! I'm available again!  
 Seth: You are.  
 Anna looks at him. And he looks back.  
 Seth: No. No. (does a weird dance) We're going to go this way. No.  
 He and Anna walk away.  
 Outside in the ballroom, Kirsten is reading the program at a table. Sandy walks up and sits next to her.  
 Sandy: Oh. Five hundred channels and nothing on.  
 Kirsten: You couldn't put on a tux?  
 Sandy: Pick your battles, honey.  
 On the stage, Peggy is with a microphone.  
 Peggy: Good evening, everyone. And welcome to the forty-seventh annual Newport Beach Debutant Cotillion. (applause)  
 In the fitting area, both Ryan and Marissa step out of changing rooms.  
 Marissa: Hey. (they walk up to each other) Are you ready to make your debut?  
 Ryan smiles nervously.  
 Cut to Marissa running up to meet the line of debutants.  
 Peggy: Holly Fisher. Daughter of Greg and Marianne Fisher.  
 Ryan joins the line of escorts behind Seth.  
 Greg walks up on stage and hands Holly over to her escort (there's bowing and curtsying).  
 Peggy: Anna Stern. Daughter of Cameron and Patricia Stern.  
 Anna walks up onto the stage, greets her dad. Seth comes up to get her. Kirsten and Sandy are applauding loudly. Anna and Seth walk down to the dance floor. Anna places her bouquet on a table with other bouquets.  
 Peggy: Marissa Cooper. Daughter of James and Julie Cooper.  
 Jimmy is on the stage with Marissa.  
 Jimmy: I love you, kiddo.  
 Marissa: I love you too, Daddy.  
 Julie looks proud. Ryan comes up, bows. Marissa curtsies back. She drops off her bouquet and they walk to the end of the dance floor.  
 Peggy: And now, ladies and gentlemen. Please join me in congratulating this year's debutants.  
 More applause. A waltz starts up. Marissa and Ryan start dancing.  
 Everyone is dancing as the crowd looks on. Jimmy as well.  
 Greg: (walking up to Jimmy) We never finished our conversation. I got to tell you, Jimmy, you got me a little concerned.  
 Jimmy: Believe me. It's nothing that can't wait until tomorrow. (jerks his head at the dance floor) Don't the girls look beautiful?  
 Ryan: (softly to Marissa) I hate dancing.  
 Marissa: Wow. Thanks.  
 Ryan: Oh no. Uhm. With you it's - it's (hey laugh nervously) not horrible.  
 Marissa: You're sweet.  
 Anna: (to Seth) Are you leading?  
 Seth: I'm trying.  
 Anna: Oooh. Attitude. I like that.  
 Greg is still trying to talk to Jimmy.  
 Greg: I - I've already put an offer, okay? I've got a mortgage on the house. The kids are in private school. Now, if there is problem, I need to know about it.  
 Jimmy: Now. Is not the time.  
 Greg: Jimmy! Where's my money? (Jimmy doesn't answer) I asked you a question - where's my money?  
 Jimmy: Look. I didn't want you to find out this way, but I don't have it.  
 Greg: What?!  
 Jimmy: I will. But I don't have it right now.  
 Greg: (getting loud) Well, if you don't have my money, then who has it?  
 Jimmy: Shhh. Look. (pulls Greg away) I promise I'm working on it, all right? There's been some bad investments, some bad accounting -  
 Greg: Whoa, whoa! Are you telling me you lost everything?  
 Jimmy: All right. Will you just keep it down?  
 Greg: No, I'm not going to keep it down. That is my money! That is my retirement! My kids tuition.  
 Jimmy: I'm sorry -  
 Greg punches Jimmy in the face.  
 Greg: You son of a bitch!  
 Julie gets up in alarm.  
 Greg is pounding Jimmy. Everyone stops and stares.  
 Marissa: Oh my God!  
 Greg: You thief! You took my money!  
 Greg has Jimmy pinned to the floor and is punching him. Sandy gets up and pulls Greg off. Greg punches Sandy in the face. Ryan lunges forward and pins Greg to the ground.  
 Greg: Get off me! (tries to get to Jimmy) You're a thief! You're a thief!  
 Sandy and someone else help restrain Greg.  
 Greg: Get off me! (shakes Sandy and other guy off) He's a thief!  
 Sandy: Leave. Now.  
 Greg: You're a thief.  
 Julie looks mortified.  
 Greg: (to everyone) He's a thief!  
 Marissa: (crouching over Jimmy) Dad.  
 Julie is at the table, a hand over her face.  
 Someone: Take it outside. Come on!  
 Later. The police are talking to people. Kirsten and Sandy are sitting at a table. Sandy has an icepack to his face.  
 Kirsten: I haven't seen you in a fight since... never.  
 Sandy: Now you know why.  
 Kirsten: What are you talking about? He sucker punched you. You didn't have to jump in like that. Defend Jimmy.  
 Sandy: Eh. I always had this thing for the underdog.  
 Kirsten smiles.  
 Sandy: After I fill out the police report, maybe we should go over and see how he's doing.  
 Kirsten laughs a little.  
 Ryan: (walking up to them) Hey. So, uh... sorry, I... I know I promised I wouldn't get into any fights.  
 Sandy: I think we can make an exception in this case. (looks to Kirsten for confirmation. She smiles. Then to Ryan) The police, however, are going to have some questions. And as your attorney, I advice you - get out of here.  
 Ryan: Thanks. (starts walking away)  
 Seth: (walking up to Ryan) Hey. Uhm. You don't mind if I walk your date home, do you?  
 They both look at Anna who is waiting in the sidelines.  
 Ryan: No.  
 Seth: Cool. That's quite a little debut you had tonight. You really know how to present yourself. Finally, a Cohen who can throw it down. (pokes Ryan in the stomach. Ryan cringes) You want to come with us?  
 Ryan: (glances at Anna) Uh. I'll just see you at home.  
 Seth: See you at home.  
 Ryan walks away. Seth and Anna walk together.  
 Seth: So, do you think I, uh, could get to see you again?  
 Anna: Mm. No.  
 Seth: Well. Okay.  
 Anna: No. It's just. I know this might sound kind of... wha
