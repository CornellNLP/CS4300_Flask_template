 Opening scene - Cohen's kitchen - shows a shot of Ryan looking worried, then Seth, then Sandy, then finally Kirsten at the fridge  
 Kirsten: I have three sesame and one plain (motions to rolls)  
 (shows close ups of Ryan, Seth & Sandy shaking their heads)  
 Kirsten: look we're not gonna hear from the hospital for a while, why don't you guys get showered and dressed, and you (to Ryan) can't be late for your meeting with the dean.  
 Sandy: I'll take em to school  
 Kirsten: (to Sandy) You can't be late for your first day  
 (nobody moves/leaves)  
 Kirsten: Well if we're not gonna eat lets-lets jus, let's just go.  
 (Kirsten heads out, Ryan and Seth get up and cross paths just as the phone rings. shows a close up of the phone ringing, then pans from Seth, to Sandy and then Ryan all looking worried)  
 CUT TO: The hospital - Marissa is in bed, and Jimmy is sitting by her bed side. Jimmy brushes hair out of her eyes then we see Sandy & Kirsten at the door of her room.  
 Sandy: (barely audible) Hey  
 Jimmy: Hey (getting up to shake his hand) she uhh she just fell back to sleep but she was awake and uhh aware  
 (Ryan sits down where Jimmy was)  
 Jimmy: (to Ryan) thanks for uh calling the hospital...finding her if they hadn't airlifted her out she uhh  
 Sandy: When can she go home?  
 Jimmy: Uhh they said in a-in a day or so, they wanna keep her under observation  
 Kirsten: That's hospital policy  
 (Julie walks in)  
 Julie: So I guess there's no need to worry right...I mean a teenage girl palms a dozen pain killers and washes it down with tequila...its perfectly normal right  
 (to Kirsten & Sandy) what are you doing here?  
 Jimmy: I called them  
 Julie: What Marissa needs right now is to be with her family...no visitors (looks at Ryan)  
 Sandy: Well let's go...we should go  
 Kirsten: (to Jimmy) If you need anything  
 Jimmy: Thanks  
 (Ryan stands, shows shots of Ryan, then Julie then Jimmy watching Marissa. then the Cohen's leaving the room)  
 CUT TO: Hospital corridor  
 Sandy: (to Ryan) Don't take it personally. Julies just been through...every parents nightmare  
 Kirsten: I'm sure she'll apologise  
 Sandy: (suprised) you are? Its Julie cooper we're talking about  
 (Julie walks up behind them)  
 Julie: Excuse me, Ryan can I talk to you for a sec  
 (Ryan walks over to her)  
 Julie: I don't know what happened in Mexico, but here's what I do know. Since you showed up Marissa's ben a wreck, comes home crying, doesn't want to go to her own catillion, having problems with her boyfriend(pause) and now you can add another shining accomplishment to your list of achievements. In addition to stealing cars, burning down houses and befriending wood be assassins (pause) You've almost killed my daughter  
 (Ryan looks shocked)  
 Ryan: You can blame me all you want (pause) but I would never do anything to hurt Marissa  
 (Julie looks un-phased and calm)  
 Julie: well you're not going to get the chance because you're never going to see her again, you even try and I'll make sure you're thrown back in juvi where you belong  
 (Julie walks away leaving Ryan stunned)  
 Theme song - California by Phantom Planet  
 The Harbor school - Kirsten, Seth & Ryan are walking  
 Seth: well, so wait, I don't get it Luke's the one that she should be blaming not you  
 Ryan: She doesn't know that  
 Seth: So why didn't you tell her  
 Ryan: I'm just glad Marissa's ok  
 Kirsten: Uhh guys I'm gonna check in with the events committee, so I'll catch up with you at the deans office  
 Seth: yeah  
 Kirsten: Ryan don't be nervous, you're gonna do great  
 (Ryan looks worried, Kirsten walks off leaving Ryan and Seth alone. Shows a shot of what Ryan is looking at)  
 Ryan: (stunned) This is school  
 Seth: Mm hmm. Ahh registration week Ryan, it's my favourite time of year because your fellow students aren't around to ruin it (kid walks past) except that one  
 Ryan: you guys have tennis courts and a swimming pool  
 Seth: I'm guessing you didn't at your old school  
 Ryan: ah, well we had a basketball hoop  
 CUT TO: A shot of the Harbor school Newport Beach logo, then pans to Seth and Ryan walking up to Kirsten who is with a group of teachers  
 Kirsten: oh hi guys  
 Seth: Hi Dr Tally, Miss Kimberly, how're you guys doin  
 (they don't say anything)  
 Seth: kay (walking away) my mums more popular then me, that's a little bit pathetic I realise. Oh hey, ah after your meeting we gotta get your photo taken for school ID  
 Ryan: Another mug shot  
 Seth: If you must be so cynical  
 CUT TO: Sandy getting his photo taken at what we assume is his new workplace. Rachel is with him.  
 Rachel: Oh yeah, that ones a keeper  
 Sandy: So when do we do the retina scan  
 Rachel: Friday  
 Sandy: (suprised) I was joking  
 Rachel: So was I, good thing we didn't hire you for your quick wit  
 Sandy: Well god doesn't give with 2 hands (I think that's what it says?)  
 Rachel: come on, time for you to meet your team. Ok you'll be assigned your researcher, two paralegals and a file clerk to do all the heavy lifting for you. Speaking of which let me show you our state of the art gym!  
 Sandy: Oh you guys have a gym  
 Rachel: You didn't at the PD's office?  
 Sandy: Oh, we had a basketball hoop  
 CUT TO: The Harbor school - Ryan and Kirsten are sitting outside the dean's office  
 Kirsten: Everything's gonna be fine  
 Ryan: (sigh) its just, it's you know at hales (I assume old school) you sorta showed up, no essays, interviews, tests (sigh)  
 Kirsten: Ryan the Harbor school is one of the best private prep schools in the country; if you graduate from here you can get into any college in the UC system, maybe even an Ivy League  
 Ryan: I don't really think I'm an Ivy League kinda guy  
 Kirsten: After a year or two here you will be  
 Ryan: college huh  
 Kirsten: Yeah  
 CUT TO: Seth walking up  
 Kirsten: (o/s to Seth) what'd you get?  
 Seth: Uhh AP history English calculus and physics and French four, good thing I don't have a life (to Ryan) what is wrong? Are you nervous?  
 Kirsten: Seth would you please tell Ryan that Dr Kim is very nice  
 Seth: Oh yeah, she is sweet!  
 (Ryan looks at them both, still worried. Dr Kim walks out)  
 Dr Kim: Kirsten, how are you?  
 Kirsten: Hi (shakes her hand) nice to see you  
 Dr Kim: Good to see you, Seth always interesting to see you. And you must be Ryan, why don't we step into my office.  
 CUT TO: Sandy's new office, He and Rachel walk in  
 Sandy: Well, this doesn't suck!  
 Rachel: That eloquence will serve you nicely on the stand  
 Sandy: Like you guys ever actually go to trial  
 Rachel: You're one of us now Sandy, better start wrappin your head around it (pause) so, is your family all excited about your first day?  
 Sandy: My wife LOVES being married to a corporate sell out, right-right-right- right, wrappin my head around it  
 (guy wheels in a trolley full of case files)  
 Sandy: You gotta be kidding me  
 Rachel: Yeah, I figured you'd wanna dive right in  
 (Sandy looks at one of the boxes)  
 Sandy: Chemical peel gone awry, fascinating, bad botox injection, noise complaint on a yacht  
 Rachel: scintillating  
 Sandy: In the pure sense of the word  
 Rachel: Don't be a snob  
 Sandy: Just defend them, right. rich people need lawyers to!  
 CUT TO: The Harbor school - Dr Kim's office with Ryan & Kirsten)  
 Dr Kim: (off screen) Weak grades, truancy  
 Dr Kim: notation regarding some criminal activity (sighs)  
 Kirsten: It was a misdemeanor, probation  
 Dr Kim: None the less, not exactly Harbor school material  
 Kirsten: Dr Kim Ryan's had alot to overcome, but Sandy and I feel that in the right environment he could really excel  
 Dr Kim: There's no doubt that Mr. Atwood has extraordinary promise. I'm just concerned that he hasn't had, adequate preparation for the rigors of our curriculum  
 Kirsten: Or are you concerned about the pressure from parents who don't want Ryan here  
 (Dr Kim looks suprised at what Kirsten said. Ryan looks impressed)  
 Dr Kim: That's definitely a consideration, but not a decisive one (Kirsten rolls her eyes) Kirsten you know as well as I do how bright and motivated our students are. those that aren't bred for USC go off to Harvard and Yale. I just think a place like Newport union might be a better fit for a student with Ryan's background  
 Ryan: My background? (Dr Kim looks suprised) (sighs) I can't change where I'm from but I can change where I'm going  
 Dr Kim: Ryan, you understand that if you did fail you would lose a year, not to mention self confidence  
 (Ryan scoffs)  
 Ryan: With all due respect Dr Kim, if you think not letting me in is gonna inspire self confidence (sincerely) Give me a shot  
 Dr Kim: You got great test scores. I definitely responded to your personal essay. Your grades are... borderline...but acceptable. If you could pass a placement exam...It's not an aptitude test, it measures your preparedness, what you've learnt not how bright you are  
 Ryan: Just tell me where and when!  
 The Harbor school - Seth at a group of tables reading, Summer walks up  
 Seth: Summer, hey  
 Summer: (smiling) Hi  
 (Seth motions for her to join him and she does)  
 Summer: It is so weird being in school right now, surrounded by all these people who have like...no idea  
 Seth: I know...have you talked to Marissa?  
 Summer: I spoke to her mom... you?  
 Seth: Ah, We went by this morning but she was sleeping (pause) I think she's gonna be ok though  
 Summer: I still can't believe it, you know... I thought she was dead  
 Seth: Me too...well hey maybe when she's feeling better we'll um, we'll take her out and try and cheer her up. Take her to a movie or, six flags that kinda thing  
 Summer: Yeah, I guess...  
 Seth: Maybe before then if you want ah, I don't know you and me could go see a movie...or something  
 (off screen girls say hi to Summer, and look weird as they see her with Seth)  
 Summer: Hey, guys  
 (Summer looks uncomfortable)  
 Summer: Look, Cohen, this years all messed up, I mean Marissa's in the hospital, I'll never speak to Luke or Holly again...you and I w  
 Seth: (cuts her off) Oh yeah its fine, we're back in school now old rules apply  
 (Seth looks hurt as he motions her to go)  
 Summer: (barely heard) sorry  
 CUT TO Marissa's hospital room - Jimmy walks in with coffee and hands it to Julie, Marissa is asleep  
 Jimmy: Strong sedative huh  
 Julie: Yeah, she needs to sleep (takes a sip of coffee) and we need to talk (gets up and moves close to the door) Look um Jimmy, you and I we need to present a united front. It's hard enough this forcing us to be in the same room together  
 Jimmy: Thanks Jules, you got a great, great bed side manner  
 Julie: Calling the Cohen's this morning was completely inappropriate. You know I don't like that Brian  
 (a close up of Marissa asleep)  
 Jimmy: (off screen) Ryan  
 Julie: (off screen) I don't want him anywhere near Marissa  
 (Marissa begins to stir)  
 Jimmy: (whispering) Marissa said it was an accident, ok there's-there's no one to blame  
 (Marissa opens her eyes, and listens, cut back to Julie & Jimmy)  
 Julie: well that's a convenient position to take considering you're the one who let her go to Tijuana in the first place  
 Jimmy: Oh, so uh now it's my fault?  
 Julie: You're the one who destroyed this family Jimmy, you lied to us, you stole money from your clients and your friends. Why do you think she took all those pills?  
 Jimmy: (scoffs, whispers) You cannot honestly believe that  
 Julie: I left her in your care for one weekend and look what happened...which is why I'm asking the judge for sole custody  
 (Jimmy looks shocked, a close up of a shocked Marissa is shown)  
 Jimmy: Julie, come on, you can't  
 Julie: Getting the girls away from you is my only chance to give them back some semblance of a life, and if you fight me on this I'll take you to court and you'll be lucky if you even get supervised visitation  
 Jimmy: Yeah well you're gonna have to because (whispers) I am not giving up my kids  
 Julie: You may not have a choice (off screen - a close up of Marissa with her eyes closed, and a tear rolling down her face) I'm going back to check on Caitlyn and the sitter. You should get cleaned up, you're a wreck  
 (Marissa opens her eyes, waits for Jimmy to leave then gets her mobile out of the drawer, she is clearly upset)  
 CUT TO: The pool house - Ryan is studying an old test of Seth's and Seth is talking to him  
 Seth: It's a good thing I never thrown anything away, the questions are different but you get the idea  
 Ryan: Yeah, that I'm gonna fail  
 Seth: Hey, no you're not gonna fail ok, you have to get in. I will not spend another year at that school alone, ok please, thankyou. study. (pauses) Especially though, if all it takes is a couple a cheerleaders walking by and suddenly it's like mmm Summer and I we jus, we just didn't happen  
 (Ryan looks at him)  
 Seth: Sorry, you study (pause) here's the thing though Ryan (Ryan looks frustrated) we connected, right we connected and it was awesome, especially the part where she kissed me, I do believe I might've ma  
 Ryan: Seth! I have two hours until I take this test, so unless you plan on attending Newport union high wi  
 Seth: Right, got it less talking more study  
 (phone rings and they both look at it)  
 Seth: Don't move! I'm gonna get that, you...keep studying  
 Hello...hey Marissa, hi um yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah sorry sure  
 (Seth hands the phone to Ryan)  
 Ryan: Hey...o, ok...alright, um ok ill be there, bye (to Seth) she's upset, something with her parents, an her moms going home for a little while so  
 Seth: wh, what about the test?  
 Ryan: I'llll be there I'll just have to do the best that I can  
 Seth: wel, hey not to bum you out but what if that's not good enough?  
 Ryan: Well then... Dr Kim is right (walking out) I'm not Harbor school material  
 (Seth now looks frustrated)  
 CUT TO: Marissa's hospital room - Marissa is sitting up in bed, and Ryan knocks, Marissa smiles when she sees him and he walks in with flowers and sits next to her bed  
 Ryan: Hey  
 Marissa: Hi!  
 Ryan: These are for you, uh its all they had left at the gift shop...I'll just uh  
 Marissa: I'm sorry...I was so dumb...what I did I  
 Ryan: hey-hey-hey-hey, don't worry  
 Marissa: wasn't (sincerely) I didn't wanna kill myself...I didn't...I just wanted to...escape  
 Ryan: yeah, I know  
 (Ryan and Marissa both smile, then they hear Julie talking to a nurse and both look worried)  
 Julie: (off screen) Excuse me nurse, when you get a chance lunch please  
 Marissa: (to Ryan) you should... (motions to hide)  
 (Ryan quickly runs into the bathroom, just before Julie walks in)  
 Julie: Ooh, sweetie you're awake, aw, how are you feeling? your sister sends her love  
 Marissa: mm (frowning) my throat hurts  
 Julie: It's because they had to pump your stomach honey (sees the flowers) Where did that thing come from?  
 Marissa: oh I, I don't know  
 Julie: It's from him (shot of Ryan) he came here didn't he after I told him not to, after everything he's done to y  
 Marissa: He didn't, I, it wasn't his fault  
 Julie: Honey you keep saying that but before he got here (shot of Ryan) you were happy  
 Marissa: You think I was happy?  
 Julie: Well if you weren't you never told me about it  
 Marissa: I tried! but y  
 Julie: (cuts her off) I need to talk to the nurse, the security in here is appalling  
 (Julie leaves and Ryan comes out)  
 Marissa: I'm sorry about that y, you know about her  
 Ryan: that's ok, I should go and take this test but I'll be back first chance I get  
 Marissa: I don't know...with my mom I  
 Ryan: I'm not afraid of your mom  
 Marissa: Well, I am  
 CUT TO Cohen's kitchen - Seth is reading a comic and Kirsten walks in  
 Kirsten: Did you ask, Ryan what he wants for lunch  
 Seth: He doesn't want any, he's on a diet  
 Kirsten: why is he on a diet?  
 Seth: WHY is he on a diet?  
 Kirsten: Well I'm gonna ask him because I wanna see how he's doing on his  
 Seth: mom-mom-mom-mom-mom (grabs her as she walks past) uh he's in a state of deep-deep-deep zen like concentration right now, ok  
 Kirsten: Well he still needs to eat  
 Seth: (desperate to stop her) HES NAKED! alright...he's naked, he studies in the nude it's a Chino thing, ok and I think that if you were to walk in on him...naked and dad was to find out I think that suspicions might be raised. a house divided... will not stand!  
 (door bell)  
 Kirsten: You and I still need to talk about your little suprise trip to Tijuana!  
 Seth: Ok, I can't wait  
 (Kirsten opens the front door, its Jimmy)  
 Kirsten: Jimmy hi, is Marissa ok?  
 Jimmy: Yeah she's-she's doing better thanks uh its Julie who's giving me the problem...is Sandy coming home for lunch?  
 Kirsten: Uh n, no he-he just started a-a new job today why what's going on?  
 Jimmy: Uh she's suing me...for sole custody, maybe even supervised visits  
 Kirsten: Why would she do that?  
 Jimmy: Well my question is can she, I just need to know what kind of shot I have at joint custody given what I've put my family through...I just wanna know what kind of case she has  
 Kirsten: Come on in, I'll get Sandy's new number  
 Jimmy: I'll just uh, I'll-I'll wait out here, I mean, y know

 CUT TO Marissa's hospital room - Marissa is on her mobile listening to her dad's answering machine msg  
 Answering machine message: Hi you've reached Jimmy Cooper, I'm not in right now but please leave a message and ill get back...  
 (Marissa hides the phone when she hears the door open)  
 Julie: Security said they'd do what they can but I don't know...you know this is exactly why I thought Sandiego would be good for you  
 (Marissa looks confused)  
 Marissa: Sandiego?  
 Julie: Dr Bourke has a facility there  
 Marissa: who's Dr Bourke?  
 Julie: oh well uh she's a psychiatrist, highly recommended, she runs an institute for young women who are troubled  
 Marissa: You're sending me to a mental institution  
 Julie: It's a recovery centre... oh honey...I know you don't understand but...I would rather have you hate me now then risk losing you again  
 Marissa: Does dad know about this?  
 Julie: well I think some time away from your father would be good for you to  
 Marissa: well...what if I don't wanna go  
 Julie: That's for Dr Bourke to decide, she'll be here after lunch to evaluate you. Please honey just talk to her, let her help you...and then we can get you out of here and you can start to get better  
 Marissa: Yeah, um if it's ok I just need to use the bathroom

 Seth: Captain oats, what are you doing here?  
 (Summer puts captain oats down)  
 Summer: Coop just called, she's freaking out, her moms threatening to ship her off to the insane asylum  
 Seth: really?  
 Summer: Yeah, I'm serious, I've gotta do something Cohen, I need to get radical...I need Ryan  
 Seth: well you can't have him he's taking a placement exam, what's wrong with me though, am I not radical enough?

 CUT TO Sandy's office - Sandy is on the phone and Rachel walks in  
 Sandy: (on the phone) No, it's a very fair offer given the merits of the case...ok (Rachel rolls her hands at him as if to say speed it up)...I'll think it over, goodbye  
 Sandy: My wife does that thing with her hands when she, she's really pissed off with me  
 Rachel: Your wife and I have alot in common...you've been here half a day and you've booked court dates for 5 of the 7 cases you were assigned  
 Sandy: Do I win the free set of steak knives?  
 Rachel: Sandy, this isn't how they do things around here and I could keep this off the partners radar for now but you've gotta understand  
 Sandy: Understand what? I'm going to court, I'm takin em on, I'm bringing em down, especially this b*st*rd who won't let his neighbour grow his hedges over his own fence  
 Rachel: look, you know how much time and energy goes into trying one of these, if you settled you could handle twice as many cases and we're in a volume business here  
 Sandy: Like cosco...look I, I thought the whole reason you brought me here is cause you wanted a trial attourney, you know who's committed and passionate and blah blah blah  
 Rachel: Yes and when one of these cases actually deserves to go before a jury the courtroom is all yours, but in the meantime I need you to pick up the phone and passionately negotiate some settlements (Sandy laughs) Come on I put my ass on the line to get you this gig, please, do it for me  
 CUT TO: The Harbor school - Ryan is doing his test; Seth & Summer walk in and interrupt it)

 Dr Kim: WHAT is going on in here?  
 Seth: Hi Dr Kim, this is not what it looks like but there's kind of an emergency  
 Summer: Yeah we just need to borrow Ryan for a little while  
 Seth: (over summer) we're gonna bring him back  
 Dr Kim: Ryan is not going anywhere  
 (Seth and Summer talk at the same time)  
 Seth: ok, but there's kind of an emergency  
 Summer: you don't understand  
 Dr Kim: you two out, out now, goodbye, goodbye  
 (Dr Kim shuts the door)  
 Ryan: Actually I gotta go to  
 Dr Kim: Have you finished the test?  
 Ryan: no but I  
 Dr Kim: Ryan if this is to difficult tell me, if the Cohen's are pressuring you to go to this school  
 Ryan: its not to difficult and they're not, I wanna be here  
 Dr Kim: then prove it, sit down finish the test  
 Ryan: I can't  
 Dr Kim: Ryan if this is the level of commitment you plan to bring to your studies here at the Harbor school  
 Ryan: Dr Kim I really don't have time to argue with you right now  
 Dr Kim: There is no argument, you walk away from this test, you walk away from this school  
 (Ryan thinks for a second)  
 Ryan: you're probably right, it wouldn't of worked out anyway, sorry for wasting your time  
 (Ryan leaves)  
 (Seth and Summer are waiting for him outside)  
 Ryan: Let's go  
 
 
 
 CUT TO: Marissa's hospital room - Marissa is sitting in a chair with her arms crossed; clearly not wanting to be there, Dr Bourke is asking her questions  
 Dr Bourke: So your mother tells me you struggled with anorexia in the ninth grade  
 Marissa: my moms convinced it was anorexia...it was just tennis season, I was really stressed, that's all.  
 Dr Bourke: And tenth grade you were caught shop lifting  
 Marissa: it was just a lighter and a pack of cigarettes  
 Dr Bourke: Do you still smoke?  
 Marissa: Not really  
 Dr Bourke: Drink?... would you say you drink alot?  
 Marissa: I guess I mean what's alot  
 Dr Bourke: have you ever had so much to drink that you blacked out (Marissa doesn't answer) Tell me about this passed year, your dad's legal troubles bankruptcy, your parents separating...homes probably the last place you wanna be right? (Marissa shrugs) your mom mentioned a boyfriend, Luke  
 Marissa: he's not my boyfriend anymore  
 Dr Bourke: really, you wanna tell me what happened?  
 Marissa: anything I say your just gonna use against me to prove to my mom that I'm troubled, right  
 Dr Bourke: I'm not here to judge; I'm here to listen and try to help  
 Marissa: You're here because my mom would rather have me shipped off to a mental institution then have to deal with what's really going on  
 Dr Bourke: I'm here because accidentally or not, you nearly killed yourself (pause) and you wanna tell me what's actually going on? with you and your mom  
 Marissa: (shrugs) how much time do you have?  
 Hospital corridor - Ryan & Seth are waiting for Summer  
 Seth: This isn't good man, Summer should have been here by now  
 Ryan: She better be here soon  
 Seth: well what if something happened? right I mean Marissa's dad can't even get her outta here how are we supposed to be able to  
 Ryan: not by waiting for Summer (walks over to receptionist) Hi we're here for Marissa Cooper  
 (a shot of Summer wearing a candy stripers outfit)  
 Summer: uh its ok Denise, they're with me.  
 Seth: good--lord  
 Summer: what? I told you I was a candy striper  
 Seth: I...thought you were kidding  
 Summer: It's for charity, all the girls do it  
 Seth: I should be hospitalised more, I  
 Summer: Well if you need any help!  
 Ryan: Ok guys (to Summer) can you get us in the psych ward or not?  
 Summer: Just try to keep up with me  
 Ryan: Cool, Seth your on lookout  
 Summer: Hi Gloria, I know it's my day off but I just cannot get enough of sick people, these guys are gonna help me with the sponge baths  
 Seth: hmm, dibs on that guy!  
 Still at the hospital - Dr Bourke is talking to Jimmy & Julie about Marissa  
 Dr Bourke: I'm not saying that we need to keep her on suicide watch but there are definitely some underlying issues that she hasn't been dealing with  
 Julie: but you can help her?  
 Dr Bourke: I can recommend further treatment, psycho dynamic therapy, group work  
 Julie: at the institute  
 Dr Bourke: At the institute or here in Newport I see patients or I can refer you  
 Julie: no-no I want her to get out of Newport it's too chaotic for her here right now  
 Jimmy: She can't leave now she's got school, she's got her friends, I think uprooting her now would do more harm then good  
 Julie: She almost died Jimmy how much more harm can she do
