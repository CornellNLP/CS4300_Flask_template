 Caleb: (to guys) excuse me guys, thanks

 Ryan: i'll be right back i'm gonna give Seth his letter (walks off)  
 Theresa: o-ok ill be here tryin'a spot the chin implants  
 (we see Eddie coming towards the back door)  
 Caleb: (in the background) where as my story has its own cast of characters (Marissa looks over & sees him, she looks worried) one doesn't become Riviera man of the year without some help (Eddie is now outside amongst the crowd, Marissa looks over to him, frowning) where would I be without my wonderful family (points) my beautiful daughter Kirsten, an my favourite- well my only grandson Seth, come join me  
 (Seth makes a 'do I have to' face but gets up reluctantly. Eddie walks over to Theresa)  
 Theresa: what're you doing here?  
 Eddie: (softly) I just wanna talk to you, cant you listen  
 (Ryan sees and rushes in their direction. camera goes back to Caleb who now has Seth and Kirsten by his sides)  
 Eddie: lets go somewhere an figure this out (grabs her arm)  
 Theresa: (pulls away) i'm not going anywhere-  
 (Ryan tries to pull Eddie away from Theresa)  
 Eddie: you stay the hell away from me ok you're lucky I don't kick your ass right here (to Theresa) look can we please just go (grabs her again)  
 Theresa: let go!  
 (Ryan tries to get Eddie away again, Eddie turns around and punches Ryan, Ryan falls into a table of food which crashes to the floor - everyone screams - Seth and Kirsten look worried, Caleb closes his eyes as if he's mortified by it - Jimmy turns around to see what happened - Luke Summer and Marissa are standing together, they all look worried - Ryan gets up off the floor and runs at Eddie knocking him onto a table that was holding drinks, glass smashes and everyone gaps)  
 Caleb: what the hell is going on (Kirsten & Seth lean forward worried)  
 (Ryan and Eddie are standing again, they both knock into a servant, and he ends up on the floor. Ryan and Eddie are on the ground kinda of wrestling each other - Luke goes over to them - Eddie stands Ryan up and punches him which sends him flying into the pool - Luke comes up behind Eddie and grabs him, Jimmy and Sandy are also standing there)  
 Sandy: why don't you leave right now before the cops get here alright?  
 Eddie: (yells to Ryan) your dead!  
 (Ryan is in the pool)  
 Sandy: right now!  
 Eddie: (still yelling) don't ever come home, your dead you hear me, get offa me man (Luke lets him go)  
 (Sandy goes to the edge of the pool, Ryan is still in the pool just floating there - Theresa looks upset - Ryan still in the pool)  
 CUT TO: Cohen living room - Ryan has an ice bag on his eye and he's sitting in a chair, Kirsten and Theresa are sitting on the couch near by and Sandy is sitting on the end of the coffee table  
 Sandy: oh that's gonna be quite a shiner, but hey (taps Ryan's leg) they look good on ya  
 Ryan: yeah? thanks  
 Theresa: (upset) i'm so sorry, about everything  
 Kirsten: oh its ok sweetie, it's not your fault

 (Ryan and Theresa look at each other, Seth and Summer come in)  
 Seth: you ok?  
 Ryan: (sighs) eh  
 (Seth and Summer are both sitting where Sandy was  
 Seth: (sighs) I cant believe Anna didn't show  
 Ryan: eh actually um (takes the now soggy envelope out & hands it to Seth)  
 Seth: your jus giving me this now  
 Ryan: I was a little distracted  
 Seth: (looking at it) (panics) the inks all smudged, I can't even read it (walks to the kitchen, Summer follows) is that a V or a Q? (to Summer) here, here look right there, first that says 'I love you' but then what is that word right there 'Azerbaijan' Aztecs'?  
 Summer: asprin  
 Seth: you think it says asprin  
 Summer: no, you're giving me a headache  
 Seth: ok coincidence, confucius, what is this C word  
 Summer: confusing?  
 Seth: you think it says confusing  
 Summer: (frustrated) no you're confusing me, what'do you care what it says  
 Seth: Summer Anna couldn't even say goodbye ta me alright an I think she's leaving because'a me, I don't want it ta happen  
 Summer: what is going on, last week your standing on a coffee cart declaring your eternal love for me, now your all like 'Anna's letter, I cant read it'  
 Seth: Summer, this isn't like that ok, she's jus my friend an I don't want her ta leave  
 Summer: then go...stop her  
 (Seth kisses her on the forehead and leaves the room. Ryan and Theresa are talking in the living room)  
 Ryan: so what're you gonna do?  
 Theresa: I need ta call Eddie...try an straighten everything out  
 Ryan: its gonna be ok  
 (Seth rushes in)  
 Seth: hey man uh i'm sorry ta interrupt I need you to drive me to the airport, I gotta stop Anna from leaving  
 Ryan: what you can't drive yourself  
 Seth: dude i've had like 3 glasses of champagne ok, you know how it goes straight ta my head, please  
 Theresa: you should go, he needs you  
 Seth: thankyou very much (rushes off)  
 (Ryan and Theresa stand)  
 Ryan: you're uh you're gonna be at the motel when I get back  
 Theresa: (nods) I don't want you to be late  
 (Ryan leaves, Theresa watches with a sad look on her face. Back outside, Julie is standing by herself and Caleb walks over)  
 Caleb: hey Juju (kisses her on the cheek) I was wondering if you were gonna ignore me all night  
 Julie: you seemed busy...congratulations  
 Caleb: thanks for coming, can I drive you home  
 Julie: I can walk down the driveway  
 Caleb: can I call you...take you out on a real date, things have gotten a bit crazy an I know I didn't appreciate you, I want to. I wanna make you feel appreciated  
 Julie: plan the perfect date...run it by me...we'll see  
 (Caleb smiles, Julie smiles and walks off, Caleb watches her go)  
 CUT TO: Ryan and Seth in the car driving to the airport, Seth is panicking  
 Seth: come on man, her flight leaves soon  
 Ryan: i'm doin 75 in a 65 alright  
 Seth: (girly voice) i'm doin 75 in a 60- (normal) everyone knows 80's the new 75  
 Ryan: what? who talks like that!  
 Seth: what is up with this a.c, my jewfro's frizzin out I look like Screech  
 Ryan: the a.c's fine  
 Seth: what is this music?  
 Ryan: (had enough) do - not insult Journey, alright  
 {side note, its interesting to see that Seth is on the giving end of what Summer did to him way back in 107:The Escape, the 2 scenes are almost identical except Ryan was nice enough not to kick Seth out of the car,lol}  
 CUT TO: Jimmy's house - Marissa answers the door and it's Theresa  
 Marissa: hey...how are you  
 Theresa: just embarrassed, I can't believe it this huge fight at a fancy party  
 Marissa: actually not the first time that's happened  
 Theresa: hm here (hands her the dress) um i'm not gonna have time ta get it dry cleaned before I go  
 Marissa: (shocked) before you go?  
 Theresa: i've ben fooling myself thinking this was gonna be easy...I made a huge mess of everything and (shrugs) I have this whole life ta figure out an so so does Ryan so...take care of him, ill see you (leaves)  
 (Marissa is speechless)  
 CUT TO: Cohen bedroom - Sandy is in there getting ready for bed and Kirsten comes in  
 Kirsten: I talked ta my dad, he told me what you did  
 Sandy: (nods) obstructed justice...tampered with a witness  
 Kirsten: so what happens now?  
 Sandy: my guess is not much, since it's an election year the DA can't afford ta lose an without their start witness they don't really have a case, if your gonna go after the king, Caleb...then you had better know that you can kill the king  
 Kirsten: I told you that I didn't want you ta get involved  
 Sandy: I will always do what's before for my family  
 Kirsten: i'd rather go ta jail than be responsible for you being mixed up in this, getting inta bed with my father  
 Sandy: I promise ya, i'd rather send you ta jail than get inta bed with your father  
 (Kirsten smiles and sits next to him)  
 Kirsten: you do something like this, there's no going back  
 Sandy: yeah, its kinda like prom night...believe me, if anybody's gonna be puttin you in handcuffs...it's gonna be me (smiles)  
 (Kirsten laughs and puts her head on his shoulder, Sandy puts his arm around her)  
 CUT TO: Ryan pulling up outside the airport. Seth jumps out and runs for the door, he grabs a pamphlet from a monk guy and throws it on the ground inside. he stops just inside the door and looks around urgently. he runs towards the security bit  
 Seth: (yells) Anna!  
 (Anna looks over and sees him)  
 Seth: Anna wait!  
 Anna: (smiles) Seth? (to the security guy) hold on (runs over to him) Seth what're you doing here  
 Seth: (breathless) ok maybe...its jus the champagne talking but i'm jus gonna say it ok. please do not leave because'a me  
 Anna: (confused) what, what are you-  
 Seth: (pulls out the letter) look you love me, I read it an I get it ok an i'm so sorry if I did anything ta hurt your feelings or cause this but I don't want ya ta leave ok none of us do  
 Anna: Seth! I love you...as a friend  
 Seth: (swallows) what?  
 Anna: god I love you as a friend  
 Seth: it doesn't say 'Azerbaijan' (Anna shakes her head)  
 Anna: (teary) look I think your an amazing guy, a little self absorbed maybe (smiles) ...but great, but I mean if there's one thing that our relationship taught me it's that...we don't have alotta chemistry  
 Seth: so you're not leaving because'a me  
 Anna: i'm leaving cause I need ta leave (Seth nods) but who knows, maybe one day we'll be perfect for each other (shakes her head) I don't know (Seth looks at her, sad) I do know I have to go'ta Pittsburgh...i'm lonely Seth, I thought I could make this my home but I cant...thanks for coming... (touches his chin) an saying goodbye  
 (Seth nods, Anna hugs him, they both close their eyes and hold each other tightly. they stop hugging and look at each other, Anna lets go of his hand and begins to walk back to the security bit)  
 Seth: (teary) Anna wait a second (walking to the glass) what am I gonna do without you huh who am I gonna play Jenga with. your so wise in all your sage wisdom, what am I gonna do without that (shakes his head)  
 Anna: (crying) confidence, Cohen  
 (Anna begins to walk away, she looks back at him then continues walking. Seth stands at the glass crying)  
 Seth: (bangs) Anna!  
 (Anna turns back and smiles, Seth looks at her, Anna smiles again still teary and walks towards the boarding bit. Seth puts his nose on the glass and shuts his eyes {he looks so lost here, poor guy} Anna continues walking and she disappears in the crowd. Seth watches her go, he is devastated)  
 CUT TO: Mermaid Inn - Ryan and Seth pull up in the car  
 Ryan: ill be right back (gets out)  
 (Seth is sitting in the car, still sad. Ryan looks through the window of Theresa's room and a woman is in there vacuuming, all of Theresa's stuff is gone. Ryan walks away - Ryan and Seth are now sitting on a bench somewhere eating pizza)  
 Seth: what if the girl i'm spose'ta be with jus went back ta Pittsburgh  
 Ryan: what if she went back ta Chino  
 Seth: (playing) why would Anna go ta Chino (Ryan looks at him) i'm kidding come on  
 Ryan: nice one...well, at least we have each other  
 Seth: actually I have Summer now...but uh ill put a little Seth-Ryan time on the books, that's quality time  
 Ryan: thanks buddy, I could always hang out with Luke, what'do you think he's doin right now?  
 Seth: um discovering fire? hunting an gathering? shaving his chest with a buck knife, you guys could do that together
