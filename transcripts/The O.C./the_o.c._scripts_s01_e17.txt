 Anna: wow, you take Israeli self defense ill take muscle-cars (they high five)

 Jimmy: well that one liked me  
 Sandy: (smiles) you were drunk  
 Jimmy: that's my point, we cannot - open a restaurant, that's crazy

 Kirsten: that's even less likely then lunch  
 Julie: (not giving up) movie?  
 Kirsten: no  
 Julie: coffee?  
 Kirsten: (sighs) Julie I really appreciate your desire to be such good friends, but the thing about good friends is that when they want something, they just ask  
 Julie: the interior design job, I know it's available I want it  
 Kirsten: (nods) ah-huh I-I thought you wanted me to water your plants or baby-sit Caitlyn  
 Julie: right because you don't take me seriously as a working woman as a designer  
 Kirsten: you're not really experienced, qualified  
 Julie: before I had Marissa I was doing lots of design work  
 Kirsten: you had Marissa when you were eighteen  
 Julie: (smiles) I know your usual model home designer fell out at the last minute, I know you have no one (Kirsten looks at her) Caleb pillow talk, he thought the idea was inspired  
 Kirsten: well it-it's definitely thinking outside the box

 (Kirsten closes her eyes)  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Summer, Anna, Luke and Danny are eating lunch at the tables, Seth comes over with his. they are all laughing hysterically

 CUT TO: The student lounge - Ryan is sitting, studying with his books and Oliver comes in  
 Oliver: hey (Ryan looks up) is this seat available?  
 Ryan: ah sure yeah  
 Oliver: (sits & puts his books down) wow whoo I'm so behind already  
 Ryan: (still working) I know the feeling  
 Oliver: does junior year ever get easier  
 Ryan: thought you were a senior  
 Oliver: not a good one an Harbor being as competitive as it is, not all my credits transferred  
 Ryan: but you still wanted to come here  
 Oliver: wasn't up to me, my parents insisted, put the paperwork in a while ago  
 Ryan: why transfer at all, a little over a semester from graduating  
 Oliver: jus wasn't...workin for me at pacific  
 Ryan: because  
 Oliver: because...there was an...incident  
 Ryan: what kinda incident  
 Oliver: ...look I've made some mistakes in my life, I don't think that's a suprise or a secret but if (sits forward) if you could jus give me a chance Ryan jus (Ryan looks at him) let me in like I know people let you in...I could finally start over, that's really all I want  
 (they both look at each other. Marissa comes in)  
 Marissa: hey guys  
 Ryan: hey  
 Oliver: hey  
 Marissa: (sits next to Ryan) oh so Ryan I thought maybe we could go to Oliver's after school  
 Oliver: order in some room service  
 Marissa: (smiles) yeah you wanna come...I was gonna help him with his French (Oliver smiles)  
 Ryan: French? didn't you live in Paris for a couple'a years  
 Oliver: a year when I was thirteen  
 Ryan: oh you need Marissa to help you  
 Oliver: well sweet talkin my way into a club isn't the same as conjugating the infinitive  
 Ryan: right you guys go ahead I told Seth I'd meet him back home  
 (Oliver & Marissa stand up, Oliver offers his hand to Ryan to shake it, Ryan hesitates then stands up and shakes his hand. Marissa smiles, Oliver smiles, Ryan half smiles)  
 Marissa: (to Ryan) you sure you don't wanna come  
 Ryan: yeah, I trust you  
 Marissa: (kisses Ryan on the cheek) you should  
 (Marissa & Oliver walk out. Ryan watches them & Oliver looks back and smiles at Ryan)  
 CUT TO: The Cohen house - Ryan and Seth are playing the playstation in the living room, Sandy and Kirsten are setting the table in the dining room  
 Seth: I don't trust him  
 Sandy: trust who?  
 Seth: Summers new (unsure) boyfriend or whatever, somethin jus sorta seems off about him  
 Kirsten: off how?  
 Seth: I don't know, he's jus not funny (to Ryan) you know who I'm talkin about right, he's big (Ryan sighs) but big isn't necessarily funny, it's cheap  
 Ryan: (worried) he said there was an incident  
 Seth: big funny guy did?  
 Ryan: no Oliver  
 Seth: (rolls his eyes) ugh dude please can we forget Oliver for five seconds an talk about me  
 Ryan: it's the reason he left pacific w-w-what if he's violent  
 Seth: gee new guy shows up violent, angry prone to punching people that'd be really weird  
 Ryan: he needs Marissa to help him with his French, he lived in France  
 Seth: ok your right we should call the cops cause Oliver lost his grasp on the subjunctive  
 Sandy: fajitas are served  
 Seth: (looks) oooo  
 Ryan: (sits forward) nothing adds up an if I try to say anything ta Marissa  
 Seth: mm-mm  
 Ryan: maybe there's somebody I could talk to, try to figure out what happened  
 Seth: yeah ok or you can jus break into the file room an steal his bio ok...or you can be a grown up forget about it an move on ok like I am, to the fajitas (gets up)  
 (Ryan sits there, he looks as though he's thinking)  
 CUT TO: Ryan riding his bike, its night - he stops out the front of a building and gets off. a security guard is there  
 S.G: hey can I help you  
 Ryan: I-I forgot a book in my locker (shows the guard his school I.D)  
 S.G: (nods) (unlocks the door) alright it's open, make it quick  
 (Ryan goes up the stairs and through the door, the guard shuts the door behind him and stays outside. Ryan is now in the halls he goes to a door that says 'file storage' and opens it. he looks both ways before going in. he shuts the door and turns on a small flash light. he walks around till he finds the right file cabinet. opens the drawer and finds Oliver files. he puts it on top of the drawer. he opens it up and we see a photo of Oliver, on the left hand side there is a letter that has 'CONFIDENTIAL' in big red letters. Ryan starts reading the letter then the guard busts him)  
 S.G: (shines his torch) hey what're you doing  
 (Ryan shuts the file & looks stunned at the guard)  
 CUT TO: Harbor school the next day - Ryan, Sandy and Kirsten are in Dr Kim's office  
 Dr Kim: I don't think I need to explain what a serious offence this is  
 Kirsten: we understand and believe me when I tell you Ryan will be punished  
 Dr Kim: I'm afraid it won't end there, this matter will be presented to the disciplinary committee, suspension even expulsion are not out of the question  
 Sandy: of course the school must do what it deems appropriate but I beg ya to understand that this is very uncharacteristic of Ryan  
 Dr Kim: indeed Mr. Atwood an Harbor seemed like a remarkably good fit, which leads me to wonder (to Ryan) why would you do this  
 Ryan: I jus...I don't trust this kid, Oliver, he seems suspicious and suddenly he's going here now  
 Dr Kim: I assure you Oliver went through the same screening process as any other student here  
 Ryan: he has a history of instability, I was concerned...for Marissa  
 Dr Kim: has he ever made any threats to her, anything to warrant your suspicions  
 Ryan: no but he's ben spending alotta time with her (Dr Kim just looks at him) and um there's this letter in his file  
 Dr Kim: a confidential letter (raises her eyebrows)  
 Ryan: that says they found him - in the men's bathroom at Pacific - having cut his wrists (Sandy & Kirsten look at Ryan) over a girl (to Sandy & Kirsten) she filed a restraining order that's why he left  
 Kirsten: (to Dr Kim) is this true  
 Dr Kim: two years ago, since then he's ben institutionalised an everyone involved in Mr. Trask's rehabilitation believed his best chance was a change in his environment  
 Sandy: and the school was receptive to him, despite his history  
 Dr Kim: Harbor is known to make exceptions for students with troubled backgrounds (Ryan shuts his eyes) but who show extraordinary promise  
 Ryan: I'm sorry  
 Kirsten: we are too  
 Dr Kim: (to Ryan) we will see you at three pm for detention which you will attend every day until the committee reaches its verdict  
 Sandy: (stands) well thankyou Dr Kim (shakes her hand)  
 Kirsten: thankyou (shakes her hand)  
 CUT TO: Anna in the halls, she's waiting for Seth. Seth comes out of a classroom  
 Anna: Seth! (happy) hey!  
 Seth: (smiles) hey  
 Anna: I have a suprise for you

 Anna: (holds up tickets) two tickets to see bright eyes, we've never seen em before so I thought 'd be different, right  
 Seth: Anna bright eyes, really  
 Anna: yes, yes

 Danny: Summer you got, right there (points to her skirt)  
 Summer: (looks down) where?  
 Danny: (flicks her in the nose, remember that old joke?) ooooh

 Anna: hey

 Danny: (not giving up) Seth seriously all kidding aside you've got something there and I think you're gonna wanna clean it up  
 (Seth looks at him, Danny looks at Seth then moves his eyes in the direct he's pointing, does it again and Seth doesn't look down)  
 Anna: Seth... you do have something there  
 Seth: (looks at Anna, then down) what  
 (Danny makes a noise then flicks his finger up which goes in Seth's nose. Anna bursts out laughing, as does Summer)  
 Seth: (fake laughs) you got me, you got me  
 (Danny & Anna high five each other)  
 Summer: (still laughing) god isn't he like the funniest guy ever  
 Anna: yeah  
 Danny: (to Summer as they are walking away) hey you wanna come over later I Tivo'd lenno

 Seth: why this Danny guy is so not funny  
 Anna: he's funny  
 Seth: no he's not funny ok he's big, big is not funny  
 Anna: whatever (holds the tickets) Seth Friday night bright eyes  
 Seth: anyone can be big that's kinda my point right, bein obvious there's no accomplishment (Anna looks at him) in that (Anna looks down) what?  
 Anna: you're jealous  
 Seth: (mouth open) of Danny's comedy, no sweetie (brushes her hair out of her eyes) I'm not  
 Anna: no, of Danny, if you weren't you'd be happy for Summer, you'd embrace the friend  
 (Seth scrunches up his face & Anna walks off, Seth is left in the empty hall way)  
 CUT TO: The light house - Sandy and Jimmy are there  
 Sandy: I love this place, I mean all it needs is a little nip an a tuck

 (everyone leaves, walking passed a stunned Kirsten)  
 Julie: oo hey sorry about your office Kiki I needed a base camp for operation model home  
 Kirsten: ok Julie I think maybe a little bit, you've lost your mind this is a disaster  
 Julie: Kirsten if you stopped open heart surgery half way through it would look like murder  
 Kirsten: you have seventy two hours! I gave you a list of the usual vendors  
 Julie: see there's that word 'usual' what I'm doing is, special, it's inspired (points to an ugly statue thing of a frog)  
 Kirsten: you're never gonna get this done in time  
 Julie: well there's a good attitude thanks for puttin that out in the universe  
 Kirsten: all you need for this is open house is a few accent rugs a couch, maybe a potted plant, we're selling a space  
 Julie: well I'm selling a lifestyle, Kirsten the Newport group should be an aspirational brand  
 Kirsten: (confused) aspirational, is that even a word?  
 Julie: look I know it seems ambitious and it'll be expensive but sometimes you gotta spend money ta make money...hey are you hungry, I'm starved  
 (she walks out, Kirsten watches her, not impressed)  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Ryan is walking down stairs, he stops at the bottom and sees Marissa and Oliver at Marissa's locker. Ryan moves behind the corner out of view and watches Oliver pull a letter out of his pocket & give it to Marissa. the bell goes so Marissa puts the letter in her locker, shuts it & walks off with Oliver. Ryan watches them then goes over to Marissa's locker, he looks at the locker, then looks both ways, he's breathing heavily and you can tell he's contemplating opening it  
 CUT TO: The Cohen kitchen - Sandy and Kirsten are lecturing Ryan on what he did  
 Sandy: why'd ya do it? if they vote to expel you there's nothin we can do you-you will have taken this opportunity an tanked it and wh-why (gets down next to Ryan) are you jealous of this Oliver kid  
 Ryan: no no I'm not jealous (looks at Kirsten, then Sandy) look you guys may not believe me, no one may believe me  
 Sandy: (raises his voice) the first time I met the kid he was in jail, you said he has a medical history your right - ok - he's trouble, now your the one who might be expelled  
 Kirsten: (disappointed/angry) if only you had come to us  
 Ryan: I wanted to deal with it myself  
 Sandy: well done, well done  
 Kirsten: do you know hard we worked- you worked to get inta that school  
 Sandy: you can't help Marissa you can't even help yourself  
 Ryan: (upset) ok I screwed up...yet again (sighs) so now what (softly) are you gonna kick me out?  
 Sandy: you think you can mess up so bad that we'll jus give up on ya (Ryan looks at him) ya cant, you are part of this family now an your gonna feel the full weight of that! your gonna wish we threw you out

 Seth: dude, what is wrong with you! (hands the letter back) ya haven't read it have you?  
 Ryan: no, not yet  
 Seth: not yet not ever, you can't read it ok you have to put it back  
 Ryan: (worried) what if he's after her! he's a sick kid he could hurt her  
 Seth: (puts his finger up) Oliver has not done anything to Marissa except be her friend, ok stop it! you're in enough trouble already, and honestly you're starting...to freak me out a little bit (Ryan looks at him) just will you promise me that you will put it back (Ryan doesn't say anything) will you promise me that you will put it back  
 (Ryan closes his eyes, then nods)  
 Seth: (leaving) put it back  
 Ryan: I will  
 Seth: put it back (leaves)  
 (Ryan walks over to the bed and puts the letter back in his bag, he stands up and closes his eyes, he looks down, bends back down and takes the letter out. he sits on the bed and opens it quickly. he reads it and is breathing heavily and looks worried)

 Marissa: of course, what's going on?  
 Dr Kim: why don't you have a seat (Marissa hesitates, then sits down) so I know this is a little outside my job description as dean, I felt I had a responsibility to have an honest conversation with you

 CUT TO: Ryan walking outside - he stops at the bottom of the stairs, looks up and sees Marissa on the stairs talking to a girl. Marissa looks down and sees him, her smile goes, and she finishes talking to the girl then walks off towards Oliver. they walk off together. Ryan sees and looks hurt

 CUT TO: Harbor school - Ryan is in the student lounge playing pool. Ryan hits the ball then moves around the table to reveal Oliver standing behind watching him. he walks over to Ryan.

 Ryan: yeah...uh...I'm sorry  
 Oliver: it's ok

 Ryan: yeah no I...it was crazy  
 Oliver: hm (turns to face Ryan) here's the deal, Ryan, an its nothin personal (Ryan looks at him) but Marissa an I we jus connect, she understands me, gets me (raises his eyebrows) an hey I don't know if there's only one person on the planet your spose'ta be with, but when she an I are together (breathes in) it sure feels that way (Ryan is shocked) (laughs) an um I'm sorry but you an Marissa c'mon man your from different worlds!  
 Ryan: (getting angry) (softly) you stay away from her  
 Oliver: ya cant fight fate man (smiles) I mean I didn't even have'ta lift a finger an look what happened to you guys, because your not spose'ta be together, an I'm not sayin you didn't serve your purpose, if it wasn't for you she would'a never gone to therapy (smiles) she never would'a met me

 Oliver: at this point, who's gonna believe you (Ryan glares at him) walk away, you have a chance ta really make somethin of yourself, don't blow it over some chick your not gonna care about in ten years, ok...I really am sorry  
 (Oliver turns to walk away, Ryan stands there angry then he lunges for Oliver. they knock into some chairs and Ryan punches Oliver which makes Oliver fall to the floor, Ryan gets on top of him and punches him twice before 3 guys hold Ryan back. Marissa comes through the door and rushes over to Oliver {its interesting to see the role reversal compared to earlier in the season when Luke was the one doing the punching, and Ryan was who Marissa was concerned for. now its Oliver, poor Ryan} she looks at Ryan. Ryan is thrashing about screaming 'stay away, stay away from her stay away from her'. Oliver freakily smiles at him with his bloodied lip. Ryan is standing there breathing heavily, he looks helpless and worried. Marissa looks at Ryan as if she doesn't know who he is anymore. Ryan stands there helpless - fade out)
