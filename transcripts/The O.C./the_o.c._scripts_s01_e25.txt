 Seth: ah it's the tourettes flarin up again it happens every now an again but its fine  
 Ryan: (picks up the invite) Julie an Caleb's wedding invitation, getting married in uh-  
 Kirsten: two weeks  
 (Ryan mouths something which I can't work out, sorry)  
 Seth: wow there really doin it, an unfortunate image just leapt in my mind  
 Kirsten: (worked up) I mean I just I-I don't understand what is the rush  
 (Sandy comes in)  
 Sandy: honey it's the gruesome twosome what'do you expect, it's the shock an awe approach to courtship  
 Kirsten: Julie Cooper is getting married to my father an your being flip  
 Sandy: me bein flip about Caleb, no i'm kinda softening on the guy he may not be friendly or ethical or y'know a million laughs  
 Kirsten: but he is?  
 Sandy: generous, boy either that or he is in love an delusional because he threw out a ball park figure for what he's offering Jimmy an me for the restaurant...it aint chump change  
 Kirsten: hm so he's bought your acceptance  
 Sandy: but at a very high price (to Ryan) hey how's Marissa dealin with her new step dad  
 Kirsten: yeah is she-is she alright with all that  
 Ryan: well she'll be in the wedding she agreed ta that so  
 Sandy: an you two are ya ya-ya what are ya back to-  
 Ryan: yeah-yeah we're good actually uh really good  
 Sandy: wow, really good for you is like singin from the tree tops  
 Seth: now that you an Marissa are really good does that mean you an Theresa are really over  
 Ryan: yeah, yeah me an Theresa yeah  
 Seth: well now that we've got your life straightened out I think it might be time ta take a step back  
 Ryan: yeah  
 Seth: an untangle this incestuous web that I like ta call the Julie Caleb union (Ryan smiles) now lets think about this when this bizarro knot gets tied  
 Ryan: ah-huh  
 Seth: (points) Julie Coopers gonna be your mother in-law  
 Sandy: (frowns) oh  
 Seth: yeah, enjoy (to Kirsten) she's gonna be your step-mom  
 Kirsten: Seth, my head is spinning  
 Seth: yeah, yeah (Ryan smiles) me and Marissa, we could be related (shakes his head) I don't know I can't even do that math but the real kicker is Julie Cooper, my grandma my grandma wears Uggs (Ryan is amused by it all) think about it  
 (phone rings)  
 Ryan: I am thinkin about it  
 Sandy: (answers the phone) hello  
 (Theresa is on a pay phone)  
 Theresa: hi I-its Theresa, Ryan's friend

 Sandy: are you alright  
 Theresa: ah-huh um I just have a legal question, can we meet  
 Sandy: sure you name the spot  
 Theresa: I-I picked up some catering shifts at the Balboa bakery, I-I have a break at one if you wanna stop by...an Mr. Cohen one more thing  
 Sandy: yeah  
 Theresa: please don't say anything ta Ryan about any of this  
 Sandy: (thinks) you got it, ill see ya then  
 (Theresa hangs up the phone, she turns around and we see that she has a black left eye)  
 Theme Song - California by Phantom Planet  
 Kirsten's office - Kirsten is on the phone and Julie comes in all cheery and energetic  
 Julie: (cheery) hellooo  
 Kirsten: (softly) I need one minute  
 Julie: ah you an me both you have nooo idea how hard it is to plan a spectacular wedding in only two weeks  
 Kirsten: Mr. err Lasser could you repeat that  
 Julie: I have a caterer who's flat out refusing to serve beef, something about a mad cow threatening to wipe out Newport Beach  
 Kirsten: Julie, phone  
 Julie: ironically the minister I wanted is away on his honeymoon, an my wedding planners a passive aggressive nit wit who has the audacity to question my taste in music, Bob Segar is not (makes a 'so called' motion) "so over"  
 Kirsten: (looks at her) I-I i'm gonna have'ta call you back (hangs up) how can I help  
 Julie: ok normally I would never bother you but there is one small thing you can help me with, a shower an by help...I mean host  
 Kirsten: Julie I cant host a shower  
 Julie: I know its last minute but I thought as my maid of honour that you would...want to  
 Kirsten: (shocked) wait...your (sits) maid of honour  
 Julie: well Kiki you're my closest friend, who else would it be  
 Kirsten: well I was thinking Marissa  
 Julie: i'm not exactly Marissa's favourite person right now but Caleb is convinced that he can get her ta help an he's already made all the arrangements ta have it at the club  
 Kirsten: in that case (nods)  
 Julie: your a god send thankyou, oh an one more thing, lets not have one of those tacky girly showers with the lingerie an the games about making whoopy  
 Kirsten: Julie don't say whoopy  
 Julie: I was thinking a couples shower, elegant a cocktail party with gifts, what'do you think, an if you have any other questions just ask Marissa (smiles) thanks (leaves)  
 (Kirsten sits back in her chair and sighs)  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Ryan and Marissa are in the student lounge together. Marissa is on her phone  
 Marissa: a couple's shower (hangs up)  
 Ryan: what is a couple's shower?  
 Marissa: something I am not throwing for my mom, that was a message from Caleb saying that per our arrangement he wants me ta help Kirsten throw a shower for my mom  
 Ryan: what about moving in with them, have you told your dad yet?  
 Marissa: no...but I will, today  
 Ryan: look if you don't wanna throw this shower then don't, stand your ground  
 Marissa: standing my ground is not really my strong suit  
 Ryan: that's true  
 Marissa: ooh pac-man, rematch? hey I almost maybe might beat you this time (laughs)  
 (we pan to Seth sitting on the couch with Summer, he was watching them and his mouth is open, Summer is smiling)  
 Seth: what is it with those two? the pac man and the getting along an the happy times  
 Summer: they're playing video games it's not a Mandy Moore movie (phone rings)  
 Seth: no, she's suppose'ta be crying, an he's suppose'ta be brooding that's how it works  
 Summer: (answers) hello... (happy) hi! yeah we're still on for tonight (gasps) fajitas yeah ok, i'm gonna make the margs...kidding god oh my god I know, oh my god, no you're so funny, no you are, no you (laughs) ok ill see you later, bye dad (hangs up)

 Seth: is that how you talk to your dad  
 Summer: how is how I talk to my dad?  
 Seth: like...he's your...friend  
 Summer: (shrugs it off) he is, he's my best friend  
 Seth: why have I never met him, I was beginning to wonder if you even had parents, I thought maybe you were like made in a lab, or hatched in a pod or something  
 Summer: so we haven't done the whole family meet n greet  
 Seth: yeah I know we haven't which is kind of odd ta me considering that you've met my dad, you've met my mom, you met Captain Oats, the list goes on an on  
 Summer: i've jus never introduced a boyfriend to my dad before, its kind of a big deal (raises her eyebrows for emphasis)  
 Seth: mm well your forgettin one key factor here Summer  
 Summer: what  
 Seth: parents love me ok i've got this non threatening non sexual vibe an they just eat that right up, we'll go uh miniature golfing or uh hot tubbing or something fun  
 Summer: well my step moms at Canyon Ranch  
 Seth: ooo dryin out  
 Summer: ah no she's on some stress management program, she has anxiety issues  
 Seth: (nods) so  
 Summer: we can go'ta lunch with my dad  
 Seth: nice, sure you wanna skip the hot tub (Summer looks at him) ok lunch is good, we'll do lunch but your dad's not gonna need a menu cause he's gonna be eating out'a the palm'a my hand  
 (he fake laughs and puts his arm behind her, Summer puts her hand over his mouth and he tries to pull it away. Seth ends up kind of leaning over her)

 Sandy: so you're leavin him I hope  
 Theresa: (sighs) its complicated,. I know it should be simple your boyfriend hits you, you leave him right  
 Sandy: (shakes his head) its never simple, how can I help you  
 Theresa: I jus need to know you know if he does this again what would happen ta him if I press charges  
 Sandy: well it depends you know anything from a restraining order ta jail time (Theresa nods) your not still thinkin about marrying the guy are ya, not if you gotta ask these kinds'a questions (Theresa looks at him, then looks away)

 Kirsten: there are plenty of people here that need'ta hear from you, Ryan is really upset
