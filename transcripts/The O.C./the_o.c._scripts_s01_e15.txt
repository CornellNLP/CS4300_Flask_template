 Opening scene - We open on an aerial view of the water, then the houses. We are now in the Cohen kitchen.  
 Hailey is sitting at the dining room table with ear phones in her ears moving along to the music. In front of her she has a full glass of juice and bagels on a plate. Sandy comes in patting his stomach, he goes to the empty basket that the bagels came out of, then glares at Hailey, not impressed. Of course Hailey is obliviously eating the bagel. Ryan now comes in, he pats Sandy on the chest as he walks passed, and Sandy tips the basket out, hopeful! Ryan goes to the cupboard and grabs a glass, he then goes to the fridge and pulls out the carton of juice, he brings it to the counter and pours it into his glass, 1/4 of a glass comes out if that! Ryan glares at Hailey who of course is drinking from her big glass. Sandy has given up on the bagels and pours himself a cup of coffee. Seth now comes in, he picks up the paper that is sitting on the counter. he goes through it clearly looking for a certain part, he looks over at Hailey who has the section that he wanted. he throws it down in frustration. Kirsten now enters, the 3 guys are all glaring at Hailey now. Kirsten comes and stands with them, she picks up the empty basket and looks at Hailey, who is still oblivious to them all glaring at her. Kirsten puts her hands on her hips. the 4 of them walk out of the kitchen  
 Sandy: she's eatin us outta house an home  
 Kirsten: (whispers) Sandy it's just a bagel  
 Sandy: no-no-no it's never just a bagel  
 Seth: mom as someone who's basically just ben a shut in for the last seventeen years of his life I can pretty much say with great authority (points) that that woman never leaves the house  
 Kirsten: she's got nowhere else to go  
 Ryan: that's because all her friends wanna kick her ass, sorry about the language  
 Sandy: why? I'd like to kick her ass (Seth nods)  
 Hailey: (yells off screen) Kirsten (the 3 guys groan and roll their eyes)  
 Kirsten: (cheery) coming  
 Hailey: (still off screen) there's no more coffee, will you make some?  
 (Sandy is mouthing 'no-no-no-no-no-no-no (uses hands for emphasis)  
 Hailey: (still off screen) the good French roast kind not the harvest blend  
 Kirsten: (to Sandy) ill talk to her  
 Sandy: (walking away) oh, that means ill have to survive on English muffins (Seth follows, not happy)  
 CUT TO: The pool house - Ryan is putting schools books into his bag. Seth comes in  
 Seth: (knocks) (whistles) Marissa? Marissa hello, she's gotta be here somewhere

 Seth: hey squeezing me in before school nice I like that but actually ill take it, ok here's the thing um Anna an I have decided to take it to the next level an I need some advice  
 Ryan: your gonna have s*x?  
 Seth: no that's a good idea though um...we're gonna tell Summer that we're dating and as much as I fear Summer hurting me what with the rage black outs an all I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings. we've become friends now an I feel like I don't wanna, I don't know if I wanna (knock at the door, it's Marissa and she walks in)  
 Marissa: (cheery) hey! you guys ready to go?  
 Seth: yeah no we were just talkin  
 Marissa: (holds Ryan around the neck) oh really about what? (kisses Ryan on the cheek)  
 Seth: uh just guy stuff you know hunting an shaving an shoes actually uh the cleats for-for the-the sports (Ryan frowns at him)

 Anna: hurt you

 Summer: what's up?  
 Seth: hey, what is up (Summer sits down at their table)  
 Summer: (to Seth) I was talkin to her  
 Seth: that's cool (goes back to what he was doing)  
 Summer: I wanted to know if you had plans this weekend  
 (Anna mumbles something)  
 Seth: what Anna is trying to say is she's not gonna do anything, we're both (Anna looks at him) not doing anything, that's what we're both doing (Summer looks at him) but infact we're doing nothing but, doing that by ourselves  
 (Seth puts his head down, as does Anna)  
 Summer: thankyou Cohen, you just reminded me (laughs) that I need my bio text book, cause we're studying monkeys (leaves the table)

 Marissa: (to Oliver) I love Paris (Ryan looks at her) I could spend all day walking the champs Elysees  
 Seth: I like Paris (puts up his thumb) I love baguettes (puts up his first finger for emphasis)  
 Luke: dude French chicks don't even shave their armpits  
 Oliver: (to Ryan) you ever ben to Paris Ryan?  
 Ryan: (feels out of place) no not yet...I hear the louvres cool  
 Oliver: no, do not go near that place (Ryan feels even more out of place) totally over rated, the Mona Lisa's like the size of the postage stamp, now the Rodin museum an the Musee Picasso(?)

 Oliver: alright, then its settled we're going

 CUT TO: The Cohen kitchen the next morning - Ryan and Seth are in there. Seth is eating at the counter.  
 Ryan: (shuts the fridge) so now your eatin with silver ware, next thing ill see you at the louvre  
 Seth: (swallows) ah no you wont because uh like Oliver said its lame (Ryan looks at him) now listen can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second ok, Summer now the way I figure it I've got many many options at my finger tips  
 Ryan: yeah like the truth that's a good one (walks to the table & sits down)  
 Seth: hey no argument there buddy but what I'm talkin about is my messenger of truth ok, my delivery system of honesty, the way I tell her now listen I could call her that's one  
 Ryan: ok  
 Seth: (scratching his chin as if in thought) yeah it is ok but its just ok (walks over to Ryan) I think it lacks any real uh spark or imagination (sits)  
 Ryan: but its effective your voice on one end of the phone hers on the other, I'm dating Anna (winks) she'll hear you  
 Seth: yeah but the phone is a rather blunt instrument no now what about (taps his top lip) shshshshw text messaging huh (Ryan frowns at him) I could black berry her think about it that feels very hip (Ryan raises his eyebrows) it feels edgy it feels twenty first century  
 Ryan: (looks unsure) kinda cold  
 Seth: mitten's required yes uh (goes to drink his coffee) oooh (Ryan looks at him, hopeful) (puts both fingers up for emphasis) a carrier pigeon! how cool would that be think about it (cutesy voice) a little message all rolled up in his cute little talons Summers a fan of the pigeon  
 Ryan: (looks at him) your a coward!  
 Seth: am I or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others  
 Ryan: (thinks) coward, definitely  
 Seth: (drinks his coffee then swallows dramatically) (getting up) fine ill tell her Monday...actually I think Tuesday y'know what dude I might jus give it till Friday (Ryan shakes his head) because that way she can have the weekend to sorta let it marinate  
 Ryan: (turns around) you could do it today

 Ryan: couldn't tell ya but thanks  
 Seth: hey the guy seems cool right  
 Ryan: I don't know we don't really seem to have alot in common  
 Hailey: besides your girlfriend  
 Ryan: keep twistin the knife, feels good  
 Seth: whatever he got us backstage passes that's good enough for me  
 Hailey: backstage (to Ryan) so now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars

 Hailey: mind if I finish the cornflakes

 CUT TO: Seth's room - Sandy is in there with Seth, and he's moving along to Rooney which is playing  
 Seth: (staring at him, turns the song off) IIII think that's enough  
 Sandy: what?  
 Seth: there was almost a knee bend man you were about to find the beat  
 Sandy: and?  
 Seth: and need I remind you of cousin Jeffrey's bah mitzvah (picks up his tie) you almost wiped out a half a dozen thirteen year olds on the dance floor (walks over to the mirror to put his tie on)  
 Sandy: well its that YMCA song it requires alotta movement  
 Seth: (putting on his tie) well man I'm just tryin'a spare casualties  
 Sandy: (sighs) (sternly) so at this concert tonight anyone there gonna be doin drugs

 Sandy: the best advice I can give ya is this (fixes Seth's tie) its from Steven Segal and his classic film hard to kill (Seth looks at him) the anticipation of death is far worse then death itself  
 Seth: (Sandy touches his hair) great so then we both agree that Summers gonna kill me (fixes his hair)  
 Sandy: look if your old enough to go to a concert alone, if your old enough to embark on a real relationship...you are old enough to be a man
