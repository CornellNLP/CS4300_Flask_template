 Opening scene - Cohen kitchen - Sandy goes to the cupboard and takes out a glass, he then goes to the fridge takes the juice out of the fridge and as he closes the fridge door we see Kirsten standing in her PJ's with a big red bow an arrow (Cupids arrow) she shoots him in the face with it, and Sandy isn't impressed.  
 Kirsten: (shoots arrow) ooooh (laughs, excited) Happy Valentines Day someone just got struck by Cupids arrow (kisses him on the cheek) mwa (Sandy is emotionless) Happy Valentines day  
 Sandy: (bends down & picks up the arrow) Valentines Days not till tomorrow sweetie (hands Kirsten the arrow)  
 Kirsten: (disappointed) you're not excited  
 Sandy: I am, I am I'm just uh (sighs) still thinkin about Oliver with that gun (pours himself a juice)  
 Kirsten: yeah I know  
 Sandy: who knows what coulda happened  
 Kirsten: but it didn't an Dr Kim lifted Ryan's suspension so the best thing for everyone is for everything to return to normal (dramatic) an in this house that means celebrating the holidays  
 Sandy: Valentines days not a holiday (Kirsten looks at him) Rosh Hashanah that's a holiday memorial day yes a holiday, you know who invented Valentines Day

 Seth: (with little enthusiasm) hey...you got me (makes cutesy face)  
 Kirsten: (excited) guess who jus got shot by Cupids arrow (raises her eyebrows for emphasis)

 Sandy: its one'a the most important things in the (?) Christian calendar, festival of lights, birth of Jesus  
 Kirsten: this is an important holiday, its Valentines Day  
 Seth: where Jewishness fuses with Christianity ok  
 Sandy: do the math

 Sandy: how ya doin kid?

 Sandy: I guess these city council guys are really busy  
 Kirsten: no, I forbid it  
 Sandy: (shocked) you what?  
 Kirsten: with whatever wifely authority I have vested in me on this most holy an romantic of days, no  
 Sandy: it's only a holiday, its not even a real holiday  
 Kirsten: not this again (shakes her head) not on an empty stomach (gets up from her desk)  
 Sandy: how bout Arbor Day, trees that's a good cause or secretary's day or how bout our anniversary  
 Kirsten: (upset) which we might not make it to!

 Sandy: I forgive your snoring  
 Kirsten: (getting angry) (yells) I - do not - snore

 Kirsten: (packing up) I am not sure, but its serious (picks up her things) you're on your own for lunch (leaves)  
 Sandy: (with attitude) Happy Valentines Day  
 CUT TO: Jimmy's house - Marissa is lying on the couch reading and Jimmy comes in the door  
 Jimmy: hey, kiddo (shuts the door) the glasser came ta the restaurant today, made a total mess, but progress is being made, how was school (kisses her on the forehead)  
 Marissa: (smiles) mm, ok  
 Jimmy: yeah  
 Marissa: hey you got something (sits up and gets it) it was left for you at the door (hands him a red heart shaped box)

 Marissa: I didn't  
 Jimmy: (confused) well...who else woulda left something...nice  
 Marissa: that is a good question, but this year I'm doing my best to avoid Valentines Day completely  
 Jimmy: what you an Ryan are...  
 Marissa: I...don't really wanna talk about it...an neither does he  
 Jimmy: hm well, it is Valentines Day, sometimes the big romantic gesture is more effective then talking (sighs) (Marissa thinks) (takes the lid off the box) ooh, there's no way your mom gave me these right (offers Marissa one) no she doesn't make her distain for me a secret much less her admiration  
 Marissa: well have you kissed anyone recently (eats cookie)  
 (Jimmy doesn't say anything, but he looks as though he's thinking)  
 CUT TO: Summer's bedroom - Summer is lying on her bed watching The Valley. there's a knock at the door  
 Summer: (yells) I'm busy...studying...naked  
 Seth: was that suppose'ta keep me away?  
 Summer: (unsure) Cohen? (gets off the bed) (opens the door) you're at my house

 Summer: no  
 Seth: thanks (walks in)  
 Summer: uh (shrugs) what're you doing here  
 Seth: (picks up a 'my little pony' off her table) who is this?  
 Summer: no one  
 Seth: (girly voice, moves the pony) I'm not no one  
 Summer: (gives in) princess sparkle, what'do you want  
 Seth: I think she's just Captain Oat's type  
 Summer: well you tell (snatches the pony from him) him ta keep his hooves off! (yells) an as for you!  
 Seth: wait-wait before you kick me out can ya jus, please give me a second to explain (Summer folds her arms) ok listen Summer...its not like...like now that me an Anna broke up I'm now choosing you, ok (Summer rolls her eyes) cause the whole reason that we broke up...is cause for me...(sincerely) its always ben you Summer (Summer's expression softens) its always ben you...an I've tried'a fight it an I've tried ta deny it an I cant, I cant do it...your undeniable  
 (Summer kisses him and pushes him onto her bed. she sits up and takes her jacket off then kisses him again. they are heavily making out)  
 Summer: Cohen (heavy breathing)  
 Seth: yeah  
 Summer: do you happen (kisses him) to have...you know...  
 Seth: oh (kisses her) yeah I do (kisses her) in my wallet  
 Summer: yeah  
 Seth: I was beginning to view it as a uh sort of a rabbits foot for good luck only but that's-  
 Summer: (covers his mouth with her hand) (softly) your about ta get lucky (kisses him)  
 (Summer sits up and takes her singlet/tank top off, Seth is on his elbows just watching her in awe, and her hair falls on her bare shoulders)  
 Seth: whatever you say Summer, yes...yes  
 (Summer smiles and her head disappears from the shot)  
 CUT TO: Beautiful shots of the sun setting on Newport, then we are at Julie's house, its now night - Julie answers the door and Luke is there  
 Julie: (suprised) Luke, hi  
 Luke: (smiles) hi Mrs. Cooper  
 Julie: what're you doing here?  
 Luke: uh w (laughs) d-d-did you know I-I was wondering did-did Marissa bring her bio text book home  
 Julie: Marissa doesn't live here anymore Luke, you know that  
 Luke: right... (nods head) I musta forgot  
 Julie ah-huh right ok well, goodnight  
 Luke: uh tomorrow um is the Valentines Day party (looks down) I w- are you gonna go...cause I'm gonna go an I thought if you needed a ride...  
 Julie: uh actually, everything that's happened with Caleb an me I think its best I stay home, avoid this holiday  
 Luke: yeah, it's just another day of the week right (Julie raises her eyebrows) ok um goodnight Mrs. Cooper  
 Julie: goodnight  
 (Luke walks off, shaking his head. Julie watches him walk away, smiling)  
 CUT TO: Summer's bedroom - Summer and Seth are lying on her bed next to each other, under the sheet. Seth is holding the sheet to cover his chest, Summer has hers covering her chest with both hands resting on to. we are seeing them from above the bed, they both look awkward/not sure. definitely not anything you'd expect  
 Seth: so...that was s*x  
 Summer: yep  
 Seth: I'm gonna go...  
 Summer: (frowns) me too  
 Seth: but you live here  
 Summer: I meant down stairs  
 Seth: oh ok  
 Summer: perfect  
 (Summer pulls the sheet to go with her as she gets up, this pulls what Seth had off him, we see him completely naked from only just above his waist. he has his hands clasped together on his chest. he looks down then grabs Summers pillow and puts it just below his chest. he sits up holding the pillow there then gets off the bed but we don't see anything passed him on the side of the bed, he just disappears out of the shot after that)  
 CUT TO: The pool house - Ryan is sitting on his bed studying, Marissa knocks then walks in.  
 Ryan: hi  
 (Marissa doesn't say anything, she is holding a single red rose and walks over to him, smiling. when Marissa reaches  
 Ryan he is almost standing, she kisses him, breathing heavily and pushes him back on the bed. she continues kissing him. Ryan looks shocked)  
 Marissa: (undoes the buttons on his shirt) I love you so much (she sits up and takes her top off so she's just in her singlet/tank top) we've waited a long time to (kisses him) mmm (smiles) you know (Ryan doesn't look happy) (unbuttons more buttons) an I thought maybe we could start Valentines Day early (kisses him) mm  
 (she runs her hand down his top, to the waist of his pants, Ryan stops her)  
 Ryan: (stops kissing) mm no wait, wait hold on  
 Marissa: (gets off him a bit) what, don't you wann'to  
 Ryan: no (Marissa sits down on the bed, hurt)  
 Ryan: (frowning) no I mean yeah (sits up) yeah of course but uh, with everything that's happened it just uh (sighs) it jus seems a little soon  
 Marissa: (closes her eyes) I jus wish it hadn't happened, that we could still be like we were (Ryan doesn't say anything) an I just wanted ta make it up to you  
 Ryan: you don't have ta...do this  
 Marissa: (embarrassed) (stands up) no your right (picks up her top) so um I guess ill uh...go...cause this is just really-  
 Ryan: wrong  
 Marissa: (putting her top on) I was gonna say embarrassing but I guess...wrong works...so it was nice ta see you an I guess ill uh...see you again...tomorrow (leaves)  
 (Ryan sits there)  
 CUT TO: The pool house the next morning - Ryan is sitting on the bed, Seth comes in  
 Seth: hey buddy, got some big news  
 Ryan: yeah I was just about to head over, set up for the party aren't you comin  
 Seth: yeah that's a whole lotta lifting, it's not really my thing (excited) an I don't know if I jus mentioned this but I have - some - big - news  
 Ryan: yeah so I heard (stands) what's up  
 Seth: well Ryan (puts his hands in the air) I'm a man, an not just like an after your Bahmitzva man but a man man (Ryan looks at him) (puts his fist in the air) I had s*x with a girl, Summer to be more specific  
 Ryan: (impressed) how was it  
 Seth: (whispers) I had s*x  
 Ryan: that bad (walking)  
 Seth: (follows him) no - not that bad, it was...just kinda weird  
 Ryan: weird  
 Seth: yeah but not kinky weird more like weird awkward (Ryan frowns) but hey you know what it was my first time she's a more experienced woman that's to be expected, an I did (nods)...make some faces in the middle that I wish that (laughs) I could uh take back but I cant and there's also sort of a whiney noise that came out towards the end (Ryan looks at him with a T.M.I expression) that uh that probably wasn't my finest hour. an I sucked SO-BAD. I was like a fish floppin around on dry land. Ryan I was Nemo an I just wanted ta go home  
 Ryan: well don't worry about it you'll get another chance  
 Seth: yeah that's the thing though I'm not sure that I will, the situation with Summer's murkier now then it was before the awful fish - s*x  
 Ryan: I wouldn't refer to it as fish s*x ever again  
 Seth: that's a good point, that's somethin that I was hopin to get a little bit more of uh tips, tricks of the trade, I think Summers use'ta drivin a higher performance vehicle  
 Ryan: yeah I don't know if I'm the guy ta talk to about romance these days  
 Seth: why, what's up  
 Ryan: me an Marissa its-its definitely different now post Oliver  
 Seth: yeah, you wanna talk about it  
 Ryan: nah I should get over to set up  
 Seth: hey so do ya have any tips or words'a wisdom for me

 Seth: that's...what I was afraid of  
 CUT TO: The Beach - Marissa and Summer are sun baking and talking  
 Marissa: an then we both jus decided to wait because you know we were really tired, well you know how it goes  
 Summer: ...I wish we had waited  
 Marissa: what? who

 Marissa: (shocked) wait, what! you guys did what (Summer waves it off) I've ben with you an hour how did this not come up  
 Summer: I must've forgotten  
 Marissa: (sighs) ok so I lied (Summer looks at her) things last night with Ryan went terribly, I think he hates me  
 Summer: he doesn't hate you  
 Marissa: he turned down s*x  
 Summer: you might be onto something (Marissa looks sad) hey you can't beat yourself up over it, no one knew that Oliver was gonna turn out to be such a looney tune  
 Marissa: except Ryan an I didn't listen (Summer sighs) I don't know (shrugs) maybe we jus weren't meant to be together  
 Summer: maybe we were jus chasing after the wrong boys  
 (they both look at each other)  
 CUT TO: Cohen house - Kirsten is working on decorations for the singles dance. Sandy comes in  
 Sandy: (cheery) hellooo  
 (Kirsten doesn't acknowledge him, nor stop what she is doing. Sandy goes to the fridge and takes out some meat, he stands there eating it and watching her)  
 Sandy: so how long will this continue  
 Kirsten: you ruined - my favourite holiday so, until Valentines Day is over we have nothing to talk about  
 (Seth comes in from outside)  
 Sandy: alright

 Sandy: (shocked) now?  
 Seth: (nods) it's gonna be as hard for me as it is for you  
 (Kirsten answering the door, it's Jimmy)  
 Jimmy: hey  
 Kirsten: hey

 Kirsten: (gasps) that's what I like a little holiday spirit around here (smiles) thanks  
 Jimmy: sure

 Jimmy: Hailey  
 Kirsten: mm-hmm (eats one)  
 Jimmy: huh, an how's she doin? you heard from her at all

 Seth: (cringes) oh, my god  
 Sandy: virile, get used to it  
 Seth: just disgusting...foreplay huh?  
 Sandy: oh I'm tellin ya, the appetiser is as good as the main course
