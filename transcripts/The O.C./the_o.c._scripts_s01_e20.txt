 Ryan: right...well we'll uh we'll jus got back to bein friends  
 Seth: (looks at Ryan) when were you guys ever friends, was it when you were beatin up her boyfriend or uh spooning in a Tijuana motel, is that when you were friends?  
 Ryan: yeah, it doesn't mean we can't be friends does it  
 Seth: (smiles) I don't know  
 Ryan: think ill have ta see her today  
 (Marissa and Summer are now walking)  
 Summer: friends Coop what're you guys gonna do together, lift weights, try on wife beaters (Marissa looks at her) sorry, guys like Ryan aren't friends with girls  
 Marissa: well I don't wanna jus be his friend, but after the whole Oliver thing I guess I need to show him he can trust me...(unsure) who knows if he'll even wanna be friends...(cheery) so how goes it with Seth  
 Summer: weird, in public he's like this huge geek who mumbles, I don't even know what he's saying half'a the time but behind closed doors, underneath the sheets he's like the anti-Cohen, do you think ill have'ta seem him today  
 (Back to Seth and Ryan)  
 Seth: I think me an Summer are finally over the hump by the way...so to speak. I jus hope man that she can keep it in her trousers when she sees me today, she'll probably have her little paws all over me (phone rings) ohp its prolly her now, a little phone s*x (reads call ID) (frowns) who do I know from the 909  
 Ryan: (takes the phone from him) nobody (answers) hello  
 (Theresa on a bed, in some room. I'm assuming it's her place in Chino)  
 Theresa: Ryan, hi its Theresa...yeah Seth's mom gave me this number  
 Ryan: hey hey how are you uh everything ok?  
 Theresa: yeah fine I'm (we hear the noise of a shower in the background)...uh I'm actually coming out there today  
 Ryan: (suprised) you are uh how come, I mean uh for work  
 Theresa: yeah but...(smiles) they cant make us work all the time right, so I was thinking maybe we could hang out tonight (noise of the shower being shut off)  
 Ryan: tonight uh sure  
 Theresa: (laughs) don't sound so excited  
 Ryan: no no I am I'm just-I'm just a little suprised that's all  
 Theresa: oh you know me full'a suprises, so I-ill come by after dinner  
 Ryan: yeah that sounds good, see ya then  
 (Theresa hangs up the phone and we see Eddie coming out of the bathroom, he was just in the shower)  
 Eddie: hey baby who was that?  
 Theresa: (pushes suitcase under the bed with her foot) wrong number  
 Eddie: oh (Theresa raises her eyebrows at him)  
 (back to Ryan and Seth)  
 Ryan: that was Theresa...she's in town wants ta hang out (Seth looks at him) as a friend  
 Seth: oh, well first uh Marissa then Theresa (smirks) who knew Ryan Atwood was so friendly  
 (Ryan nods his head, not saying anything)

 Caleb: well you could always tell him that it would mean alot to you

 Seth: why not  
 Summer: because its none'a there business...look there's like...pressure an scrutiny in the spotlight  
 Seth: (sits up) what spotlight?  
 Summer: when has being in the public eye ever helped a relationship huh yeah sure we're this weeks hottest couple but then the world gets sick of it the shopping sprees the strip clubs, people turn against us ok how many juicy sweat suits does she need (Seth has no idea what she's on about) oh that goatee is soo mid 90s (faster) an pretty soon the movie bombs and the wedding is called off (Seth looks at her) (touches his chin) but I'm not gonna let that happen ta us, cause Cohen, what we have is special

 Sandy: yeah yeah he's a lumbar supplier one'a the biggest in the country, infact he was in town on a negotiation with one'a the Newport group's chief rivals  
 Shaun: imagine that  
 Sandy: yeah I'm guessing that in that room that you accidentally stumbled into were documents containing information that would be very valuable ta somebody like Caleb  
 Shaun: you think  
 Sandy: (sits forward) you expect me or the DA's office ta believe that a belly full'a liquor or a wild coincidence would put you in that room (smiling) you were there for Caleb  
 Shaun: (laughs) that's an interesting theory...an one I you know I hope you don't explore to much cause uh, what is it Sandy, Sandy you know Caleb an I have ben friends for many years (laughs) an if I were ta si'down with the DA there's no...telling what we might talk about (laughs)

 Ryan: I'm workin on it  
 Seth: right, well...if I may speaking from a recent personal experience (sits on the chair) the triangles uh not a friendly shape ok, its pointy its got sharp edges, triangles hurt people man  
 Ryan: there is no triangle Marissa an I aren't together, an Theresa's just here's for work  
 Seth: except for the fact that Marissa still obviously has feelings for you an Theresa obviously has feelings for you. infact the only thing that's not obvious...is how Ryan Atwood feels  
 Ryan: (sighs) I don't know it's complicated  
 Seth: (nods) that's right it is complicated, it's complicated by the fact that there's an Eddie, an this Eddie still obviously has feelings for Theresa, infact that would actually make this romantic triangle more of a romantic...rhombus  
 Ryan: so what am I supposed ta do?  
 Seth: that, I don't know, but I would do something soon otherwise (stands) someone's gonna get hurt...and judging from Eddies phone voice its probably gonna be you  
 (Seth walks out, Ryan sits there thinking)  
 CUT TO: Caleb's office - Caleb is there with Sandy  
 Caleb: what the hell do you expect Sandy, constructions a dirty business, bids accepted below cost, permits mysteriously approved at the last second, guys like Shaun are the life blood of the industry  
 Sandy: well (stands) that was a touching speech Cal but still the answers no, good luck  
 Caleb: your opening a pandora's box you know that (Sandy turns back, listening) Shaun's old he's tired if the DA starts asking questions he's got lots of answers  
 Sandy: well if you build your empire on quick sand sooner or later it's gonna sink  
 Caleb: an what about Kirsten, she's complicit in all this to  
 Sandy: she doesn't know anything about this  
 Caleb: because I didn't tell her...I was trying to protect her, but she's number 2 here at Newport group, she signs Shaun's paychecks, so like it or not we're in this mess together

 Anna: (upset) well that makes me feel great  
 Summer: ...I jus cant be like one of those couples you know who hold hands in the hall way an make out in between classes, let the whole world know what's going on, its none'a their business you know  
 Anna: yeah well you don't have to ignore him Summer  
 Summer: I don't ignore him (Anna looks at her as if to say 'please') ok maybe a little but only in public  
 Anna: look you spent so much time trying ta get his attention, I mean you dressed up as wonder woman, well wonder woman is spose'ta have an invisible jet not an invisible boyfriend (Summer doesn't say anything) I mean either your really evil or there's something else going on  
 Summer: (softly) (shrugs) I jus don't know why he likes me, I mean he's way smarter an we have like less then nothing in common an he's just gonna get bored with me because pretty much all boys do, an if everybody knows we're dating then everyone will know when he breaks up with me, which he will...I mean dumped by Seth Cohen...its real good for my reputation

 Seth: I know she is, she's scared of being seen in public with me its fine  
 Anna: come on, Cohen, she fought for you she was fearless, ruthless infact...now she's got you...there's nothing scarier then that  
 Seth: (confused) nothing scarier then being with me? or do you mean like anyone  
 Anna: look once you get what you want, that's when you've got something ta lose (Seth doesn't say anything) she's afraid of losing you Cohen  
 Seth: why? I'm not goin anywhere

 CUT TO: Marissa and Theresa  
 Theresa: in the church where my mom goes there's this stain glass window of Theresa of Avila...her hearts being pierced by the arrow of an angel (Marissa listens) her eyes are closed an even thought it hurts her ta love that much she has the most beautiful smile (Marissa smiles) I remember my first communion I was wearing a white dress an gloves (voice over, with scenes of Ryan driving home) an I looked up at that window an I thought some day someone would pierce my heart (end v.o) an I would walk down the aisle in a real white dress an understand why she's smiling (Ryan driving again) (laughs) I know it sounds lame (Marissa shakes her head, smiling) but I guess life's not really like that, ya cant get all caught up in wishing for something that's not gonna happen, you gotta hold onta the next best thing (Marissa looks as though she's thinking) I guess I should call Eddie  
 Marissa: yeah I should uh get back to school (Theresa nods)
