 Theme Song - California by Phantom Planet  
 Cohen's backyard - Sandy and Seth are trying to teach Ryan golf.  
 Sandy: alright knees bent (Ryan bends his knees) not quite that much, back straight eyes right over the ball, feet a little closer together (Ryan moves his feet) just off your left foot there you go, not quite that close together but (Ryan moves them apart again) that's ok alright just let it hang like a pendulum, nice an easy (sways his hands back and forth like he's going to swing) nice an easy keep breathin, nice an easy (Ryan looks at him) nice...ill stop ill s- ill just go right over here  
 (Ryan looks down and hits the golf ball, he is meant to be putting it into a cup. but it bounces straight into the pool)  
 Seth: (jumps up from the pool, with the ball) I got it! (goes back under the water. Ryan sighs and looks like he's had enough)  
 Sandy: alright one more  
 Ryan: no, no more  
 Sandy: oh come on you were so good at the driving range  
 Ryan: I don't play golf (holds the club out)

 Sandy: wow I guess sometimes it's good to be Oliver  
 Seth: sometimes it's great to be Oliver (to Ryan) but you or I don't care about those sort of things do we (Sandy putts the ball into the cup) or Marissa I don't think she cares either  
 Ryan: you think (Sandy smiles)

 Anna: wow looks like Summers not the only one who lost their balls  
 CUT TO: Ryan, Luke, Marissa and Oliver - Ryan putts and the ball veers slightly to the right. Oliver and Marissa watch from near the golf cart

 Oliver: am I trying to hard with him, all I want is to be friends an I jus feel like he hates me  
 Marissa: no I mean, he likes you he just uh

 Oliver: right trust issues, cant win em all I guess  
 Luke: (to Ryan) hey nobody's lookin (Ryan rolls the ball into the hole with his foot) (yells) oooooh nice shot buddy  
 (Ryan picks the ball up out of the hole)  
 Oliver: ok I think we've torn up the course long enough, last guy back buys the first round. Oliver gets in the golf cart, Marissa walks around to get in the other side. Luke and Ryan look at each other then run, Luke puts the flag in the hole then runs to the golf cart with Ryan)  
 Marissa: (laughs) c'mon on lets go (they drive off)  
 (Ryan & Luke get in their golf cart and aren't far behind. we see it switch between Luke & Ryan, then Oliver & Marissa all driving and having a great time - we see Marissa & Oliver coming over a hill & Luke & Ryan are at the bottom of it heading up. Ryan, Luke & Marissa are smiling/laughing. Oliver has a serious/determined look on his face and keeps going, just before they are about to hit head on Ryan swerves to miss them)  
 Luke: look out look out for that tree  
 Ryan: right right hold it  
 Luke: stop stop stop  
 (Oliver & Marissa stop at the top of the hill & get out. we see that Luke and Ryan are inches away from the water)
