 Cohen's house – Kitchen - Kirsten is pouring juice & Seth is sitting at the kitchen table.  
 Kirsten: first day of school, are you excited? (Seth gives her a look) You know I ask you questions in the hopes of eliciting an actual response

 Kirsten: you look adorable!  
 Seth: no  
 Kirsten: cute?  
 Seth: no  
 Kirsten: dope?  
 Seth: no  
 Kirsten: RAD!  
 Seth: PLEASE, please this is so painful  
 Kirsten: ah, I'm-I'm-sorry-sorry (Sandy walks in) How was surfing?

 Kirsten: doesn't Seth look rad (Sandy kisses her head)  
 Sandy: oh you do look rad, bad props son  
 (Seth is shaking his head in horror, Ryan walks in)  
 Seth: thank god man, are you ready to go

 Sandy: enough said  
 Seth: how do you do that by the way, how do you convey everything with just a look  
 (Ryan gives it to Seth)  
 Seth: again!  
 Kirsten: (to Ryan) how're you doin?...are you nervous?

 Marissa: If you're trying to make me feel better...  
 Summer: ok the point is there's no such thing as bad publicity  
 (Marissa smells something)  
 Marissa: Is that something burning?  
 Jimmy: Ok so uh new oven, haven't quite figured out how to make French toast

 Anna: you are such a boy!  
 Seth: well, whatever. I don't see what the problem is I'm nothing but available to that girl  
 Anna: alright, right there, that's your problem. girls like to be chased by guys that aren't into them  
 Seth: and that sounds a little bit like a game to me Anna and I don't really like to play games ok, unless we're talking about a little-a little Saturday night jenga, a little-little magic gathering. LOVE magic gather  
 Anna: maybe you just don't know how to play  
 Seth: well, your a gir...l right  
 Anna: yeah  
 Seth: uh huh and we're friends right  
 Anna: sure  
 Seth: ok awesome so then why don't you train me in the ways of women huh, give me a little advice  
 Anna: I don't understand the mind of chicks like Summer

 Rachel: oh yeah, how'd that go?  
 Sandy: well I got to work on time didn't I?  
 Rachel: to bad, it might be a while before your wife is in the mood for looove  
 Sandy: oh yeah, something you know I don't  
 Rachel: well I know lots that you don't but in this case, are you familiar with the Balboa wetlands  
 Sandy: yeah, it's the largest coastal wetlands in California, home to the blue heron and the brown pelican and my personal favourite something called the swamp rose  
 Rachel: right, the wetlands are key to water quality in the county and not to mention, they're kinda pretty  
 Sandy: so naturally they must be destroyed  
 Rachel: The Balboa heights are 250 acres of land that sit above said wetlands  
 Sandy: yeah, every developers been going after the heights for years  
 Rachel: well somebody got it, and they're looking to tear it up, put in condos, a golf course  
 Sandy: (sarcastically) oh thank god cause you know the lack of golf courses around here is, it's tragic  
 Rachel: This is a policy changing career making piece of litigation here, a tree hugging crusader like yourself would probably kill for a case like this  
 Sandy: and you wanna share this with me  
 Rachel: yes  
 Sandy: why?  
 (Rachel hands him the file)  
 Sandy: oh, my wife's company is the plaintiff  
 Rachel: it's her fathers company  
 Sandy: so why even tempt me with this, it's a conflict of interest I, I'm not even sure it'd be ethical  
 Rachel: well the client, the Balboa land trust not only waived the conflict of interest they insisted that you take the case. your politics, your passion, your severe dislike for your father in-law, your the ideal advocate  
 Sandy: I suspect my wife is gonna have a different spin on all this  
 Rachel: look, you came to this firm because we have the resources to help you make a difference, they're gonna teach this in law school...so what's it gonna be? Your s*x life or the swamp rose

 Dr Kim: I understand you are going through alot of change right now but you're a leader here at Harbor that doesn't have to change. you're a wonderful example to your fellow students they look up to you  
 Marissa: not anymore they don't

 Seth: (to Ryan) Hey, how was soccer? (Ryan doesn't answer) So pops how's the new job (Sandy doesn't answer) Oh hey mom um are we (Kirsten glares at him) I'm just going to be quietly eating now  
 CUT TO: the pool house, Ryan is on his bed reading and Marissa comes in  
 Marissa: Hey, what was that about?  
 Ryan: what  
 Marissa: well you attacked him  
 Ryan: he beat me to the ball, it was a clean tackle  
 Marissa: why are you lying to me?  
 Ryan: why are you lying to me?  
 Marissa: what're you talking about?  
 Ryan: you and Luke, I saw you yesterday I heard everything  
 Marissa: I didn't know what to say  
 Ryan: how bout the truth, why didn't you just tell me  
 Marissa: why didn't you just tell me! instead of just going off and hurting him, you're as bad as he is!  
 Ryan: you know what; I don't need to be lied to by one more person  
 Marissa: I didn't lie to you...what happened was between me and Luke it has nothing to do with you  
 Ryan: you're right it has nothing to do with me  
 (the both look hurt)  
 Ryan: this just isn't gonna happen  
 Marissa: no, its not (she leaves)  
 CUT TO: The pool house the next morning - Ryan walks out of the bathroom and Sandy is waiting for him  
 Sandy: your coach called...he wants to suspend you for 2 games  
 Ryan: great  
 Sandy: he thinks you've got talent, he also thinks your attitude sucks  
 Ryan: It does  
 Sandy: SIT down and listen to me (Ryan doesn't move) You can stand if you want but you know how lawyers love to talk (Ryan sits on the bed) The last thing you need is for this blow out on the soccer field to turn into a suspension from school. This school could do great things for you  
 Ryan: for Seth maybe, not for me  
 Sandy: you're angry, I know that, I don't blame ya, every day at that school your gonna run into spoilt little rich kids who's ass you are gonna wanna kick, well you've just gotta find a way to work it out right now because forget about suspension...we're always one mistake away from...from someone taking you from us  
 (Ryan looks at him)You know Seth was never really uh big on organised sports, id love to see you play, go to some of your games  
 (Ryan half smiles, Sandy leaves)  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Seth & Ryan are walking outside  
 Seth: huh, and women usually find stuck brutality so romantic  
 Ryan: I messed up  
 Seth: ah yeah, well its my experience in life Ryan that you should always apologise alright, even if you haven't done anything wrong, your shoes would get peed in so much less...it was a metaphor  
 Ryan: apologise, right, and to Luke  
 Seth: that cry baby no man, he gets to drowned in his own tears  
 Marissa and Summer are walking down stairs  
 Summer: They're all the same, it's to bad cause I could tell you really liked him  
 (Ryan walks up to them, as they get to the bottom of the stairs)  
 Ryan: Hey, uh do you mind, could we?  
 Summer: oh, we have to get to class...come on Coop  
 (Summer pulls Marissa away, Marissa turns back to look at Ryan)  
 (beautiful scenes of the beach at sunset/coast at sunset)

 Sandy: could be a couple of years  
 Kirsten: (softly) yeah, well, I couldn't be married to a man who wasn't a man  
 Sandy: (softly) I'm all man  
 (they both smile/laugh)  
 Kirsten: we'll get through this, there's a reason why we're together  
 Sandy: I have that suspicion  
 Kirsten: ok  
 Sandy: ok?  
 Kirsten: ok  
 Sandy: ok  
 Kirsten: ok (kisses him) the kids are at that carnival  
 Sandy: I heard that rumour  
 Kirsten: mm hmm  
 Sandy: are you getting out  
 Kirsten: are you gettin in (she pulls him closer to her by his tie, phone rings) Oh my god  
 Sandy: why do you keep this thing on?  
 Kirsten: emergencies, oh that's my dad, and it's an emergency  
 (Sandy's phone rings)  
 Kirsten: hey, dad  
 Sandy: Rachel, hi  
 CUT TO: The carnival - Seth & Anna are playing ski ball  
 Seth: if only ski ball were a school sport, you know what I mean  
 Anna: a boy can dream  
 Seth: alright let's see you take a shot  
 Anna: no, ill pass  
 Seth: take one shot, take a shot, its very easy, ok concentrate, alright lean to the left a little bit (to Ryan) hey  
 Anna: (to Ryan) any luck finding Marissa  
 Ryan: nah, no sign of her, you guys  
 Seth: nothing, we have to let Anna concentrate now because she dares step up to the master, ssshhh  
 (Anna throws, she's get 100,000 and screams/cheers in excitement)  
 Seth: ok, clearly uh you're a lesbian, wow I'm gonna go trade in my tickets for some cash prizes (to Anna) oh hey do you think I should get Summer something, what do you think she would like (Anna gives him a look) ok I can figure it out  
 Anna: (to Ryan) Seth doesn't understand the whole hard to get strategy  
 Ryan: that's because he's not  
 Anna: oh  
 Ryan: why are you helping him with Summer?  
 Anna: why not (Ryan raises his eyebrows) Seth doesn't see me that way, when he looks at Summer he sees lips, and hair and boobs, when he looks at me he sees...a lab partner, we're friends  
 Ryan: an your gonna let that slide (Anna shrugs) Anna, guys wannna be chased by girls who aren't interested in them  
 (they see Summer & Marissa in the distance)  
 Anna: so do girls  
 Ryan: she's heading for the ferris wheel, gotta go  
 Anna: good luck!  
 Ryan heads over to the ferris wheel and runs into Luke  
 Ryan: I'm sorry about yesterday  
 (Luke looks over at Marissa in the queue, and then back at Ryan, Ryan runs to catch Marissa just as Marissa and Summer get on. Ryan grabs Summers arm)  
 Ryan: do you mind  
 Summer: not getting involved  
 (Summer walks away, letting Ryan take her place. Ryan sits next to Marissa and pulls the lap bar down)  
 Marissa: what're you doing?  
 (Ryan looks freaked out, remember he doesn't ‘do' heights)  
 Ryan: I wanna talk (ride starts)  
 Marissa: I thought you were afraid of heights  
 Ryan: uhh huh, but this is important to me (getting up top) oh boy, look um I said some things last night and I just want y  
 (they stop abruptly right at the top, Marissa is amused)  
 Ryan: whoa, uh-wh-what's going on  
 Marissa: uh, we're stopped  
 Ryan: yeah wh-wh-wh-why why are we stopped  
 (Marissa looks down to see why, Anna hands money to the operator)  
 Anna: keep them up there a few minutes, let them work it out  
 Seth: you are the master  
 Anna: Cohen, there's something I wanna tell you  
 Seth: alright, more advice I'm ready, bring it  
 (Anna grabs Seth & kisses him, Seth looks up after the kiss and sees Summer watching, Anna sees who Seth is looking at)  
 Seth: is this... all part of the plan (Anna looks disappointed) cause it looks like its working  
 Anna: yeah, was all part of the plan...so you gonna go  
 Seth: yeah, thankyou (walks away but stops) oh hey, (shrugs) I got this for you (hands Anna a sock monkey) it's all I could get with my tickets  
 Anna: thanks  
 Seth goes over to Summer  
 Seth: (clears throat) hey Summer, what's goin on  
 Summer: Coop's stuck on the ferris wheel and I was looking for someone to go on the tilta-whirl with me  
 (Seth takes some of her cotton candy)  
 Seth: well I'll go on it with you  
 Summer: ok, I may vomit  
 Seth: I like those odds  
 CUT TO: Ferris wheel, Ryan & Marissa are still stuck at the top. Ryan doesn't look great  
 Marissa: are you ok  
 Ryan: yeah  
 (Marissa sits forward and rocks the seat)  
 Ryan: had to get the cheap ferris wheel didn't you, oh what kinda carnival is this Cooper (Marissa looks at him) UUhh ok (closes his eyes and turns to her) Look, I don't talk, alot about stuff and I really don't trust people… but I trust you (Marissa smiles) and I wanna make it, (swallows) this work, no matter what...and if we ever get down from here maybe we could talk about it  
 Marissa: (having fun with his vulnerability) oh, well who knows when that'll be  
 Ryan: oh please don't say that (Marissa smiles)  
 Marissa: Look, maybe you just need something to take your mind off of it  
 Ryan: Oh we're fifty feet in the air how do you expect me to possibly  
 (Marissa leans over and kisses him! Ryan opens his eyes, then closes them again - Awwww - after a while they begin to move down and neither notice, they stop at the bottom and Ryan says to the operator one more time, Marissa laughs and they start kissing again. camera pulls out to a wide shot of the ferris wheel still going round, and lit up beautifully)
