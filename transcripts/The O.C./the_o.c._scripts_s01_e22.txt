 Opening scene - Seth and Ryan are at the Mermaid Inn. Ryan left his watch there and he is picking it up  
 Seth: so then did you take your watch off during the deed or...what exactly  
 Ryan: you wanna wait in the car? I can pick this up at the front desk myself  
 Seth: no its cool I got more questions so then I don't understand did you take it off during foreplay, was it before foreplay now that would seem presumptuous but  
 Ryan: no seriously, seriously you can stay in there turn the radio on, leave the windows up  
 Seth: cause I like to leave the watch on Ryan an I like to leave it on an know how i'm doing...if i'm beating my old time (Ryan turns around and groans while opening the door) the thing is its sort of a s*x marathon not a s*x sprint  
 Ryan: (to desk guy) excuse me, hi i'm the guy that called earlier about the watch that was left here  
 Guy: uh room 204 right, yeah such a nice girl was stayin in there beautiful too (nods) your girlfriend? (Ryan doesn't say anything)  
 Seth: ok that's a little awkward  
 Ryan: no, no she's not but thankyou  
 Guy: a girl like that you would be a lucky guy if you could (holds up watch)  
 Seth: ok thankyou for your time, or his time. the timepiece thanks, thanks alot (they walk out) one day we're gonna look back on that an we're jus gonna laugh an we're gonna laugh some more we're gonna have a good laugh not at my timepiece joke, but at uh y'know the situation  
 Ryan: i'm fine really I mean Theresa's back with Eddie where she should be right  
 Seth: yes, absolutely listen man this is a good time for you ok Ryan Atwood this is 'clean slate Ryan', finally you have no women ta protect from violent goateed factory workers or pill poppin manic depressives  
 Ryan: (frowns) I guess your right I guess I really do have a clean slate  
 Seth: you do! dude since day one of you getting here its ben nothin but lady drama with you Marissa, Theresa...Luke, Oliver, Eddie dude i'm gettin exhausted jus thinkin about it  
 Ryan: I am...kinda tired  
 Seth: you should be but you know what your gonna get a break cause you deserve it, I think i'm gonna declare this month...angst free Ryan month  
 Ryan: a month you think it's gonna last all month  
 Seth: angst free Ryan week, with an option for an additional week, if you like it  
 Ryan: (thinks) hm (smiles) ok thanks bud  
 Seth: right on (taps Ryan) hey what's Luke doin here did you tell him about your watch  
 (we see Luke standing outside the 'usual' room)  
 Ryan: no, why would I?  
 (Julie comes out of the door and kisses Luke goodbye, Ryan and Seth both see. they quickly get beside the car so they don't get seen and continue watching. Luke walks off and Julie slaps him on the butt as he goes. Julie goes back in. Ryan and Seth look at each other in complete shock)  
 Ryan: it didn't even last the night  
 Theme Song - California by Phantom Planet  
 Pool house the next morning - Ryan and Seth are still in shock over what they saw. Ryan is sitting on the end of his bed and Seth is sitting in the chair  
 Seth: I can't believe they were at a motel...its just...it's so cheap it's so tawdry  
 Ryan: yeah that's the real moral of the story here  
 Seth: you know we're gonna have'ta see Luke at school today right (Ryan raises his eyebrows) (shakes his head) how could he do it...well I mean i get how he could do it its Mrs. Cooper but-  
 Ryan: what about her, it's her daughters ex boyfriend (frowns) if Marissa found out...  
 Seth: nooo she cannot find out, she doesn't handle the bad news well at all  
 Ryan: so its gotta end before she finds out  
 Seth: I agree...maybe you should sorta take the reins on this one, I would but I feel like its more your speed (Ryan looks at him)  
 CUT TO: Cohen kitchen - Sandy is making toast and Kirsten and Jimmy come in  
 Kirsten: uh Sandy Jimmy's here

 Sandy: I don't that's your job  
 Jimmy: well we've basically...blown through our entire budget (Kirsten looks at Jimmy)  
 Sandy: well you're really not so good at managing the money are you Coop

 Kirsten: she's good  
 Jimmy: (worked up) yeah at-at manipulating others an back stabbing, pot stirring an generally creating an atmosphere of hate an dis-trust

 Jimmy: this restaurant is spose'ta be my oasis my happy place, a place ta...rebuild after Julie not (puts his hands up) she's not doin to the light house what she did to my marriage  
 Sandy: well free is cheap Jimmy I mean what choice do we have

 CUT TO: Harbor school - Ryan and Seth are walking in the halls

 CUT TO: Kirsten's office - Sandy, Jimmy, Kirsten and Julie are in there. Julie is looking over the design possibilities  
 Julie: (looking at photos) good light, exposed brick its a bit 80's but these trends are cyclical south-facing windows mm these floors could be sanded an the beams are rather oppressive ah...some white enamel could lighten it right up (turns to face the guys) ill do it  
 Sandy: now...you know we can't pay ya  
 Julie: oh y'know everybody has'ta start somewhere an the value it'll add to my portfolio alone will be worth it, it'll be my calling card (Jimmy rolls his eyes)  
 Sandy: an we should get started, right away  
 Julie: well you will have'ta pay for the floors the linens the silverware unless you want your patrons eating with their hands like Jimmy does
