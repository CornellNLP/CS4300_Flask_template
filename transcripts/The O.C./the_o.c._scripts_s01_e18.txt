 Opening scene - The pool house - Sandy goes in to talk to Ryan. Ryan is on his bed reading  
 Sandy: (knocks, then opens the door) you're not havin breakfast  
 Ryan: I'm not really hungry  
 Sandy: Dr Kim jus called to let us know that you've ben suspended indefinitely, y'know until the disciplinary committee can figure out whether or not they wanna expel ya  
 Ryan: I know you want me to say I'm sorry but I'm not, Oliver admitted it right to my face, he told me he wanted me gone...so he could get to Marissa  
 Sandy: (shrugs) then why would he drop the assault charges against ya  
 Ryan: he did that  
 Sandy: yeah I-I mean it seems to me that if he had it in for ya (walks inside) if he wanted you gone you'd be gone you'd be back in juvi already I mean y'know that right...c'mon help me out here would ya (sits on the bed) (Ryan sits forward) tell me what's goin on  
 Ryan: (sighs) Oliver's dangerous  
 Sandy: this is what I know, you attacked him period your on probation you knew the slightest infraction would probably result in ya bein taken from us (shakes his head) an ya did it anyway I-I for the life of me I can't understand why, talk to me (Ryan shuts his eyes) c'mon Ryan talk to me  
 Ryan: (swings round to sit on the edge of the bed) what's the point your not gonna believe me anyway  
 Sandy: (trying to get through to him) it's not about what I believe, I wish it was! it's about what you did! (Ryan looks at him) the next time you feel like raisin your fist you had better open your mouth an talk (Ryan looks down) I'm here for that (rubs his eyes) so what am I spose'ta do, I cant ground ya I'm not gonna chain ya to the wall (frustrated) you wanna go after that Oliver kid (stands) go ahead, doors open (Ryan just sits there listening) but if you wanna stay, if you wanna be part of this family your not gonna go anywhere your not gonna do anything your not gonna see anyone unless Kirsten an I say its ok, that's the deal take it or leave it (Ryan looks at him, not saying anything)  
 Theme Song - California by Phantom Planet  
 We are still in the pool house, but Ryan is there by himself. he's just sitting there flicking through a book, we pan across and Ryan is now lying on the bed he's puts the book next to him, we pan again and Ryan is now doing sit ups on the floor. pan again and Ryan is sitting on the edge of the bed, he falls back and sighs. in the background we hear the sound of a bell, Ryan looks at his clock just as it changes to 8:00am  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Marissa and Summer are walking outside  
 Summer: so Ryan jus like punched him for no reason  
 Marissa: well that's what Ryan does he punches people, he doesn't talk to them...an he doesn't listen  
 Summer: ok well he had to have a reason though, I mean yeah Ryan's violent but he's not stupid  
 Marissa: (sighs) he just...I don't know he thinks Oliver's in love with me...or something  
 Summer: well isn't he (Marissa looks at her) a little  
 Marissa: (heated) we're jus friends!  
 Summer: (defensive) ooooook  
 Marissa: I mean Oliver's like the only guy in my life who isn't jealous an scary an breathing down my neck all the time, an he actually tells me what he's thinking...unlike some people  
 Summer: soooo are you an Ryan...  
 Marissa: we broke up  
 Summer: (shocked) whoa! Coop...(thinks) so that means that we're both single now...which (excited) rocks! right (Marissa half smiles) no more Ryan no more Seth Cohen we're totally free, liberated, infact how bout I treat us both to a little Bourke Williams today after school, a little facial a little massage  
 Marissa: (smiles) I cant I promised Oliver I'd help him study after school  
 Summer: (disappointed) oh, well how bout this weekend

 Marissa: (turns back) hey you coming?  
 CUT TO: Seth and Anna getting drinks inside  
 Anna: well even if Ryan gets expelled he's still gonna live with you guys right, I mean your parents aren't gonna kick him out  
 Seth: no, I don't think so  
 Anna: (concerned) well is he ok  
 Seth: yeah, he's not the one who got punched in the face  
 Anna: (takes his arm and they start walking) I'm talking about in the larger sense Seth

 Anna: you don't know, haven't you talked to him  
 Seth: no, what am I spose'ta say  
 Anna: um I don't know are you ok is there anything I can do

 Summer: yeah well why shouldn't he, he has Marissa all to himself now  
 CUT TO: Kirsten's office. Kirsten and Sandy are eating lunch together, Sandy is sitting there quiet  
 Kirsten: what

 Kirsten: Sandy he's a good kid, he's not perfect but we'll work it out we always do, everything's gonna be ok

 CUT TO: Harbor school - Marissa and Oliver are outside eating lunch  
 Oliver: come on you have to go, we both could use the weekend away, it'll be my treat  
 Marissa: I can't, besides I'm the one who should be treating you, you never would've gotten hurt if it weren't for me

 Oliver: which means she'll be spending it next to Ryan which is not good for her right now  
 Luke: well isn't that kind of up to Marissa  
 Marissa: look it's not a big deal, its fine  
 Oliver: ok so let me at least get you an your mom a suite at the hotel, that way ill be there an you wont even have'ta think about Ryan

 Ryan: (hurt) you'd think you of all people would believe me, I believe you  
 Seth: Ryan Marissa's a big girl ok you can't go around telling her who she can an can't hang out with

 Kirsten: dad you're the one who hired her  
 Caleb: I gave her something to do so she wouldn't be calling me all the time  
 Kirsten: well it worked, now she doesn't have'ta call you she's always here  
 Caleb: which is why I want you to talk to her, I know she's your friend but in the interests of the business not to mention your father's sanity, this has to end

 Ryan: I know what its like to be abandoned by your parents, your friends...an have no one in your life who believes in you (Marissa looks at Ryan with tears in her eyes) but you put the gun down you get a second chance  
 (Oliver stands there crying, Ryan looks at him, Marissa looks at him, Sandy looks at him. he finally puts it on the floor. the security guards rush in to take it away, Marissa runs to Ryan)  
 Marissa: (crying) I'm sorry (he hugs her) I'm so sorry
