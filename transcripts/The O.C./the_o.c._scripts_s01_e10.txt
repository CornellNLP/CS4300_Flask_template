 Kirsten: Dad good news, ohh I'm sorry I didn't know you (sees Julie with Caleb) JULIE (suprised)  
 Julie: Kirsten, you're father and I were just talking about you (kisses Kirsten on the cheek) this man just single handedly saved the children's hospital benefit  
 Caleb: I did no such thing  
 Julie: oh, he's so modest. I had just lost the Buckley yacht when he graciously agreed to let me host the event on his  
 Kirsten: the man just gives and gives hm. I-I didn't know that you were organising the children's hospital benefit  
 Julie: well, I wasn't going to but then I thought its time I stopped dwelling on my own problems and got back to focusing on the needs of others, right (Kirsten fake smiles) so, must be off. Cal (kisses his cheek) I owe you big time. Bye Kirsten  
 Julie: Bye Julie  
 Caleb: hmm she is something, isn't she  
 Kirsten: she's that! you know you are now the official sponsor of the Julie Cooper come back tour

 Kirsten: they're working together, that's all...I suggest we do the same, ill see you later  
 CUT TO: Harbor school - Ryan, Seth & Anna are eating lunch  
 Anna: I don't understand why you just don't take her to dinner an a movie, it's a classic combination  
 Ryan: because somebody promised her the best date ever  
 Seth: Ryan, I went ahead an I did a little recon on your behalf I was extremely stealth and I spoke to Summer, okay, an I asked her what would Marissa wanna do on a date, what would she really enjoy and she told me...she didn't know  
 Anna: (sarcastic) how helpful!  
 Seth: BUT Summers three favourite activities are shopping tanning and waxing, maybe there's something there man, they're best friends, use that  
 Anna: and here I thought Summer was superficial  
 Ryan: I have no car no money, whatever I do it's just gonna disappoint her  
 Anna: what'd you usually do on dates?  
 Ryan: I've never actually been on one  
 Seth: hey hey I thought you; you just told me that you had...

 Seth: no we don't, we don't we talk about all sorts of things all the time, we talk about music, we talk about sailing, what  
 Anna: Right about how you named your boat after her how you made her a burned CD with all your favourite songs with the word summer in it  
 Seth: Wow, I'm sorry I was under the impression that we were friends who I don't know talk about our-our thoughts and stuff  
 Anna: we are, so I guess... you're finally hearing some of mine...I'm gonna go back for desert

 Marissa: how are we doing, mom  
 Jimmy: Marissa why don't you come over here and -and talk to us okay, come on over and sit down

 Julie: I'm throwing a party. I'm hosting the children's hospital benefit this Saturday, they're trying to build a new wing for the children...and I would love it if you could both be there. your fathers already agreed  
 Marissa: No, no way  
 Julie: Marissa, honey. this party is a chance for us to show the community that we still belong, that we're still a family. yes we've suffered some set backs your fathers business in particular, but its important for us to let everybody know the Cooper family is back  
 Marissa: why do you care what other people think?  
 Jimmy: look Marissa no one has fewer nice things to say about your mother then me, (to Julie) no offence, but she's been pouring her heart out to me and I think you're gonna wanna hear what she has to say  
 Julie: Marissa, I am so sorry... for the way I handled things at the hospital (sincerely) I was scared... and I was wrong, everything I cared about was falling apart and I was blaming everybody but myself...I just want us to feel like a family again. now I know it's gonna take some time and I'm gonna need your help, will you help me (holds hand out to Marissa, Marissa takes it)  
 CUT TO: the pool house -night - Ryan is on a laptop and there is a knock

 Ryan: oh, that sucks (looking relieved, lol)  
 Marissa: we're gonna be spending a romantic night on a yacht for this charity even hosted by...my mom  
 Ryan: your mom-your mom hates me  
 Marissa: no. no she doesn't hate you she just doesn't know you, but now she'll have her chance  
 Ryan: bu, we had a date Saturday night, I mean there was a whole thing happening  
 Marissa: I know but my mom came by today and apologised to me and my dad and it seems like she's changed...hey if my parents got back together and my dad found a new job, then my life could go back to normal again  
 Ryan: well maybe I should stay away for a little while give you guys  
 Marissa: look first date stuff, candy flowers that's easy  
 Ryan: candy, flowers right  
 (Marissa holds his face)  
 Marissa: (smiling) but its times like these when a girl needs her boyfriend the most  
 Ryan: (stunned) boyfriend  
 Marissa: well, I mean, aren't we  
 Ryan: (smiling) I-I-I guess, I've just never been a boyfriend before  
 Marissa: but you've had girlfriends

 Marissa: great! (kisses his cheek)  
 CUT TO: Cohen kitchen - the next morning, Seth is talking to the house keeper  
 Seth: the fact is yes I admit it I occasionally talk about Summer, maybe I even talk about her to much but it's not really the point is it  
 (the house keeper looks at him as if he's crazy and walks off, Ryan comes in)  
 Seth: hey. so get this uh Anna thinks all I ever do is talk about Summer...I mean that's crazy right  
 Ryan: you want me to lie  
 Seth: I'm that guy. (Ryan looks at him) dude how can I be that guy, I hate that guy. well then no wonder Summer doesn't have any interest in me cause apparently all I do is I talk about Summer, although you'd think she'd like that  
 Ryan: (swallows juice) you're doing it again  
 Seth: right  
 CUT TO: Kirsten is in the backyard, Sandy sits next to her

 Kirsten: is Rachel's boyfriend as understanding as I am  
 Sandy: Rachel doesn't have a boyfriend  
 Kirsten: mmm, go figure. you know some people who don't like their life, make work their life  
 Sandy: well that's not me. an ill tell you this if our settlement conference goes well today, I could be home by six

 Seth: what, girlfriend. I thought that you didn't do girlfriends, I mean you did em (motions with his hands) but you, you know what I'm sayin  
 Ryan: I don't, and this is not a good way to start, at least you'll be there  
 Seth: no I won't, who would I bring I can't take Summer or.. I could do you think she would go, I don't know (Ryan looks at him) I'm doing it again  
 Ryan: or you know who you could ask  
 (they both watch Anna who is at her locker)  
 Seth: I could take a friend, interesting (walks over to Anna) Okay I'm never gonna mention Summers name to you again, except for that. from now on all you and I are gonna discuss are things that we both have in common like how do you feel about Newport charity events huh  
 Anna: I hate them  
 Seth: me too, so what'd ya say you come with me to one we'll hang out and we'll just quietly mock people  
 Anna: is Summer gonna be there?  
 Seth: I don't know, who cares. if anything happens between me and Summer you will not hear about it from me, okay I promise, on our friendship  
 Anna: (smiling) kay  
 CUT TO: Sandy, Caleb, Kirsten & Rachel in the meeting for the balboa heights. Sandy & Rachel are on one side of the table, and Caleb & Kirsten are on the opposite side  
 Rachel: obviously the US fish and wildlife services ecological risk assessment asserts that the land adjacent to the wetlands should be considered wetlands as well  
 Caleb: well, why stop there councilor, why not include the land adjacent to the land adjacent to the wetlands  
 Rachel: Mr. Nichol I'm sure your attourney here has already explained that it's only a matter of time before the state acquires the land by eminent domain  
 Kirsten: It took the state five years to purchase the Balboa wetlands  
 Caleb: let's...cut to the chase shall we, how much is the land trust offering me for Balboa heights  
 (Sandy writes down a figure and slides it over to Caleb)  
 Caleb: Mr. Cohen I was beginning to wonder about your involvement in all of this (he looks at the figure) thankyou all for coming (gets up from his seat) this meeting is adjourned  
 Kirsten: where are you going?  
 Caleb: well, I mean THATS it, that's your whole dog and pony show...I'm disappointed, what have you two been doing (Sandy looks confused) I mean Kiki tells me that you've been in the office alone (Kirsten looks angry) together every night till, two in the morning?  
 Rachel: feel free to counter Mr. Nichol  
 Caleb: (to Sandy) why is she doing all the talking? are you just here to ensure that your firm makes the early edition again...father and son in-law fight for the heights  
 Sandy: I gotta tell ya Cal I've dealt with alot a shady characters in my line of work but I've never seen anyone stoop as low as you...you'll poison anything, the air, the water, even your daughters marriage as long as you profit  
 Caleb: you've ben living off my profits  
 Sandy: if you think I'm bought and paid for (packs up, stands up and puts his briefcase on the desk) you just wait till I get ya on the stand, don't let my silence here mislead ya, I'm takin you down.(to Kirsten) councilor

 Ryan: you know...I think your mom would understand if you told her you didn't wanna do this  
 Marissa: except I do (sits down with him)  
 Ryan: right...that's what I meant, uhhh Marissa this event is important and on a yacht and whenever I go to one of these things somebody (Marissa is smiling) gets into a fight
