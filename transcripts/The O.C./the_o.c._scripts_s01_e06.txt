 Gabriel: hi  
 Ryan: (smiles) hey

 Gabriel: (to Ryan) what about you?  
 Seth: (to Ryan) did you ask Marissa  
 Ryan: I haven't talked to her in a while, I don't think she's gonna wanna go  
 Gabriel: and why not

 Luke: yeah I know... (seriously) I know how lucky I am to have a second chance, that's why I don't wanna waste anymore time  
 Marissa: (confused) w-what'd you mean

 Luke: I've ben an idiot. I never shoulda broken up with you in the first place, and now with everything that's goin on with your dad. the thing is you were there for me when I was in the hospital and now, I wanna be here for you (he goes to kiss her) its all just ben so crazy, I just wish we could be together, like it was

 Kirsten: right, the four of us...Gabriel, Ryan and a hundred and fifty of your closest friends  
 Sandy: Cal she's ben workin over time on this thing, the menus, the invitations, on top of the mountain of work she's ben buried under  
 Caleb: is it to much?  
 Kirsten: no work is great, we're back on track with the new development  
 Caleb: yeah after your boy out there nearly burned it to the ground  
 Kirsten: we've had a few set-backs but the accident insurance more then covered the damages  
 Caleb: and then I hear that you've commissioned an architect that I've never approved to do the redesign  
 Kirsten: I commissioned a design but I would never build without consulting you  
 Caleb: honey you don't need my approval...after all you adopted the boy without consulting me  
 (Kirsten & Sandy both look at each other, shocked)  
 Kirsten: I would've uh called you about Ryan dad but there wasn't enough time  
 Caleb: I get it, I'm pushing you to hard, things are slipping through the cracks...which is why I've decided to scale back your responsibilities  
 Kirsten: you're demoting me?  
 Caleb: I wanna get more involved, give you a chance to spend a bit more time your new family, your new son (Kirsten is speechless) now then tell me all about Jimmy Cooper, son of a bitch lost four million dollars (laughs)  
 CUT TO: Jimmy in his home office, Julie comes in  
 Julie: I took Caitlyn by the stables to say goodbye to china, guess she won't be needing these anymore (puts the horse riding stuff on Jimmy's desk) you know I think China was her best friend  
 Jimmy: China's a horse (sighs)  
 Julie: maybe to you  
 Jimmy: hey y'know...I don't feel good about this  
 Julie: well you shouldn't  
 Jimmy: what'd you (sigh) what'd you want from me?  
 Julie: (sighs) I think I want a divorce (goes to leave then turns back) I'm sorry honey, I just don't see any other way (leaves)  
 CUT TO: Marissa's door, Ryan is there

 CUT TO: Ryan at the crab shack bussing tables. Gabriel comes in  
 Gabriel: hey

 Ryan: that I can do (smiles)  
 Gabriel: alright (pulls out a mini bottle of alcohol from her bag) from the flight, I hate flying, you?  
 Ryan: I've... never ben on a plane  
 Gabriel: my first time I was fifteen, my mother sent me to Japan all by myself to do some modelling (Ryan looks at her) I guess she figured it was easier then her having to get a job  
 Ryan: I can relate  
 Gabriel: I've heard  
 Ryan: so uh, how'd the modelling thing turn out?  
 Gabriel: well when your a teenager and your living in a house with a bunch of girls...no parents, things can get a little insane (Ryan nods, listening) by the time I got clean I was 22...retirement age (off Ryan's look) you must think its weird, me with an older guy  
 Ryan: I live in a pool house (smiles)  
 Gabriel: mm (smiles) uh-hm so how'd it work out with your girl?  
 Ryan: whoo  
 Gabriel: paste eater  
 Ryan: they have a past  
 (in the background someone wants a refill, Ryan goes and serves her leaving Gabriel at the counter, smiling)  
 CUT TO: Kirsten & Sandy in the kitchen. Kirsten pours herself a coffee then throws the kettle down in the sink. she is clearly upset  
 Sandy: oh Kirsten...come on honey (holds her from behind) you could not have done more or done better  
 Kirsten: I just don't understand I've-I've worked so hard for him, I've killed myself for him  
 Sandy: well the man is a bottomless pit of need you think you can fill it, you can't. oooh (Kirsten turns to face him) you're amazing...if he can't appreciate you screw him...quit! (whispers) quit  
 Kirsten: you've never supported me working for him, you've never liked him  
 Sandy: your right I haven't, not since our wedding day when I watched you walk yourself down the aisle  
 Kirsten: he was in Singapore, there was a monsoon  
 Sandy: oh baby we changed the date three times for his schedule, he makes the world revolve around him including you!  
 Kirsten: Sandy...he's my dad  
 Sandy: and he's ruining your life...quit!  
 Kirsten: ...I can't  
 CUT TO: Ryan & Gabriel at the crab shack. They are sharing a plate of food, and talking  
 Gabriel: so you're living in a pool house and then...so what's next for you?  
 Ryan: what's next for you? the leer jet to London, Paris in the fall?  
 (Marissa walks in and sees Ryan with Gabriel)  
 Gabriel: (smiling) perhaps  
 Ryan: (sees Marissa) I'll be right back (walks over to Marissa) hey  
 Marissa: hey, got a minute?  
 (cut to them outside)  
 Ryan: what's up?  
 Marissa: I wanted to talk to you before but-  
 Ryan: Luke was there  
 Marissa: right (they look at each other) um...he wants to get back together  
 Ryan: (disappointed) what'd you tell him?  
 Marissa: I told him I needed to think about it  
 Ryan: ah huh  
 Marissa: (she clearly wants him to give her a sign, but he doesn't) (desperate) I don't know what I should do  
 Ryan: I don't know either (shrugs)  
 Marissa: I know I jus-  
 Ryan: look if you came here for me to help you choose  
 Marissa: of course not  
 Ryan: good (Marissa looks hurt) why don't you just let me know when you've made up your mind ok  
 Marissa: (almost crying) ok (walks away)  
 CUT TO: Ryan riding his bike & Seth on his skateboard  
 CUT TO: Marissa & Summer at some food place  
 Marissa: if he just said something, I mean I just wanted him to say anything  
 Summer: well you can't expect him to choose Coop, he comes from a place where they have like knife fights and drag racing and like s*x on the hood of a car  
 Marissa: that's from fast and the furious  
 Summer: well that movie was based on a true story  
 Marissa: (laughs) no it wasn't  
 Summer: whatevs, all I'm saying is you have to do the choosing, not him or Luke (Marissa sighs)  
 CUT TO: Ryan on his bike & Seth on his skate board, they stop at the same place Marissa & Summer are. Marissa & Summer are now sitting at a table with food  
 Seth: its fate its-its destiny look we both like burritos  
 Ryan: you wanna eat somewhere else  
 Seth: (ignoring what Ryan said) who's winning right now me or my hair?  
 (Ryan looks at him, looks at his hair, then back over to the girls)  
 CUT TO: Marissa & Summer at the table  
 Summer: I'm gonna get us some (?)  
 (Summer gets up from the table and just as she turns around Seth & Ryan walk up)  
 Seth: hi Summer...Seth Cohen  
 Summer: could you give me a hand... (points) over here  
 (they both walk off leaving Ryan & Marissa alone)  
 Ryan: ok (sits down) I-I know you gotta figure some stuff out I get that but... in the mean time there's this party that uh well its for Seth's grandfather  
 Marissa: I know...I'm going...Luke asked me this morning  
 Ryan: (disappointed) cool well um... ill see you and Luke tomorrow night  
 Marissa: (nodding) yeah, see ya (Ryan leaves)  
 CUT TO: Seth & Summer  
 Seth: (?) aggressive (?) that's classic, holy jalapeno somebody came to play

 Seth: (suprised) what  
 Summer: I just got my nails done, it'll ruin the polish  
 Seth: (making a face) you lick it!  
 Summer: I don't like picante, it's for Marissa (still holding her pinky out)  
 Seth: (hesitates then quickly licks it) uh-hm  
 Summer: thanks

 CUT TO: Kirsten & Sandy in their bedroom  
 Sandy: hey  
 Kirsten: hey, how was court (kisses him)  
 Sandy: (excited) I was distracted all day and I couldn't help but think that if you quit d'you know what we could do  
 Kirsten: I'm not quitting  
 Sandy: no hear me out, we could find out who's living in our old house in Berkley, we could buy it back, you loved that house Seth loved that house  
 Kirsten: that house had bad plumbing an termites  
 Sandy: oh it was a fixer upper that we never got to fix up  
 Kirsten: (laughs) I know  
 Sandy: we moved here cause your mom got sick, we never planned to stay if you quit we could do anything we want we could go anywhere  
 Kirsten: no we-cant  
 Sandy: why not? Seth has been planning his exodus from this place since he was six Ryan wouldn't care, you-you could get that little gallery in Sorselido you've always dream of or the mission you could put your art history degree to good use  
 Kirsten: (smiling) I haven't thought about that gallery in years  
 Sandy: so (pulls her to him) think about it (kisses her) (holds her hands) think about it  
 CUT TO: Marissa & Summer in Marissa's room  
 Summer: (holding a dress) is this to slutty to wear to an old guy's birthday party, I don't want the dude to have a coronary

 Summer: aloha Caleb Nichol is like the Donald Trump of the west (Marissa half smiles) do you know how many hot rich 20 something banker brokers are gonna be there (Marissa looks at her and raises her eyebrows) alot and now I have someone to introduce me to them  
 Marissa: isn't that a little mean to Seth  
 Summer: to who? (Marissa looks at her) kidding!

 Kirsten: well thankyou I order from them all the time (smiles)  
 Caleb: (laughs) less time at work more time for cooking  
 Sandy: yeah because there is just no place Kirsten feels more comfortable than in the kitchen  
 Seth: (looks at Sandy) what're you talkin about, mom can't even make cereal  
 Kirsten: (looks at Seth) thanks Seth!  
 Seth: I love you mom (makes a cutesy face)  
 Kirsten: I love you too (imitates Seth's face) (clears the table)  
 Caleb: you have a quick wit Seth, amazing you're not better at skirt chasing  
 Seth: oh... well if by skirts you mean girls in your outdated cowboy speak I have a little news for you it turns out that somebody has a date to your party (Caleb raises his eyebrows, Sandy looks impressed) and its not a big deal or anything but if you must know Summer asked me  
 Sandy: (suprised) oh Summer, wow, Summer's hot (Gabriel laughs)  
 Seth: you did not just say that  
 Sandy: (getting up) say what?  
 Seth: (mortified) jus go...please  
 Sandy: (suggestively) you go

 CUT TO: The kitchen. Kirsten is rinsing plates and Sandy walks in  
 Sandy: Caleb seems to be in good spirits he just polished off his second bottle of merlot, now would be a very good time to talk to him

 Kirsten: yeah  
 Caleb: are you adopting another kid  
 Kirsten: it's nothing  
 Sandy: uh actually it it's something  
 Caleb: I've never known my daughter to need someone to speak for her  
 Sandy: maybe you've never really gotten to know your daughter (heatedly) if you did you'd know she is the best thing to ever happen to that company, you'd support her not demote her to the point where she wants to quit  
 Kirsten: Sandy!  
 Caleb: is that true you wanna quit?  
 Kirsten: no! I-  
 Sandy: Kirsten  
 Kirsten: (softly) we were talking!

 Caleb: ehh it didn't sound like nothing...infact...thanks Sandy for letting me know how she feels, she would never tell me that she never tells me anything (Kirsten looks frustrated) if you wanna quit that's fine, ill expect your resignation in the morning (Kirsten looks upset) now then the grappa

 Kirsten: ok worst apology ever  
 Sandy: (sitting) you know I'm no good at those, look the important thing is it's out there, you spoke your mind

 Jimmy: why not  
 Julie: this whole community thinks you're a criminal Jimmy! Caleb Nichol owns the community what makes you think he feels differently

(hear the sound of the door handle being pushed down) they both look towards the door to see a shocked/stunned Marissa standing in the door way)  
 Marissa: oh sorry I-I thought (Ryan sits up and looks at her) (hurt & confused) sorry (leaves and slams the door)

 Summer: (offended) that's-not true (Seth gives her a look) ok... maybe a little  
 Seth: do you have any idea how pathetic it is to sit there an listen to you babble about mergers and acquisitions while some guy just stares at your boobs  
 Summer: which guy was starting at my boobs (looks around)  
 Seth: who cares (stands up) listen to me the point is that that guy doesn't you, he doesn't care about who you really are. infact he has no idea that every day of 3rd grade you shared your lunch with that little skinny squirrel that kept getting his nuts stolen by that fat squirrel  
 Summer: I hated that mean squirrel  
 Seth: and-none of those guys were there when you had to read your poem aloud in class and your hand was shaking because you were nervous and you cared what the other kids thought

 Caleb: if you're looking for a fight  
 Sandy: no save it, you an I both know the only reason your punishing her is cause she is doing so well without you, your afraid she's not gonna need you to tell her how to run the company or her family and I got news for ya she's better then you at both...if you don't wanna lose her then just let her keep doin what she's ben doing, you'll stay rich she'll be happy an I'll-ill figure out a way to make it work

 (she runs her fingers through his hair, touches his arm then leaves. Ryan just sits there, almost crying)  
 CUT TO: Marissa & Luke in Luke's bedroom. they are making out on his bed. you see Luke's hand over Marissa's thigh which shows she's only wearing her underwear and nothing on top. goes between close ups of their bodies, and them kissing. It's very steamy
