 (three gunshots) 
 (boy praying in German) 
 There was a boy. 
 Find him. 
 Sounds like the Menno mob. 
 You're kidding, right? A Mennonite mob? No joke. Is this the boy Gerry's looking for? If the police take him, the Epps will know and the boy will die. Woman :  We have to protect him. Bring me that boy or worry about your own family. You really do want these people... your people...  behind bars, huh? They're violent and degenerate. They're your people now. Sir, we have a warrant to search the premises. Phone Joey. (grunting in pain) You put Gerry in jail? Now you are the new boss. (insects buzzing) (sigh) (taking a breath) (engine revving up) (cow mooing) (bird cawing) Noah? Noah! (Noah panting) Hey. Hey. (Noah grunting) (chickens clucking) Ugh! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Ugh! (Noah panting) Up there. Between the two beams, there is a key. Ugh! Our emergency funds. After supper, I'll give them to Anna. ♪ And you take a bus to cousin Herman in Toronto. He married an  Auslander,  but he'll help. Once Eli Voss and his men are put away, you bring my family back to the farm, to live the way God intends. You don't have to do this. God says otherwise. (tinkling) (Noah sighing) I had the reins around my waist. There was a snake in the grass. He... Hey, you know how that mare can be. (gasping and hissing in pain) ♪ I lied for you in church. I will do whatever I have to to protect my family. Lie to anyone you want to, but not to me. (hissing in pain) What happened? Eli Voss sent a message. Hey. It's O'Reilly. So? So we traced the drugs back to an outfit operating out of a local Mennonite community and ended up arresting four. What about Voss? Close, but... (indistinct chatter) ...no. How close? He, uh, was in the farmhouse and somehow slipped through a second-story window. You had drugs and Voss in the same location, and you didn't seal the perimeter? The tip was time sensitive and I had to move fast. What can I say? (sighing) Alright. Next time... if there is one... I need you to say to your superior officer, "Eli Voss  moves millions in product every year for the Mexican cartels. I need you to take this seriously." OK. Well, it's not over yet. Let's hope not. Keep me posted. Novak! Yeah. "Epp, Jeremias." The arrest report says that you seized his phone, so why isn't it on the evidence list? I typed it in. Right here. Doesn't matter. I've got the phone here somewhere. Jay, I put the phone in the box. It's a wonder that I let you two even go for coffee by yourselves. Find the phone! (indistinct chatter) (Jay sighing) Jay, I gave you that phone at the bust. That's right. And I bagged it. And then we checked off the list of evidence together then... I put it in my trunk. (buzzing noise) Ah, God. (sigh) Novak. If you want to see your badge again, listen very carefully. My what?! Your I.D. and your badge. Put $500... (Beep) (sigh) (cows mooing) (bell tinkling) (serene soundscape) Anna : Amen. Amen. Ahem! (knocking on door) (disquieting music) I'm here for Noah. Abel too. ♪ Get in the truck! Ne. (clanking) Get in the truck. (whispering) Get in the truck. If this is going to be my last day on Earth, I won't commit a  sin  by riding in that. Snowflake knows her way home. (crickets chirping) (cell phone ringing) (menacing music) ♪ Guten Tag,  Mr. Epp. (truck door closing) (Novak sighing) So, I guess you already know that prison's no place for a Mennonite. Especially with all those murderers and pedophiles. Not the kind of place you want to turn the other cheek. (chuckling) So, here's what I'm thinking. I don't think anybody's gonna be surprised when they find you hanging by your bootlace next time this door opens in Maidenstone. Yeah? Argh! (Grunting) Now, I'm not asking you to rat out your uncle 'cause I hear he's pretty good with a knife, but, hey... Look, if you just tell me who's taking over for you in Ontario, it'd save me a lot of time. I can't. Even for that,  Onkel  would kill me and my family. (thump) (Gerry grunting) (indistinct word) What's that? I can't hear you. Huh? Sounds like you're choking on your shoe lace, huh? Speak up! Noah Funk! (gasping) (coughing) Say that again. (Gerry panting) That  Schwindel  Noah Funk! (Gerry grunting) (crickets chirping) Epp! Epp! I swear I had nothing to do with planting that dope. I will die before I help you bring that poison into my community. ♪ Hmm. Come. (moaning) Ah. (clinking) Your brother's life is in your hands. (clinking) Say "no" again, and it will be your brother and your family in that hole. If I say yes, my family is safe? Ja. And the Janzen boy, you'll leave him alone, you promise? If I want to talk, I'll call you. ♪ (sigh of relief) Ah. OK. Noah :  Hoo! Where have you been all night? Are you alright? What have they done to Abel? Tina, warm some water on the stove! We have to go to work! A little business, and then I'll come in. Go on inside. You're gonna tell her? Ne. She'll find out sooner or later. You're my  Onkel's  man in Ontario. Everybody answers to you now. How do we start? (horse whinnying) There's been a bust...  danke schön...  so the first thing, we must change numbers. Phone numbers? Go downtown, buy 30 burners. Keep one, and deliver your new number... and a burner to all the contacts in my brother's phone. What's a "burner"? A burner is a pre-paid phone. Pre... (word in German) (indistinct chatter) Hey. I know you're into drawing, and there's something I wanna show you. Can't really say, but it's art. And it's downtown. (phone ringing) I can't. Do it at lunch. There and back. Boom. Kyle's mom went on a cruise, and he's been using her car. ♪ (mooing) Of course, they were planted. Gerry says someone gave the police the drugs to plant, so we'd be forced to sell our land. Na ja. Auslanders! God willing, the truth will come out. So much trouble, and you, the new Pastor's wife, and yet you still find time to visit. So kind. Of course. Even with the singing to plan for tomorrow. I'd be frantic by now. It's tomorrow? Hoo! Nothing fancy. Just get, uh, the cheapest ones that you can. You know what? Just, uh, get 30 of these. ♪ (clicking) (distant siren blaring) ♪ Hello, sir. What can I do for you today? I need, uh, 30, uh, burners. Burner phone? Come on, Abel. (clicking) Let's go, buddy. Goddammit! (sigh) (phone ringing) Hey, Doc. It's Novak. You don't happen to know a Mennonite junkie by the name of Abel Funk, do you? Ah, does this mean that you're off probation or do you still have to sit in the corner during lunch period? You gonna share or do I have I revoke your "dental license"? Abel Funk is a deadbeat crackhead who stopped paying so I cut him off. OK, well, today is his lucky day because you're gonna welcome him back in with a one-time free offer. Professional standards do not permit the Doctor to do "free." Relax. I'm buying, OK? Just make the call, OK? Thank you. (beep) (sigh) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) Ja. Really? Ja, ja. ♪ Hey, uh, you Mennos allowed to play Xbox? Kyle... What? No, seriously. We... rakaka... could get her strapped on with, like, a .9 or something? Come on. ♪ There you are, sir. Ah. Phone. If I may? There's no sin if you're not killing real people, right? No, it can't be. Like, it's... Kyle... ♪ Kyle : Hey, Tina! Ben : Just hold up! Abel? Abel?! (frustrated sigh) (buzzing) Good morning? (sigh) ♪ 
 
 (making lip-smacking sounds) Giddup! Go! Thank goodness you're here. Isaac, I need you to get the cows in. (horse whinnying) Tina, no! Tina! I need you right now. (footsteps) What is going on? ♪ Why won't you talk to me? (crickets chirping) Abel. I need your help. Oh. Yeah. Sorry about this... There is a list of names in there. I need you to show it to me. I have to call these people and give them each a phone. Since you know so much about this filthy business, you're going to help me. (Abel coughing) Hang on. That's the button you use to start talking. That's the button you use to stop talking. Everyone thinks they'll be so connected with this. Ja.  Connected to strangers, connected to sin. A tiny little devil in every ear. Tss! (dog barking) Gerry... Gerry... (Noah speaking German) (distant train horn) I folded the laundry. Borrowed a shirt. Your clothes are on the dryer. Got a whole Johnny-Cash vibe going on right now. Alright. Alright. I like it. Hahaha! (door opening) (crowd-cheering ringtone) Novak! You don't just hang up on people. Do it again  and I'll take your badge to your chief... (school bell ringing) Tina. Tina. I just wanted to say sorry again for the whole "downtown" thing. Maybe we could try again. I could get Kyle to drive us again. My parents would never allow that. How about this? We'll be at the end of your driveway at 8 o'clock. If you're there, great. If not, it's OK too. (phones ringing) (indistinct chatter) I wanna see the Chief! Hehe, it's OK. Hey! Yeah, hi. Good to see you. Where is my goddamn badge? Hey! Hey! Oh, look at this. "Loretta Dunkel"? Haha! Now I know where you live. I want my money! Yes! I earned it!  Arschloch! What did you just say? Arschloch.  Arsehole. (Novak sniggers.) You, you wouldn't happen to be Mennonite, would you? Ja, Eefelt.  Now give me back my license. Do you like pie, Loretta? Then, my  Auslander  boyfriend promises to marry me, so I tell the bishop, "Take your rules and shove 'em up your... Arschloch! You see how much you learn when you're not always cutting people off? (laughing) Speaking of which, it's time for a... a little more translation, please. Yeah. Yeah, uh... Cheddar makes it better.

♪ Thy power to save ♪♪ (conversations in German) You have a beautiful voice. You are new here,  ja? My father just bought the welding shop near town. And your father is pastor? Yeah. I guess that means you'll be baptized soon. Yeah. I hope so. That's exciting. I hope to be as well. I'm just 17, but I think I'm ready. I need those potatoes. Tina, now! (sigh) Irma didn't come. She was supposed to bring the  holubtsi. You're too slow! It's like you've never peeled any  sokh  in your life. (Tina hissing in pain) Komme. Komme. I don't have time for this. Sure, but  Pater  has time to be downtown looking at phones?! (whispering) I thought I was  verrückt,  but I saw him. It was  Vater. You went downtown? Ja. Who took you downtown? Are you even listening? Who took you downtown? Friends. Auslander  friends? Boys? What is so wrong with that? (Anna sighing) Go to your room. Go, and pray that God forgives you for your wickedness. Ah, Tina. Tomorrow, after church, I know it's supposed to be our time together but I have business. It's private church business, so I was thinking maybe we plan something special for next Sunday. Tina, go. (buzzing) I know this is  verrückt,  but were you downtown yesterday buying phones? What? Someone I know, and I won't say who, they think that they saw you buying phones. Phones?  Ne,  that's... Verrückt? Ja. Ganz verrückt. Ne. I have to go. Ja. (door closing) (crickets chirping) Time to deliver those phones. (indistinct chatter) (dinging sound) (vehicle door closing) (engine revving up) (distant conversations) (wood creaking) (vehicle driving away) (distant conversations) (door squealing) (soft music) (Ben sighing) ♪ (spray-can shaking sound) (sinister music) (distant train horn) (knocking on door) ♪ (buzzing) (door closing) Please give your old phone to Joey. Take a new one. ♪ You were my husband's last hope. (spray-panting sounds) (vehicle approaching) (siren call) (Tina panting) (recording of men speaking German) "Cheese plane," OK. Epp's farm. Epp's farm. Epp's farm. Yes, when are you landing at the Epp's farm? What are you... what are you landing at the Epp's farm?! (crowd-cheering ringtone) (buzzing) Hey, pal, you OK? (dog barking) Thank, pal. I appreciate it. Let's go. So, this is where you come? Sometimes. Annnd... you are? This is Tina. I'll make it up to you somehow, I promise, but can we please drive her home? OK. Where are we going? A farm about a mile past the Mennonite church house. Thank you. You're a Mennonite? I know you guys aren't all related and into that weird stuff, OK, but do you happen to know a woman by the name of Anna Dahl? She's my mother. (distant train horn blowing) One second. Benny boy, come here for a second. I just wanna talk to you. Listen. You're gonna walk home and think about what you've done. OK? Thanks, champ. Ms. Funk. (Novak sniffling) Shall we? Believe it or not, I got a thing for a Mennonite girl back in the day, in high school. Uh-huh. Anna Dahl. My mother went out with you? Nah. I mean, once or twice, holding hands... kid stuff. She found the right guy. Yeah, your dad. Speaking of your dad, he must be really busy with all that pastor stuff, huh? Yes. Ohh, man, so terrible those arrests. Gerry Epp and his gang, those are really dangerous guys. Yes. I know your dad would never ask me for help, so I just feel, as a detective and, you know, as a favour to your mom, you know, it's my duty to, you know, check in on him. Particularly if you think that he's doing anything dangerous. Tina, if you know anything, you should tell me. Look at me. For your father's sake. We always go for a ride in the buggy on Sundays. Just me and him. We never miss. But this Sunday, he says he has "church" business. You don't think he's...? No. No. (chuckling) No, but thanks for telling me though. That's... That is good to know. Good to know. (birds chirping) (peaceful music) (cows mooing) (bells ringing) (serene music) Noah : Amen. ♪ Ahem! (word in German) ♪ Where do we find God? Some say He is everywhere... the earth, the sky, the stars... but if this is true, then... ...how do we truly see even a piece of Him? I believe He is in here, inside each of us. We can't see Him, but if we are very quiet, if we listen very carefully, we can hear Him. (man clearing his throat) And He is telling me that we have been keeping a secret for far too long. If a loved one wants to work for Eli Voss, come to me. If you need help to quit working for Eli Voss, come to me. And together, we will say "Get thee hence, Satan." (cell phone buzzing) (Noah coughing) Excuse me. I'm sorry, I need some air. (cell phone buzzing) (Noah coughing) (door closing) (indistinct whispering) (cell phone buzzing) Ja? What kind of sermon was that?! (Noah speaking German) Eli wanted a leader, and now he has one. And our cheese plane has cows on the runway. (Ernesto speaking German over the phone.) Ernesto. Ja? Noah. No more secrets. You show me. Right now. ♪ Ja, ja, ja. Ja. Ja. Ja. ♪ I had to tell Voss that I would take Gerry's place so that he wouldn't hurt you and the family. I thought I had no choice, but now I see, now I understand. Gelassenheit.  Submission. God wants me to submit to His plan, so I can meet everyone in Voss's business. I write down their names and their crimes, and then I can destroy this whole satanic mob. ♪ Oh, Ne, Ne, Ne! (gurgling noise) (inaudible word) We have to get them out! (horse whinnying) (car engine roaring) Who is that? The policeman. Bronco Novak. Wait! Wait, where are you going? Let's go! Now! But the men in the plane! Komme! (engine revving up) Ne. Ne. Get in the truck! Get in! ♪ (distant car engine roaring) (cows mooing) ♪ (horse whinnying) ♪ (gurgling noise) (Novak grunting) ♪ (seagulls squawking) (cows mooing)
