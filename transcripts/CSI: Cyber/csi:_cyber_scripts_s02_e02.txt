 (music playing, everyone whooping) 
 Woman : I don't know, what do you think? 
 (laughing): Look at this one. 
 The one with the Mohawk! 
 Woman 2 : No way! I was into that guy! 
 Man : So far, so good, right? 
 Right? Like, it, right? Yeah? 
 I like it. 
 Man : Yeah? 
 Women : Yeah. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Man 2 : 20 feet away and you know my weakness for redheads. 
 Woman : This redhead! Partner! 
 Man 2 : It's a match. It's a match. 
 Woman : Oh, my God. 
 Man 2 : Check it out. 
 Man 3 : Look at this! It's perfect! 
 Ramirez : How'd you find this place? 
 On an app called “Run-A-Tab.” 
 This is what you've been missing when you've been working every Friday night. 
 Major male hotness. 
 Ew! 
 Except for this loser. 
 Is he “hearting” every woman in here? 
 Do you remember when a guy would buy you a drink, start an actual conversation? 
 Nope! (laughing) 
 (loudly): Hi! 
 Hi! 
 Uh, can I get you another one? 
 Uh, it's just a soda. 
 Perfect! 
 We have something in common already. 
 I have 64 days. 
 Six months. 
 Congrats. 
 Thank you. 
 So, uh... uh, do you go to meetings? 
 It's called anonymous for a reason. 
 (laughing): Right, right. 
 Sorry. 
 This is all just new to me. 
 Look, you're really sweet, but you should know I have a boyfriend... so... 
 (anxious laugh) 
 Oh! 
 Okay. 
 Um... 
 Enjoy your night. 
 Good night. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 (snickers) 
 A boyfriend?! 
 I didn't want to lead him on. 
 I just wasn't feeling it. 
 But this guy... 
 Oh, hell to all the yeses. 
 What?! 
 You are so popular on HeartMate. 
 Most of these guys don't get past the texting phase. 
 (wry laugh) 
 Hey. 
 Man : You are so hot. 
 Want to hang out? Want to get out of here? 
 I got no plans. 
 Want to be with you. 
 Hi! 
 (laughs) It's for us. 
 Operator : 911. What is your emergency? 
 I-I heard gunshots and screaming. 
 My, uh, my neighbor... she's-she's in danger. 
 I-I think the guy's still in there. 
 P-Please hurry! 
 (siren wails in distance) 
 (SWAT officers shouting) 
 Go, go, go, go! 
 (woman screaming) 
 Stay where you are! Tracy! 
 Officer : In the back room! 
 Officer 2 : Right where you are! 
 Now! Now! Move! 
 Clear! 
 Clear! 
 (indistinct, overlapping conversations) 
 Nelson : Any leads on who SWATed you last weekend? 
 Still no. 
 I feel really bad about what happened, Raven. 
 I could tell by your stealth getaway down the fire escape when SWAT busted down my door. 
 Okay, look, you said it three times now. 
 You've reminded me every day since it happened. 
 I did it to protect you... us. 
 The police report that puts me in your apartment at 3:00 a.m.? 
 Yeah, you were... smart to leave. 
 It just sucked. 
 Russell : Aw, this is amazing. 
 (Ryan laughs) 
 Baby pacifiers?! 
 Are congratulations in order? 
 You, uh... you flatter me. 
 These things are so cool. 
 They're Bluetooth-enabled pacifiers, from England. 
 Here, let me... 
 Hold this. 
 The teat can measure temperature... knows its own location, and then it tracks the medications that you're giving your child... and then all that information is sent back to the parent's phone. 
 Or in this case, my tablet. 
 37 degrees Celsius. 
 (chuckles) 98.6 Fahrenheit. 
 Perfect toasty body temperature. 
 I thought I'd have Raven check these out for vulnerabilities. 
 How you doing? 
 We got an update on the infamous Garth Rizzo. 
 Who's that? 
 Garth Rizzo-- otherwise known as the most hated man on the Internet. 
 He's been running a revenge p0rn site called ShamedExxx.com, for a year now. 
 He victimizes innocent women by posting their private naked photos on his blog, and recently, he went from uploading two photos a day, to ten. 
 He's averaging about 20 million views a week. 
 Unfortunately, we can't arrest him for being a scumbag. 
 We've been going after him for months, but he's got a squeaky-clean record, and an army of lawyers. 
 Krumitz : And he's got a ton of followers. 
 They call themselves "shamers." 
 They've basically turned Rizzo into a god. 
 How's he get their photos? 
 Well, guys send him photos of their exes to make themselves feel better after being dumped. 
 And Rizzo's just decided that these women (phone ringing) needed to be put on blast. 
 And we can't just take down the site? 
 The DOJ's attorney's hands are tied. 
 Technically, Rizzo's not breaking any laws. 
 Same rights that protect our freedom of speech protect Rizzo. 
 Yeah, the only way we can arrest him is to prove that he hacked the devices to obtain the photos. 
 I don't suppose we can get a warrant for search. 
 Mundo : Not until we can prove he's doing something illegal. 
 So we have to prove that he's doing something illegal so we can take a look at his devices, but to look at his devices, we have to prove he's doing something illegal. 
 That's a nice Catch-22. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Raven, take that if you need to. 
 So let's start where we always do, reach out to the newest victims on the site, see if any devices were hacked. 
 Tracy :  Sorry I called in the middle of a work day. 
 I didn't know what else to do. First, all my utilities were shut off. The service companies blamed it on a computer error. Then my mail got put on vacation hold. The post office said that I filled out a form online-- I didn't. And then, yesterday, I get called into HR. At work. Due to the nature of the e-mails you sent Mr. Williams... What e-mails? ...we're going to have to ask you to pack up your things, and leave the office immediately. You're firing me? You're lucky I'm not calling the cops, Tracy. He said that I sent him an e-mail threatening to tell his wife about our affair. There is no affair! I never sent those e-mails, Raven, but-but because they're coming from my account, nobody believes me! And then, two days ago, I get kicked out of my apartment. I don't have anywhere to go! You can't just evict me! You're the one who terminated your lease. I would've appreciated a call, not just an e-mail, you know. Finally, I went to the cops. All of these e-mails came from your account. Yeah, but I didn't write any of them. Well, do you know who did? Isn't that your job to figure out? Look, if there's no name, then there's really nothing we can do for you. Someone's hacked my computer, pretends to be me, and is literally destroying my life. They have to be stopped. We have no leads on this. And even if you did know who was doing this, in order to get a restraining order against that person, they would need to physically threaten you. So, whoever is doing this has to try to kill me before you get off your ass! Look, Raven, I know that you work in I.T. for the museums-- is there anybody who could maybe look at my computer? Or maybe you? I know you did some hacking. Of course. Hey, I'll see what I can do. And you can stay with me until you get your apartment figured out. (phone chimes) Well, that may be awhile, because my bank account is empty. Mundo : Just hear me out. I... You're being unreasonable. I... I'll be there as soon as I can. I've reached out to the, uh, to the new victims of Rizzo's site... Elijah, there cos a point where whatever's going on in your personal life starts to reflect on your work. You're saying it has? And there's a point where I just care about you. I know you spent the last few nights in the bar, instead of home with your family. And you can't use that "I was working late" excuse with me. Is everything okay with you and Devon? Yes. Yeah, it's... What is it? (sighs) My dad has cancer. Oh, Elijah. What kind of cancer? Is there a prognosis? They found an inoperable tumor in his spinal cord... He needs chemo and radiation, and he's refusing treatment. There's a possibility he could be paralyzed or... you know... worse. You just need to focus on your family right now. Take some time off; do what you need to do. What I need to do is work. ♪ ♪ There you are: an unauthorized IP address. Gotcha. The hacker's name is Kyle Bristow, and this morning he emptied my friend Tracy's bank accounts from his home computer in Maryland. Raven, I know she's your friend, but one case of bank fraud doesn't require the whole Cyber Division. He got her fired from her job, and evicted from her apartment. I think Tracy was the target of the SWATing. I really believe that Tracy's in danger. I'll tell you what: I'll send Elijah to check out Kyle Bristow. Meanwhile, you and Krumitz stay on this Rizzo case. Great. Thank you, Avery. (door creaks open) (indistinct radio communication) Victim's name is Kyle Bristow. Medical examiner determined his death sometime within the last three hours. Blunt force trauma. Wife confirmed there's a decorative obelisk missing from the mantel. Ryan : Whew! Overkill. This denotes a crime of passion, driven by anger. Killer kept striking Kyle, even after he was dead. This is personal. The wife's alibi checks out. She was at work during the TOD. We know she got here just before you did. So what are you thinking, should we just hand this case off to Maryland PD? Raven has proof Th Kyle was a hacker. There's a cyber element to this case that's ours. Did you find anything in the vic's devices? Yeah. Got two cell phones on the victim. One of them was a burner with a lot of activity, including some very angry text threats... from Raven's friend Tracy. Looks like they knew each other. Maybe Tracy wasn't looking for justice. Maybe she was looking for revenge. ♪ CSI Cyber 2x02 ♪

Krumitz : Yeah, there's a naked photo of you online. Ramirez : Now, would you be willing to drive to D.C.? Krumitz : No, this is not a prank. Ramirez : Today would be great. Okay. Bye. I'm an agent at the FBI. Hello? Hello... Hmm. Heard from Tracy? No. No, her phone is off. This is not like her. Something's wrong. (elevator bell dings) Elijah? Did you talk to Kyle Bristow? What happened? Um... (sighs) Kyle Bristow was found murdered in his house yesterday. What? Did you tell Tracy you'd I.D.'d her hacker? No. No, I would never do that. You can't honestly think Tracy was involved. She's the victim here. (sighs) It's tough to look at it that way after you've met Kyle's widow and two children. Raven, did you know that Tracy has a record? She's been booked on drunk and disorderly. She's been in rehab. And she's been clean for months now. She's not a murderer. Everything I see says differently. I'm sorry. ♪ ♪ (engine starts) Operator : 911. What's your emergency? Um, hi. I have information about a murder, and I think I know who did it. Nelson : These are the phones recovered from the Kyle Bristow murder scene. There's no communication between Kyle and Tracy on this phone, but... based on the messages I found on Kyle's side-piece phone, ooh, Tracy had motive to kill. Side-piece phone? You're saying that Tracy was his mistress? Yeah. The two have been messaging each other on the HeartMate dating app for the last month. Russell : Kyle was pretending to be single? I mean, he was in full-on cheater mode. Made up a whole nother life that didn't include his wife and kids. She's been asking to meet for weeks. He just kept making excuses. So, a cheater who wasn't really cheating. Yeah, but then yesterday, Kyle sent her a message saying that he wanted to meet. Sent her his address. That puts her at the scene of the crime. Definitely a bad move. The last message Tracy sent accused him of lying. Look, she found out he was married. Motive. A few days before, Kyle sent Tracy a message saying he was starting to fall in love with her. Even though they'd never met? Welcome to the world of online dating. I mean, people chat for a year, they fall in love, they get engaged-- without ever meeting each other. When I was your age, you actually used to have to walk up to a woman and say hello before you could declare your undying love. Nelson : Yeah, well, apps have changed everything. This is HeartMate. So, this app actually shows you how close you are to another user? Mm-hmm. And how many times you guys have crossed paths. Like this girl here, right? We've walked past each other... 82 times. Stalker numbers. No, no, that's Jennifer Wilkins. She works here. Really? Yeah. She's right behind you, man. No, no, don't, don't. Oh. Don't, don't. Right. Smooth. Russell : Come on. Give her a heart after that. Come on. No. Nah, I'm not really looking for anything. How about you? Any special lady in your life? No, not since my divorce. I don't think this online dating thing is for me. I'm more of a "wait for serendipity to strike" kind of guy. Serendipity? Is that a new app? How old are you? Detective :  Miss Ramirez, last weekend,  you were with Tracy Jacobs the night that SWAT came to your apartment. Is that correct? Yes. Was anyone else at your apartment that night? No. Detective : This morning, we got an anonymous tip that led us to the weapon that was used to murder Kyle Bristow. It was found in a hotel room we believe was occupied by Tracy Jacobs last night. Ryan : Detective Gonzalez, what does this have to do with Raven? Well, the same person that called in the anonymous tip also made the 911 call the night that she was SWATed. Do you have any idea who that might be? No. But whoever it was framed Tracy for Kyle Bristow's murder. That's the person you should be looking for. Raven, as Cyber Division's legal counsel, I'm advising you should refrain from comment. Just answer the questions. I know this is difficult for you because Tracy is your friend, but you need to know she is the primary suspect in this case. Gonzalez : Mi Ramirez, we know that you texted Tracy this message yesterday. "I know who your hacker is. I'm taking care of it"" Raven, is this true? Yeah, but I... I didn't give her a name. I didn't tell her it was Kyle Bristow. We found Tracy's fingerprints at the crime scene. On the door handle, inside the home. They match the partials that we lifted Gonzalez : Tracy's been off the grid ever since they found Kyle Bristow's body. Do you know where she is? No. Raven, would you mind excusing us? Gonzalez : I was wondering why the Feds were so interested in a homicide case. Now it's pretty clear. Protecting one of your own. That's not what's happening here. There's evidence of cyber fraud. That makes this our case. And I'd kindly appreciate you sending any evidence you've collected to our lab. Agent Ryan, Raven Ramirez is a known associate of our primary suspect. She could be an accessory to murder. This is a clear conflict of interest. Raven is not working on the Bristow case. There is no conflict of interest. Thank you for your time, Detective Gonzalez. Avery, next time you call me down here, just tell me the truth. You needed me to witness that conversation in case it comes back to bite you in the ass. Which it might. Point taken, Mason. Just need a little legal support from the Department of Justice. Are we in trouble here? Better make damn sure whatever work you're doing on the Kyle Bristow murder case is aboveboard. Is there anything else? Give me something on Garth Rizzo. I want that case file closed sooner than later. It's all about setting precedent. If we get Rizzo, I can advocate for stronger revenge p0rn laws. Take down all the Rizzo copycats with him. We're working on it. Okay. Got a lot going on here. (chuckles) Women have an uncanny ability to multitask. You should try it sometime. (laughs) Nelson : These points represent the frequent locations of Kyle Bristow's two phones during the last month. The one in blue his regular phone; the one in red his side-piece phone. Check this out. (typing) Russell : They only share one data point. So the only time those two phones were in the same place was at Kyle's house during the murder, right? Exactly, so in all other cases, they were miles apart. So, how can one man be in two different places at the same time? He can't. Pull up the texts from both phones. (typing) All right, the side-piece phone-- there's lower-case letters, there are abbreviations, emoticons, no punctuation. On his regular phone-- complete sentences, capital letters, no shorthand. Proves that two different people wrote the messages. Ryan : Well, it implies that. We have to prove it. Oh. Microbials. Ramirez : This was posted on Garth Rizzo's site. I took that photo years ago. I was in a long-distance relationship. It was supposed to be for his eyes only. And now it's on the Internet? God, I'm so embarrassed. You think my ex did this to me? It's possible, Marcie. You also could have been hacked by a stranger. We've already started analyzing your devices, and hopefully we'll find proof. Every person has a unique set of germs that only link back to them. They're called microbials. 'Cause of our excessive use of our devices, they're like extensions of our own flesh. Our microbials can actually transfer to our devices. So I analyzed both of Kyle Bristow's phones. Russell : On the screen here, you can see the microbials from his everyday phone. And on the right... from his side-piece phone. Nelson : They look completely different. Russell : That's because they are. Microbials are a new identifier-- as unique as fingerprints. So, if the microbials don't match on each of these phones, you're saying that Kyle didn't use both these devices. Exactly. I can tell you with... with scientific certainty these phones belonged to two different people. And this side-piece phone was not Kyle's. The microbials on it did not match a sample that was taken from his body. That side-piece phone was staged. Okay, so if the phone wasn't Kyle's, then he wasn't the one talking to Tracy on HeartMate. Whoever the real owner of this phone was, they used Kyle's photo to pretend to be him. That means all the data we pulled from the side-piece phone was all cyber-staged. Someone wanted us to believe that Kyle was having an online relationship with Tracy. 
 
 (phone ringing) Hello. Mrs. Jacobs, this is Detective Murphy. I have some questions about your daughter. Yes. Are you with Detective Gonzalez? Uh, yes. That's my partner. I just have some follow-up questions. I was just about to call you. Uh, Tracy just contacted me. She did? Did she say where she was? No, but I'm worried. Do you have any idea where she might be going? She wanted me to wire her some money. I-I know I shouldn't have, but she sounded scared. Mrs. Jacobs, you have to tell me where you sent that money. I need to bring Tracy in before she hurts herself or others. We thought the side-piece phone belonged to Kyle. Now that we know a third party was using it, let's use the HeartMate app to track our target's pattern of life. Nelson : All right, since HeartMate is always recording your movements, I have the data from all the people he's crossed paths with since he started the fake Kyle profile. And the red dots are the times he crossed paths with Tracy-- 154. Clearly he was stalking her. Nelson, eliminate all the Tracy data points when he was actively stalking her. Should give us a smaller vicinity to search. All right, that leaves us with all the locations that relate just to our target. Every one of these places should help us build a profile. Triangulate the data, narrow his domain-- where he lives, works and plays. Might help us I.D. our target. Let's see if Kyle's fake profile gives us any clues to our target's real identity. He carefully constructed his fake dating profile. He chose a good school but not Ivy League. An architect is a profession, well-respected but attainable. He chose Kyle's photo, a handsome man because our target has low self-esteem about his own appearance. So it's wish fulfillment. He's projecting an idealized self, pretending to be who he wishes he could be. Take a look at this. Looks like somebody used Kyle's network to make it look like he was the one hacking Tracy. Kyle's devices are clean. But we did locate the device he used to hack Tracy's e-mail. It's a computer at a frame store. Nelson :  This was the computer  that logged into Tracy's e-mail account. Side-piece phone also recorded the same location over 80 times. Now, either he really likes picture frames... Or he works here. It's an employee-only computer. Kyle Bristow was a customer. Wait a minute, that's the same photo he used on Kyle's fake HeartMate dating profile. Pull up the invoice. Kyle Bristow dropped off that picture a month ago. Man : Here you go, Mr. Bristow. Thank you. How's that Rizzo case going? Not great. No intrusion on Marcie's devices. And since the district doesn't have any revenge p0rn laws, once a woman sends her photo to her boyfriend or anyone, he could do whatever he wanted with it, and there's nothing we could do to help her. Which seems like the theme of my day. Tracy's not your responsibility, Raven. I know. Maybe if I had told her I worked for the FBI, she wouldn't have run. Maybe she would have run no matter what. What if I'm wrong about Tracy, Nelson? What if she's guilty? It has to be here. Can-can you please check again? My mother said she was wiring money here. Sure. I'm sorry, miss, the transaction was canceled. Um... Okay, h-how much does a SIM card cost? Ten. Fine. Thanks. Thank you. (gasps) Sorry to startle you, but, uh, you have a flat tire. Ugh, damn it. I don't have a spare. You could call a tow truck. It'll take a hour and cost you about 40 bucks. Or I could give you a ride somewhere. I mean, if-if you want. It's just a couple miles till the bus station. You know, you look familiar. Oh, I-I think I just have one of those faces. No, I-I think I've met you before. I remember now-- I offered to buy you a drink at the Corridor. Oh. Oh, right, yeah. Yeah, small world. Hey, I just got a hit on Tracy's cell phone. Look, she's traveling south on Route 15 in Virginia. She must have changed her phone number because it's still off-line. But her HeartMate app is running. 'Cause even if you change your SIM card, some apps like HeartMate stay logged in. We can find her new number. Who are you calling? I'm calling Elijah. Raven, I'm sorry, I have to do this. Local PD needs to pick her up. I know. Um, I think it's the next street here. Oh, you passed it. So how's your boyfriend? He's good. Must be nice to have someone you can count on, someone who won't ever lie to you. Yeah, it's great. Um, you know, you can actually just let me off here. (sirens blare) I'll walk. Tracy Jacobs, you're under arrest for the murder of Kyle Bristow. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Uh, Officer, I had no idea she was a fugitive. I just offered to give her a ride. She had a flat tire. Geez, she seemed so nice. I didn't kill Kyle Bristow. Then why did you run? I-I was in rehab. I have a record-- I'm guilty until proven innocent. What happened when you went to Kyle's house this morning? The door was wide open, so I-I just went inside. Was Kyle there? I don't know. I keep seeing images of his body on the ground. There was so much blood. I don't remember what happened. I really liked the guy. Why would I hurt him? Do you remember sending these messages to Kyle on HeartMate yesterday? Uh-uh. No, I didn't send these. Wait, Kyle's married? Yes. You weren't communicating with Kyle on HeartMate. But it was his picture; he was texting me. That was someone pretending to be Kyle. These are the men that had access to the computer that hacked you. Do you recognize any of them? Him, I think his name is Holden? I had a flat tire, and he offered to give me a ride. Tracy, did you have any other encounters with Holden? He said I met him in a bar. I guess I blew him off. I believe that Holden was pretending to be Kyle on HeartMate. Meeting you in that bar was no accident. He spent weeks as Kyle, getting to know you,  so that he could approach you in the real world-- your preferences, what you liked and disliked,  what made you laugh and smile. He knew I was in AA. Because I told Kyle. I told him everything. Holden is his very own Cyrano de Bergerac. When you rejected him in that bar, he felt all of his work had been for nothing, and he decided he was gonna get revenge. (door opens) Tracy Jacobs is not guilty of Kyle Bristow's murder. I need you to convince the state prosecutor to hold of for 72 hours before prosecuting. Let me give you some legal counsel instead. Walk away. This is not a hill you want to die on. I can't walk away. Mason, this young woman is innocent. Holden Katnik is framing her. The prosecutor has prints on a murder weapon, and she fled. Where's your evidence? It's clear what happened here. Holden murdered Kyle. Then he sent Tracy messages on HeartMate luring her to Kyle's house and planted a burner cell at the scene. When Tracy arrived, Holden drugged her. He took the murder weapon from the scene, drove Tracy to a motel and then planted the murder weapon in her motel room. He's responsible for the angry  messages on Tracy's phone. It's all a setup to fabricate motive. That story might impress a jury, but Tracy's testimony won't even back it up. She has no memory of those events. I mean, if you want to exonerate her, you need more than conjecture. You need to prove that this Holden Katnik did it. Nelson, Krumitz. I need to know where we stand on the Bristow case. Do we have anything to prove that Tracy's innocent? Krumitz : No. I looked at Tracy's frequent locations. She was at Kyle Bristow's house from 12:32 until 12:42 p.m. And time of death window is from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. So that does not clear Tracy. Krumitz : If we had the exact time of death, we could prove Tracy wasn't even there when Kyle was murdered. Enzymes. Oh. (laughs) Are we supposed to follow people when they say weird words and run out of the room? So if this works, we should get Kyle Bristow's exact time of death? In theory, this process will show us the degradation of the proteins in Kyle's muscles, which will narrow down the time of death to within minutes. Did you just use the word "theory"? How experimental is this? Don't worry, this has been lab tested. On pigs. No, hey, p-pigs are the closest thing we got. Don't tell me any more-- plausible deniability. (chuckles) Russell : Time of death, 11:58 a.m. Yeah. (laughs) Tracy Jacobs did not kill Kyle Bristow. I think the word "bingo" (whoops) is in order here. Hello. Oh, yeah, wait a minute. Ramirez : Tracy. Hey. Raven? I don't work for the museums, I work for the FBI, and you're the first person in my life who knows the truth. I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. Yeah, no, I-I get it. Okay, here's your new phone and laptop, completely hack-proof. Even I couldn't break the encryption on these devices. So Holden won't be able to find me? The head of the NSA won't be able to find you. It's like putting your devices in witness protection. And until we capture Holden, we've got you in a hotel set up for you. I'm so sorry this happened. I'm so glad you're okay. Michelle : Daddy? Yeah. Why didn't Grandpa pick me up from school? Is he okay? He-he just fell asleep. That's all. We always get ice cream on Fridays. Can we go? I'll get some for Grandpa too. It's gonna be okay, Daddy. It'll be all right. Cutting-edge forensics, really? The pseudoscience used to determine the "exact" time of Kyle's death isn't even validated yet, hasn't even been tested on humans yet. It may not be established method yet, but it will be. There is real science to back it up. (scoffs) You know I do things in an unconventional way. Unconventional is one thing. Irresponsible is another. This will never hold up in a court of law. And now I've got the state prosecutor on the phone, asking  me  questions. We are very close to a lead on Holden. "Very close." "Close" isn't good enough. Hey, I want Tracy Jacobs back in custody now. (cell phone chimes) (cell phone rings) Hey. Raven, you promised that Holden wouldn't be able to find me. He can't. He just texted me. He's watching me right now. That's impossible. Nobody can help me. Not even the FBI. Okay, hold on, calm down. J... Tracy? Hello, Tracy? What's wrong? Holden got ahold of Tracy. But I gave her a phone that I configured with anonymized search and disabled access to non-trusted hotspots. It's impossible. It was you. What? You're the connection. He was in Tracy's e-mails. That's how he knew you were friends. So he used me to get to Tracy, but how? You have HeartMate, don't you? Oh, my gosh. Holden saw us together the night of the SWATing. He's been following me. Explains how he got Tracy's new number. You were with her in this building an hour ago. He tracked you in here, and then he followed Tracy when she left. She has an encrypted device. Maybe he used a cell catcher to get her new number. He just had to be in close proximity. The cell catcher measures signal strength, so he would know which number was Tracy's Pull up your HeartMate account. Cross-reference all the guys the HeartMate account connected to an hour ago with all guys you connected to the night you were SWATed. It'll be a fake profile created by Holden Katnik. Ramirez : Looks like there's only one name in common, Brad. Let me see if I can get his account details. Brad Larson. Shoot. Straight to voice mail. Tracy, Holden's pretending to be Brad Larson on HeartMate. He found you by following me. If anyone by that name tries to contact you, ignore him. Let me know you got this. Just stay in your hotel room. ♪ ♪ Okay, I'm tracking Brad Larson. It's Holden's new HeartMate identity. Mundo : I need a team in Adams Morgan at Fifth and Emerson, male suspect, possible murder suspect. Raven, where's Tracy? At the hotel. We just got a call. She never made it to her room. Find her. Elijah, I'm with you. Ramirez : Amy Whittaker. Tracy created a fake profile. What are you doing? (siren blares) Holden's on the north side of the street. He's on the move. I don't have a visual. He's not in a car, definitely on foot. Let's go. ♪ ♪ Ramirez : Tracy. Raven, let me go, I have to do this. You're gonna give him what he wants? Turn you into a killer? What else am I supposed to do? He's never gonna stop. Yeah, he is. Right now. Mundo : Holden Katnik, FBI. Man : FBI, freeze. Hands in the air now. Do not move. Slowly get down on one knee. Holden Katnik, you're under arrest for computer fraud and the murder of Kyle Bristow. Come on. How did you find me? Fake name on HeartMate, Amy Whittaker, that's your alter ego when you go on benders. Are you gonna turn me in? Ryan : Are you both okay? Ryan : Let's get Tracy home. You saw the whole thing, didn't you? Hey, you handled it beautifully. How did you know I was here? Ryan : I paired with one of D.B.'s pacifiers. (chuckles) (chuckles) (elevator dings) Uh, thank you for letting me get Michelle today. Family comes first. Yeah, I-I... thought I had it all under control. I, um... I don't. Elijah... I'm here for you. We all are. Next time you talk to your father, just tell him how much he means to you. (elevator dings) Ryan : Oh, the guy with the bright ideas. Oh, come on, now, you're not beating yourself up, are you? 'Cause that whole muscle degradation technique, that was a cutting-edge choice. More like "double-edged." (chuckles) I could have gotten myself fired. Eh, if you're not almost getting fired, you're not doing your job. Well, my job is far from over. I mean, Holden might be behind bars, but Garth Rizzo is still out there, ruining women's lives. We'll get him. Have patience, my friend. It's only a matter of time. (cell phone chimes) Oh. Let me show you this. It's so bizarre. I keep getting these-these push notifications. Oh, let me see. Ah. These are from SoulmateStop.com. Mmm. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I did not create a profile. I sort of... did. (gasps) Yeah, it was a... What? It was a free trial period. Russell : Where'd you get this photo? It's horrible. Oh, it's your FBI I.D. photo. You know I got to tell you, I'm not... I'm not... I don't know how I feel about this to be honest. Don't worry, okay? Look, I chose a dating Web site that doesn't geolocate like HeartMate. Now, whoa, whoa, whoa, who's "Dolla Bill"? Stands for D.B. Both : Dolla, dolla bill, y'all. "Marital status: currently looking" Whoa, hey, Nelson, I'm divorced, and I got four kids, all right? "Incredibly virile". Yeah. Nelson : I like that one. Just man to man? "Hair color: silver fox". I-I am not comfortable with these answers, please. Online profile, that's the first impression. That's the best version of yourself. The... the better version. Yeah. (scoffs) You have over 50 messages.
