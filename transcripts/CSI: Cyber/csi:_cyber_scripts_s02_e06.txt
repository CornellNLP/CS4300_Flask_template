 All available units, Robert, Tango, Victor, to North Broad Street. 
 Tac team en route. 
 (helicopter hovering, sirens blaring) 
 Ah. We need EMTs here. 
 Officer (over radio) : Copy, Adam-214. 
 Uh, ETA ten minutes. We'll be right there. 
 What the hell?!

 Officer : Behind the tape. 
 Sorry. 
 (indistinct, overlapping chatter) 
 LAPD confirmed the driver of the other car was Brad Harper. 
 Died on impact. 
 Damn. 
 Officer said he just celebrated his 21st birthday. 
 Mundo : No skid marks. 
 This car didn't even try to stop. 
 The report says that our driverless vehicle was involved in an illegal street race. 
 Owner reported it stolen... 
 (engine revving) 
 (tires squealing) 
 ...and driven straight through  his closed garage door. 
 (engine revving, tires squealing) 
 Drag racing a remote-controlled car just took car-hacking to a whole new level. 
 Someone out there is playing  Grand Theft Auto,  only this is no video game. 
 The victims are real. 
 (indistinct radio communication) 
 Man : Come with me. 
 Okay, so, this is the same make and model of the car that was stolen and crashed. 
 I generated a 3-D model based on factory blueprints, and then highlighted the mechanical systems that connected to the car's onboard computer. 
 Which, thanks to super cool, yet totally unnecessary new features, is pretty much everything. 
 Headlights, turn signals, steering, brakes-- all vulnerable. 
 Cars are pretty much computers on wheels these days. 
 Yet another reason to love my '68 Mustang. 
 (laughs) Do me a favor. 
 Pull up the crime scene photos, will you? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, how do... how do we know that the... the driver didn't jump from the car before the crash? 
 I think this was the ultimate car hack. 
 Someone was remotely driving this car. 
 And how do we know that for certain? 
 The Event Data Recorder will tell us. 
 90% of new cars have one. 
 Records everything in the moments leading up to a collision. 
 And there are sensors underneath the seats, so it'll tell us if anybody was inside. 
 Like a little black box in an airplane crash, this device will tell us everything that happened. 
 Okay, I buy that. 
 (grunting with effort) 
 It's kind of a mess in here. 
 Krumitz : It should be jammed up against the wheel well. 
 All right, I'm plugging to the car's CAN-Bus, downloading data. 
 Krumitz : Great. Okay, now, the black box will tell us everything that happened leading up to the collision, and the CAN-Bus should tell us how the target hacked in. 
 Now, if it were me, I'd go one of three ways-- the navigation system, the emergency response system, or the onboard diagnostic dongle. 
 (laughing): The what? 
 Dongle. 
 The insurance company's device you self-install to get your money back for safe driving? 
 Yeah, dongle. 
 (laughing): That's what I said! 
 Well, you use that word one more time, I'm gonna call HR. 
 Dongle. 
 Oh, I-I... 
 Dongle! 
 Okay, there you go, buddy. 
 What? It's a computer thing! 
 Russell : No, I'm calling right now. 
 You wouldn't say that around Avery, would you? 
 Nelson : What are you guys talking about? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my. 
 All right. 
 Got it. 
 Doesn't look too damaged. 
 All right. 
 Nelson : All right. 
 We'll send the data from the black box, along with everything from the car's computer. 
 Krumitz : Wait. 
 If I'm analyzing the black box and the CAN-Bus, what are you guys gonna do? 
 We're going to Disneyland. 
 (laughs) 
 You don't think they're really gonna go, do you? 
 I would. 
 Woman (on TV) : I'm here in downtown Los Angeles where late last night, an illegal street race resulted in the tragic death of a young man on his way home from work. 
 Witnesses claim the street race was broken up by police and one of the cars fled the scene. 
 But in a shocking turn of events, witnesses also claim that no one was behind the wheel. 
 We're waiting for police... 
 Ramirez : What's Director Silver doing in Cyber? 
 Ah, he's giving tours. 
 Got to hire a new deputy director since Avery turned down the position. 
 But more importantly, why are all the darn pens in this place missing springs? 
 Nobody uses pens anymore. 
 Well... 
 There is so much press on this accident and the driverless car. 
 Did you see this? 
 I saw it on the news five times before realizing it was my son's car that was hit. 
 I came here to ask every network to stop replaying the footage. 
 Please! 
 Just stop playing it. 
 Let us grieve in peace. 
 Russell : Losing a child... unthinkable. 
 But having to watch all of this over and over again-- can't even imagine. 
 Footage of the crash is on every network, blog, social media site. 
 A remote-controlled car on the loose? 
 It's a huge story. 
 Well, let's find and arrest the hacker responsible, make that the story. 
 All right, where are we? 
 Krumitz asked me to analyze the black box, and I don't think this accident was an accident. 
 The target's car was picking up speed when it slammed into Brad Harper. 
 Wait a minute. The car is accelerating? 
 Ramirez : And steered into  the collision. 
 (engine revving) 
 The target crashed his car on purpose. 
 Why? Was he trying to get rid of the digital dust so we couldn't track him? 
 Yeah, he didn't. 
 His car's computer is telling us that his commands were not from the navigation system, emergency response system, or the insurance dongle. 
 He didn't hack in remotely. 
 So our target installed a foreign device to control the car, and we need to find it. 
 ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 
 Guys! Guys! Check it out. 
 An open source microcontroller connected to the car's OBDtwo. 
 It's got to be our hacking tool. 
 Ryan : This is how the target took control of the car. 
 Got a SIM card, which means it has a cellular connection. 
 Target could've been controlling this vehicle from anywhere. 
 Nelson : We can pull records to find the cell number the SIM card was connecting with. 
 And get the target's current location. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right, it's race time, baby! 
 Now, where is he? 
 Mundo : Target's cell was a burner. 
 Dropped off the network the moment the race ended. 
 We can't track him. 
 But we can track the cell towers the phone connected with. 
 Mundo : Only pinged one tower, so he was relatively stationary. 
 However, target was controlling the vehicle from somewhere within this circle. 
 Nelson : That's all of downtown Los Angeles. No way we'll find him. 
 Ryan : Then we'll find the other driver from last night's race. 
 Look, street racing is dangerous enough. 
 This black hat has no regard for anyone else's safety. 
 We have to find him before he races again, or more people will die.

 Mundo : FBI. We're looking for the owner of that car. 
 They go by the name Blaze, AKA Carmen Lopez. 
 This is about the race the other night? 
 I already spoke to the cops, and they let me go. 
 Yes, but we're FBI-- we have questions of our own. 
 Someone died during that race. 
 You could be charged with involuntary manslaughter. 
 I was yanked from my car and handcuffed five miles away from that crash. 
 Carmen, who was controlling the other car in that race? 
 I don't know. 
 Ryan : You're new to this crew. 
 No neck tattoo. 
 You're not a full- fledged member yet. 
 Th race was your initiation. 
 L.A. Street Kings looking for new drivers to transport drugs across the border? 
 As I'm sure you already know, in addition to illegal street racing, word is your friends are also running a massive drug ring. 
 You have two prior arrests for drug possession. 
 You talk, or you're looking at time. 
 The other driver goes by the name Smokescreen. 
 No one knows his real name. 
 He contacts who he wants to race from an unknown number, picks a location, and shows up in a different car each time. 
 When's the next race? 
 Don't know. He races when he feels like it. 
 Doesn't give much notice. 
 So unless you're gonna book me on some trumped-up charge we all know won't stick... we're done here.

 Driver : Yeah-yeah, you got to help me! 
 My car's out of control and it's driving itself! 
 What do you got? 
 I've been searching for any posts about Smokescreen, and a ton of them just popped up. 
 Everyone's talking about this car chase in Los Angeles right now, claiming it's Smokescreen. 
 Pull it up. 
 Tv newswoman : We're live right now, with reports that a car is allegedly being... 
 Ramirez : Okay, the driver called 911 in a panic, saying he lost control of the car and that it was driving on its own. 
 Wait a minute, it was somebody  inside  the car this time? 
 Looks like he found himself a new challenge. 
 LAPD. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 (gasping, grunting) 
 Come on! 
 Officer : Pulled the driver from the car. 
 Kept saying he wasn't driving,  but  he was buckled in, behind the wheel. 
 He wasn't driving. 
 Driver : It just took over. 
 I-I... I sideswiped a few other cars. 
 It was out of control. 
 But the car slowed down when the cops showed up, so I tried to jump out, but the doors wouldn't unlock. 
 I was trapped. 
 I-I know it sounds crazy, but it's like the car was possessed. 
 You said that when the police showed up the car slowed down. 
 Yeah. 
 Then sped up again, right before the crash. 
 I-I'm just glad my son wasn't in the car with me. 
 I was on my way to pick him up from soccer practice. 
 Steven, once we know you're okay, we're gonna have more questions for you. 
 Got it. 
 (grunts) 
 (sighs) 
 Configured exactly like the first one we found. 
 No two hackers build a board the same way. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Let's see what cell phone this SIM card was communicating with. 
 All right. Our target's escalating. 
 Drag racing remote-control cars is no longer a big enough thrill for him. 
 If somebody is in the car, his stakes are higher. 
 He wanted the police to be there when he crashed, to prove that he was driving. 
 It may be remote, but it gives our target a sense of power and control, something that he lacks in his real life. 
 I think I got him. 
 Mundo : Cell phone's still on. 
 (siren blaring) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 FBI! Hands in the air! 
 Get your hands in the air! Stay right where you are! 
 Nobody move! 
 The signal's getting stronger. 
 The device Smokescreen used must be here somewhere. 
 Oh, come on, this is harassment. 
 (rapid beeping) 
 Bingo! 
 The cell phone used to communicate with the car-hacking tool in Steven Fuller's vehicle. 
 All right, whose car is this? You plant that in my ride? 
 It's your car. Turn around and put your hands behind your back. 
 Yo, this is a joke. I've never seen that phone before. 
 Carmen : Hey, Martinez, say nothing.

 Carmen Lopez, AKA Blaze, AKA April Castilla. 
 Detective Castilla. 
 LAPD Gang Unit. 
 How did you make me? 
 LAPD's cracking down on street racing; they let you go without even charging you; and you're wearing the color of the day so that other officers know that you're undercover. 
 You've been playing with your bracelet. 
 Today's color is green. 
 Agent Ryan, you're about to ruin a six-month undercover sting. 
 Do you know how hard it was to get in with these dealers? 
 Gain their trust? 
 We'll do our best to keep your cover intact. 
 Detective Castilla, what can you tell me about Paul Martinez? 
 He's the alpha. 
 The brains behind a drug-smuggling operation  coming in from Mexico-- but can't prove it yet. 
 Is he Smokescreen? 
 I don't know. 
 But... a lot of those guys are tech-savvy. 
 Paul taught me how to boost horsepower by tuning my car's ECU and removing emission controls. 
 So maybe that is the guy you're looking for. 
 But one thing I do know-- if Paul Martinez finds out I'm a narc, it's not my cover that's at risk... it's my life. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Nelson :  Hey, Raven, still no clue  how our target saw the road. 
 Some newer cars have front-facing cameras in the grill to help them park, but this car has a camera on the trunk for going in reverse. 
 Ramirez : Well, the target had to see somehow. 
 You know, I  love  when you do your thinking face-- you look  so...  mm! So serious. 
 Stop it. 
 Stop. This is serious. 
 Nelson (laughs) : What? 
 I'm just sayin'. 
 I mean, you look nice today. 
 As pretty on screen as in person. 
 Uh-huh. And I'm sure you haven't noticed any of the beautiful women in L.A.? 
 What do you mea... I... 
 Did Krummy say something? 
 No. But  you  just did. 
 (laughs): Busted. 
 Hey, what about this? 
 A lane-assisting feature some cars have. 
 A camera mounted behind the rearview mirror that enables the car to steer itself back into its lane if the driver falls asleep. 
 All right, well, let's see if this car has one. 
 Looks like it does. 
 Good call, Raven. 
 Now, let's see how this thing works. 
 Uh... 
 Okay, we're in. 
 Our hacker was using that image to navigate? 
 (scoffs) Pretty hard to see what's ahead of you on the road. 
 Nelson : Hold on. 
 It was in night-mode, which is infrared. 
 Mm... 
 All right, here we go. 
 Ramirez : All right, this was Smokescreen's point of view. 
 He could see forward and he could see behind him. 
 Yeah, but no side view. 
 Talk about a blind spot. 
 Hey. What do you got? 
 Okay, I analyzed data  from both cars' internal computers. 
 Russell :  Uh-huh. Now, once the car-hacking tool  was installed, it logged an error message, but never appeared on the dash. 
 There were no... no warning lights or anything, so the... the driver never knew. 
 
 
 
 Am I boring you? 
 Uh, tell me what's happening to the pens around here, will you, please? All the springs are missing. 
 Krumitz : I don't know. Who uses pens anymore? 
 Well, apparently only me. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Like I was saying, I've got a recorded error message on each car's computer, and the time stamp of when it occurred. 
 So if we just check the navigation system history... 
 It will give us the location where our target physically installed the device. 
 Exactly. 
 Great. 
 Do it. Can I have my pen back? 
 No. 
 We got a hit. 
 Looks like the CAN-bus signal was disrupted at the Studio City Hand Car Wash. 
 Based on that location, I'm not so sure that Paul Martinez is our guy.

 Special Agent Avery Ryan. 
 We're looking for someone who may work here. 
 Sure. 
 What's his name? 
 We're looking for Smokescreen. 
 You got a first name? 
 Or is that his first name? It's hard to tell these days.

 We'll need information on all your employees.

 Who's Kevin? 
 He's one of my vacuum guys. 
 He was here just a second ago. 
 He's kind of hard to miss. 
 (starts engine) 
 (engine revs) 
 Mundo : All right, so all we know about our target so far is his name is Kevin and he's in a wheelchair. 
 Well, it makes perfect sense. 
 Without the ability to use his legs, he can't compete with real world racers. 
 He's got to beat 'em in cyberspace. 
 You know, I bet it's racing that put him in that wheelchair. 
 But he became addicted to the excitement, to the adrenaline rush. That's why he can't give it up. 
 Well, why set up Paul Martinez to take the fall? 
 There must be a connection, a history. 
 So what now? 
 We challenge Smokescreen to a race. 
 He'll connect to his car hacking tool. 
 He stays online long enough, we can track him down. 
 With all the media coverage on his remotely driven vehicles, he'll be eager to show his skills. 
 But he'll be suspicious of a new challenger. 
 So we get somebody he's raced before. 
 A race he never got to finish. 
 (vehicle approaching) 
 I got a message to meet my handler here. 
 I should have been suspicious. 
 Called in a favor. 
 I knew you wouldn't show otherwise.

 I thought this meeting was to pull me off the case before I get killed. 
 A man lost his life. 
 If Smokescreen keeps racing, who knows how many more lives are gonna be lost? 
 We need to find out his real identity. 
 We need you to race Smokescreen again. 
 And what makes you think he's gonna want to race me? 
 He's competitive. 
 You post a public challenge to a rematch on ToggleFly, his ego will force him to comply. 
 I believe you were in the lead when the cops showed up. 
 I help you, you help me. 
 When you brought Paul in for questioning, you didn't get all of his devices. 
 I copied the hard drive of Paul's laptop. 
 But it's been encrypted. My team can't crack it. 
 You can. You decrypt this for me, and I'll challenge Smokescreen to a rematch. 
 Ramirez : Automatic License Plate Reader Database? 
 Russell : Yep. 
 It's pretty amazing, actually. Cameras mounted on squad cars and street poles, they're constantly scanning license plates to check against a list of citations and warrant records. 
 And then the camera captures time, date, and location of the vehicle, and all that information is saved. 
 So, basically, anyone's pattern of life-- going to work, where you live, going to the movies-- can be determined through this database. 
 Russell : Pretty cool, huh? Okay, so what do we know about our target? 
 He drove to the car wash, but he parked far enough away that his coworkers could not I.D. his car. 
 And-and he worked on the weekends. We know that. 
 So we need to find the common license plates parked near the car wash Saturday and Sunday. 
 Right. And narrow it down from there. 
 How many license plates are in the database? 
 Uh, in L.A....? 
 (exhales) Three million per week. 
 It would take a couple hundred thousand.

 Well, we better get started then. 
 Yes, please.

 Flooding in is more like it.

 No, Nelson, stick to the plan. 
 No, look, not me, my car.

 You know what, that could work. 
 If Blaze is a no-show, our target won't be able to resist racing someone trying to beat him at his own game.

 Up arrow, gas. Down arrow, reverse. 
 Pretty basic commands but it should work.

 We're getting ready to drive a car in Los Angeles from a computer here in this room, believe it or not. 
 That's possible? 
 Uh, yeah. Terrifying, right? 
 A lot about car hacking in the news lately. 
 Seems like every day there's a new headline. 
 Well, we're-we're, uh... we're working on making it less newsworthy. 
 Just got to beat the bad guy to the, uh, finish line. 
 Sorry about that.

 Uh-huh. So close I can touch it.

 Krumitz : I know I'm supposed to keep Smokescreen racing so we can track him, but does it matter if I win or lose? 
 Because I kick ass at  Gran Turismo,  so I'm planning on winning. 
 Okay, you guys, listen up. 
 I just sent you the top 100 hits that we got from the license plate database: Vehicles most frequently spotted close to the car wash. 
 We're searching for any with a disability plate or a registered handicapped parking permit. 
 So, let's go-- any one of those vehicles could belong to our target. 
 Okay, I created a ToggleFly account under the name Ghost and challenged Smokescreen because Blaze is a no-show. 
 Any response? 
 Not yet. 
 Guess we're gonna have to find out when the flag drops. 
 (laughing): Whoa. 
 Gentlemen, start your engines. 
 Guys, we're still not getting the number used by Smokescreen's car hacking tool. 
 All right, look, I have another idea. 
 If I can get inside Smokescreen's car, I can get the serial number off the SIM card itself. 
 Elijah could track down the cell phone on the other end. 
 Nelson, that is too risky. 
 Avery, that might be our only shot. 
 Nelson : I got this. We know Smokescreen can only see directly in front and behind. 
 Huge blind spot on both sides.

 Nelson, what's taking so long? 
 Ryan : Nelson, the race is about to start. 
 Nelson, get out of there right now. 
 Aah! 
 Krummy, go, go! 
 You have to race to keep him from ditching his cell. 
 I'm going, I'm going. 
 I just didn't want to hit that sexy flag lady. 
 There has to be a car hacking tool in here somewhere. 
 You need a physical device to manipulate the accelerator. 
 Not every car. 
 Auto park assist, which networks the computer to the accelerator. 
 Yeah, he's got it. 
 Krumitz : Which means Smokescreen could just remotely intrude without ever getting near the car. 
 Also means there's no car hacking tool in here. 
 That's why we didn't pick anything up on the cell catcher. 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! 
 Whoa! Oh! 
 Krummy, Krummy, heads up! 
 Whoa! Aah! 
 He's trying to crash already. 
 Or take out the competition. 
 All right, we got an I.D.: Kevin Cane, age 23, Hawthorne, California. 
 Kevin Cane. Yes, okay. 
 Personal cell. 
 I am tracking the target's location right now. 
 Ryan : Our target is five minutes away from here. I could go after Smokescreen. 
 Elijah, you could check on Carmen. 
 If Paul Martinez has made her, she could be in big trouble. 
 But Nelson, Krumitz, tell us you can end this race. 
 Yeah, yeah, okay, we got this-- chances are his remote intrusion was through the navigation system. 
 Can we hack it and take control? 
 Ramirez : There's no time for that. 
 We have to kill the navigation from inside the car. 
 You mean turn it off? 
 Krumitz : No, no. 
 You have to disable the GSM chip. 
 Nelson : Hey, Krummy! 
 He has the car headed straight for the crowd, bro! 
 Like Raven said, no time for that. 
 (crowd screaming, clamoring) 
 Whew! 
 We did it! 
 He did it! (laughs) 
 What did you do? 
 I just needed something metal to short out the network. 
 (cheering) 
 (sirens approaching) 
 Kevin Cane-- or do you prefer Smokescreen? 
 You lost the use of your legs in a crash racing Paul Martinez on this very spot. 
 That's why you set him up. 
 Crashing those cars made you feel powerful, didn't it? 
 Crashing is the only thing I ever enjoyed about racing. 
 And now I don't even have to be in the car to do it. 
 Well, your street racing days are officially over. 
 (banging, knocking) 
 (muffled grunting) 
 Let's get you out of here. 
 Here... 
 (muffled yell) 
 I dare you to try something. 
 I've been dying to shoot you. 
 Thanks, you know, for blowing my cover and almost getting me killed. 
 And here I thought I just saved your life. 
 I'm pretty sure I saved yours, too. 
 Nah, I had him right where I wanted him. 
 We'll call it even, then. 
 Actually... now we're even. 
 Decrypted the files you gave us from Paul's hard drive. 
 Evidence of offshore accounts he was using to launder money along with personal e-mails to his suppliers in Mexico. 
 D.A.'s gonna wonder how I got the evidence. 
 Tell him the truth: FBI Cyber. 
 Paul Martinez was our suspect as Smokescreen, so we searched his devices. 
 That, along with the attempted murder of an undercover officer and a federal agent, should put him away for a very long time.

 Daniel... we need to talk. 
 Uh... 
 Russell : Oh, I'm sorry. 
 This a bad time? 
 No. Not at all. 
 I'm just-just hanging with my new friend. 
 Artie. 
 Hi, Artie. 
 Sir. Uh, uh... nothing suspicious going on in here at all. 
 Definitely not, um, abusing FBI resources for personal gain. 
 Shut up, Artie. 
 Right. 
 Daniel, now why are you removing all the springs from our pens? 
 Me? 
 I found a lot of partial prints in our reference database that match to you. 
 (weak, anxious laugh) 
 Daniel...? 
 The pen springs are for our prototype's mechanical claw. 
 We needed about 100 or so, and nobody here uses pens. 
 Nobody except me. 
 What is that thing? 
 It's a battle robot-- a remote-controlled armored killing machine designed for arena combat. 
 And one day, our only line of defense against the intelligent robot armies we'll inadvertently create. 
 Well, everybody needs a hobby. 
 All right... 
 Oh! 
 There we go. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 May I? 
 Smash that thing! Smash that... 
 (laughing) 
 That's the claw coming after... 
 Ooh-hoo! Ow! 
 (laughing) 
 It's fun, right? 
 Krumitz : Doing a 360, 360, 360... 
 Just smash it, man. Just smash that! 
 (laughing) 
 Welcome back, Agent Ryan. 
 Director Silver. 
 I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were coming. 
 I was in the building. 
 Giving another tour? 
 No, no. Those aren't necessary anymore. 
 So you found a new deputy director? 
 Yes, I believe we have. 
 You. 
 Sir, with all due respect, I told you that I need to stay in the field. 
 You know, I was here when your team was driving a car from across the country. 
 That's pretty fascinating stuff. 
 And you tracked down the person responsible. 
 A hacker in a wheelchair, from what I read in the report. 
 A street racer that injured himself in a crash. 
 He got a computer science degree so he could terrorize the streets. 
 Avery, there's no other person for the job of deputy director. 
 You want to stay in the field, you stay in the field. 
 But I want you to run this division. 
 So... Cyber is yours. 
 Because, this time, I won't take no for an answer. 
 (laughs quietly)
