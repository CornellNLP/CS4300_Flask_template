 LIL' MURDA: Oh, so you gon' act like you forgot   what happened last week on P-Valley? 
 Forcing deserving folk off their property   is not a way to run a city. 
 Auction's only two weeks away,   and your ass is gon' be on the block. 
 You everybody punk, from what I heard. 
 LIL' MURDA: Nigga, you is dead to me! 
 Somebody danced in my place? 
 LAUREN: Yeah, they called her M-I-    
 - crooked letter- crooked letter... 
 - Oh! 
 Somebody done posted a video of me from last night. 
 Your vajayjay done went viral, girl. 
 MERCEDES: You don't know Patrice Woodbine. 
 She stole from me. 
 - [YELLS] 
 - [ALL SHOUTING] 
 All the money I had stashed up in the church building fund, she used it for her own f*cking church. 
 It was the only way I could get Terricka back. 
 PATRICE: You need to leave Terricka with 'Shelle. 
 Need to let somebody take you on up out this office for a minute. 
 Where you gon' take me? 
 [BABY FUSSING] 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 - I'ma go talk to her. 
 I'll go talk to her. 
 - Let me handle her. 
 My wife went missing the day Hurricane Drake hit. 
 I'll get my deputies to put up some flyers around town quick-fast. 
 What do you mean I'm not allowed any more transfers? 
 Apologies, Miss Savage, but our records show    that you've done over ten in the past few days. 
 I can run you ten stacks by the end of the week. 
 - What I gotta do? 
 - We gon' need IDs. 
 MERCEDES: I know this man named Mane that can hook us up. 
 - How many you need?
