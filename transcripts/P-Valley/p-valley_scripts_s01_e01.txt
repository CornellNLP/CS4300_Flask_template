 Mercedes! Wait.      
 Why you didn't tell me you was coming tonight, Ma?      
 You know I don't like surprises.      
 They love you.      
 Folks was willing to give up their rent and car note for you.      
 I didn't know you made that kind of money.      
 Well, tonight was a good night.      
 What you think?      
 I mean, I see how you manage your abundance.      
 You always said I was blessed and highly favored.      
 Thank you, Jesus.      
 Where did I go wrong, Mercedes?      
 Mama, don't start this sh1t again.      
 Why has my God forsaken me?      
 He must be so mad at me to have given me a ho for a daughter.      
 Heifer, I ain't never been no ho.      
 Your body is a temple, Mercedes.      
 Didn't I teach you that?      
 You sure did.      
 That's why when I was a young un, you sent me over to bend my temple over in front of them niggas to get them to buy our breakfast at the Waffle House.      
 I ain't know the Lord then.      
 Bitch, you barely know him now.      
 - Stripping is blasphemous. 
- No, Ma.      
 It art. I transport M*therf*ckers.      
 Dazzle them, something you wish you could do.      
 Oh, Mercedes, this ain't gonna get you through the gates of heaven.      
 Well, I heard hell hella lit, though.      
 With all this, church should have been getting double the tithes and offering, with all the money I seen these heathens waste on you tonight.      
 So you think I'm a waste?      
 You're not a waste, Mercedes.      
 But this is a waste of time and your talent.      
 You think I'm doing this for nothing?      
 You ain't been doing sh1t but breaking my heart!      
 Oh, Lord!      
 This all my fault.      
 With everything I done done, I... I deserve this.      
 Put her sins on me, Lord, 'cause I can carry 'em.      
 For her and for me, and I don't care if I have to die as a sacrifice for this daughter of mine.      
 I will do everything in my power to save her.      
 Save her, oh, dear Lord! Save her! Save this ho!      
 Save her, Lord! Save her. 
Save her, Lord!      
 Save her! Save this-save...      
 God is always grateful for an offering.      
 But he'd be even more grateful for your repentance.      
 The cash all I got to give tonight.
