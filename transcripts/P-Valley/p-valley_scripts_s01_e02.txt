 KEYSHAWN: Last week on P-Valley, y'all... 
 Mercedes' last dance. 
 Took you long enough. 
 Well, retirement age for a stripper nowadays. 
 Who gonna take over your Sunday night set? 
 You in a hole that deep for a refinancing loan? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I thought you liked a little easy money. 
 I do. 
 I'm just wonderin' why all these Mexican niggas here. 
 AUTUMN: What's a girl have to do to work here? 
 CLIFFORD: You can start tomorrow if you want. 
  Is this one empt... 
  Slow your roll, high yellow. 
 I ain't gone yet. 
  Can't believe I even let you hide your booty money in the church building fund. 
  You sure weren't complainin' when I put that booty money in y'all account so y'all could apply for that loan. 
  It's Hailey. 
  That's my name. 
  Well, I lays M*therf*ckers out. 
  That's why they call me Little Murder. 
  I got somethin' that'll murder you.
