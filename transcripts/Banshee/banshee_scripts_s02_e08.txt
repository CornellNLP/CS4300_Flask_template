 I thought you said you disabled the alarm. 
 I did, both of them. 
 But I didn't think you'd take so long to open the goddamn safe. 
 Are you gonna bitch about that now? 
 Ana, what the f*ck? 
 Go. Get out of here. 
 Brock : Hood! Hey! 
 Yeah? 
 You got 'em? 
 No, no one came this way. 
 They ran right towards you. 
 sh1t, they must have doubled back. Come on.

 2x08 - Evil For Evil 
 [door opens] 
 [closes] So when did you two become a duo? I needed the money. Yeah, we all need money. That's why we work together. It wasn't that kind of a job. Oh. Oh, okay. Not that kind of job. You need to tell me when you're out there. I don't need your permission. You do around here. What if it had been one of my deputies that found you? Your deputies? Yeah. Jesus. Do you hear yourself? It was a big risk for a small take. It was f*cking stupid. I needed the money for Max. Look, I could have helped. Alex : I've already agreed to using your vendors  and your administrative fee, but 5% of the floor, that's out... That is the figure your father and I agreed on. If you don't think I'm earning it, we can rethink it. I don't know how I'm gonna hide something like that in the books. We'll figure something out. You'll find me to be very flexible. Well, you're gonna have to be. We should schedule a weekly meeting. Okay. You were saying about the warehouse? Cell phone detonator. Homemade. And the shipment? No. Sorry. Our associates in Philadelphia... [knocks, door opens] Rebecca, come in. Sit down. Our associates in Philadelphia... are expecting delivery today. You call them and tell them we'll make it up to them. What happened? An explosion at our manufacturing facility. Someone planted a bomb. Who would do that? It was Hood.He's making a statement. What are you gonna do? Nothing for now. There's something else. What? The slaughterhouse lost power over the weekend. We have a backup generator. It was disabled. All of the meat has gone bad. How's that possible? I spoke to the electric company. Someone hacked their server and shut down that particular grid. He's got to be f*cking kidding me. [keys jingle] [door opens] [closes] Sugar : You know, there's a saying in the restaurant business. Don't buy your meat where you buy your bread and butter. Trying to say don't sh1t where you eat? Yeah. Why didn't you just say that, then? It lacks poetry. Morning, Kai. The club I can understand. If my employees were involved in illicit activities, you are compelled to act, sure. Even the warehouse. Yeah, I heard about that. Explosion or something, right? Now I've got a slaughterhouse filled with rotten product. Are you accusing me of something? What can you possibly gain by f*cking with my meat? What the hell are you doing? Are you here to report a crime? 'Cause if not, I'm kind of busy. What the hell are you doing? Sugar : Kai. Easy. You and I have a very complicated relationship. No. I'm a cop, you're a criminal. You disappoint me, Sugar. You should be keeping better company. [door opens, closes] Being your friend, it should come with hazard pay. You know, he's right about one thing. All I'm doing is harassing him. Well, before you decide to kick it up a notch, give me plenty of warning. Oh, crap. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Doctor said for you to take it easy, remember? I'm okay. Yeah? Now, what is this? [chuckles] Well, I think it's pretty cool. Thanks. I mean, that's major architecture. Good morning. Don't forget your inhaler. Got it. You're not going to work? Took a couple of days off. What are you up to? Just gonna go cast my Father of the Year ballot. Deva, I know you're mad  and I'm sorry I haven't been around enough. It was worse when you were. Yeah, and there's no excuse for it. You just need to be around, Dad. I know. And it wasn't for... Look, it wasn't fair for me to put you in that position, but I am very sorry, baby. I'm gonna do better, I promise. [door opens, closes] I was gonna pick it up after work. I'll get it after my shift. Em, I'm pregnant, not an invalid. The package could weigh 20 or 30 pounds for all I know. Let a man do his wife a solid. I think we can handle it. f*ck me. Hey, you want to have some fun? He's gonna be the first Yawners to make it to the NFL. Oh, really? What if he likes to paint or dance ballet? He'll be a Renaissance man. [laughs] I should get back. Okay. [pounds] [dogs barking] We need to talk. [cartoons playing on TV] You said you were going to arrest Proctor. I'm working on that. Jesus. Every day I think that he knows I'm the one who told you about the warehouse. Hey, there's no way he could know that was you. But right now I need something more. I need something that directly connects to him. I don't know anything else. You said you see him three or four times a week. He f*cks me. There's no pillow talk in that. Lucas : Come on, it doesn't have to be illegal. Just something usual. Anything. [sighs] One night I was leaving his house really late and I saw all these guys moving a bunch of crates into his basement. What was in the crates? I don't know. Did you see in the basement? He doesn't let me wander around. I need to know what's in that basement. Are you f*cking kidding me?! We don't want you to do anything that puts you in danger. Just talking to you puts me in danger. Just leave. Please. You pushed her too hard. Right now she's all we've got. f*ck. No one wants to see Proctor go down more than her. Well, moving crates into a basement isn't a crime. Depends on what's in the crates. That's not enough for a warrant. And without a warrant, you can't go in there. Boss. What? I know. Do you? Yes. Here's his ditzy bitch. Hey. Hi. Can I ask you a quick question? Sure. When did you become a traitor to your race? [men laugh] Get out of my way. Oh, no. Oh, no, look at that. Excuse me, guys. Don't tell me this is a half coon baby in here. Ooh! What the f*ck are you doing, man? Come on, let's go. Somebody call 911. Hurry. [knocks] Come in. That boy at the motel, did he tell you his name? He just said Jason. Jason. He didn't say anything about himself, did he? No. It's just because I don't understand why Hood cares so much about what happened to him. I mean, it's, well... What are you going to do? About Hood? Yeah. He's acting out of desperation because he has nothing and he's trying to provoke an equally desperate response. What about all that money you lost? You know, I'm taking a longer view. Those losses are nothing compared to what we'll make with Longshadow. And I can't jeopardize that arrangement over a personal vendetta with Hood. No matter how much I'd like to. I can't believe you have so much restraint. [sighs] Woman over P.A. : Dr. Irvin to Orthopedics. Dr. Irvin to Orthopedics. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Meg, honey. It's Emmett. I'm here. Nurse : Sir... It hurts. What's happening? Where are you taking her? Doctor's right here. I'm Dr. Holland. She's bleeding internally. We're prepping her for surgery. Okay, honey. Baby, tell me what happened. There were these guys. They had shaved heads. Tattoos. They know you. Nurse : You need to stay here, sir. Emmett, I'm scared. Okay, all right. Okay, look, I'm gonna be right here. Emmett, I'm scared. Nurse : Sir, I need you... I'm scared. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna be here. Sir, we have to go. [shouts] Emmett. Hey, what happened? Meg, they're taking her into surgery. It's the driver we shook down the other day. Sharp. The skinheads? Son of a bitch. I guess he wanted to get some payback. f*ck. Whoa, whoa. Where are you going? To get Sharp. No, no, you stay here. We'll go. Get the hell out of my way, Brock! Listen, Em. Emmett, Emmett. Look at me. Look at me. Meg needs you here, okay? She needs you. Hey, we'll find them. I promise. We're gonna find them. Okay? It's gonna be okay. [door opens] [clicks] Who's your informant? It's confidential. Alison : Will he testify? No. How do you know you can trust him? Let's just say he has a good reason to want to see Proctor put away. Alison : As long as that reason wasn't your gun in his face. [laughs] I think you got the wrong idea about me, Ms. Medding. You are hardly the first cowboy cop I've ever dealt with. You all smile, play the game, but you'd really rather just shoot first and ask questions never. And here I was thinking we were just starting to hit it off. From what I understand, you've been down this road before with Kai Proctor. If I'm gonna get a search warrant, it needs to be bulletproof. No judge will issue one on hearsay. My informant saw the guns being moved into the basement. She's got soft hands. Shut your mouth. Lucas : What's going on? Brock : Meg's in the hospital. What? They were getting even with Emmett. She assaulted me, Sheriff. Hondo : Yeah, I witnessed it. I was defenseless. She okay? She was in surgery. We've been looking for these assholes all night. I sure hope she's okay. Shut the f*ck up! [laughing] Shut it! We were gonna head to the hospital after this. It's gonna have to wait. I need you both after you're done booking them. Brock : Why? What's up? Got a warrant to search Proctor's. f*ck! I want to go over potential sites for a new lab. I'll call you back. Kai Proctor. We have a warrant to search these premises. On what grounds? It's all in here. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. Oh, no, no. You made yourself perfectly clear. You got anything you want to say to me? I'll make sure the DA's office takes your cooperation into account. I don't know what it is you hope to find, Sheriff. So that's a "no?" Okay. You mind if I look around? Thanks. [knocks] Wait a minute. What's that? [knocking] What's that sound like? See, to me, that sounds like...  [switch clicks] ...a door. b*st*rd! I'll f*cking kill you! Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'll f*cking kill you! Easy, Kai. This is not changing anything. I think it might. Brock : Wow. What's in there? I'm guessing this wasn't on the original floor plan, right? Brock : You have permits for all these illegal guns? He asked you a question. f*ck you. I'll take that as a no. I'll f*cking kill you. Kai Proctor, you're under arrest. You have the right... I know my f*cking rights! Yeah, okay, but let me have my moment, all right? Kai Proctor, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Now, you have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney, the court, they'll appoint one for you. You're f*cking dead. Take him away. All right, let's get the guns and anything else. Sure. 
 
 Well, the internal bleeding was a lot worse than we thought. But she's gonna be okay? We're gonna watch her, make sure that her pressure doesn't drop again, but, yes, she's going to be okay. But the trauma was too great for the fœtus. What? We'll run down the guns. If we're lucky, one of them has been used in a major crime. If not? None of the guns are registered. We've already got him on illegal possession. That is a major offense, especially if there was gun trafficking. How long can you keep him in county? Long enough to try and make a case. I want to go over the warrant again. We've been over that already. Well, now you're gonna go over it with me. If you're gonna be late to the party, Gordon... Did you not get the f*cking memo? I'm still your boss. Proctor's not gonna beat the warrant, end of story. I've faced Proctor in court. He's got a good lawyer. Yeah, now so do we. You want to f*ck with me on this? Do I step out so you can measure your dicks? The Feds will be by to pick up the guns first thing in the morning. Until then, thank you for your time, Sheriff. Lucas : Guess everyone needs a hobby, huh? Stamps, that's a hobby. This is psychotic. So, how'd it go with the ADA? Good. She thinks we have a strong case. Well, hopefully it'll hold up this time. Hey, I wanted to ask you. Who tipped you off on the guns? Confidential informant, Brock. Not that I don't trust you. Any word on Emmett? I left a couple messages. Okay, I'm gonna head over to the hospital, check in. Great. You know what we haven't talked about in a while? What's that? Him. Sheriff Lucas Hood. When he first got here, he did whatever the hell he wanted. We were all so shocked. And now, all of a sudden, he's Mr. Johnny By-the-book. I guess better late than never, huh? I guess. He tell you who his informant is? Why would he tell me and not you? I don't know. You two seem pretty close. I'm sorry? No, I'm... Come on, Siobhan. I'm not blind. I see things, you know? I'm assuming you two are probably sleeping together at this point. You want to tell me about it? There's nothing to talk about, Brock. Oh, f*ck. Go fish. Hey, you want a burger or a hot dog? Uh, both. Okay. How about you, Deva? I'll take a burger, please. Hey, yo! Stop. You're cheating. Put that back. That's not how we play. Come on. Damn it. [footsteps] Carrie. If you want to know, I'll tell you. But you really don't want to know. Carrie, wait. Look, why don't you stay for dinner? The problem is this new ADA Medding. She's smart. And from everything I've heard, she is not open for business. Everyone has a price. You want to add attempted bribery on top of the gun charges? Everyone has a weakness. Anyway, our best shot is to attack the search warrant. We attack the veracity of their confidential informant's claim. Burton : Which was? Their CI claims to have seen guns in your basement. That was the basis for obtaining a warrant. Impossible. Is it? No one knew about that room. No one could have possibly seen what was inside of it. Rebecca and Burton are the only other people with access to my home. Is there anyone else? No. Think. If we knew who the CI is, maybe we can discount the warrant. Juliet. Jackson : Who's Juliet? I'm going to step outside for a minute. [knocks] Take care of the girl. [knocks] [door opens] Lucas : How is she? [sighs] Doctor says she's gonna be fine. That's good. Siobhan and Brock, they got Sharp and his buddies. They're in holding right now. Lucas : They're not gonna get away with this. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, we also arrested Proctor. For what? Assault weapons, but... it doesn't really matter right now. Emmett. Hi. Hi. Doctor says you're gonna be fine. I lost the baby. It's gonna be okay. Okay? You just need to get some rest. It's gonna be all right. Emmett. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at the hospital? Oh. Meg is sleeping. How is she? She's gonna be fine. Thank God. Yeah. You can't still be on duty tonight. Emmett : No, I already called Brock to cover. This is a test. That's all. You're right. Okay, well, I'll wait for Brock. You get back to Meg. [laughs] He's gonna be here in, like, five minutes. It's fine. Just try to get some rest, sweetheart. It's gonna be okay. Promise. All right. All right. Well, you have a good night. You, too. Alma : And you tell Meg that I will be praying for her. Emmett : I will. All right. Thank you. Meg : Just a test. Cheryl, I'm going to need the other thing as well. I think she must have stepped out. Sheriff Hood. How can I help you? Well, I don't know if you heard,  but we arrested Kai Proctor last night. Possession of illegal firearms. What does that have to do with me? Nothing I know of. But I am curious why Proctor would have so much information on the Kinaho casino. I mean, that is a lot of information to have about someone else's business. Don't you think? So I started wondering, maybe everything going on between you and him lately, maybe you have a little more to do with him than I know. [chuckles] Do I need to call my lawyer? I know you'd never intentionally risk the well-being of your tribe by getting in bed with someone like Proctor. So I'd like to help you get him out of your business. And why would you do that, Sheriff? We have a case against him with these guns. It might stick. But if it doesn't, I want some insurance. And what do I get out of it? Same thing I get. Same thing this whole town gets. My father had certain dealings with Kai Proctor. Extortion rackets for land grabs. I inherited those along with everything else when my father passed. He was a revered leader, so I hope you can understand why I didn't want to bring these things to light. Of course. I understand that. But I think we've all been living in the dark long enough. Yeah. I think so, too. Sharp : I've been wondering when you'd come around to pay us a visit. Look at him, boys. That is one angry black man. I guess we're lucky the bald guy and the dyke caught us first. You think so? Hey, I liked the dyke. [laughs] Do you know what I love about this country? The same laws that protect people from me, protect me from you. You sound like my father. I think that was an insult. You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor. You just have to have faith in the system. And he did. One day his boss cheats him out of some wages, so he takes the guy to court. The judge says, "Boy, don't bite the hand that feeds you." Pops gets fired. That's some judge. Couple years later he buys his first car. It gets stolen. So like any law-abiding citizen, he goes to the police. They say, "Boy, don't you know we got better things to do The point is, my father died without ever having anyone to speak for him. That's touching. I never wanted to be a cop. Just wanted to play football. That didn't work out. Now, you guys got me realizing the real reason I'm here is to speak for people who can't speak for themselves. People like my father. And my baby boy who you killed today. f*ck you, man. I ain't scared of you. What the hell is this? Relax. He ain't gonna do sh1t. There's no one else here. You get past me and you're home free. Oh, I'm gonna f*ck you up, spook. Sharp : Help him, asshole! Take him out, Curtis. Nighty-night. Come on, he's going down. You got him. Go night-night. You got him. Night-night. He's going down. [shouts] [panting] Sharp : He's had enough. What did you say? I said he's had enough! You know how you feel right now? That rage that you're feeling? That keeps building inside you because somebody touched someone you love. I feel that rage every day when I see you and your people  overrunning this country. It makes people feel better to say we're ignorant,  but I see exactly what's going on. I'm not ignorant. And I'm not sorry. Same deal. You get past me, you're home free. [shouts] [grunts] [gasps] [gasping, wheezing] [laughing] [gasping] You know, if you're gonna be here this late, feel free to pick up a mop and a broom. Tables can never be too clean. sh1t. I got you, m*therf*cker. What? Got who? Rabbit. I got him. How? FBI followed protocol and digitized all of Agent Racine's files. It was a shot in the dark, but I found an old exploit from a legacy system. I used the computer. Yeah, right. Racine found Rabbit? Yes, he did. He just didn't know it. But I do. Kind of wish you didn't. Hey. I was hoping you'd still be up. I'm up. Listen, I just wanted to explain... What, about the fact that you got an illegal search warrant for Proctor's arrest? I wouldn't put it quite like that. Juliet never said anything about those guns. You lied to get that warrant. But I ended up being right. That is not the point. What's the point, then? That's not the point. You know what Proctor's capable of. You put that woman's life on the line. Oh, come on. Not to mention my career. But that's nothing new for you. Hey, I didn't ask you for anything. You already did. The second you got that warrant, you made me complicit in your lie. Yeah, but Proctor... I don't give a f*ck about Proctor, okay, or how you got him, but if you think that sleeping with me  gets you my unquestioning loyalty... You know that's not what I think. How do I know? How do I know? You never tell me anything. I'll answer any question you have. Right now. [phone vibrating] It's Brock. Oh, my God. Brock : Hey, Hood, over here. Did you call for an ambulance? Yeah, they're on their way. Siobhan : f*ck. They're alive. I need more bandages. Hey, Emmett, you want the EMT to take a look at you? No. Two of the guys are mostly okay. A lot of broken bones and concussions, but... the one guy, Sharp, he's... he's pretty bad. Listen, Emmett, I think we need to get your story straight  before we call you a lawyer. Lucas : Hey, Brock. You leave us alone for a minute? Yeah. Hey, we're gonna figure this out. There's nothing to figure out. You were in an emotional state. Your wife, your baby. They taunted you, you snapped. You didn't know what you were doing. I knew exactly what I was doing. I've been dealing with guys like Sharp my whole life. Maybe not as extreme as him, but it's always something. A look, a comment. Something. You know, you get real good at burying it and hiding it behind a smile. This, I couldn't let it go. I didn't want to. I've been following His teachings for years. Been turning the other cheek. The thing about it is if I could go back, I'd do the same thing to those pieces of sh1t again. I'd do the same thing again and again even though I know it's a sin. So what kind of Christian does that make me? [sighs] You know, when Meg first told me she was pregnant... my first thought was "How can we raise a kid here?" I mean, this town. [sighs] It's like everything that's good just gets swallowed up by the bad. It's like a never-ending cycle of sh1t. Guys like Sharp feel like they can do whatever they want to whoever they want. And we're supposed to be part of the solution. We're supposed to hold that line. But there is no line. Not here. The Bible says, "See that no one repays evil for evil." Sometimes repaying is all you've got. I got no problem with that. [knocks] Brock : Hood. [music playing] ♪ Walking through a room ♪
