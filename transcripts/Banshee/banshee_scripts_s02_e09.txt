 2x09 - Homecoming 
 Priest : Who are you? 
 I already told you. 
 I wanted to let Jesus Christ into my life. 
 I have a feeling you'll be meeting Jesus quite soon. 
 The only question is how much it'll hurt before you do. 
 What the f*ck kind of priest are you? 
 Please watch your language. 
 f*ck you, m*therf*cker. 
 [coughs] There's no call for profanity. 
 Spend some time with our confused friend. 
 See if you can show him the light. 
 Well, I thought he'd never leave. 
 [gasps] 
 See, now, that won't be necessary. 
 Shut your mouth. 
 [groans]

 [grunts] 
 f*ck me. 
 Man : Down! Get him! I need him alive! [grunts] [panting] [yells] f*ck! Ah! [Gordon chuckles] Deva : Like that. Good morning, everybody. Max : Hey, Mom. Deva : Hey. Hi. Deva : That's sick! I love it. That's pretty cool. How did you sleep? Good. Deva : Do you like it? Max : Yeah. Me, too. It's awesome. Hey, you know what? Let's go outside and try it out. You gonna do an awesome trick? Max : Oh, yeah. Deva : I think you are. [Max chuckles] Carrie : I miss this. And I missed you. Do you think we could ever get it back? I don't know. Probably not this, but maybe something different. Something better? I'm sorry I lied to you. I know. Carrie : Sometimes when you live with a lie for long enough, it starts to feel like the truth. Hey, Alma. Hey. Proctor arrest. You up for it? Sure looks like a lot of paperwork. How much is it gonna cost me? Are you kidding me? It's Proctor. It's on the house. Thanks. Besides, we both know you would just screw it up. Hey, Emmett. Sheriff. You come for these? No. I don't deserve that badge. Come on. No one deserves it more than you. Have you heard back from the D.A.'s office? You let me worry about the D.A., okay? Listen, what I did to those men... They had it coming. Not from me. Well, if not from you... Listen, Emmett, there are rules, and then there's what's right. And then there's God. Yeah, God kind of takes all the fun out of the argument. This job is doing something to me. I can't risk becoming the man I was last night. So, what are you gonna do? My sister lives down in Florida. I'm gonna head down there for a while. See what it feels like. I hate to lose you. You know, you may have everyone else fooled, not me. How's that? I know you're a good man. It's been an honor to work with you. You, too. Woman on P.A. : Dr. Hadman to E.R. bay 13. Dr. Hadman to E.R. bay 13. [heart monitor beeping] Hey, man, give me some f*ckin' morphine. [wheezes] I'm dyin' here. I've been ringing this bell for a f*ckin' hour already. Where the f*ck do you people go? Oh, sh1t. That's right. You gotta tell Proctor I didn't tell them anything. By the time they came to me, they knew all about it. What the f*ck are you doing? That's my f*ckin' morphine drip! [wheezing] You won't be needing that anymore. [wheezing continues] You were paid to transport Mr. Proctor's merchandise and keep your mouth shut. You chose to speak to the authorities. As such, Mr. Proctor has asked me to inform you  that your services will no longer be required. Get the f*ck away from me...

♪ 11:00... ♪ What are you doing here, Sugar? You came to see me when I was inside. I'm just returning the favor. Seeing if there's anything you need. Yeah? And where was your friendship while Hood was making his plans? A simple warning is all I would have needed. Hood, he doesn't consult with me. Yeah? Would you have told me if he had? Kai... I've known you since you were a kid. We may not be friends, but in some way, we're still family. We're not family. Not anymore. You made your choice. And don't come back. Kai, it doesn't have to be this way. Yes, it does. I forgave what I could, given the years you lost for me. But when I get out of here... and I will get out of here... I'll be coming for Hood. And if you're standing between us, I'll cut you down without a second thought. [knocks] You shouldn't have come here. Hey, boss, we might have a glitch with Proctor's case. Just get your son and go. You can't ever come back here. Why are you helping me? I know what it feels like to be trapped in your own life. Siobhan : I went to check on Juliet. She missed her shift at the Savoy. Juliet : And what about you? I made my choice. Juliet : Thank you. Just go. Siobhan : I swung by the day care center. Apparently, she pulled her son out in the middle of the day. The director there had a feeling she's not coming back. Smart girl. What about your case against Proctor? She was never gonna testify. Anyway, we've got a stronger case with Longshadow. Hi. Lucas : He has a list of people Proctor extorted to clear the land for the new casino. And you think Longshadow's gonna see that through? He wants Proctor out of his hair for good. The charges against my uncle will soon be dropped. You've nothing to worry about. But I am worried, Rebecca. I don't doubt for a moment Proctor's lawyers will buy his way out of a few gun charges. But the cops have papers linking him to the Kinaho Moon and I can't have that. That sounds like something you should talk to him about when he gets out. Siobhan : Why now? What? Proctor... why now? That's why I'm here, isn't it? I don't know why you're here. I've been trying to pinpoint in my mind what it is about you... procedure, protocols, laws... you just don't have patience for any of it. Rebecca, your uncle has had a long run, but his luck's about to run out. I don't think that they're gonna take him down for this, I know it, because I'm gonna help them do it. Why are you telling me this? It's time for you to make a choice. Why me? I like you. [chuckles] The warrant is specific to the basement and excludes any and all other rooms of the house. So, it could be argued that the subbasement in which the contraband was found wasn't on the warrant and is, therefore, inadmissible. Would that work? 50/50. Depends on the judge. Meanwhile, I'm pushing for a new bail hearing. The A.D.A. is arguing flight risk. But all the new ones do that, so I will push it through. It'll just take a day or two. What about Longshadow? Well, that's a whole 'nother ball of wax. You sure he's gonna go through with it? Rebecca : He seemed very sure. Yeah. Well, we'll have to see what he's got. Until then, my number one priority is to get you out of here. So I will call you as soon as I have anything new. Thank you. Rebecca, I will wait for you outside. What is it? It never rains, but it pours. You're worried about Alex? Well, he picked a hell of a time to grow some balls. Well, can't Sperling do anything about that? Maybe. Maybe. Uncle? Just go home, Rebecca. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay. [pounds] [door opens] You've got another visitor. Mother. Hello, Kai. You look tired. I'm not tired. Just older. Why are you here? A mother hears her son is alone and in trouble. Well... I've been alone for many years, Mother... for my entire adult life. As have I. Does my father know you're here? Your father demands contrition from everyone except himself. As I get older, I have far less patience for arrogance disguised as righteousness. And yet you stay. And yet I stay. I was not raised to think there was another way. By the time I came to it on my own, I was an old lady. I failed you, Kai. I let the dogma of small-minded men determine your fate when I should have been protecting you... the way any other mother in the world  would have protected her young. And now I see you in here, and I know that we put you here... Your crimes, whatever they may be, are my crimes. [sobs softly] May I come see you again? Yeah. [door slides open] [slides shut] [distant siren wailing] [door opens] Can I help you? Captain Julias Bonner, NYPD. So you are not here to pray? No. Just doing a little legwork for the FBI. Priest : Where is Agent Racine? They don't seem to know. Maybe that's why they asked me to drop by... to see if maybe you knew. I haven't seen Agent Racine in a while. He was not a healthy man. Bonner : But he did come in here from time to time. Yes. He was looking for my brother. I take it you haven't heard from him, either. If I had, do you think I would tell you? No, I guess you wouldn't. I don't suppose you'd allow me to search the place. Yes, of course, as soon as you show me your warrant. Why all this interest? Surely you have more pressing cases. [chuckles] Oh, yes. But you never seem to forget the one that got away. I almost nailed him a long time ago. I picked up this kid doing a job for him. Diamonds. It's for you. Turns out it was Rabbit who tipped us off. I tried to turn the kid, but he was,  you know, committed. Everyone must live or die by their own code. Of course. [chuckles] Well, you have a good day, Father. Have a good day. Rabbit : They're closing in...  the intruder last night, now this cop. They will be here soon. I had hoped to be a bit stronger when I faced them. [heart monitor beeping] Priest : It was a mistake sending the assassin after them. We should have waited until you were healthy. The only mistake was her failure. You could not have foreseen that. [beeping accelerates] [rapid beeping] [yelps] Who the f*ck are you? I'm a nurse, man. Rabbit : What about this intruder? He proved more resourceful than we imagined. There are only so many hospitals in the city. We will find him. Job : Which one? New York Presbyterian. Was I shot? No, dude. You got hit by a car. Rabbit : We have to assume he will get word to them. He was badly hurt. He may not get word to anyone. How long have I been here? I don't know. My shift started at noon. Are the cops here? Why would the cops be here? Priest : I have called everyone in. We will be ready for them. What the hell are you doing? No, you can't get out of bed. Tell me where my f*cking clothes are. You can't go anywhere. They're gonna f*cking kill me, man. No one's gonna kill you. They're gonna f*cking kill me. You have a serious concussion. You can't go anywhere. The f*ck I can't. Please just get back in the bed! I need some help in here! Get the f*ck off me! [panting] Hey, sorry to keep you waiting. It's alright. I just got here. Hey, Laura, can I get a cup of coffee? A few days ago, that building blew up. Word is it was an ecstasy lab. Proctor? Well, not that we can prove, but, yeah. Thanks. I've requested a forensics team from the DEA, but first they gotta find us on a map. So I'm guessing this is not a defective gas line. Mm-mm, truck went through a wall and then the place went sky-high. Is that it? I mean, why are you showing me this? Because the day before this happened, I was out there with Hood and Emmett. We shook down some guys. We found out this is where they're making the drugs. And Hood desperately wanted to tie it to Proctor, but we couldn't. And then it blows up. Just like that. And then he busts Proctor on a warrant based on information from a confidential informant. Exactly. And I wouldn't bet the farm on that warrant. sh1t. What the hell is he up to? 
 
 George. Long day? The only kind I seem to be having these days. Drink? No. That was some stunt you pulled with the council. Oh, George, don't be a sore loser. Men voted their consciences. Well, I'm sure you've heard that your good friend Proctor has once again been incarcerated. Proctor's no friend of mine. As a matter of fact, I'm taking measures to make sure he goes down for the count. Maybe I underestimated you. But maybe you underestimated me, too. This dagger belonged to my great-grandfather. It's handed down as a totem to the first-born male of each generation when he comes of age. So far, every man in my family  who has carried this knife has had occasion to use it. Of course, I have no sons. Is this your occasion, George? Is that why you're here? I didn't think so. [sighs] [thumps] [gasps] [footsteps receding] [door opens] Carrie : It's hard to know when I realized it. Little girls love their fathers. And mine was so loving, so attentive. And he kept me in this little world, and I had no other reality to compare it to. So what changed? Kids in school. They started to tease me. And you know how kids can be. Then this one day, I was walking home from school and I passed by a newsstand. And my father's picture was on the front page of every paper. So I bought a copy and I read it. And I didn't understand much... I was about 11, but I understood enough. They were saying that my father had had people killed. So I took the paper and I put it on his pillow... and I went to sleep. And then the next morning, he was sitting in my room in an old rocking chair I had in the corner, just rocking back and forth, staring at me. And for the first time in my life, I was scared of him. Jesus, Carrie. But then he picked me up... put me in his lap, and I was barely awake... kissed me on my head, and just rocked me back and forth  and I almost fell asleep again. He was my daddy. Hey... that's enough. You'll have plenty of time to tell me the rest of it. Yeah, I should get going. No, no, no. Shh. No. No, you shouldn't. You okay? Yeah. I'm just thinking about Emmett. Yeah. I just can't believe he lost it like that. Well, I don't think he did lose it. I think he made a conscious choice. They hurt his family, he needed to make 'em pay. We would have made them pay. Yeah, but he needed it to come from him. Think of it like you and Breece. Look, there is a point at which any one of us will do exactly what Emmett did. It's just a question of what puts us in that situation where the circumstances outweigh the consequences. We go to the Cadi every day and we're supposed to be dealing in justice, but... all we're really doing is enforcing a set of rules. But justice... real justice...  is personal. Sometimes the only way to get it is with your own two hands. You scare the sh1t out of me when you say things like that. You're the one that wanted me to talk more. [cell phone ringing] Yeah, I'm starting to have second thoughts. [Siobhan giggles] You're the only sheriff that doesn't answer his phone. [ringing continues] What? You need to get your ass to New York now. Job? I'm in deep sh1t here, man. Whoa, slow down, slow down. Where are you? In the hospital is where I am. New York Presbyterian, room 307. And if Rabbit get here first, I'll be... You found him? Yeah, I found him. Now he gonna find me. I'm on my way. What? What's wrong? I have to go. What, just like that? You don't think I'm entitled to more of an explanation than that? Yeah, you are, but right now I just don't have time. Well, are you coming back? Not tonight. How about ever? I don't know. Then don't go. I have to. [sighs] I don't think I can do this anymore. I mean, I don't even know who you are. I know. I'm sorry. [door closes] Hello, Brock. [coughs] sh1t. Sorry about that. It's fine. Wasn't expecting anyone, clearly. Don't worry about it. What the hell are you doing here? I got the night shift. I have to leave town tonight. Where are you going? It's not important. For how long? I don't know. [sighs] You're in charge. Yeah, because that worked out so well last time. Hood. Who the hell are you? You're a good man, Brock. Take care. [gasping] [knocking on door] Are you expecting anyone? No. It's okay. I got it. [knocking] Are you expecting somebody? Hood, what the hell is this? Carrie here? Are you serious? If she's here, I need to see her now. Go f*ck yourself. Gordon, it's okay. Yeah, the hell it is. What is it? What? Job found Rabbit. Oh, my God. Where? New York. Job's hurt. I'm going now. I'm coming. What? Give us a minute. We have to go, now. Give us a minute. Gordon, honey... Look, this is your first night back in this house. I know, but if Rabbit's in New York... None of this sh1t makes any sense. I know it doesn't. But I have to do this, to protect us, to protect our family. If we're gonna have a chance... And how are we gonna have a chance when he keeps showing up here? What is it with you? Why is any of this your problem? Don't look at her, I'm the one talking to you. I don't have time for this sh1t. You can stay here if you want. Hey, stop f*cking talking to her. Don't you turn your back on me. Gordon, stop it! f*ck you! Jesus Christ! Now, how many times are you gonna ruin our lives? This has nothing to do with you. Gordon, put the gun down. You don't understand. What, are you protecting him? No. What the hell is this? Are you f*cking him? Is that what this is? No, it isn't. Then what the hell is it, then?! If he doesn't get that gun out of my f*cking face, I'm gonna f*ckin' kill him. Stop it. You're gonna kill me? I don't think so. I don't give a f*ck what you think. You show up at my house You don't know what's going on, so back off! I will blow your f*cking head off! Last chance! He's Deva's father! What...? What did you say? Gordon... Gordon... I will tell you everything. But right now I have to go. Carrie : I have to go. Why? Because I have to kill him. Or die trying. [truck engine starts] I meant what I said... either he dies or we do. Nothing less. I couldn't agree more. [heart monitor beeping] [beeping continues] [elevator bell rings] [heart monitor beeping] [gunshots] [heart monitor beeping] [gasps] Is that any way to greet an old friend? Asshole. Can you move? Barely. Come on, let's get you... [grunts] [gunshot] Oh! f*ck! [nurses screaming] [gunshot] Shots fired on the third floor. Request police backup. Drop your weapon! [grunting] [gunshot] [gasps] Help! Drop it! Drop the gun now. Come out and drop the gun now. [speaking Ukrainian] Let her go! I'll shoot her in the head. [nurse whimpering] [speaking Ukrainian] I'm Rabbit's daughter. Are you sure he wants me dead? Stop walking. Because you had better be very sure before you pull the trigger. I'll kill her. [nurse screams] No, you won't. [whimpering] [panting] What took you so long? He had a friend. Job : How about a little less talk and a little more getting the f*ck out of here? [distant sirens wailing] sh1t. Let's move. [chatter] I want men in all four stairwells. And be careful. The shooter might still be in the building. You two, with me. I want you to head down there, make a loop. We'll meet back up at ICU. Son of a bitch! Move, move, move! [sirens wailing] [helicopter blades whirring] Lucas : So what the hell were you thinking, trying to take him out on your own? I saw an opening and I took it. Would have finished him right there if it hadn't been for that psycho priest. Priest? Yulish. What, you know him? He's my uncle. I never met him, but my father used to talk about him. I always got the feeling that he was scared of him. Are there any members of your family who aren't homicidal maniacs? We'll go in tomorrow. Job : I know the layout. I should come with you. You can't even stand, Job. It's just a concussion, man. You get them every day. The inside of your head must look like a Jackson Pollock. Can't have you slowing us down, okay? Job : It's not exactly an arsenal. Yeah, we had to leave in a bit of a hurry. Hey, Pony still dealing guns in these parts? Only dealing Pony's doing is blow jobs in Sing Sing. [gun clips clicking] But you know who is still around? You think? I'd have heard if someone took him out. Who? An old friend. He's using a very liberal definition of the word «friend.» Think he'd remember me? The question is, do you want him to? [clicking] [door closes] Your men...? They are dead. Then they have come. Yes. I spent 15 years searching for my daughter. And now she hunts me. Tell me, Yulish. Do you really believe in God? I do, yes. Rabbit : To me... God always felt like something men made up to feel less alone. And now... I am more alone than I have ever been. I don't trust you. I don't give a sh1t. Rabbit : And instead of wishing for God... I am praying... that He does not exist. [door clangs shut] Because if He does... My sins will follow me beyond the grave.
