 Previously on Banshee... 
 You were the most notorious thief in the country. 
 Now you want to play cop? Nah... Lukas Hood. I've got the badge. Kai, Hood is serious game. You'd better come ready. I think he knows... By the time he figures out we're not coming back, we'll be long gone. Ana. My name is Carrie. I still love you. You cooked up a tainted batch that killed a boy. But not just any boy. State Senator Schumacher, that's his son. No! It's a hard thing to see someone die. You're gonna be okay. The smartest career move you could make would be to get the f*ck out of my way. 1x03 - Meet the New Boss [ distant siren wailing ] [ gagging ] [ sighs ] Anastasia? Stop. Cuff yourself to the bedpost. Don't bother. [ chuckling ] [ gun thumps ] You look good. Healthy. Pale, though. I think maybe you live on the East Coast. For years I've been thinking... "Where is she? Is she close or half the world away? Is she still nervous when it thunders? Does she remember our walks in Coney Island? Getting borscht from Alexa's?" They're all there, every last one. And what do you want in exchange for this? Just let me go. He found you faster than I thought. He did in one week what I failed to do in 15 years. True love, huh? [ laughs ] Just take the diamonds and consider me dead. Or what? You've only given me half of what I want. I want him. I can't do that. If you could, you would be free. Your word? My word. Now... how are you going to get away? There's something else in the bag for you. [ gasps, laughs ] [ speaking Ukrainian ] Clever Girl. [ kisses ] Bye, Daddy. [ horn honks ] [ all clamoring ] Say "champ." Say "champ." Champ! Banshee, PA! What's up, baby? Mr. Sanchez, What can I tell you about... I can tell you'd better... Benjamin, this fight will cement your credibility with the Gaming Commission. Give me another week, and I'll have us cleared to break ground on the hotel. I must admit I had my doubts, Kai, but you pulled it off. It's our casino. We're putting up the purse. He was just the middleman. Benjamin : Alex, enough. Sanchez : The champ is in the building, ladies and gentlemen. The champ is in the building. Mr. Sanchez, Kai Proctor. Welcome to Banshee. Glad to be here. This is Benjamin Longshadow. His tribe runs the Kinaho Moon. Chief. It's an honor to have you here. Alex Longshadow. Oh, 'kay. Mr. Sanchez, if you would do us the honor... a few shots with the casino in the background. Man, of... come on, man, of course. Right this way. Mr. Proctor, Douglas Dern, Damien's manager. We spoke on the phone. We did. Pleasure to meet you. You said the place was old. You didn't say ancient. The Kinaho feel a powerful connection to their past. In the case of the Kinaho Moon, a little too powerful, in my opinion. I would have preferred to have the new casino built before we hosted Mr. Sanchez, but rest assured the money is real. Yeah, it had better be. Sanchez : He's gonna look worse soon, I promise. Nice casino. Not bad. [ slot machines chiming ] Not bad at all. [ power tools whirring ] There it is, baby. That's where I do my thing. This way, Mr. Sanchez. You don't approve. The hotel... the revenue it will earn should be for our people. We shouldn't be including a man like Proctor. A man like that gets things done quickly. We're building something that will sustain our tribe for years to come. When I go to the spirits, I want to have seen the start of it all. Ahh! [ heartbeat thumping ] Ahh! [ heartbeat thumping ] Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a hotel? It's just a quick call. I can have you in the presidential suite. No, no, no. My trailer goes wherever I go. I don't like to be too pampered before a fight. Besides, there'll be plenty of time for that after I put Hollister's noose up there. As agreed. Thank you. I think I like this town. We also made some improvements on your bedroom. I think you will be pleased. # Amazing Grace # ♪ How sweet... ♪ Now I know I like this town. # The sound # ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ 
♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now am found ♪ 
♪ Was blind, but now I see ♪ 
♪ 'Twas Grace that taught... ♪ Senator, you have the Department's deepest sympathies. Mrs. Schumacher, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry for your loss. Sorry, ma'am. Sheriff Hood. Gordon. Hi, Deva. It's a pretty tough day for everyone. Yep. Say, why don't you join us for dinner tonight? Nothing fancy; I'm just gonna grill out some burgers in the back yard. Oh, honey, you know... That sounds great. Thanks, Gordon. Why don't we say about 6:00? Sure. See you there. Good. So, how do you like your burger, Sheriff? Medium rare, thanks. Can I see your gun? Yeah, sure. No. Thank you. You don't need to see his gun. Gordon : Hey, hon', why don't you grab the Sheriff another beer? I'll get it, Mom. Thanks. Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Yep. So, Deva, how are you doing? I don't know. I still can't believe it. Yeah. It takes some time. [ coughing ] Deva, honey, would you go get... Yeah. Hold on, Maxie. Nice and deep, bubba. [ coughing stops ] You okay? That's the way. Deva : You good? What's wrong with him? It's been happening since he was a toddler. Is he... is he okay? He has good days and bad days. Huh. Hey, Max, why don't you go ahead and touch the gun just for a second? Yeah. [ laughs ] Gordon : You know, Sheriff, we never got a chance to thank you for pulling Deva out of that mess the other night. Aw. So how did the arraignments go? Well, all the men you arrested identified this guy Hanson,  but apparently he's long gone. And either they don't know or won't talk about where the skulls came from. It's not that I can't guess. Whores, gambling, drugs. All crooked roads in Banshee lead to one man, and that's Kai Proctor. I'll get us some more drinks, eh? Great. Alone at last. Shut up. What happened? Heavy bag workout. Mm, not unless it was a bag of bones. Ana... it's me. Mm, no, you're different. How? You used to be kind. [ scoffs ] You know... you get locked up, forgotten about for 15 years, see how kind you feel after that. Now, I know you're angry, but... Angry? You have no f*ckin' idea. Gordon : Hey, where are you going? Uh, I got a call. Thanks for the food. [ music playing on jukebox ] Look, um, you wanna talk about it? [ laughs ] Drinking alone? [ music plays on jukebox ] To keeping secrets. # Downing my whiskey # ♪ It's all the same ♪ 
♪ Tobacco in the sunshine... ♪ Hey, um... Rebecca. Rebecca. I think you should go home. [ both moaning ] ♪ Downing my whiskey ♪ 
♪ It's all the same... ♪ No, you don't. [ moaning ] What, are you... saving yourself for someone? [ panting ] Rebecca, we can't... Shut up. ♪ It's all the same, it's all the same... ♪ [ music continues ] Look, you told me to call if she came back again. Well, she's back. ♪ Downing my whiskey... ♪ Hi, Uncle Kai. Don't you think you're getting a little too old for this rebel streak of yours? That's rich coming from you. Whatever you may think, my choices have cost me dearly. Yeah. You're really hurting. My mother lives just 10 miles away from me. I haven't seen or spoken to her in over 20 years. My father, when I run into him, won't even f*cking look at me. My sister, your mother, denies I even exist. Yeah, well, that's why they call it being shunned. [ shouting in Pennsylvania Dutch ] Show some respect! [ sighs ] [ speaks Pennsylvania Dutch ] I'm sorry, Uncle. You can't begin to understand how alone I am. I've lost count of the people I hurt, and still I hurt people every day. You have no idea what that does to you inside. It's like a blade in your belly that has gradually scraped you raw. I'm not buying it, Uncle. You have everything you've ever wanted. You're free. Why don't you just admit that you like being bad? Do you realize no one else can talk to me like that? You're the only person who isn't scared of me. The only one. I'll drive you home. [ engine starts ] [ crowd cheering ] Announcer : I want to welcome our Camp Genoa Marines to view a private sparring session with the champ. [ crowd cheering ] Announcer #2 : All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce a man who needs no introduction... two-time cruiserweight champion of the world, honorary referee for this weekend's fight, Banshee's own Sugar Bates! [ crowd cheering ] Now, a special gift for Mr. Sanchez from our sponsors at Stark-Himmel Timepieces... a solid gold watch with a one-of-a-kind diamond bezel designed especially for the champ. This is yours. Wear it well. You got my invitation for the cocktail party tomorrow and the fight on Saturday? I did. Thank you, gentlemen. Hey, listen, man, I wanna give a semper fi to all my jarheads from Banshee's Camp Genoa, all right? Marines : Ooh-rah! Seems like you're always hosting something around here. Y'all ready to see me whip some ass? Crowd : Yeah! You just came in to see him train? No. Actually, I came to see you. You heard about the Schumacher boy OD'ing, right? Yeah, I did. It's terrible. Proctor, you told me you had a talent for resolving problems here in Banshee. I was kind of hoping you could help me with this one. I found these in the dead boy's pocket. The kids call them "skulls." You ever seen pills like that before? Are you asking me or accusing me? [ laughs ] Why, I'm asking you, Kai. Just don't play games with me, Sheriff. I'm well aware of Mayor Kendall's agenda. Oh, this has nothing to do with Kendall. The boy means well, but he's an idiot. On that at least I'm sure we can agree. So if you'll excuse me... I'm busy trying to bring good things to Banshee. Thanks for your time. All : Oh! [ crowd cheering ] Asshole. What? You gotta watch me. If you blink, it's over. He didn't have to hit him that hard. They're just sparring. Sanchez : Damn, I'm out of partners. Marine : Right here! Sarge will take you on! Hey, hey, hey. [ clamoring stops ] Ahem. 5-0. Yeah, Sheriff. You want a shot at the title? Huh? You can't throw a few punches? [ crowd booing ] Go easy on him. I'd be scared of me, too. [ laughter ] Man : You're the champ! Sanchez : The Sheriff too smart. He don't wanna step in the ring. He don't want none of this. [ crowd clamoring ] 
 
 Excuse me, excuse me. Hey. Can you come here? Hey, hey. Hey, doll. How you doing? What's your name? Chloe. Hey, um, Chloe, can you bring me a bottle of champagne? Sure. I'll be right back. No, doll. Can you bring it to my trailer? Say, tonight around 11:00? [ gasps ] All right, Mr. Sanchez. All right, Chloe. All right. [ knocking ] [ sniffs ] Come on in. Hmm. Must be 11:00. [ gun clicks ] They're all there. Just take them and go. You can start a new life somewhere. You deserve that after everything you've been through. You think you can buy me off? Huh? You listen to me. I'm not going anywhere. So take your f*ckin' diamonds and get out. [ Chloe giggles ] [ moans ] You want a bump? I never have. I'll try. Yeah, f*ck me harder. [ laughs ] No, no, no, no. No, doll, no. Not like that. Like this. You like it like that? f*ck me harder! [ gasping ] Ah, you're hurting me. No! Get off me! Don't! Shut the f*ck up! f*cking bitch! Ah! Oh, my head! We have combed the entire building, reviewed all security footage. She left absolutely nothing behind. But she came. She walked right into the lion's den. He has become a threat to her. He has been locked up for 15 years. He's sick with love. He is reckless. And rusty. He'll make a mistake. He already did. He scared her. I thought this was your day off. I don't have much of a social life. Do you miss being home? You don't really talk about it. It must be hard coming to a new town not knowing anyone. [ clicks ] I'm used to being alone. I'll never get used to it. [ whirring softly ] Sheriff. Yeah. You need to get over to the hospital. Siobhan : Chloe, I'm so sorry I have to ask these questions. [ heart monitor beeping ] I'm almost done, okay? So you and Mr. Sanchez... being in bed together was consensual? Until it got rough. I did something wrong and he just... Chloe, look at me. You did nothing wrong, okay? He kicked me and then he punched me. I was crawling. I was trying to get away,  but he... he wouldn't let...  then he... took the champagne bottle... [ sobbing ] Siobhan : Okay. I'm gonna go talk to your nurse, okay? Hey, hey, hey. We've got nothing. Even the overflow lot is filled. You're gonna wanna try down the way... hey! Lucas : Found a spot. [ machines ringing ] [ squeals ] Oh, crap. Sheriff Hood. I've heard about the girl. How is she? Well, she looks like she was hit by a train. I know this is a delicate situation, but I'm going to ask you to arrest Sanchez after the fight tomorrow night. What? Yeah, I know how it sounds, but Banshee needs this fight to happen. Too many people and businesses stand to lose if it doesn't. Are you out of your mind?! That girl... Hey, hey, Deputy, give us a minute. You're actually gonna discuss this... Hey, hey, hey. You saw what he did to that girl. Calm down right now. Are you just another one of Proctor's yes-men now? Is that it? "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss." Sheriff, I just wanted to thank you for your discretion. These things can always be handled. "These things"? So this has happened before? You know the deal... tomorrow I'll go visit the girl. She'll put on a show, but ultimately, it always comes down to the number they had in their mind from the moment they decided to f*ck him. Yeah? Dern, right? Yeah. Yeah, you need to go somewhere I can't see you and stay there. Hey, I mean, come on... Hood. Hey, hey. [ crowd gasps ] 5-0, that was not cool. Benny was just doing his job, man. What the f*ck? You're under arrest for rape and aggravated assault. [ crowd gasps ] I'm under arrest? [ laughing ] Okay. Yeah, I'm under arrest. All right, yeah. Come and get me. Sheriff. Sheriff. [ crowd gasps ] Gotta watch me. [ laughing ] That is cute. I like that. [ laughing ] Looks like you're not too smart after all. This what you wanna do? [ laughs ] Ladies and gentlemen, amateur hour. [ crowd murmuring ] Let's go. [ crowd murmuring ] [ crowd gasps ] Sanchez : Come on, Sheriff, let's go. Get up, bitch! [ all gasp ] [ laughing ] Get out of my way. Move! Move. Hood. [ bottle shatters ] [ crowd gasps ] [ Sanchez screaming ] Get the f*ck off of me. Come on, Champ. [ choking ] [ laughing ] [ growling ] [ Sanchez screams ] Oh! [ gasping ] f*ck. You like hitting little girls? Huh? [ screaming ] You m*therf*cker! [ cracking ] [ screams ] Woman : Oh. my God! [ sobbing ] [ cracks ] [ screaming ] Sugar : Hood, enough! [ panting ] Meet the new boss. Siobhan : You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be held against you in... Sugar here. Come on. I got you. All right. Let's walk, hmm? All right. So you're just the kind of guy who makes friends wherever he goes, huh? [ laughing ] Yeah, it's all right. sh1t. Just open the door. [ whimpers ] Whoo! Whoa. I always wanted to drive one of these. You cost me a referee gig tonight, brother. And I could have used the scratch. [ music playing ] Ha. All righty. Here we go. [ tires squealing ] ♪ Wait ♪ 
♪ Take all this pain ♪ 
♪ Take it away ♪ 
♪ Take it away... ♪ [ ice bag crunches ] [ car engine rumbles ] What's going on, Kai? He in there? Sugar : Yeah, but he's not fit for a visit. Kai : So now you're his gatekeeper? It's okay, Sugar. It's all right. You cost a lot of people a lot of money tonight. You cost me a lot of money tonight. Why don't you take it up with Sanchez? Can I help you with something, Mr. Proctor? I always had very good relations with your predecessors. Yeah, you bought them. Sometimes laws need to be bent or broken for the greater good. I know you agree with that. No. No, you know nothing about me. Well, clearly not as much as I should. There's a lot you don't know as well. My family's been here for 160 years. I've lived here my entire life. I am this town. I helped build it and I bled for it. Have you ever loved anything like that? I have. You see, people here don't always approve of the way I go about things. But from what I've seen since you got here, you're not very different from me in that regard. So what puzzles me is why you seem to hold me in such contempt. I have no contempt for you. I'm just not afraid of you. I think maybe you're not used to that. See, you call yourself a businessman and you dress well, you speak well, but you're still nothing but a petty thug. You've been doing it so long, you actually think it makes sense to show up here in the middle of the night and ask me why you can't own me like you own everyone else. That makes you delusional, which makes you dangerous. Why would I want to get in bed with someone like that? Sheriff, do you know why they're afraid of me? Why is that? Because they should be. And maybe you should be, too. Why don't you show me why right now? Nah. I haven't given up on you just yet. You have a good night. Dern : You're not understanding me. He's done. He's done permanently! The Sheriff f*cked him up really bad. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself. No, look, look. They already arrested him. I'm cutting my f*ckin' losses. I never should've come to this jerkwater town. I gotta call you back. Mr. Dern. I'm a little busy here. I imagine so. I won't waste your time. I'm here to pick up the satchel. What the f*ck are you talking about? You were paid an agreed-upon sum of cash to deliver the fight to the Kinaho Moon. Clearly, the fight is off. And while Mr. Proctor does not hold Mr. Sanchez's reckless behavior against you personally, he does expect his money to be returned. [ laughing ] Well, listen to me, little man. Proctor assured me that he'd buy us enough time to pay off that little skank, so he's the one that didn't come through. And as far as the money, tell him it's the cost of doing business. And if he knows what's good for him, he'll leave it at that. Now I'm gonna go finish packing... [ yells ] so I can get the f*ck out of this shithole! Dern : Hey, what are you doing here, asshole? I told you... what the f*ck is that? Hey, wait. Now, now, don't. Come on. Just back off. Hey... [screams ] Don't!
