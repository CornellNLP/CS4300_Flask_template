 Previously on Banshee. 
 Whores, gambling, drugs All crooked ways in Banshee leads to one man and that's Kai Proctor. 
 You heard about the Schumacher boys right? They found these in the dead boy's pocket... you ever see pills like that before? 
 Rebecca we can't... 
 Shut up. 
 To keeping secrets. 
 Anastasia. 
 Just take the diamonds. 
 Consider him dead. 
 I want him. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Come and get me. 
 Hood! Enough! 
 People here, do you know why they're afraid of me? 
 `Cause they should be. Maybe you should be too. 
 ( panting, kissing ) 
 Come this way, come this way. 
 Turn over. 
 ( grunts ) 
 Mmm. 
 ( panting ) 
 You good? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Was it okay for you? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Are you sure? 
 You're usually a little more animated. 
 It was a quiet one. 
 Well, that's no fun. 
 Come on, let's see if we can make some noise, huh? 
 ( laughs ) Oh, honey. 
 It's okay. 
 Honey, not now. 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. I'm just... I'm just a little spent. 
 You're sure there's nothing wrong? 
 It's fine. 
 I'm gonna grab a glass of water. 
 ( sighs ) 
 ( crickets chirping ) 
 ( owl hooting ) 
 ( theme music playing ) ( alarm blaring ) f*ck! ( yells ) ( exhales ) ( exhales ) ( cell phone chiming ) Hello. Where's my f*ckin' money? I'm in a bit of a bind. And you're calling me. Am I the only one detecting a pattern here? I'm on a take. I got boxed. Where are you? State Museum, Harrisburg. The State Museum. How the mighty have fallen. ( Men laughing ) I'll bet she could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch. Lucas :  It's a Modigliani exhibit. I don't know which I find harder to believe... that there's a Modigliani  in Harrisburg or that you got boxed in a State Museum. There was no box in the schematics, Job. Well, not in the ones you were looking at, baby. Oh, look, the alarm's got a dialer. State police are responding. ETA... six minutes. ( Men laughing ) Man : I'm telling you, you should ask her out. Job, I can barely hear you. Can you turn this sh1t off? ( alarm stops ) Is it off? Yeah. Then I'm in there with you. And I'm gonna get you out. Okay. Is there a manual release? Not one that you can reach without a blowtorch. What's behind these walls? Solid stone. Someone knew what they were doing. ( yells ) ( screams ) ( hyperventilating ) ( door clangs ) ( shouts ) ( cell phone vibrating ) Hold on a second. Hello? Carrie :  Oh. I figured I'd get your voice mail. I keep odd hours. We need to talk. Now is not really an ideal time. Really? Well, it's the middle of the night and I'm sneaking out to my backyard because I haven't slept a single night since you showed up. You're putting me and my family at risk. Hold on. ( Beeps ) Job. I know you did not just take a call  while I'm trying to save your pasty, dumb ass. Where are the cops, Job? Three minutes away. I am looking for an override. Look harder! ( Laughing ) Hey, Mama, you suck any dick yet tonight? Man : Yeah, like... like maybe your own? ( laughter ) Well, yeah, yeah. Wait, do you ever get bored and tit-fuck yourself? ( men laugh ) Man :  Ooh, she's gettin' pissy. Man #2 :  Oh, yeah. Man #3 :  I think she's upset. I'll be right back. Lucas :  What? Job! Man : Oh, we pissed him off. Man #2 :  Oh, yeah, we did piss her off. ( laughing ) I think she likes you. Hey, sweetie. Sit your bitch-asses down. Now I am going back to my table. And the next one of you that gets up out of this booth is gonna be pissing sitting down for the rest of his life. It's Zack's Diner, just off the interstate... Oh, sure, narc on a sister. She... I mean, he has a knife. Lucas :  Job! Now we both on the clock. Yeah, I'll be right back. ( Beeps ) Ana. It's Carrie. Listen,  we're gonna have to talk some other time. No, I don't wanna have another conversation with you. You need to stop this for both of our sakes. Hold on. ( Beeps ) Job, I need this door open now! Job? You're talking to Job? Jesus Christ, you're on a take? Listen, I'm in a jam. You're on a take. Oh, my God. I got boxed. f*ck. ( hyperventilating ) Carrie :  Okay. Okay. It's okay. Just breathe. ( breathing slows ) Now, where are you? State Museum, Harrisburg. It's okay. Job will back-door it. Get back to him now. Okay. ( sirens blaring ) Job, I hear sirens. ( keyboard clicking ) One second. I've got an override. Nothing's happening. Come on. Wait for it. Come on! Now would be good. Done. ( police radio chatter ) Dispatch, please advise we're sweeping the east hallway. ( grunts ) ( police radio chatter ) Ladies. Bitches. ( Scoffs ) ( police radio chatter ) ( siren blaring ) Officer : Miller, that you? Shots fired! Suspect is on the move on foot, heading down North Street to 83rd. He's wearing Miller's badge. ( gunshots ) ( officers shouting ) Unit 3, respond. Officer :  Right there! Right there! ( sirens chirp ) ( panting ) Officer :  Cover the entrance. ( police radio chatter ) Start moving through here. ( radio chatter ) Officer :  Over there! Officer :  We got the exits. He's got nowhere to go. Over there! Go! Go! Move! Move! I see him. ( sirens wailing ) ( sirens blaring ) ( Panting ) ( hyperventilating ) ( breathing slows ) I like that. On three! One, two... three, three, three! ( breathing heavily ) Hi. Hi. How much does he know? Don't worry about Sugar. He's one of us. There is no us. That was some solid driving. You're still sharp. Hey, I didn't ask you to come, you know? I didn't do it for you. If you go down, we both end up on Rabbit's radar. Well, I guess we're in it together, then. This is my life you're risking. I had it handled. Yeah, everything was going right on schedule. Mm-hmm. ( Both laugh ) What is it with you? You're still the same reckless thrill junkie you were 15 years ago. This whole sheriff thing you're doing...  it's one long bungee jump without a cord. You're not so different. I'm not out there risking everything for the thrill. I wasn't the one driving the getaway car. Shut up. I'm serious. So am I. Shut the f*ck up. ( door closes, engine starts ) ( sighs ) What, sheriff wasn't good enough? Now you want to be a statey? I had to improvise. You get the painting? Once a job goes south, always leave the take behind. So all that work for nothing. Maybe not. ( panting ) ( train whistle blows ) ( clinking ) What? Nothing. ( train whistle blows ) Sheriff. Miss Moody. Kat. Are we on a first-name basis now? The Moody boys are gunning for you. You killed their brother and they're not gonna let that sit. Why would you warn me? That's not the right question. What is, then? The question is why aren't you scared? You have a good morning, Kat. What was that about? Just a friendly chat. With the widow of the man you killed? Yeah. I'm funny that way. Sheriff, you sure you wanna be  showing up to work looking like that? Pick your battles, Brock. All right, fine. Tell it to the senator. He's in your office. Senator Schumacher. There's a lacrosse stick in my bed. Excuse me? Syracuse, Hopkins... all the schools were all after Reed, offering him full rides. He was lightning on the field. Now he's dead, and my wife... she's got his lacrosse stick in our bed,  holding onto it every night as she cries. I'm... sorry for your loss. I'm not here for your sympathy. I want justice. You made enough arrests that ATF has practically closed the case, never mind that this guy Hanson seems to have disappeared into thin air. It's federal jurisdiction. f*ck jurisdiction! This happened in your town, Sheriff Hood. His blood is on your hands. You sleep with that in your bed. ( bangs ) ( button clicks ) Alma, get me the number of the high school. Who are you looking for again? Your telling us about Hanson was helpful, but he's disappeared. So we're looking for anyone else that might have been involved, someone who might be able to lead us to Hanson or tell us where that bad E came from. Hanson was getting his stuff from somewhere. God, how can one town have so many scumbags? Hey, him. I know him. You know him how? Hanson and his guys beat the crap out of this guy. I don't know why, but it was the day before the rave. Arno Webber. I played Pop Warner with him. He's pretty small-time, but no stranger to the penal system. He lives over in Hitler's Bunker. Hitler's Bunker? It's just some run-down apartments where the Aryan Nation guys hang out. ( Door opens ) What the hell is this? You have no right to bring her in here without asking me. Chillax, Mom. I'm not in trouble. Deva was just helping us with... If you want to see or speak to my daughter, you ask me first. I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopewell. Come on, baby, let's go. Deva :  Not for nothing, Mom,  but we're trying to catch a murderer. Now. Deva, thanks for your help. Sure. I hope you catch the asshole. So, what was all that with you and Mrs. Hopewell? She had a point, I guess. That was it, huh? Lucas : This the place? Yep. This is where the Master Race collect their unemployment checks. ( dog barking ) ( music blaring ) They seem angry. They don't like to see a black man with a badge stepping into their white world. Oh. Hey, it's okay, guys. He's one of us. His wife is white. Nice. Just sayin'. ( men muttering ) ( baby crying ) That's Arno's door. Man :  Hey, cop! What the f*ck you doing here? Whatever the f*ck I want. I'll go see Arno. You stay here with the Hitler Youth. ( music blaring ) ( Needle buzzing ) Hey, Arno. ( grunts ) You stay the f*ck back! ( laughing ) Penn State, right? You're that all-star nigger running back. ( laughing ) Ah! Okay! Okay! f*ck, what do you want? Why'd you run? Why'd you run? Instinct, man. Looking for a guy named Hanson. Seems to have gone off the grid. I'm not telling you sh1t. ( nose cracks ) Oh, God! You're a two-time loser, Arno. What are we gonna find if we toss your apartment, huh? ( laughs ) Possession? An attempt to distribute? Get a warrant, m*therf*cker. Wrong answer. Oh, God! Off the grid. ( Laughing ) You wanna see Hanson? Well, there he is. Emmett : That's Hanson's hand? f*ckin' "Addams Family," right? ( laughs ) How do you know it's Hanson? From the tat, man. I inked him myself. Lucas :  A crab? He was a Cancer, man. He was into all this astrology sh1t. Where'd you get it? That I can't tell you. Okay, then you're going down for Hanson's murder. What the f*ck, man? I'm helping you. No. You're annoying me. Where'd you get the goddamn hand? ( sighs ) Okay, okay.  I work at the slaughterhouse on the killing floor, all right?  Cleaning and sh1t. Well, one day last week, I sneak in a few pops on the job, get a little loaded, and fall asleep behind some crates.  I wake up around midnight, hearing things.  I peek out and there's the boss himself and that weird, quiet dude with the bow ties carrying something wrapped up in a tarp. I hid while they fed it to the shredder. And when they left, I found that down in the blood gutter.  I kept it.  Kind of like insurance. You saw Proctor himself? Yeah, I did. And you'll testify? f*ck, no! I'm kinda addicted to breathing. I can help you with that. Wait, wait. This is bullshit. It's bullshit. Proctor would never do it himself. Cuff him. No, man! Wait, wait, wait! Hey! 
 
 Check it out! Check it out! Uh, modern technology don't lie. And the Oscar for Best Picture goes to... Arno Webber! ( laughs ) You guys are gonna protect me, right? You're a good citizen, Arno. Dude, seriously, man, you gotta keep my name out of this. He'll kill me. What a loss that would be to the Nazi gene pool. We'll be in touch. Stay by the phone. You just took my f*ckin' phone. Emmett :  Then stay here. Ugh. ( saw whirring ) Jesus Christ. And you confirmed the hand's Hanson's? Prints match. So we don't get Proctor for drugs or racketeering, but we get him on murder of one of his own. Guess there's a poetry to that. So, we good to go? Well, it's not a slam dunk, but it's actionable. Okay, then. Get your... get your witness locked up tight. When his name goes to the grand jury, he'll be an endangered species. You got it. Thanks. Sheriff, could I have a moment? It's good to see you, Gordon. Yeah, you, too. Thanks, Emmett. So this guy Webber... Deva identified him? Yeah. Okay. But that's as far as her involvement here goes. I don't see why it needs to go further. My wife was pretty pissed. Well, I'm sorry about that. Poor judgment on my part. Don't get me wrong. I get it. The case was getting cold and... I appreciate what you did for my daughter. Carrie and I both do. I just... I need to keep Deva safe, you know? She's only 15. I understand. Okay. So, uh, go get him, huh? ( door opens, closes ) What are you thinking? I'm thinking we should have brought backup. You are the backup. Sheriff, Deputy. What can I do for you? You're under arrest. What for? Murder. Who did I kill? Christopher Hanson. ( panting ) Yeah. I haven't seen Hanson in quite some time. Yeah, that's one of the side effects of killing someone. It saddens me that you continue to hold me in such low regard. You'll get over it. Can we get on with this? You stay right there. Can we get on with this? ( handcuffs clicking ) Kai :  So, Sheriff Hood,  how are you finding the job so far? Never a dull moment, Kai. Yeah, you've been kind of busy since you got here. I imagine things were a bit quieter in... where was it, Oregon? Deputy Yawners mentioned your right to remain silent. Oh, come on, Sheriff. If you're going to be arresting me every time someone shows up dead, we might as well get to know each other. I already know... Come on. ( Lucas coughs ) Where's Emmett? The deputy fell out of the car. We got no business with him. If he's hurt and you just left him... Right about now I'd be worried about my own ass if I was you. I got to admit... didn't count on Proctor being with you. Two birds, one stone. Our lucky day. I don't think so, Marcus. You don't think so? You knocked every one of my brother's teeth out. Looked like a f*ckin' baby when he opened his mouth. Yeah, and he cried like a baby, too. Now I'm gonna take your teeth out one by one real surgical. Then we'll see who's crying. ( laughing ) What the f*ck you laughing at? A dead man making threats. Dex :  Marcus, we need to talk about this. You didn't say nothing about messing with Proctor. Shut up, Dex! We get the sheriff, that's fair. An eye for an eye. But Proctor? We got families. What about our brother's family? Huh? What about Cole's kids? You just didn't say nothing about messing with Proctor. We got Proctor in the deal! God was just saving us a trip. Get him up. Get him up! Get him up, God damn it! Ah! Ah! ( slices ) ( Screams ) ( screaming ) Marcus :  m*therf*cker! You tore my f*ckin' ear off! Dex : Don't! ( laughs ) What, are you gonna kill a cop, Dex? Huh? I mean, how do you see this playing out? Shut up. What, you're... you're gonna kill us both? And then just go home, kick back, fry up some f*ckin' venison? I said shut up! No, you listen to me! I was taking Proctor in when you guys showed up,  and that's what I'm gonna do. You and your brothers, you came out for some redneck justice. I get that. But you got only one shot at getting out of this. That's the one I'm giving you right now. Go home. Take your brothers. You do it now,  I might forget this ever happened. You'll let us go? How do I know you're not bullshitting me? If I was, you'd already be dead. ( shotgun cocks ) I meant what I said. Get the f*ck out of here. ( groaning ) No, no, no. Sorry, boys. I'm gonna have to keep the truck. You crashed my car. Fair is fair. Once you hit the road, I'm sure you can catch a ride to the hospital. You can come get the truck from the Cadi tomorrow. Oh... Marcus... don't forget the rest of you. You're really gonna let them go? I'm prioritizing. Help me get him down. Jesus Christmas. What the hell happened to you guys? Lucas :  Car trouble. What the hell is this? What did you do to my client? He's been assaulted? Kai, wait. Have you been assaulted? If you assaulted my client, I will have charges brought up against you. You, too, Yawners. I'll bring the wrath of God down on this whole... ( coughs ) Quiet. He's all yours. ( police radio chatter ) ( door clangs ) Don't even ask. ( crickets chirping ) ( water running ) ( Carrie gasps ) ( both laugh ) Wait. I got you something. Carrie :  Is it hot? No. ( kisses ) I paid for this one. Lucas : It's our house. It's where we're going. Where is it? Lucas :  Far from here. ( moaning ) What's the matter? What is it? f*ck me. Please, just f*ck me. ( gasps ) ( moans ) ( music playing ) Big day for you. Why didn't you just shoot the Moody boys? They gave you the perfect excuse. Well, if I kill every dumb redneck that crosses me, it won't be long before people outside Banshee start looking at me. Yeah, you could lose your job. ( chuckles ) And speaking of jobs... I want in. You want in on what? Whatever comes next. No. What do you mean no? I mean no. You've been good to me. You got a good thing going here. I'm not gonna screw that up for you. ( laughs ) No, this is screwed up. You think I wanna spend what's left of my life pouring beers and breaking up brawls? I got my life savings in this place. It's not gonna give it back to me when I'm done. I'm 56 years old. That's 70 for a fighter. I'm black, I got a criminal record. You have an interesting way of selling yourself. f*ck you. Look, I don't need much, but I need more than I got. You have a particular skill set? ( chuckles ) You mean aside from saving your ass? ( clinks ) ( urinating ) The doctors couldn't get Marcus' ear back on his head. Well... I guess half deaf is better than all dead. Why didn't you kill them? I'm not a killer. ( laughs ) I think my late husband might disagree with that. I guess he would. They're gonna keep coming, you know? Why are you here, Kat? I don't know. ( both moaning ) ( grunts ) Oh, you... Ah! ( necklace clinks ) ( Kai singing loudly in Pennsylvania Dutch ) Mr. Proctor! Would you do me the profound courtesy of shutting the f*ck up? ( sighs ) Oh, God. ( Singing stops ) ( singing resumes ) ( sighs ) Dan :  Hello? I'm in here. Got your babysitting duty, huh? Yeah. You mind if I have a quick word with your prisoner? If it gets him to stop singing, I'm all for it. ( singing continues ) The wunderkind mayor,  here to savor the moment. Enjoy it, Mr. Mayor. Because a moment is all you'll get. Is something on your mind, son? Don't call me "son." Ah. I'm sorry. Forgot about your daddy issues. Did you know I had to put him in a home? And when I go visit him there now in that place and I see him and I smell him... Enterprises fail, Kendall. Or it dissolves to make way for progress. I'm not respons... You broke him. And I'm gonna break you. As long as it takes. Hmm. I admire your gumption. Most men would just grab a shotgun and come after me, but you... you ran for mayor. It's maybe a little... I don't know... gutless, but for someone like you, a boy who will never really be a man... You're a blight on this town. And I'm gonna... oh! ( Choking ) I was building this town before you were born. You have me to thank for all of it. Your father was weak, barely a man. And you're no different. Break me? You're a gnat on my ass. You have no idea what real power is, you little prick. ( heaving ) What the f*ck is going on here? I think he needs medical attention. What happened? Dan? ( Coughing, panting ) ( coughs, growls ) ( singing in Pennsylvania Dutch ) Okay, the charge is murder in the first. Will you be entering a plea now or waiting on the grand jury? My client is pleading not guilty, Your Honor. Very well. I assume you'll want to discuss bail now. Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor, this is a murder charge. We have an eyewitness as well as physical evidence. Mr. Proctor's wealth is a matter of public record. The DA pulls my client into this courtroom on a regular basis. If there was ever a flight risk... There's clearly  a larger political agenda at work here. We fully expect this case to fall apart, as all the DA's cases against my client have in the past. Mr. Proctor has never fled before. He's not gonna start now. It's murder, Judge. Mr. Proctor has a business to run. He can't do that from a jail cell. Okay, in light of the defendant's legal history here and the fact that he's never been convicted,  I'm not going to remand him until after an indictment. Bail is set at $300,000. Defendant will surrender his passport before being released. ( gavel pounds ) Attorney :  Thank you, Your Honor. I brought a check with me. Eyewitness? Already working on it. ( dog barking ) f*ck me. You don't write, you don't call. What do you want? Hmm. What do I want? I want a steak, fries, and a Diet Coke. I want the entire Jean Paul Gaultier fall collection. Oh, and I want $750,000 for my blown-up business. ( sighs ) I am sorry about that. What did you expect to happen? It's f*ckin' Rabbit. Well, I can get you the steak. You can start with the steak, then you can take me shopping for new digs. Digs? Mm. That's right, baby, digs. You better brace yourself. Here come the m*therf*ckin' neighborhood. You know you're gonna hate it here. Not true. I already hate it here. Arno :  I know all about witness protection and relocation. ( TV playing ) I've seen it in shitloads of movies. You gotta set me up with a whole new life in, like, Topeka where I get to be whatever I want, like a master electrician... or a guidance counselor. ( scoffs ) Don't judge, bro. I got sh1t to offer. You are sh1t. I'd make a great stone mason. Is it possible for you to draw a breath without speaking? You're an uptight m*therf*cker. What's your blood pressure like, man? f*ck. ( sighs ) I gotta take a piss. Well, put it back when you're done. ( laughing ) ( Knock on door ) Who's there? Hello? Arno :  What the f*ck's going on? Arno :  What is it? They're here for you. f*ckin' hell. Wait, are you just f*ckin' with me? Ah! ( coughing ) Arno : Wait, wait! Get the f*ck off me! Get the f*ck away! I didn't tell 'em anything! Hey, cop, wake up! Help! ( groans ) ♪ In the darkness it finds me ♪ 
♪ A terrible fire ♪ 
♪ It don't matter how much I pray ♪ 
♪ The flames leap and burn me ♪ 
♪ There's nothing I can do ♪ 
♪ To make the fear go away ♪
