 Uh-huh, Barbie.

 Hey. Hey. So how were you planning on getting home if I hadn't shown up? How do you get anywhere from here? Middle of nowhere. Yeah, that's where they build them. They give you a bus schedule. Thanks for coming. No problem. [clicking] [theme music playing] 2x05 - The Truth About Unicorns Lucas : You okay? It doesn't feel like you think it would. Lucas : Getting out? Yeah. Carrie : But you would know. Lucas : Yeah, reentry's a bitch under any circumstances. You must be missing your kids. Sometimes in bed I'd pretend that they'd crawled into my arms like they used to when they were little and they couldn't sleep. Deva's going through some stuff. 
She needs her mom. And how's Max? From what I can see, he's all about his skateboard. You'll see for yourself soon enough. Can we stop somewhere to eat? 
I'm starving. Lucas : Good? Mm-hmm. How much do you remember about prison food? [chuckles] You know, there was this one time it was the warden's birthday, anniversary, something, I don't know. He decided he wanted to give us a special meal, right? So he has the cooks make us these big steaks. Pretty good. With potatoes and pie for dessert. Mm. It's funny... some guys, they just inhaled it. I mean, it had been so long since... Other guys, they took it back to their tables and sat, looked at it, just started crying. I get it. Then there was these other guys  who took the steak and threw it against the f*cking wall. Like telling the place to go f*ck itself, you know? Woman : Sean, get back here. Sean : I got it! Girl : Give it back! [Sean laughing] Sean : That's so not fair. You're supposed to be setting an example. I told you this was a bad idea. I got to tell you, I'm with Sean on this one. He wasn't sharing. Sure, take the girl's side. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. [guitar playing] This could be Banshee. Mm, but it doesn't feel the same. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. Deva had one just like this. 
She loved this thing. She slept with it, took it to school with her. We read "The Last Unicorn" together when she was little. It was her favorite book. "I would enter your sleep if I could and guard you there..." uh, something something. "But I cannot enter unless you dream of me." There you go. You read "The Last Unicorn"? In prison. It was a small library. What is it? Nothing. Tell me. I just... the whole time I was away, I thought I knew what I was missing. Turns out, I only knew the half of it. You should buy it for her. This a Revell? Man : Good eye. You a modeler? Once upon a time. How much? It's 10. Carrie : Thank you. I wouldn't have pegged you for the model airplane type. Yeah, when I was a kid, about the only time I spent with the old man... building model planes. In all the time I've known you, you've never once mentioned your father. Really? There's no reason to start now. [wind chimes tinkling] [wind chimes tinkling louder] What is it? It's nothing. Nothing. Carrie : Security camera, upper right-hand corner on a swivel. Lucas : Won't do them any good if they get hit at night. Carrie : You've been away too long. 
See that ring around the outside lens? That's LED lighting. 
Finds you in the dark. But that Vicon in the window display... Lucas : That's a camera? Yeah, it's wireless. It's no problem throwing off the signal. 
Totally Mickey Mouse. Listen to you. Well, it is. You know, if the safe is the same make, this place would be child's play. But if you get jammed up front... There is an alley running behind the whole block. I'm sure they have a door to it. Look at you. [cap guns popping] [children laughing] What? That car. Carrie : A tail? Lucas : I don't know. But you've tagged it before? Twice. Where? Next street up, down a block to the right. The driver? Couldn't see. Tinted windows. I'll bring the truck around front. Right. [chiming] [cap guns popping] [children laughing] [popping] [squealing] [pops] [popping] [laughing] [engine starts] Behind. I know. Wait here. Excuse me. Is everything okay? Yeah, sorry. I thought this was a friend of mine's car. Would you mind just giving me a hand? Yeah. Thanks. Guess I got too much stuff. Thanks. [music] Where are you going? 
Turnpike's that way. Yeah, I thought we could take a little detour. Something I want to show you. What is it? Won't take more than a couple hours. Unless you're in a hurry to get home. Home. [Carrie laughing] Wait. Lucas : I got you something. 
It's where we're going. It's our house. It's the house. Lucas : I figured we could, I don't know, disappear here. Carrie : Oh, my God, you own this? Paid cash. Set up a trust for the taxes. Just wanted you to see it. It was a good plan. Lucas : You know, I've been thinking. It's probably time for me to be moving on. Ever since I got to Banshee, things have...  well, I've made things worse for you, your family. I mean, that wasn't the plan, but that's what happened. You tried to tell me. Anyway, I can't play lawman forever, can I? Yeah, but where would you go? What would you do? Um... just go. Maybe come back here. I don't know. I just can't keep doing the things I've been doing to people. No more. No more. When I got out and I found you, you had a home, a family. You had all the things you were supposed to have with me. And that f*cking killed me. Then I saw Deva. And the truth is I just didn't want to go. So I told myself that by staying, I was protecting you. From Rabbit. Yeah. Lucas : I mean, I believed it. I really believed it. But he was always really after me. It was never you. So... [sighs] best thing I can do for you is to leave. [music] [gasps] [gunshot] 
 
 [birds chirping] What is it? Well, maybe nothing. Stay there. [music] Sheriff Hood. Agent Racine. Let's go. Lucas : The FBI dropped in for a visit. So I see. Mrs. Hopewell. Congratulations on your release from prison. Sit anywhere. You won't be needing that. Lucas : Maybe. You want to tell us why you're here? Heard you had a visitor while you were inside. Oh, you knew? After the fact. You don't know me well. If you did, you'd know that putting Rabbit down is pretty much it for me. Lucas : Why? What is it between you and Rabbit? [chuckles] When I was a young agent... I worked a few angles. Got Rabbit's case for myself. 
I figured I'd grab a few headlines, move up the ladder. 
But I busted him too soon. His lawyers shredded me. 
Got my wiretaps thrown out. A week later, my confidential informant was murdered in Astoria along with his wife and two daughters. So the way I see it, those little girls and anyone else he's killed since then, they're all on me. You have an ashtray? Never even tried to quit. 
Loved it too much. And now they tell me I don't have too much time left. Six months. 
A year. I don't know what happens to us when we die,  but I don't want to go out with all those deaths on my head. Yeah, that's touching, but it still doesn't explain why you're following us. Waiting for her to get out. Figured Rabbit would be waiting, too. 
I still think that. So you're using us as bait? Exactly. But you're wrong. He's not coming. 
He's tired, worn out. He's given up. What about you, Sheriff? You also believe our Rabbit has decided to forgive and forget? No. - You think he knows my father better than I do? It's not about what he knows. 
It's about what I know. So when Rabbit shows up, you plan to be there. That's right. 
Then deliver him to justice. By which I mean shoot him till he's dead. And if we get killed in the process, that's just too bad? You don't have anyone to blame but yourself. You had him at point-blank range. You think of it, you should thank me for having your back. Carrie : Did you hear the man? 
We should be thanking him. How about that? We should be working together. Carrie : We can't. Why not? Because we don't trust you. You should. You of all people. Why? For starters, I know you're not Lucas Hood. Hey, hey, hey. My gun is in the large compartment. I'm still waiting to hear what you got to say. 15 years ago, Capital Diamond Company. I'm sorry? Two thieves broke in that night and one got away. He or she was never caught. But you weren't so lucky, were you? I was there watching that cop Bonner interrogate you. You didn't give him a thing. Hell, we still don't know your real name. Then I show up in Banshee and there you are. Lucas Hood. A sheriff, no less. I think you must have me confused... No, no, don't. Don't waste my time. Those bodies your people dug up in the woods, one of them was stolen. Someone wanted that body gone before any DNA trace samples could be taken. Turns out there was more than enough DNA on the clothes that poor sucker was wearing when he died. And the DNA belonged to one Lucas Hood. He had his blood profiled like everyone else in law enforcement. So that makes you something of a mystery, doesn't it? Would you mind putting a little water in this? [water running] He knows who you are. 
You can't let him leave. Enough people have died over this. So...  can I count on your cooperation? [water stops] No more. So we help you find Rabbit...  what happens next? You do that, as far as I'm concerned, I never even have to ask the next question. What question? What question? Just who the hell you really are. [gunshot] [gunshots] You okay? Yeah. Stay there. [gunshots stop] [chiming] [glass shatters] On three. 
Okay? [gunfire] [wings fluttering] [gunfire] Carrie : Hey! [gunshot] [coughs] sh1t. Rabbit. [straining] [knife pierces] [screams] [whimpering] [grunts] [humming sound] [loud music] [silent music] He's never gonna stop coming. Not until we're both dead. Nope. I'm here. [music playing] ♪ Oh ♪

What happened? Okay. Well, I guess you won't be leaving just yet. I can't. I can't say I'm sorry to have you around a bit longer. What can I say? 
You keep me young. Hmm? And you're very generous with my whiskey. Especially my good whiskey. [chuckles] You know,  every time I think I know the way forward... something just kicks me back on my ass, you know? It's like, you know... it's... f*ck, I don't know. Like you're still inside. People like you and me, we don't need bars. We build our own cells. When you live like we live, it goes without saying. We're gonna find ourselves in places we never imagined we'd be looking back and wondering how the hell we got there and why the hell it seems you can't leave. There's something broken in us. Something that we don't have that other people do that lets them settle down and find peace and dream of a better life. People like you and me, we can't afford those dreams. Lucas : Why not? Sugar : Because of what we have done. There are ghosts that just won't let us be. f*ck that. [music stops] ♪ All ♪
