 Gunshot wounds to the abdomen, and left chest. 
 He's my brother. 
 Previously on Chicago Fire...  
 If this was all about gangs, there is one cop who could have helped out. 
 Don't even think about it. 
 This conversation becomes about favors. 
 Sometimes you gotta dance with the devil. 
 Voight tried to take me out. 
 You know, Daniel's planning on using the fact that I was on antidepressants as proof that I'm mentally unstable. 
 Screw Daniel. 
 You got two weeks to find a new place. 
 What? 
 Where am I gonna live? Where am I gonna go? 
 I got no right to ask this, but I think if you reached out to her, it could go a long way towards turning things around. 
 Renee? 
 I'm doing fine. 
 Thanks for your concern. 
 I just got a call from a hospital. 
 She took a bunch of pills. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Cruz! 
 Coming in! 
 Damn it! Cruz! 
 You a fireman or a kamikaze pilot now? 
 Fire's out. That's all that matters. 
 It matters if you get yourself killed. 
 Thanks, mom. 
 Matt. 
 I'll see you tomorrow morning. We can talk then. 
 Oh, oh, oh, jeez. 
 Mom, why are you hiding from your parole officer? 
 [Sighs] I went out last night. 
 If she tests me, I won't pass. 
 Just please get rid of her. 
 [Stammers] 
 [Knock at door] 
 Ms. Kendrick. 
 Hi, Matt. I'm here to check in on Nancy. 
 Yeah, you just missed her. She's out for a walk. 
 I can wait. 
 Um, my shift is about to start. 
 Fine. 
 Try later. 
 Thank you. 
 Leslie. 
 Ms. Larocque, so sorry. 
 This is just how it is when I'm on shift. 
 My apologies. 
 Um, look. 
 Daniel's rejected her offer. 
 He wants full custody. 
 I thought you said he'd take the deal. 
 It was a good deal, but the father has a strong case. 
 Does he? 
 Let's look at it from his lawyer's perspective. 
 We've got a switch-hitter who married a man, conceived a child with him, then left him, and took the child to go live with her former lesbian lover, a woman with a time-consuming and very hazardous occupation. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I'm just looking for ways to normalize this scenario as much as possible. 
 Normalize? 
 For instance, you two shacking up with a skirt-chasing firefighter is not helping our cause. 
 I was just trying to tell her how Kelly has been so helpful. 
 Ladies, you want me to convince a judge that you're serious about being a family? 
 Then you need to get Clarice and this baby into a warm, loving, nurturing, and, yes, normal home. 
 Okay. 
 We'll get our own place. 
 [Station alert] 
 All companies be aware, we have a lightweight truss construction heavy structure fire. 
 I can't get down the stairs. It's too hot. 
 All companies, third-floor rescue. 
 Casey, get me two ladders. 
 Got it. 
 Keep it flowing. 
 Herrmann, Mills, Cruz, up the second ladder. 
 Gotcha. 
 Come on, I got you, man. All right? 
 You're doing good, man. 
 That's it, sweetheart. 
 Good job, man. 
 [Man coughing] 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 What about Hudson? You have to get him. 
 The dog. 
 Hudson! Hudson! 
 Cruz! 
 Stay put, Cruz. 
 Wait a minute! I can hear him. 
 Come here, boy! 
 Cruz, get out of there! 
 Cruz! Cruz! 
 Hudson! 
 Hudson! 
 Where are you, boy? 
 [Dog barks] 
 [Dog barks] 
 [Dog barks] Come here, come on. 
 Aah! 
 Man down! Man down! 
 I'm going. 
 [Shrill beeping] 
 Cruz, call out! 
 Cruz! 
 [Beeping continues] 
 Hey, Cruz. 
 Cruz! 
 You okay, buddy? 
 Yeah, yeah, I think so. 
 All right. We got to move. 
 [Indistinct shouting] Mouch! 
 Mouch! Mouch! 
 Mouch! 
 I'm okay. 
 Mouch! This way! Watch your feet! 
 Watch your feet! Gotcha! 
 Let's go! 
 Mouch, you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you sure, man? 
 Let 'em check you out. 
 I'm fine. 
 Hey, Casey, how about you? You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 You got a second-degree burn here. 
 Take him to the hospital. 
 It's nothing, Chief. 
 Take him to the hospital. 
 You okay? Good boy. 
 [Dog growling] 
 [Back up beeping] 
 Hey, Whaley, any new updates on Renee? 
 She's okay physically. 
 They're going to keep her on a 72-hour hold. 
 Psychiatric observation. 
 Did you talk to her? 
 She wouldn't see me. 
 I, uh, I don't know what to do. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How long are you going to freeze me out? 
 I'm not freezing you out. 
 I gotta talk to Boden. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Cruz is still in the E.R. 
 He's telling doctors he wants to come back and finish his shift. 
 Did you happen to notice if Cruz's bunker gear had a cape sewn into it? 
 No, Chief. 
 It definitely does not. 
 Then please dissuade your man of the notion that he is invincible. 
 Sure. 
 And that's how our fellow firefighter was saved today. 
 56 hits in less than an hour. 
 Just tell me this thing's not going to go viral. 
 Glad to see Mouch's near-death experience can help drive traffic to your podcast. 
 The whole point of the podcast is to show people what we really do. 
 You're supposed to be looking up how-to videos on taping drywall. 
 All right. 
 We got to get back to fixing up the bombardier, all right. 
 We're behind schedule. 
 Oh, stop calling it the bombardier. 
 That name has poisoned the well with the locals. 
 We got to re-christen it something else. 
 May I propose "Moustache Pete's"? 
 No, you may not. 
 We need something simple. 
 A single, evocative word like, uh, "Solstice" or "Perception," or uh...  
 "Pretentious"? 
 Or we could call it something fun like "Moustache Pete's." 
 You can name it "out of business" if we don't get back on schedule. 
 Okay, okay, here we go. 
 "How to tape drywall, part 1 of 15." 
 Gee, you know who I bet's really good at drywall? 
 Casey. 
 Too bad somebody got on his bad side by fraternizing with one Detective Voight. 
 Hey, uh, listen, I need...  
 Hey, have I thanked you lately for opening your trap about Renee? 
 Because she's currently in a psych ward. 
 Kelly, she needs help. 
 How fun do you think this is for her? 
 Yeah. What did you want to talk about? 
 [Station alert] 
 Ambulance 61...  
 Tell you later. 
 Person down, Michigan and Upper Wacker. 
 Hey, Christie, I have a new proposal regarding mom. 
 Give me a call when you can. Bye. 
 Hey, Mouch. 
 You okay? 
 I came to you a while back, about Cruz... 
 Hell, there's something off about him, and you told me to shut up. 
 In so many words, I guess. 
 So, are you still in charge of our truck, or do I have to go around you and talk to Boden? 
 Watching you and Kelly move back in and out of that place is like watching a ping-pong match. 
 I know, I get it. I just hope he understands. 
 I tried to get him to come inside a store, but he won't move. 
 Hey, it's too cold for you to be out here, hon. 
 What's your name? 
 Mick. 
 Mick, can you stand up? 
 You think you can walk over to that ambulance? 
 Come on, Mick. 
 Oh, yeah. We got you. 
 Whoa, 70 over 50. 
 What are you on? 
 [Grunts] 
 Okay, fine. 
 It looks like you might be suffering from exposure, so we're going to get you to the hospital, all right? 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 It's nice and warm at the hospital, Mick. 
 You'll like it. Lots of pretty nurses. 
 Prettier than you two? 
 Come on, be realistic. 
 Hey. 
 Don't worry about Severide. 
 He'll totally understand why you need to move out. 
 I know, it's just... after all the drama, it just sucks having a lawyer make decisions about your living situation. 
 Okay, Mick, just a little pinch. 
 [Grunts] 
 Ahh! 
 We'll keep trying to convince him to consent to a blood draw, but we can't force him to. 
 And unless he does, we can only guess at what transmittable diseases he's carrying. 
 And judging from this cocktail of antivirals, you must think this guy's a walking petri dish. 
 Hep-B's always a big risk. Also Hep-C. 
 The interferon therapy should protect you against those, but given the tracks on his arms and symptoms, I think we need to treat you as though you've been exposed to HIV. 
 How soon can we test for HIV? 
 Not for three months after exposure. 
 Here's the first one. 
 Hey, you're going to be fine. 
 The statistics are way in your favor. 
 I mean, it's like Russian roulette. 
 Large bore needle filled with this guy's blood. 
 If he has the hiccups, I'm going to catch 'em. 
 Hey, Lieutenant, I was hoping a ask you a question. 
 Um, I was looking at the list of upcoming classes at the academy, and I'm...  
 I'm trying to figure out which ones to take to, if possible, make a move to Squad? 
 Let me eat my corn flakes first. 
 Yeah. Yeah, sure. 
 We can finish the exposure paperwork later. 
 Don't worry, Shay, you're getting the best care available. 
 Thanks, Chief. 
 What's wrong with her? 
 Needle stick. 
 Aw. 
 Was he sick? 
 Yellow, track marks, and he didn't agree to a blood panel. 
 You okay? 
 I just want this shift to end. 
 Casey hates me, now my partner gets stuck. 
 Casey? 
 Yeah, forget it. It's fine. 
 Screw him. 
 He doesn't understand you, it's his problem. 
 Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Mills. 
 Even if it's just Hep-C, it's, you know, 80% of infections are chronic, and, um, I'd be on disability for months, and if Daniel's lawyer finds out...  
 You're getting ahead of yourself. 
 Wait for the test to come back. 
 Yeah. 
 Um... the lawyer said that living with you isn't normal enough. 
 So I have to move out. I'm sorry. 
 You do whatever it takes to keep you, Clarice, and that baby together. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Mouch. 
 How's the arm? 
 Burned but fine. 
 Hey, man, I wanted to thank you again. 
 It's in the job description, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, also, I think I owe you an apology. 
 I realize you may not understand why I went to Voight. 
 I didn't have another choice, and it made all the difference in Antonio's case. 
 He threatened me and my fiancée. 
 He saved my brother, Casey. [Knock on door] 
 Cruz is back, in case you're interested. 
 I screwed up, Lieutenant. 
 It won't happen again, believe me. 
 I tried that once already. 
 When you told me you could live with your sins, that turned out to be a lie. 
 Lieutenant, you got to believe...  
 This is not a conversation! 
 If you've come to hate yourself, if you've decided that you don't deserve to live, well, that's your problem. 
 Do you wnana stand at the ceremony where we pin Mouch's badge next to Darden's because he burned to death trying to save someone who's already dead inside? 
 If your badge isn't on Boden's desk by next shift, I'll go to the police about Flaco. 
 It'll mean the end of my career too. 
 But, hey, I'll pound nails for a living. 
 What I can't do is stand by and watch you endanger one more of my men. 
 The kitchen's just being redone. 
 New cabinets, new appliances, laundry hookups are right over there. 
 Okay. 
 Um, school-wise, I know Wesley's young, but...  
 Oh, it's never too early to think about that. 
 We're in the very desirable bell elementary school district. 
 But I have to be honest with you. 
 I've got a lot of people interested in this unit. 
 Okay, can you just give us, like, a second? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 So the, uh, the lawyer says that Daniel's attorneys could find out about the needle stick during discovery. 
 Look, Daniel's lawyer can say whatever he wants. 
 What that judge is going to see is a family ready to provide Wesley with a warm and loving home... in a very desirable school district. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We'll take it. 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Scoffs] 
 What, you expected a straitjacket? 
 Why are you here exactly? 
 Because your brother asked me to come. 
 Poor Eric. 
 He thinks he's finally cracked the puzzle that is Renee. 
 All this nonsense about me sleeping with Dean. 
 I'm not here to argue about that. 
 Oh, right, because as my life turned to ashes, you just coasted on and forgot all about me. 
 You don't know anything about my life. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I know that Kelly Severide is doing just fine. 
 We're done. Take me back. 
 Open the door. 
 Renee. 
 
 
 
 [Buzzer] 
 Dawson, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing, huh? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Call Casey. 
 [Sighs] 
 What the hell? 
 [Metal clangs] 
 Whoa. 
 Stephanides didn't say anything about a safe. 
 What do you think's inside? 
 Nothing good. 
 My luck don't run that way. 
 Well, let's open it and find out. 
 Worst-case scenario, it's empty. 
 What if it contains a decomposed head of some gangster that went missing in the '20s? 
 Next thing you know, this bar gets wrapped in crime scene tape, and we can't get back in here. 
 If there's a mobster's head in there, Moustache Pete's going to be famous. 
 We're not calling it Moustache Pete's. 
 Yes, we are. 
 Forget it. 
 That safe is bad news. 
 Look out. 
 Hey, Herrmann! 
 Each week my shift moves up a day. 
 Tuesday and Friday this week, Monday and Thursday next week. 
 I've drawn up a list of house rules that mom would have to agree to. 
 Curfews, when she can have visitors. 
 You can add whatever you want to the list. 
 Matt, no. 
 Christie, I need you. 
 Please, at least on the days I'm on shift. 
 Will I have to learn how to lie to her parole officer too? 
 Mom. 
 Christie. 
 You look wonderful. 
 Wow, you realize this is the first time we've all been together as a family in, like, 15 years? 
 Yeah. 
 I guess the real purpose of this meeting is to discuss the mom problem. 
 Okay, fine. 
 I'll talk to Jim. 
 Okay. 
 Now let's eat. 
 The chicken sandwich is great, by the way. 
 I'm a vegan. 
 Since when? 
 [Scoffs] Going on ten years, Matt. 
 I did not know that. 
 I... wow. 
 Is that like a vegetarian, or is it the eggs thing? 
 You can't eat anything? 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 What? 
 Do I seriously have to explain this to you? 
 What? No, that's fine. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey, did you get my message? 
 Yeah. What did she say? 
 Nothing that matters. She's angry. 
 At me? 
 At me. At... at... at everything. 
 Look, I'm sorry, but all this was against my better judgment, and now she's spinning out, so...  
 No, I get it. I get it. 
 Thanks, Kelly. 
 This is, uh, it's my last shift at 51. 
 I'm glad we got the chance to work together. 
 Is Cruz going to grace us with his presence today? 
 I don't know. 
 You talk to him? 
 I did. 
 How'd that talk go? 
 Don't worry about it, Mouch. 
 I talked to him. 
 That's all you need to know. 
 "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
 Produce good fruit as evidence of your repentance. 
 Even now, the ax lies at the root of the trees. 
 Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 
 I am baptizing you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is mightier than I. 
 I am not worthy to carry his sandals. 
 He will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire. 
 And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'we have Abraham as our father.'" look, mom, a fireman. 
 And raise up children to Abraham with these stones. 
 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. 
 John tried to prevent him, saying, 'I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?' 
 Jesus said to him... " 
 [Continues speaking in background] 
 I read the whole thing from front to back. 
 There's no codicil in this deed about any safe. 
 We bought the bar, lockstock, and barrel. 
 That means the safe rightly belongs to you, me and Otis. 
 Along with whatever's inside.  
 Whether it's an old stamp collection or bearer bonds or, gold doubloons. 
 You're outvoted Herrmann, two to one. 
 We didn't buy that bar hoping to find buried treasure. 
 We bought it as an honest investment. 
 And for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm onto something good and real. 
 Now whatever is in that safe, somebody put it in there and locked it away for a reason. 
 Why don't we leave it alone and get on with our plan? 
 Yeah, we're gonna open the safe. 
 Seconded. 
 [Station alert] 
 Truck 81, Ambulance 61, Battalion 25, bomb squad assist. 
 Wrightwood and Jesse. 
 CPC be advised, divert all traffic. 
 Bomb disposal unit on site in Lincoln Square. 
 So what exactly is our role in a bomb squad assist? 
 Nothing. 
 Not unless the bomb tech snips the wrong wire. 
 What's the story, Chief? 
 A tenant committed suicide in his car around back, shot himself in the head. 
 But the police are suspect because the deceased was turned down four times by the C.P.D., and there is a gasoline smell coming from the inside. 
 Zoom in. 
 Our mast camera confirmed the place is wired. 
 We should cut our way in. 
 We have access to the apartment above? 
 That'll do it. 
 Great, we'll get out of your way. 
 Whoa. 
 There's a woman down there. 
 The neighbors say it's his ex-wife. 
 My guy will go in and see if it's secure and your guys can bring her out. 
 Severide, you sure you want to do this? 
 We're here, right? 
 Gonna need a jump bag, though. 
 Copy that. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 Carpet's wet. Gasoline. 
 She's been stabbed. Come on down. 
 Dawson, Shay, she's got a steak knife stuck in her abdomen. 
 Pulse? 
 Weak. 
 Hey, can you get us out that door? 
 There's quick, and there's safe. 
 Which do you want? 
 I wanna save this woman's life. 
 Huh. 
 "Huh"? What "huh"? 
 A small incendiary device set to spark the gasoline. 
 This'll take a few minutes to disarm. 
 She doesn't have a few minutes. 
 I got two more wires splitting here. 
 It's wired here too. 
 Headed...  
 Here we go. 
 I got at least 5 pounds of mixed ammonium nitrate. 
 Well, that plus the gasoline is a fertilizer bomb. 
 Hey, Chief, is everyone back? 
 You just get yourself down here, Kelly. 
 How's she doing, Severide? 
 Weaker. 
 How much blood's on the floor? 
 Uh, it's not that much. 
 Then she's bleeding internally. You gotta move. 
 Pack that knife, so it doesn't shift when you move her. 
 Where the hell's that jump bag? 
 Whaley's here. 
 Use all the gauze and tape he's got to keep it secure. 
 Someone's always got it worse. 
 Ain't that right. 
 Packing around the knife. 
 Hey, we need that door open now. 
 Attempting to disarm the door. 
 Kelly. 
 Kelly. 
 We're good. Door's open. 
 Woman's coming out. 
 Who says engine only knows how to put out a fire? 
 Okay. 
 I'll talk to Boden. 
 [Sighs] What happened, Joe? 
 I kicked in that door, convinced Leon was in there. 
 I even knew I was too late. 
 But it wasn't Leon, it was Flaco. 
 Dead. 
 It was Flaco, and you were too late. 
 All I could think was, if I pull him out of those flames, I might as well throw Leon back in. 
 Ah, you don't know that. 
 I thought that God was just handing me the answer to my problems. 
 But now I know it was the devil. 
 I thought I could run from him. 
 And then I almost killed you. 
 I could have killed Otis or Herrmann or Casey, all because I'm weak. 
 [Sobs] 
 But now I know I'm the one that has to suffer, not you. 
 Joe, I forgive you. 
 [Sobbing] It's not right for me to bring my sins into this house and have my brothers sacrifice for what I did. 
 Joe! 
 Listen to me. 
 I forgive you. 
 [Sobs] 
 What can I do for you, Casey? 
 Lieutenant, can I have a minute? 
 Now's not a good time, Mouch. 
 Yes, it is. 
 You don't have to do this to him. 
 There's more to it than you know, Mouch. 
 He told me everything. 
 Now I don't know if he was waiting for God or Flaco's ghost or just somebody to say it, but he needed to know what he did was okay. 
 He screwed up. 
 He knows it. 
 But he was taking care of his family. 
 How far would you go for the ones you love? 
 How far have you gone? 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Yes, this is Leslie Shay. 
 He consented to a blood draw. 
 That's good, isn't it? 
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 He's clean, he tested negative for everything. 
 Oh...  
 [Chatter, giggling] 
 [Buzzer] 
 Good luck, Renee. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 For real? 
 Come get in the car. 
 There's something we need to see. 
 Go to hell. 
 You're full of it, you know that? 
 I am, huh? 
 Is that going to get me into your car? 
 Ignore everything that's real, go ahead. 
 Whatever. 
 Your brother was a hero today. 
 That is so low. 
 You stopped, didn't you? 
 30 minutes. 
 Then I take you anywhere you want to go. 
 [Sighs] It's just a box. 
 We never should have opened this. 
 Mom's just getting her things. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks for agreeing to this, Christie. 
 I really think it'll work. 
 Yeah, well, tomorrow morning at 8:01, she's all yours again. 
 Understood. 
 Friend of yours? 
 No. 
 That's Cheyenne. 
 Your old cellmate? 
 Yeah. 
 You two gave me back my freedom, but I don't want to be your problem anymore. 
 So I'm going to go stay with Cheyenne until I figure out what's next. 
 Mom, I don't think your P.O. is going...  
 Aw, I'll sort things out with Kendrick. 
 But I'm not going to be the wedge that drives you two apart anymore. 
 Oh, be a brother and sister again, okay? 
 You know, be there for each other. 
 Hey, how's it going? 
 Hey. Good. 
 Are we gonna sign a lease or not? 
 Yes, we are. 
 We definitely are. I'm sorry. 
 I can't get a hold of her. Um...  
 Oh, hey. Hey. 
 Did you get my message? 
 Yeah, that's, uh... great news. 
 We should sign the lease. 
 Uh, actually, would you mind giving us a second? 
 So, um...  
 Daniel offered to settle. 
 You know, split custody, I mean, if I move to New York with the baby. 
 Good, that's great. He blinked. 
 I took the deal. 
 What? 
 I just... I can't keep fighting him anymore, Les. 
 So I'm going to go to, uh, I'm going to go to New York. 
 No, Clarice. 
 Just stand up to him. We can win this. 
 I'm leaving tonight. 
 Shay...  
 Okay, I get it. 
 Come on. 
 It's quieter than I remember. 
 Please don't. 
 You're the one who said life never looked simpler than it did from right here. 
 That was crap. 
 Sometimes a view is just a view. 
 You know I never had anything close to a real relationship since you. 
 Really? 
 One girl I liked... really liked... but she left. 
 Or I let her leave. 
 I should have made it work, but sometimes it's easier just to let things fall apart. 
 I slept with Dean. 
 And now I see you, and I see my family. 
 And all I can see is what I lost. 
 Sometimes a view is just a view. 
 I've missed you. 
 I figured you hated me. 
 Oh, I did. 
 But not anymore. 
 [Engine revving]
