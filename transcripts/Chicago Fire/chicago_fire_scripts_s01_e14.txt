 Look out! 
 Previously on Chicago Fire... 
 They granted her parole. 
 There is one condition. 
 She has to move in with me. 
 Your place, ten minutes? 
 You're on. 
 I moved out. 
 What? 
 I told Daniel it wasn't gonna work. 
 Stay with me. 
 Recovery time could be four weeks instead of one year. 
 How come I didn't hear about this from my other surgeon? 
 It's experimental. 
 There are real risks here, including partial paralysis. 
 Disappoint everyone, but don't ever disappoint yourself. 
 You want to stay. 
 I can't go with you. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 Fold your arms behind your back... 
 Lifting your hands as high as they'll go. 
 And extend your arms forward. 
 Bend your elbows. 
 Press up against my hands. 
 Ah, thank you, Lieutenant. 
 Be right back. 
 [Toaster pops] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Well? 
 Full duty starting next shift! 
 [Gasps] 
 Bang! 
 Congratulations. 
 Pretty great, huh? 
 Yes, so great. 
 So happy for you. 
 Thank you.  
 Uh, hey, just a heads-up. 
 Eric Whaley's still there. 
 I got no beef with him. 
 How's the little one? 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, things are working out surprisingly well, considering Clarice is in the bathroom every ten minutes. 
 Severide is just... he's been totally cool since she moved in. 
 That's nice of him. 
 I mean, going up and down that spiral staircase with a baby, that's gonna suck. 
 But we should probably just leave him up there until he can walk down himself. 
 Um, I get that you're not a huge fan of Clarice, but we're a couple now, and I'm looking to basically be a stepmom. 
 So I need your support. 
 I'm sleeping with Mills. 
 I knew it! 
 You skank. 
 You kept it from me this whole time? 
 We agreed to keep it cool at work, so... 
 Does Casey know? 
 I don't think so. 
 Are you gonna tell him? 
 Do you think I should? 
 So you're over him? 
 Look, he zigged, I zagged. 
 Wasn't meant to be. 
 How's the s*x with Mills? 
 [Laughs] 
 I... I really like him, but it's not just a physical thing. 
 So let's just say he's very... detail-oriented. 
 But here's the problem. 
 He wants me to meet his mom, and I'm... I'm just not there yet. 
 What would you do? 
 Detail-oriented, huh? 
 [Station alert] 
 Ambulance 61, Truck 81, Squad 3. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 Driver fled the scene, but the passenger's pinned in there pretty good. 
 Door's jammed. We gotta cut her out. 
 Cruz, Otis, be prepared to assist squad with the pin in. 
 Are you hurt anywhere? 
 It's okay. 
 All right, sweetie, this is gonna go around your neck. 
 Can you tell us your name? 
 Ambrosia. 
 Oh, yeah? You working tonight? 
 A little. 
 And you were in my dreams. 
 [Sighs] 
 Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Come here, sweetie. 
 Hon, what did you take, sweetie? 
 Dawson, track marks. 
 Hey, Casey, how long till we get in there? 
 Five, maybe ten. Let's go! 
 Capp, be ready with the spreaders! 
 Hadley, we need the ram for a dash roll! 
 Got it! 
 [Metal whines] 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Okay, good. 
 Good? 
 All right, guys, watch her head. 
 Try to keep her steady. 
 Okay, good. 
 She's gonna arrest. 
 We gotta get her to the hospital now. 
 Let's get her up. Let go of the handle. 
 There you go. 
 I'm barely getting a pulse on her. 
 Fifth heroin O.D. this week. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Yeah, I asked Nancy what was on her bucket list once she got out. 
 She didn't get the reference. 
 You forget how closed off these prisoners are in terms of movies and popular culture and stuff. 
 Little things that we take for granted. 
 I'm just gonna give my congratulations, and then I'll let you two have your time together. 
 Sounds good. 
 [Sighs] 
 Can't believe this is really happening. 
 Rick. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll drop by once you get all settled. 
 Okay. 
 Ready? 
 All right, mom. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Is that him? 
 [All cheer and applaud] 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Welcome back. 
 Dawson. 
 Welcome back. About damn time. 
 Thanks, Chief. 
 And the neck's 100%, right? 
 Yeah, you wanna spar a few rounds after shift and find out? 
 No, I'm good. 
 Hey, this is, uh, Pouch. 
 The best damn thing to ever happen to this house. 
 Otis is transferring. 
 What? Come on. 
 It's like I'm being rocketed into space. 
 I'm going over to Morningside. 
 Kelly, your relief Lieutenant, Eric Whaley. 
 It's been a while. 
 Yeah. 
 You two know each other? 
 Yeah, I was, uh... engaged to Eric's sister. 
 Ah, got it. 
 The original Renee? 
 There was a second one? 
 Well, now that you're back, Whaley will move over to engine and relieve Jeff Turner for the next few shifts. 
 Okay, everyone, listen up. 
 Some of you may know Gabby's brother, Detective Antonio Dawson. 
 He has some information from C.P.D. for us. 
 Thanks, Chief. 
 Last few weeks, I've seen a spike in fatal overdoses. 
 M.E.'s office has connected at least a dozen deaths to a toxic batch of heroin. 
 Now be aware, it's laced with fentanyl and in most cases does not respond to the normal protocol of naloxone. 
 We are now approaching each overdose as a potential homicide. 
 [Station alert] 
 Truck 81, Squad 3, Engine 51, Ambulance 61. 
 Structure fire. 
 Gabby. 
 You're on the front lines on this thing. 
 Yeah, I'll look into it. 
 See, that's exactly what I don't want you to do. 
 The crew that's pushing this bad dope... they don't mess around. 
 As opposed to all those amicable drug dealers out there? 
 I'm serious. 
 Be careful. Don't go Gabby on this. 
 Hey, you look like hell. 
 Good morning to you too. 
 [Sirens blaring] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Looks like the fire's in the back, probably where the kitchen is. 
 Truck, get inside, open up the windows and the exits. 
 Give me a primary search. 
 Engine, get an attack line in the front. 
 Herrmann, Mills, open up the back. 
 Otis, secure the utilities. 
 Mouch, Cruz... where's Cruz? 
 Cruz, put your mask on! 
 There's somebody in here! 
 All right, we'll find him! 
 Fire department! Is there anybody in here? 
 [Explosion] 
 Fire's in the exhaust system. 
 We gotta get that aerial up to the roof. 
 Herrmann, Mills, get that ladder set. 
 Just get me a line up there. 
 Severide, give me a progress report. 
 Primary search of the kitchen negative! 
 Let's cut a vent. 
 Hey, he's over here! 
 Okay, let's clear a path. 
 [Saw buzzing] 
 Hey! Grab the end. 
 All right, that's good! 
 We got you. 
 [Saw buzzes] 
 Keep feeding me line! 
 Good. Vent's open. 
 Send the water! 
 Push him all the way up. 
 Board-up crews. 
 Why do they always look like gangsters? 
 Because they are. 
 Do you have any idea what these contracts are worth? 
 Vultures. 
 Hey, it's not as bad as it looks, old-timer. 
 Kitchen ceiling is gonna need some patching up, but other than that, it's just a lot of smoke damage. 
 It's a sign to finally get my ass to Florida. 
 Wanna buy a bar? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 So you a fireman or a kamikaze pilot now? 
 Saved the old man, fire's out. That's all that matters. 
 It matters if you get yourself killed. 
 [Siren blares] 
 Eric. 
 Look, man, when the whole thing went down, you and I are weren't talking, obviously, and... 
 I never got a chance to apologize. 
 I really am sorry for what happened. 
 We used to be friends once, right? 
 I'm only here a couple more shifts. 
 So how is your neck? 
 100%. 
 You'd tell me if it wasn't, right? 
 Wouldn't be here if it wasn't. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Otis, Casey, my office. 
 Otis, your transfer just came through. 
 You report to Morningside next shift. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Um... so it's official? 
 Only if you want it to be. 
 Look, we know you made this decision based off of one shift there, but you have had a month to think about it. 
 We want to give you an opportunity to... 
 I'm ready to go, Chief. 
 Otis... we do a lot of ball-breaking in this house. 
 It's not that we don't appreciate you, but if anybody ever crossed the line... 
 It's not personal, Lieutenant. 
 Morningside's a smaller house. 
 I'll have a better chance of getting off elevators sooner, and they'll let me drive. 
 They'll be lucky to have you. 
 Thanks, Chief. 
 Good luck, Brian. 
 [Chuckles] Lieutenant. 
 [Knocks] 
 Whoa, what are you doing here? 
 I need to talk real quick. 
 [Sighs] 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Yeah. 
 This ought to be good. 
 If anyone calls you asking if we went to a movie last night, the answer is yes. 
 This heroin thing is starting to blow up a little bit, and I'm damn close to making some busts. 
 Okay. 
 The thing is, the guys over in narcotics, they get real territorial, and they don't want a guy from vice taking collars from them. 
 So I told a little white lie to my boss 'cause I wasn't where I was supposed to be last night, and I said that you and I... can you just say yes if anyone asks? 
 Why do I feel like I'm not getting the whole story? 
 Because you're not getting the whole story. 
 I'm working a case. 
 Will you cover for me, please? 
 Uh...  
 Of course you will. Thank you. 
 Hey, I just did a little recon on that bar owner. 
 You're not actually thinking of buying it? 
 Me alone? No. 
 But would I be willing to be a part of a consortium? 
 Maybe. 
 All right, first of all, that guy was as old as dirt. 
 Second of all, he did a face-plant off a ladder. 
 I doubt he even recollects making an offer to sell. 
 You heard him. 
 He wants to get his ass to Florida. 
 He's gonna sell that place. 
 It's in an up-and-coming neighborhood, he owns the property, and he's got the Brass ring... a liquor license. 
 There's the worm. 
 It's right there. 
 Who's gonna be the early bird? 
 Why not us? 
 I'm telling you, if this place hits the open market, some hipster douche bags are gonna swoop in and print money. 
 Hmm. 
 [All laugh] 
 No vision in this house. 
 None! 
 Zero. 
 [All laugh] 
 So, um, who was this new Renee? 
 I'm curious. 
 I apologized. 
 I offered to put it past us. 
 If that's not something that you're up for and you'd rather keep it frosty till you leave, I can do that too. 
 What are you apologizing for? 
 For dumping her two days before the wedding or for what happened after? 
 You're not in full possession of all the facts here, Eric. 
 Then enlighten me, Kelly. 
 That's what I thought. 
 You were a coward then, and you're a coward now. 
 Before this goes any further South, why don't you walk away? 
 Or what? 
 Excuse me? 
 Is Matthew Casey here? 
 Yeah, he's right this way. 
 How'd you get here? 
 I took the bus. 
 What's going on? 
 Just wanted to see where my son works. 
 This is where I work. 
 Well, are you embarrassed that I'm here? 
 No, of course not. 
 Well, then can I get a tour? 
 Yeah. Uh... 
 Um... 
 You saw the truck. 
 This is your truck? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 And, uh... 
 Oh, this is Peter, behind you, mom. 
 This is Peter Mills, our candidate. This is my mom. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Hi. 
 Oh. [Laughs] 
 You have got a great son. 
 That's very kind of you to say. 
 Oh. May I? 
 Oh, yes. Please help yourself. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, this is, uh, Gabriela Dawson. 
 Oh. 
 You... you were at my hearing? 
 Yes, that's right. 
 Oh, thank you so much. 
 That just... that meant the world to me, and I'm sure it did to Matthew as well. 
 Oh, ma'am, it was... it was my pleasure, and, uh... congratulations for... well, you know, getting out of... you know. 
 Prison. 
 Yeah. Yep, prison. 
 The big house. The big house... is... they even call it the big house anymore? 
 Probably not, I'm guessing. 
 Ohh. 
 She's adorable! 
 She's an absolute joy. 
 Forget Hallie, this is the kind of woman I've always envisioned you being with. 
 [Nervous laugh] 
 You given any more thought to dinner on Sunday? 
 I g... I just gotta tell my mom if you're coming. 
 Yeah, sorry. Sorry. 
 Dispatch has been pounding us with runs. 
 47's out of service, so we've just been slammed. 
 And, um, my cousin might actually be staying with me that week. 
 Are you nervous about dinner? 
 Not at all. You? 
 I mean, I'm the one who extended the invitation, so... 
 Yeah. Right. 
 Of course. No, I just, uh... 
 Am I getting in the way of you and Casey? 
 Absolutely not. 
 He's just a friend. I'm only seeing you. 
 I only wanna see you. 
 I just wanna make sure we're not moving too quickly or anything. 
 [Door slams] 
 Text me. Let me know. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Why don't you tell Whaley what happened? 
 [Sighs] What difference would it make? 
 He'd get off your ass, for one. 
 Look, if I was gonna say anything, I would have said something then. 
 Maybe he needs to know. 
 You think I'm in a big hurry to revisit the whole thing? 
 It's over. It's done. 
 He can say what he wants. I don't care. 
 Lieutenant, I gotta talk to you about Cruz. 
 What about him? 
 He's been acting a little off. 
 You notice that as well? 
 I figured it was a private matter. 
 Yeah, and I keep asking him to tell me what it is, but he won't open up. 
 Then stop asking him about it, Mouch. 
 
 
 
 [Station alert] 
 Ambulance 61. Person in distress. 
 Wallingford Motel. 
 [Siren blares] 
 So why are you guys keeping it on the sly? 
 It started out being what I wanted, but then Boden called him on the carpet, gave him some vague B.S. about putting the time in to "master your craft." 
 And Mills really took it to heart. 
 I don't know, if I dug someone as much as you dig him, I wouldn't be able to hide it, especially working together 24 hours a day, side by side. 
 Are you trying to make me feel worse? 
 [Chuckles] Dawson, for someone who's such a mad woman on the job, you are so timid in your personal life. 
 I mean, take some risks, have some fun. 
 You know what, thank you. 
 Excellent point, which you have made before, granted. 
 But I'm at a place in my life where I could really embrace the message. 
 I'm texting him right now. 
 Nice. 
 When's Clarice due? 
 Ugh, two weeks. Getting butterflies. 
 Oh, plenty of time. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 I heard screaming, but we never have any trouble around here. 
 Nothing. 
 I hate hotels. 
 Paramedics. 
 Don't tell my wife. 
 She took a hot shot. 
 Hey, honey? 
 Can you hear me? 
 Agonal respiration. 
 She's barely breathing. 
 Fight for us, girl. Come on. 
 You get your rocks off watching girls shoot up? 
 I never force them to do anything. 
 That was completely their thing. 
 "Their"? 
 There's another girl in here. 
 61 to main. 
 We need another ambulance and C.P.D. for a D.O.A. 
 Oh, God. 
 Can't get a line in. 
 Her veins collapsed. 
 I'm gonna go sub-lingual. 
 If this is the same bad dope, we don't have time for anything else. 
 I can't get her jaw open. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 [Silently] Come on. 
 [Gasps] 
 Hey. 
 What's happening? 
 You're okay. You're all right. 
 My name's Gabby. This is Leslie. 
 We're gonna get you to the hospital, all right? 
 Come on, let's get her in the chair. 
 Yeah. 
 Man, this stuff is gonna wipe out half the city. 
 Hey. Antonio. 
 Hey, Victoria. It's me. 
 What the hell happened? 
 It wasn't enough for you to hit this junk on your own? 
 You had to bring Natalie back into it? 
 She was clean! 
 I told you to stay away from her! 
 Antonio. 
 What's the problem? 
 Hey! 
 What the hell's going on? 
 There's this new crew out of New York that's been pushing their way into prostitution, looking for a cut of everyone's action. 
 Those who don't pay, their girls are getting hit with bad dope. 
 That's what's going on. 
 That's who I'm trying to bring down. 
 And I'm trying to get close to these animals, but it's difficult when my informants keep getting spiked left and right! 
 Okay. All right. 
 I get it, okay? 
 But I've never seen you like this before. 
 You're starting to worry me a little bit. 
 You're keeping secrets from your boss. 
 You're asking me to lie to mine. 
 It's different being a cop than a paramedic, Gabby. 
 There's a little more to it. 
 I would have put on a pot of coffee if I'd known you were coming. 
 If you knew I was coming, this wouldn't be an unannounced visit. 
 Yeah, those... those are personal letters. 
 As long as you're on parole, nothing in here is personal. 
 Yes, we understand, Officer. 
 Thank you. 
 Pretty straightforward, Nancy. 
 You're to be in this house from 9:00 P.M. to 9:00 A.M. every day. 
 You're not to consume alcohol or illegal drugs. 
 You are not to associate with any known criminals. 
 And we have an appointment on the 23rd in my office. 
 It's yours to screw up. 
 Well, then you have nothing to worry about. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Be a second. 
 Hey. 
 Can I call you right back? 
 Okay. 
 Rick? 
 Uh, no, I... I called that off. 
 Why? He... he seemed nice. 
 He was too nice. 
 So then who was that on the phone? 
 Uh, a friend. 
 Another pen pal? 
 Wow, you make it sound so tawdry, but, yeah. 
 He was someone kind enough to visit me in prison. 
 [Door shuts] 
 Morningside, huh? 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I've heard all the speeches, so, you know, thanks all the same, but you can save it. 
 What speeches? 
 "It's a dead house." 
 "You're throwing your career away." 
 "All you're gonna do is sell T-shirts." 
 Oh, I don't have any speeches. 
 I made a hundred bucks off this. 
 What? 
 Wh... what do you mean? 
 Oh. 
 When you first started, there was a little side action on if you had what it took to make it at 51. 
 I took the under, so to speak. 
 Well, who else bet against me? 
 It was a confidential pool. 
 Hmm. 
 Hey, you made it four years, man. 
 I'll give you that much. 
 Okay. I get it. 
 It's like a reverse psychology ploy to get me fired up and make me stay, right? 
 Son of a... 
 Hey. You got a minute? 
 [Clears throat] 
 I, uh... was a little confused by your text last night. 
 Text? 
 Yeah. 
 "You're right, I think it's time to meet your mom, and I'm really looking forward to it." 
 If I'm not mistaken, you met her. 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 No, I sent that before she got there. 
 That's so weird 'cause I... 
 [clears throat] that was... that was for somebody else. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Ah. 
 That explains it. 
 All right. 
 Hey, can I have everybody in the briefing room? 
 Moment of your time? 
 Thanks. 
 [Sighs] 
 As you can see from the prospectus, the offer on the table fluctuates based upon how many of us get on board with the actual offer. 
 Now, it also entails that the owner be carrying the loan himself. 
 70,000? 
 He'll never take it. 
 Guys, nothing ventured, nothing gained. 
 If he turns us down, he turns us down. 
 I'm just looking for the 7k in cash to get the 10% down. 
 Who's in? 
 I'm in. 
 Otis, buddy. 
 All right, we'll keep you apprised while you're over at Morningwood. 
 Oh, no, no. 
 I'm actually happy to announce to all you people who bet that I wouldn't make it here that I've withdrawn my transfer request. 
 Get out of here with that. 
 No one was betting against you. 
 What? 
 All right, look. Anyone else? 
 Look, it's a neighborhood bar in Bucktown. 
 We're looking to bring in the new families that have moved in and have thus far been neglected. 
 You're gonna pass up a deal like this? 
 Mouch? 
 Too volatile. 
 All right, Mouch is out. 
 He thinks the bar is built on a volcano. 
 Anybody else? 
 I'm just looking for one more to put in 2,300, and we're whole. 
 I'm in. 
 Dawson. 
 I'm making an investment. 
 I gotta make money to pay for med school, so... 
 Are you crazy? 
 What? 
 Plus it sounds like fun. 
 So then just tell me what happened! 
 We've already been through this! 
 You haven't told me a damn thing! 
 How is this your business? 
 How is this my business? 
 Yes! How is it your business? 
 It wasn't just Renee's life you screwed up! 
 It was our whole family! 
 Look! 
 I moved on with my life, okay? 
 Maybe you should too. 
 Tell me, how do you move on from seeing your sister's car wrapped around a telephone pole, huh? 
 Come on. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah, your boy here, the great Kelly Severide, after he dumps my sister, she goes out drinking, ends up in a coma for three months. 
 Where was Kelly? 
 Never heard from him. 
 Your sister hooked up with an ex-boyfriend before the wedding. 
 Shay. 
 No, he needs to know this. 
 Kelly found out about it, so he called off the wedding. 
 And he didn't say anything because your entire family was in the hospital after Renee hit that pole. 
 He didn't wanna dump more grief on you guys. 
 So he took the hit. 
 That's what happened, all right? 
 So lay off. 
 Shay. 
 Hospital just called. 
 Clarice's water just broke. 
 Thanks. 
 Anything else needs to be said beyond what's already been screamed or yelled? 
 No, Chief. 
 Nope. 
 You gonna make it another three shifts? 
 Do I need to find you a new home? 
 I like to fulfill my obligations. 
 So, yeah. 
 I'd like to stay till I'm done. 
 You got a problem with that, Kelly? 
 I don't. 
 Eric, I have been on vacation for the past few weeks, so you probably haven't got a chance to know how I operate. 
 I say things once. 
 Copy that. 
 Both of you, back to work. 
 Part of my frustration, I guess, is that I don't know where she is half the time. 
 She doesn't really talk to the family anymore. 
 Deal. 
 Ah, that's amazing. 
 Yes. 
 Thank you so much. 
 You guys saved my life. 
 If you want the place, it's yours. 
 Wow. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Just got two favors. 
 Name it. 
 Don't turn this place into some kind of hipster joint that caters to all these new arrivals. 
 Are you kidding me? Hell, no. 
 Just keep the charm. 
 You have our word that we're gonna bend over backwards to try to accommodate that. 
 Oh, you said you had a second favor? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I promised someone else a little taste, if you know what I mean. 
 Strictly off the books, depending on what he brings to the table. 
 But it's your call as to what size that piece will be. 
 Uh, we're not... we're not really looking for any more partners. 
 Relax, sweetheart, he's a silent partner. 
 Just take care of him. 
 Sorry I'm late, Mr. Stephanides. 
 No problem, Arthur. Come on in. 
 Arthur's crew boarded the place up after the fire. 
 Free of charge. 
 You're gonna get along just great. 
 [Sports announcer in background] 
 Uh, what are you doing? 
 I'm going out. 
 To do what? 
 Have dinner. [Car horn beeps] 
 With this pen pal guy? 
 Yes, indeedy. 
 Your parole officer said you... 
 I'll be back before my curfew. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I'm worried about it, mom. 
 You're not even 24 hours into being... 
 I am not going out to sell crack! 
 I thought you invited me into your home so I could live my life, but if your intention was to parent me or... or... or somehow get back at me for what happened, then you shouldn't have bothered. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up! 
 Nobody talks to me like that, all right? 
 Especially in my own house. 
 I'm going to have dinner, Matthew. 
 I'll be back before my curfew. 
 I hope you have a wonderful night. 
 [Line trilling] 
 [Beeping] 
 The number you have reached is no longer in service. 
 Hey. 
 It's a boy. 
 All right! 
 [Laughs] Come on. 
 Oh, God, he's healthy, beautiful, adorable cheeks. 
 He can't wait to meet you. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 [Laughs] 
 Sorry about that back at the firehouse. 
 No, you're not. 
 Hey. 
 [Laughs] 
 That's amazing. 
 Daniel. 
 Do you wanna hold him? 
 [Baby cries] 
 [Shushes] 
 Look, I don't know what your plans are, but, um, of course I'd love for you to be a part of our lives as much as you can. 
 Wow. 
 Father of the year right there. 
 Clarice Carthage and Leslie Shay? 
 Yes. 
 You've been served in the case of Daniel Schwartz versus Clarice Carthage. 
 What is it? 
 Petition for full custody. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Phone vibrates] 
 It's okay. 
 Oh, my God. You're not answering. 
 I hope that's good news. 
 Um, I'm in the parking lot. I'm sorry I'm late. 
 Be there in a sec. 
 Hey, what are you doing here? 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Antonio, what's wrong? 
 The girl you brought in, the O.D. 
 Yeah, Victoria. 
 She bolted. 
 Nobody's seen her for at least an hour. 
 All right, well, what's... what's up? 
 The D.O.A. was my informant for years, and I was gonna start over with Victoria, and now she's gone. 
 Antonio, you need some rest, okay? 
 You're barely making any sense. 
 Let me take you home. 
 I gotta go. 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Car peels out] 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh, God! Antonio! 
 Antonio! 
 [Whimpers] Antonio! Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. Come on. 
 [Coughs] 
 Come on! Oh, God. 
 Hold on, you hear me? [Coughs] 
 Hold on. 
 Somebody help! 
 Hold on. I got you. 
 I got you. You're gonna be fine. 
 Help! 
 Somebody help me!
