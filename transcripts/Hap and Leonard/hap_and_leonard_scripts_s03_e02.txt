 Got so every time my mama found a dead chicken lyin' around, she'd take the belt to me. 
 She'd hear a pig squeal at night, and she'd come to my room and whup me. 
 A-A-A-And your point is? 
 My point is... 
 I'd put the old dick to anything that ain't nailed down, and if I'd do a chicken, I'd sure as hell do a colored gal. 
 And that ol' Florida Grange, she's a way lot better-lookin' than a chicken. 
 Must've been hard livin' with a... sister lookin' that fine.

 Of course I'm right. 
 That was a blast from the past to jingle your bells and warm you up fast. 
 Merry Christmas to one and all. 
 Here's your main man Sonny Knox comin' 'atcha all the way from the North Pole, home of the one, the only 96.6, your Blues Fix Radio. 
 We are one week away from saying goodbye to the '80s, and as we do every year, we are going to play the greatest blues songs of the century. 
 Tune in bright and early with me, your host, Sonny Knox.

 That's the big time. 
 Then these Bible-thumpin', shit-kickin' racist moose dicks will really miss me. 
 Sonny, we just need to find out what you know about Florida Grange. 
 Oh, she was here, day before last. 
 Almost did a deal with her and her client, Bobby Joe Soothe. 
 What, Soothe? 
 Any relation to L.C.? Grandson. 
 He came in here the other day lookin' like he took a dump and found gold in the bowl. 
 Said he had this long-lost recording of his granddaddy, the late, great L.C. Soothe. 
 Last song he recorded before he died. 
 Found it in the great aunt's attic. 
 Some say it's the greatest blues song ever. 
 Nobody even knew a recording existed until Bobby Joe walked in here the other day offerin' to sell it. 
 If it was the real thing, [EXHALES SHARPLY] worth a fortune. 
 Think it was the real deal? 
 In my humble but expert opinion, it was. 
 So what happened? 
 Nothin'. 
 Bobby Joe said he'd talk to his lawyer, this Miss Grange. 
 We arranged a meeting, I got the cash ready, then Bobby Joe dropped off the map. 
 Haven't seen her since they found the body. 
 Body? Body? 
 You guys didn't hear? 
 They found Bobby Joe hangin' off the Grovetown bridge two days ago. 
 Wait. He... He... He dead? 
 Deader than a dodo bird. 
 If I didn't know any better, I'd say that curse was real. 
 Curse? What... What curse? 
 Folks say whoever listens to that song is cursed. 
 But I listened to it. Look at me. 
 I don't believe in any of that crap. 
 [TELEPHONE RINGING] I believe in three things... music, business, and the great American dollar. 
 It's Sonny here. 96.6. Curses? Come on. Bullshit. 
 Leave a message. [ANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS, BEEPS] 
 MAN: Mr. Knox, this is the Grovetown Fire Department. 
 Call us as soon as you can. 
 We regret to inform you your house just burnt down.

 [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS]

 Somethin' ain't right, Hap. 
 Nope. It ain't. 
 Florida came down here to meet with a client, and he turns up dead? 
 And now she's gone? 
 Why didn't Old Swollen Nuts tell us that Bobby Joe was dead? 
 Mm. Playin' them Elvis cards close to the vest. 
 Maybe he has somethin' to do with it... ring in the new year with a little cracker-cop pastime. 
 What I'd like to know is what's a guy doin' with a recording worth that much money, and he ends up swingin' from a bridge?

 She say where she was goin'? I dunno. 
 Did she say where she was going?! 
 I woke up that morning... she was gone already. 
 I was b-bein' straight up with you fellas. 
 Aw, come on. All that talk about how much you love women got me to thinkin' about you. 
 I talk too much, I talk too much. 
 I always have. I... 
 It was just talk. It was just talk. 
 That's... That's how come I got no friends. 
 Or maybe I talk too much because I got no friends. 
 'Cause I don't know. 
 Maybe I get on people's nerves. 
 You get on Florida's nerves? 
 I ain't gonna lie. 
 Yeah, I thought about maybe makin' a play for her. 
 Woman like that, what man wouldn't? 
 But... 
 sort of puts a damper on the whole romance side of things, don't it? 
 [KNOCKS ON LEG] 
 Drop your pants, woman sees this... 
 Sort of thing you got to come around to slowly, and she was only staying the one night so... 
 Pbht! 
 You hear her mention a fella named Bobby Joe Soothe? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Fella that hung himself from the bridge? 
 [CHORTLES] No, she didn't mention him. 
 Hung himself? 
 That's what they're sayin'. 
 Who's sayin'? 
 The police are. 
 But they got a funny relationship with the truth sometimes.

 REYNOLDS: "They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow." 
 SNEED: Huh? 
 [SIGHS] Scripture. 
 My daddy was a preacher. 
 Was he now? [SIGHS] 
 Funny. 
 What? 
 Them folk, they care for their own, same as we do ours.

 Yeah. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 REYNOLDS: Make 'em almost seem human. 
 Doesn't it? 
 ♪♪ They're human enough to mourn, I guess. 
 Well, they say elephants mourn. 
 That don't make them human.

 You got this? 
 Yeah. I got it. 
 Good. I got better things to do than watch that sh1t get put in the hole.

 LEONARD: I mean, it'd make sense, her being on the Southside. 
 Tell you the truth, I'd prefer her with our own people. 
 How come nobody has heard from her? 
 Maybe Hanson ain't as honest as we'd like him to be. 
 Maybe Florida's not wantin' no one to know where she at 'cause a good reason. 
 So you believe Tim's theory? 
 I mean, Hanson's tough. 
 But he holdin' on hard. 
 I mean, just because he actin' sincere don't mean he ain't puttin' pressure on the girl to come back... wife or no wife. 
 Men be like that sometime. 
 Man, I had no idea you knew so much about heterosexual relationships. 
 [CHUCKLES] Just like the gay ones, just twisted. 
 What if... 
 What if he sent you here to do his dirty work? 
 Well, either way, I'm doin' the dirty work. 
 And either way, I want to make sure she's safe. 
 So tomorrow we go to the Southside. 
 Oh, correction... I'ma go to the Southside. 
 You gonna stay here and wait for Hanson. 
 Unh-unh. No, no, no, no. 
 We both go to the Southside, and we... we leave a note for Hanson. 
 I am not takin' your honky ass behind me. 
 Them folk gonna clam up for sure. 
 Hey, I took you to the white side. 
 Well, that's different. I'm handsome. 
 Look, look, you get to go in town and be white, do white people things... play golf. 
 Uh, you can get that Hall & Oates record you always wanted. 
 What if I find you hangin' from a bridge? 
 Look, just hope I find her and we can put this place behind us in our rearview. 
 I don't like splittin' up... especially in a place like this. 
 I love you, too, Hap. 
 But trust me on this. I'ma be all right. 
 Fine. Fine. 
 Just sit down, sit down. 
 Yeah. 
 What's that? 
 What? I got somethin' in my teeth? 
 Well, I'll be damned.
