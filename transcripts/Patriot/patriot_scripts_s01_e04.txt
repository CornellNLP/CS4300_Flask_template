 [fades] 
 John. 
 I can take that from you now. 
 Thank you. 
 You're staying here? 
 Yeah, you? 
 I'm in the William of Orange room. 
 I'm in Oscar, King of Sweden. 
 We could have met in the lobby. 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 Male voice : Thank you. The Cleric is indebted to you. 
 Leave your hotel tomorrow. 
 You'll transfer the bag to Al-Mashad on the 19th.

 You're buddy-buddy? 
 Well, listen. 
 I'll be throwing five plates of the Denon presentation your way. 
 So you'll be performing that... 
 You'll be performing that for Denon, for Lawrence, for all of us, at 3 P.M. Luxembourg time. 
 That's 17 hours from now. 
 That'll give your buddy a chance to see you do your thing. 
 I haven't prepared any plate work. 
 Well, good luck. 
 [zips] 
 Buddy. 
 What's with the gear? 
 Woman : The helmet helps reduce the swelling Steven will encounter at high elevations. 
 You excited about coming to Luxembourg? 
 Yeah. 
 Woman : Don't lose your helmet, Steven. 
 I won't. 
 Well, you did this morning. 
 Just for an hour. 
 Hey! Don't sass!

 John : Hey, sweetheart. Everything is cool. 
 Um, one good thing. 
 Um, I made a new friend at this job. 
 It's a guy named Dennis. 
 Boy : Somebody shot him. [imitates gunfire] 
 John : Hey, there's... 
 There's something I've been meaning to tell you, and it's kind of hard to say.

 [device beeps] 
 What are you worried about, hon? 
 He's not okay. 
 I wanna go and see him. 
 Look, I know he's in Milwaukee. 
 I could be three in three hours. 
 And how do you know this? 
 It's just... A dumb pen. 
 You brought it. 
 Hmm. 
 There's a woman in Europe. 
 She's investigating this thing... this incident that John's connected to. 
 She's gotten footing. 
 Nothing meaningful, but footing. 
 And, Alice, she cannot connect the person that John's positioned as right now to John Tavner. 
 And she cannot connect him to you. 
 It means his freedom. 
 Something happened, and it means his freedom. 
 He called you, I know, from this place on this night. 
 You've already broken the rules. 
 No, I didn't, Tom. 
 But John did. 
 For the first time. 
 [sighs] 
 We have this principle we use when we're trying to locate someone who doesn't want to be discovered. 
 You are what you can't stop doing. 
 What that means... 
 If we discover what someone is passionate about, then that person and that thing will intersect. 
 Passion involves compulsion. 
 And people... All people have compulsions that draw them away from their safety and their best interests. 
 People and what they love don't always intersect. 
 People and their compulsions do. 
 And John, well, he's compelled toward you. 
 He's crazy about you. 
 And if this woman learns that and follows you to your impending point of intersection, well, then that's the end of all of it, honey. 
 So, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you two to intersect. 
 [soft sigh] 
 I wanna look out for him. 
 Because... 
 Why? 
 Because I don't think anyone's looking out for him, Dad. 
 I am. 
 Oh... 
 I'll go to him now. 
 Okay, hon? 
 I'll go right now. 
 Don't let go. 
 I got you. 
 Are you holding on? 
 Yes. 
 Dad? 
 I'm here. 
 [crash] 
 [indistinct PA ananouncement] 
 It's one man. 
 And you say that he... 
 Took off. 
 With your attaché materials? 
 Yes. 
 Which are? 
 Maps. 
 Of? 
 Lands. 
 Which? 
 [exhales] 
 I don't know that I'm allowed to say. 
 You are. 
 Hot spots. 
 Uh, Madagascar. 
 Um, El Dorado. 
 That's a city of lore. 
 What? 
 It doesn't exist. 
 Yeah. Right. 
 I... I meant Spain. 
 I had so many maps in there... 
 Anyway, it was akin to... 
 Do you have purse snatchings here? 
 Seldom. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, it was like that. 
 Akin to. 
 They just ran by, snatched my bag. 
 That was that. 
 Did you fight? 
 [chuckles] 
 I fought like hell. 
 I asked to interview you because your attack happened in the radius of a murder on the same evening of the murder within the same hour. 
 Wow. 
 I'm afraid I told you everything I can about that evening. 
 [Woman speaking French on P.A.] 
 I can't believe all that money fit in this pillow. 
 I may have seemed a little nervous back there at TSA. 
 It's cool. 
 I just want you to know that fainting isn't a sign of weakness. 
 It's just a sign that your bod doesn't have the support system to cross the finish line. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 You have more than piping on your mind. 
 Stressed? 
 So? 
 Can I show you something? 
 Something that helps me? 
 Let me see your Blackberry. 
 The day planning feature. Let's take a look. 
 What's the most important thing you have to accomplish today? 
 Do you remember there was a sum of money? 
 I handed it off, and we can't find the guy now. 
 So... what? 
 So I have to find him... before he uses the money to... 
 I need to find him today. 
 Okay, what's the second most important thing? 
 Probably Leslie's f*ckin' plate thing. 
 Westphalia Odeon at the King Gerald hotel. 
 What? 
 The conference is at the Westphalia Odeon. 
 It's... It's wondrous. 
 It's... It's like a hundred Harbaughs. 
 Great. 
 f*ck. 
 Hey, let's tackle it. 
 What's the first task today? 
 First task up? 
 [Blackberry chimes] 
 Well, I have to capture a guy. 
 Tape him up. Yeah. 
 Then put him in this bag. 
 How long does that take typically? 
 [whispers] Taping a man? 
 I don't know. I've never done it before. 
 Probably a lot. 
 It's probably hard. 
 You wanna put, like... 
 ...four minutes? 
 Uh, whatever. 
 Well, I mean, it's not whatever. 
 John, we're making a schedule. 
 I'm just gonna put four minutes. 
 Hey, don't put "capture a guy." 
 Well, what should I put? 
 I don't know. 
 Put "CG." 
 Okay. 
 Good code. 
 For your ringtone, I'm just gonna pick a random reminder from my cloud, okay? 
 What do you have for the rest of the day? 
 A lot. 
 Yeah. Good. 
 Yeah, that's why we're doing this, so you can do a lot.

 Tom : Then what? 
 John : And then I'll meet these brothers sometime that day, and I'll get them to take the money I'm bringing over. 
 If I have the little brother, right? 
 There's a threat. If there's no threat, they'll just keep asking for the red bag, or they'll go to the detective and f*ck everything up. 
 Tom : All right. Don't get defensive. 
 It's just a little weird, putting a guy in a bag. 
 John : You know... 
 Tom : What? 
 John : That's not a fair technique in an argument to call someone defensive. 
 Tom : It's a great technique, because they can't argue with you after that. 
 They have to stop arguing or they'll sound defensive. 
 Just make sure you get him to Edward that morning, because you have to get to the bagman straight away. 
 Hey, man. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, I'm glad to see you. 
 Yeah. 
 I gotta get this bag off.

 Tom : Now, I'm sure the bagman checked out of the King Gerald. 
 He knows you'll be looking for him. 
 But you're gonna find him that morning. 
 John : How? 
 Tom : How would someone find you? 
 John : Well, if someone really knew me, I post sometimes on the same forum, I guess. 
 Neo-traditional music forum. 
 I'm in a fight with this guy, Greg12, about whether Willie Nelson f*cked up Pancho and Lefty. 
 Tom : Don't pick a fight with Willie. 
 John : I'm not. 
 Tom : Who doesn't love Willie? 
 John : No one. I do. 
 I'm not in a fight with Willie Nelson. 
 I'm in a fight with Greg12, because I like the original. 
 Someone could catch me doing that, fighting on that website, and maybe find me that way, if they knew me. 
 Tom : Well, stop doing that. 
 John : Yeah. I always plan to... then I don't. 
 I want to get the final word in with Greg12. 
 Tom : Greg12 is probably 12. 
 You want to jeopardize everything because of fight with a 12 year old? 
 John : Yeah, I see your... Yeah. 
 Tom : So there's a noonday game. 
 John : The Jaywick thing? 
 Tom : He grew up in South Essex. 
 It's their rivalry game today. 
 Hemsby Palace. 
 If you're from that city... 
 You know how people say "the big game"? 
 It's that kind of game. 
 John : You think he's going to leave $11 million on its own? 
 And go to a bar and watch soccer? 
 Tom : Yes. 
 John : Why? 
 Tom : The same reason you're fighting with a 12 year old, I'd say. 
 It's only being telecast at the one pub there.

 Only us. Ready? 
 We fit Donnely nut spacing grip grids and splay-flexed brace columns against beam-fastened derrick husk nuts and girdle plate Jerries, while plate flex tandems press task apparati of 10 vertpin-plated pan traps at every maiden clamp plate packet. 
 Knuckle couplers plate alternating sprams from the T-Nut to the S.K.N to the chim line. 
 Whoa. 
 Yeah. 
 That is the McMillan Way. 
 And it's just another day at the office. 
 Yes. 
 How will you account for lift slippage if your girdle plate Jerries cross the prim fixture?

 What do you do at the Milwaukee thing? 
 I'm a normal piper. 
 Huh. 
 Mr. John Lakeman. 
 A police detective left this for you. 
 We should just drop it out the window like in cartoons. 
 You know what? 
 I mean... 
 What? 
 I've just been wondering in this moment after you said that why so many safes fall out of windows in cartoons. 
 Why the f*ck are safes falling out of windows so much? 
 Maybe the basis for that is that that's how people would get them open. 
 That could be the basis for that. 
 Yeah. That's what I'm saying. 
 Maybe people were trying to open them that way. 
 That forms the basis for the cartoons. 
 Which, you know, the best ones, they always reflect real life. 
 Yeah, true.

 I watch this show all the time. 
 I can't believe I can't know of one.
