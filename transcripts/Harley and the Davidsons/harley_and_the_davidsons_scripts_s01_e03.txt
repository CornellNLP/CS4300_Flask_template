 This is it. This is our venture, a motorized bicycle. 
 I've known you since we could walk. 
 You were born for this. 
 Ah! Go. Come on! Come on! 
 [Engine starts] 
 Dear brother, remember Bill Harley, from across the road? 
 He and I have made an amazing machine. 
 Forget about trams, cars, trains. 
 I want ours to go anywhere. 
 This is power, control, and speed. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 You think you can come here and humiliate me? 
 We are gonna destroy you. 
 Officiant : By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. 
 It's a boy. 
 After the war, we'll have an entire group of loyal Harley-Davidson enthusiasts. 
 Boys coming back only want Harleys, just like yourself. 
 Release the hounds. 
 It's a class-action lawsuit for infringement on the patented clutch design. 
 We didn't steal anything. 
 I designed the damn thing. 
 We built better machines. We're an honest company. 
 What does this mean for us? 
 It means we have nothing. 
 Look at what I found. 
 Number one off the line. 
 We start over from scratch. 
 We're Harley-Davidson, and we'll keep building motorcycles, even if we have to do it in a shed.

 There's more of them every week. 
 Over here. 
 Here you are. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 These, too. 
 Clara : For the women, there are some dresses in there and some gloves. 
 Yeah. 
 Man : That's very generous. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Thank you very much. 
 Yeah. 
 ♪♪ 
 Man : Look at this. 
 Joe Petrali? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Man, you racing, too? 
 Hey, you're the rider that tore up the track in Evanston. 
 They let you race a Cherokee? 
 Not the brightest bulbs, some of those race officials. 
 [Laughter] 
 Hey, what about you, Petrali? 
 You racing that JDH Two Cam? 
 No, sir. 
 Harley has their new motorcycle ready. 
 You'll see at tomorrow's race. 
 [Engine revs] 
 Here's to success. 
 Ohh. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Here comes Wharton. 
 Ma'am. Arthur. 
 As your dealer's association president and standing chairman of the AMA, I am afraid I have some unhappy sentiments to convey. 
 Oh, no. What is it, Wharton? 
 I've had a tip that these hooligans are holding an outlaw race at an abandoned factory. 
 They specifically do this to thumb their noses at the official AMA races here. 
 And we care why? 
 The sales are terrible, Arthur, and getting worse. 
 Wharton : These outlaw groups are making motorcycles using junk parts instead of buying new ones. 
 They're just kids, Wharton. 
 They don't have money for new motorcycles. 
 Like most people these days, they're being resourceful. 
 You ought to commend them. 
 Listen, I get it. I do. 
 It's just easy to find somebody to blame, but the bottom line is times are tough. 
 Right? 
 Take a look out there. You see that? 
 That gentleman is our main problem. 
 Brand-new model a sells for $500 and seats six. 
 Now compare that to a brand-new motorcycle which sells for $300 and seats one. 
 Excuse me, gentlemen, ma'am. 
 Hmm. 
 Hm. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Can I help you, boy? 
 I don't think so. 
 They let you off the reservation again? 
 It looks like it, doesn't it? 
 This is a travesty. This man is obviously a negro. 
 He's not officially sponsored! 
 Arthur. 
 I appreciate your empathy, but is this really any of your business? 
 No. 
 But there are bylaws to uphold! 
 Hey. 
 What's happening here? 
 Just another day in paradise. 
 What is it? 
 It's not here, the new prototype. 
 I thought you brought it with you. 
 We did. But it's not here. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 I think maybe your son borrowed it. 
 Come on, Willie. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Laughter] 
 Whew. 
 There's that kid again. 
 Yeah. 
 Where'd you steal that hunk of junk? 
 It's Harley-Davidson's new bike. 
 Big deal. 
 They haven't made a great bike since the 1929 Two Cam JDH. 
 It'll blow the wheels off any bike here. 
 Ooh. 
 [Spectators ohh] 
 [Chuckling] Okay. 
 Sounds like we got a new racer! 
 [Cheering] 
 Uh, I don't know about that. 
 No? Why not, kid? 
 You have to go home for nap time? 
 Hey, I'll race any of you... anytime. 
 Good to hear that. 
 Good. 
 Man : Let's do it again, guys. Do it again. 
 Man #2 : Bring it over here. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Man : Yeah! There he is! 
 [Cheering] 
 Can I join in? 
 Hell yeah! 
 [Engine starts] 
 Crank it up, now! 
 Make it good! 
 Don't worry, kid. 
 I promise not to kick your ass too bad. 
 Okay. On my mark! 
 [Engines rev] 
 [Engines roar, tires squeal] 
 [Cheering] 
 Shane : Oh, ho-ho! [Laughs] 
 Come on, man. 
 [Laughter] 
 Here it is. 
 The new Harley-Davidson piece of crap. 
 [Laughs] 
 Son of a... 
 [Horn honking] 
 Oh, no! No! 
 Let's get out of here! 
 [Whistle blows, engines rev] 
 Go! 
 Move! Let's go! 
 Stop there! Police! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Sighs] 
 Poor kid. 
 Couldn't get away on his busted bike. 
 You know who that kid is? 
 Who? 
 Walt Davidson... Walter Davidson's son. 
 As in "Harley-Davidson"? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 We're eating. 
 I know. 
 [Ringing continues] 
 Davidson residence. 
 This is he. 
 [Sighs] I see. 
 Do you have the bike, too, Officer? 
 What is it? 
 It's the police. 
 They arrested Walt. 
 What? 
 I'll be right down. [Sighs] 
 No, to pick up the motorcycle. 
 My son can stay overnight to think about what he's done. 
 All right. 
 [Receiver clicks] 
 You're really gonna leave him in jail? 
 Kid needs to grow up. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 I feel for him. 
 Well, it can't be easy being Walter Davidson's son. 
 No. 
 Man : Here he is, Mr. Harley. 
 Thank you very much, Officer. 
 My dad didn't come down? 
 Uh, no. No, Walt, he didn't. 
 You know what that means... "Prototype"? 
 It means that we have  one. 
 I didn't... 
 You're not supposed to take that bike! 
 I did... I didn't know it was gonna break down. 
 I was gonna have it back before the AMA race. 
 Well, you won't let me race with the big boys, so, I mean, I thought I'd race with the outlaws. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 They're real motorcycle people, Dad. 
 I wanted them to see how great our new motorcycle is. 
 I did it for Harley-Davidson. 
 You did it to show off. 
 No, I just did what you would've done. 
 No, he insists he didn't crash it, Bill. 
 Bill : It's pretty unlikely. 
 It had to have an impact to fail like this... had to. 
 Let me see it. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Metal rattles] 
 The bearings have shattered. 
 Must be an oil-feed problem. 
 Could be design, manufacturing... 
 I don't know. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't want to point any fingers, but how'd this happen? 
 Like I said... 
 I don't know. 
 Right, but how did our one prototype not get tested? 
 Why'd we take it to race if it wasn't ready? 
 Bill, where you been? 
 I was at the lake... with my family. 
 Walter : You were at the lake when final tests were being completed? 
 Yes. Yes, I was. 
 Since the new machine is halfway there design-wise, whatever happened to the old overhead valve racing engine? 
 It just kept seizing up after a couple of hundred miles. 
 It's a design issue. 
 ♪♪ 
 Thank you. 
 Do we really need to do this? 
 We aren't doing anything, Walter. We're only hearing him out. 
 Why? He's the enemy. 
 With the loss of the foreign market and collapse of the domestic, we're looking at a 75% production cut. 
 We've weathered the storm before. 
 Yes, but it's costing us $50,000 a month just to stay open. 
 [Knocks on door] He's here. 
 [Both sigh] 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Thank you for meeting with me, gentlemen. 
 Oh, I think it's we who should be thanking you, Mr. Ford. 
 Bill. 
 Edsel Ford. 
 And you are too kind, too kind, indeed. 
 [Door closes] 
 Mr. Ford. 
 I saw you race at the Catskills in '08, Mr. Davidson. 
 You were fearless, absolutely fearless. 
 At the Catskills. 
 I didn't know you were a motorcycle fan. 
 Oh, well, I hate to admit it, but I'm, uh... I'm not really. 
 My father took me. 
 He loved racing of all sorts. 
 I remember him saying, "that man has no fear... No fear at all." 
 He was thrilled. 
 Those were the days. 
 Yeah. 
 And both our companies were just starting up back then. 
 And here we are now. 
 Uh, do you mind? 
 No. Please. 
 Edsel : Okay. 
 Without giving you the whole sermon on the mount, let us just speak plainly. 
 The deal I am offering is just as beneficial to you as it is to me. 
 But more importantly, it'll save jobs, which means saving families, which will make a stronger America. 
 And if you are overly business-minded, it also means more consumers, but for me personally I am loathe to see one more man out on the street because I despise waste. 
 Forgive me for being effusive. 
 Not at all. 
 The servi-car Harley-Davidson has designed, it is ingenious... 
 Edsel : ... A machine on its own merit. 
 We believe a three-wheeled service machine can be a great success. 
 Arthur : This is Bill's design. 
 Uh, where did you get this? 
 I will guarantee sales of 30,000 vehicles sold through our dealerships. 
 Uh... 
 I mean, as of now, it's only a design. 
 There's no prototype. 
 Not yet, but I will make you a preferred supplier. 
 Edsel : The servi-cars will be sold as Ford vehicles with the Ford name on the side. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Gentlemen, that is my proposal. 
 The motorcycle industry is, I'm afraid, up against the ropes. 
 This may help prevent Harley-Davidson from joining its former competitors. 
 Who pays for development? 
 You do. 
 And production. 
 You have 30 days to consider, which I know sounds hard-nosed, but it is the standard condition, as per our legal department. 
 All right. 
 Well, that's the long and, uh, the short of it. 
 Edsel : We can walk through any further details, should you be interested, but please do consider my offer. 
 We will. Thank you. 
 It seems like a... [Sighs] 
 Thrilling opportunity, sir. 
 Thank you, once again, for your time. 
 [Door closes] 
 This could be a real lifeline for us. 
 Lots of retooling, new parts, new line. 
 Yeah, and we're paying for it. 
 Okay. 
 Sure, it's not perfect, but if either of you have found a way to drum up a contract worth 30,000 units, I'm all ears. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Listen to me! Last hired, first to go! 
 Well, I'll work for half what you're paying! 
 And I'll work for less than that! 
 I can... I can't do that, and you know it. 
 When things pick up, you'll get your places back. 
 I promise. 
 Hey, no promises! 
 How am I supposed to feed my family?! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Settle down! Come on! 
 Quiet! 
 I was gonna say how we've always been fair with you and always will be. 
 But you know that already. 
 What about him? 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Your son was hired after most of us. 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Is he going? 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 He fired me this morning. 
 Let me go before all you fellas. 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 Looks like your boy's growing up. 
 You might be right. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 You're back. 
 Of course we're back. We live here. 
 Besides, we're not the one who got arrested. 
 It must be nice having your daddy bail you out. 
 If it was us, we'd still be in jail. 
 He didn't. 
 What the hell you want, anyways? 
 Your motorcycles are pretty wild. 
 There's so much work in them. 
 You really live here? 
 A bunch of us. 
 You know, my mom worked at Milwaukee saddlery. 
 Made the seats on Harleys till last month. 
 Your mom? 
 Yep. 
 Shane was a metalworker at John Deere, Monk was at the foundry, Deek from the rubber plant. 
 We've all been junked. 
 You take all these parts that have been junked, add us, this is what you get. 
 Don't you dare touch my motorcycle. 
 [Wrench clatters] 
 And you still got one coming for hitting me. 
 [Engine starts, revs] 
 You sure you're not some kind of spy, Davidson? 
 No, I was let go. 
 Your own family fired you? 
 Last hired, first fired. 
 Reya. 
 ¿Que? 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Reya : All right. 
 You're a not a spy? Prove it. 
 Help us put up fliers. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How's that gonna prove anything? 
 It's illegal. Cops chase us every time. 
 Okay. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 It's a beautiful day. 
 It is. 
 You should, uh... you should eat something. 
 [Sighs] So should you. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 [Sighs] 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Bill. 
 Bill... 
 This isn't going to go away. 
 Don't talk like that. 
 Whatever happens, we can't let this bring you down, too. 
 You have to live your life. 
 Nope. 
 No. No more of that. 
 You'll be fine. You'll be just fine. 
 Let's, uh... let's go for a walk. 
 Come on. 
 [Sighs] 
 Not again. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 I'm fine. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm fine. 
 Just let it be. 
 At least until next x-rays, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I'm fine. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Let's walk. 
 How are you boys? 
 Lang! 
 [Laughs] 
 How are you, old man? 
 Good to see you. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 Now, all the way from Florida... 
 Whoa-ho! 
 [Laughs] 
 And one more thing... rum from Havana. 
 [Laughs] 
 Thank you. 
 One of the perks of living so close to a country that is civilized enough to prohibit prohibition. 
 You are a true gentleman. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I won't argue with you there. 
 Lang : Cheers. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Ahh. While on the topic of foreign lands, I think the future... 
 [Door closes] 
 Of this company may well lie outside our borders. 
 We need to look outward, boys... 
 Internationally. 
 A Japanese company wants to purchase our designs and manufacturing know-how. 
 Walter : Hm. 
 Buy? Not lease? 
 Buy. 
 As in Harley-Davidson Motorcycles with someone else's name on it. 
 What's the difference between a Harley-Davidson bike with a Japanese name on it and one that says Ford? 
 You know about the Ford proposal. 
 I do. 
 Building motorcycles for Ford is quite different than selling off what we spent the last 30 years creating. 
 Mm. 
 Ford allows us to grow with the automobile market. 
 It's long-term stability. 
 Lang, what you're proposing is that we sell the crown jewels. 
 He's just relaying a business opportunity, Arthur. 
 No, we aren't selling any of our intellectual property. 
 At least the Japan deal doesn't make us spend money to make money. 
 It doesn't dictate how we operate. 
 William : Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 Here. This one's high. 
 Watch your hands, Wally. 
 [Chuckles] Well, you said "help." I'm helping. 
 [Police whistle blowing] 
 Hey, you! 
 Stop! 
 [Police whistle blows] 
 Here! 
 [Sighs] Okay. Okay. Uh... 
 Keep quiet. I'll distract them. 
 You go the other way. 
 Fine. 
 Hey! 
 There they are! 
 Hey, you! Stop! 
 Twice in a week? 
 You to your room. 
 Thank you, Officer. 
 I don't know what he sees in those clowns. 
 It's totally normal for a boy his age to behave like this. 
 I hate this rebellious behavior. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Gee, I wonder where he gets that from. 
 Cancer of the bone is rarely just that, usually originating in other organs. 
 But that's not what is worrying. 
 The increase in size of bone mass is very... aggressive. 
 And? 
 I wish I had better news. 
 I believe we're looking at months, not years. 
 I'm very sorry, Mrs. Harley. 
 Why do you think Ford wants the servi-car? 
 Well, he told us himself. 
 Because it's ingenious. 
 Humor me. 
 It's a three-wheeled motorcycle designed to be towed behind a car, allowing the repaired car to be returned to the customer. 
 The servi-car is then detached and drives off. 
 "Repaired" or "new"? 
 Harley-Davidson will be delivering new cars for our biggest competitor, and then we drive off. 
 Might as well gift-wrap them for him while we're at it. 
 Like I said before, Walter, it doesn't cost us anything to hear him out. 
 Let's just hear what the deal is. 
 Yes, of course. I'll tell him. 
 Walter : We've been waiting for almost an hour. 
 I've made a note. 
 Well, he's a busy man. 
 [Sighs] 
 And we aren't? 
 Goodbye. 
 Nice of you to join us today. 
 Where were you on that last meeting? 
 L... let me guess... the lake? 
 No. No, I was, uh... 
 A picnic... I was at a picnic. 
 A picnic? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. [Sighs] 
 Mr. Ford is ready for you now. 
 [Sighs] 
 As per our previous meeting, Harley-Davidson will finance the development of the servi-car while complying to Ford's high standards of design and manufacturing. 
 Of course, you own the design and the machinery. 
 Again, when the servi-car is ready, we guarantee a 30,000 minimum order. 
 And when all 30,000 are on the road, ongoing projected sales are very positive. 
 "Projected." 
 Well, nothing is for certain, of course, but the projections are impressive. 
 That's swell. 
 God damn it. 
 What? 
 Why is it starting to feel less like an opportunity and more like a shakedown? 
 Because you hate being told what to do. 
 Look, I'll admit, the stipulations here aren't ideal, but this represents stability for us, for our dealers, our workers, our families, Walter. 
 Is it worth selling our soul off? 
 Oh, stop it. You're being dramatic. 
 Am I? 
 Yes. 
 Bill, help me out here. 
 Unless you need to go to the park or fishing or something. 
 Shane : [Grunting] 
 God damn it! [Sighs] 
 One more time. 
 All right, you got her? 
 Yeah. 
 [Grunts] She won't budge. 
 All right, let's open it up. 
 Come on. 
 Shane : Come on. Come on. 
 Use this. 
 Cheers! 
 Cheers. 
 Ah, sh1t! 
 [Wrench clatters] 
 You all right? 
 You laugh, I'll punch your lights out. 
 Walt : 3/4-inch Ratchet. 
 Where'd you steal that from? 
 I've worked summers on the line since I was 12. 
 What? 
 So you can come and go at the Harley-Davidson plant? 
 I got fired, but, yeah. 
 What do you say you pop into the old shop, grab us a V.L. springer fork from the parts room? 
 What, like steal one for you? 
 Yeah. 
 And I think things with us will be square. 
 Forget it. 
 Come on, man. It's a part I need new. 
 I bet they have hundreds of them. 
 How do you usually find new parts, huh? 
 Besides me stealing them. 
 We sell bikes. 
 Shane : And we buy what we can't scrounge. 
 You sell your own motorcycles? 
 Hell yeah. 
 We race every month. 
 The bike that wins that race, that machine is the hero, sells right away... 
 Bragging rights for the new guy who buys it. 
 Mm-hmm, so when you trade the winning bike to a dealer, he gives you parts or tools. 
 And you build another bike. 
 And you sell that one, too. 
 Dealers love it. 
 It makes them money, too. 
 [Chuckling] Hell yeah. 
 You see, these boys don't like to admit it, but most of the parts they need, they can't make themselves. 
 See, what you're looking at, Walt, is what they call a cottage industry. 
 So... 
 No springer fork? 
 Guess we ain't square. 
 Hey, keep it. 
 I got two. 
 ♪♪ 
 What the hell is this? 
 150 brand-new model D's. 
 What, the ones we shipped to St. Louis? 
 And that they shipped back, along with another 150 tomorrow. 
 What's wrong with them? 
 Get Gene on the phone. 
 Okay. 
 The motorcycles? Nothing. 
 The city of St. Louis is broke, so they shipped them back. 
 We needed this sale. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we did. 
 Damn. 
 300 units. 
 And the market's only getting worse. 
 Some people are saying this could last another decade. 
 You know, that servi-car deal could give us a nice, nice cushion, as well as put a lot of men back to work. 
 Look, I'm not asking you to swallow your pride, Walter. 
 But it's easy to talk about ideals and freedom when things are easy. 
 But what about when it's not? 
 What about when it's hard, huh? 
 We got to put food on the table. 
 Subtle as a sledgehammer. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay. 
 Call Ford. 
 [Sighs] 
 This way. 
 Edsel : Arthur, good to see you. 
 Edsel, how are you? 
 I'm good, I'm good. 
 Do come in. Take a seat. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is good for both of us. 
 It makes both of us stronger. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door closes] 
 It is wise to view this depression as an opportunity. 
 Those who weather this storm... Well, the field is theirs. 
 No conscientious man wants another man to fail, competitor or otherwise, but if he does, it would be wasteful to squander any opportunities that arise. 
 Some folks would find that distasteful. 
 Picking the bones? 
 Well, they'll have plenty of time to examine their morals standing in the bread line. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Arthur... 
 I am very glad that you've come aboard. 
 So, this is a Two Cam overhead valve racing engine? 
 Johnson : Mm-hmm. 
 [Metal clatters] 
 [Sighs] 
 See, we added a gearbox and the clutch from a JDH Two Cam. 
 We added peashooter heads to make a racing special. 
 And see, then... [Chuckles] 
 Then, I stretched and lowered... 
 The frame to fit it all in. 
 It looks so different. 
 Yeah, every one is different... 
 Unique, I might say. 
 And out of just parts, too. 
 Recycled, scrounged, and buy what else you need. 
 So, how does it break down, then? 
 How do you make out at the end of the day? 
 Well... 
 We sell the bike for $50, minus about $20 for new parts, throw in labor, and, uh... [Chuckles] 
 Well... 
 Nobody's getting rich. 
 But i... it's not about that. 
 It's about doing it yourself and living by your own rules.

 When you can.

 You wanted to talk to me, Dad? 
 Yes. Come on. 
 You know, I've been thinking. 
 I want you to come back to work. 
 I don't want to take anybody's job. 
 [Chuckles] You won't be. 
 You'll be working with me... 
 Walter : In the office. 
 The office? 
 You're my son. 
 There's bigger things in store for you than messing around with those hoodlums. 
 Me? In the office? Really? 
 You're a good mechanic... Very, very good. 
 You learned the ropes on the factory floor, but now you'll learn the ropes in here. 
 And one day, you'll take my place. 
 Can I think about it? 
 Think about what? About working with me? 
 It's just... [Sighs] I don't know. 
 I don't know if this is for me. 
 Why? 
 It's just, I don't want to be sitting around doing paperwork or in meetings or making decisions like building tricycles. 
 I don't know how you can do it. 
 And as far as those hoodlums, those are my friends. 
 They're a waste of your time. 
 That you make money off of. 
 Those guys buy more new parts than anybody realizes. 
 Really? 
 They need them for their chopped-up bikes, which they sell. 
 Then, they build new machines all over again, half with new parts, half with scrounged. 
 Is that true? 
 I've seen it. 
 Regardless, you'll be here, in this office, 8:00 A.M. sharp Monday morning.
