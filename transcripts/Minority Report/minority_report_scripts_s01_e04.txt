 Previously on  Minority Report... 
 Vega :  I want you to come work with me. 
 A Precog? 
 Shh. 
 Is helping you? 
 Vega :  Akeela, no one can know. 
 I programed this to detect the fluctuations and give a 30-second warning. 
 That way if you're, you know, at a cocktail party or something, you can slip away. 
 Also understand that your job performance reflects on the men and women of this department. 
 Yes. 
 And that if you mess up, we all mess up. 
 If Agatha won't tell you, I will. 
 Tell me what? 
 Blake : Impressive. 
 So impressive that, uh, to be honest, uh, I have questions. 
 Where's my money? 
 You've got nowhere to go, Charlie. 
 What do tou want? 
 (chuckles) 
 (panting) 
 Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 (computer chimes) 
 Anoushka? 
 Stop talking. 
 (computer dinging) 
 Wait right here. 
 Allow entry. 
 Sorry, Anoushka. 
 Apparently it's always brother time these days. 
 Please, come in. 
 You said we needed to talk. 
 So let's talk. 
 I know you're new to social cues of civilized society, but it's polite to call first. 
 You're my brother. 
 Yeah, still. 
 Can this wait? 
 Dash : You tell me. 
 You and Agatha are the ones saying the sky is falling. 
 I don't think it's time-sensitive at this moment. 
 (sighs) 
 What exactly did she see? 
 I told you already. 
 Vega standing next to a milk bath. 
 Don't shoot the messenger. 
 I got to tell her about this. 
 Don't. 
 That's exactly why Agatha wanted to keep this from you. 
 Our lives are at stake, and if she's right, then your new partners' the one that sells us out. 
 Vega is not an enemy. 
 Okay. 
 You just met her; I'm your brother, but okay. 
 Arthur, come on. 
 Oh, spare me. 
 Every time we help her, we risk putting ourselves closer to the edge. 
 No, next time you need my help for one of your good deeds, I'm not nothing be here. 
 For all you know, she could be the one to save us from whatever it is that's going to get us caught again. 
 Then keep her close but keep the secret, Dash, until we know more. 
 She already knows too much. 
 I have to go. 
 Vega :  There were three of them, Dash, Arthur, and Agatha. 
 They were called the Precognitives. 
 They could see murders before they happened. 
 For six years, our police held them against their will and used them to save lives. 
 But after the government's Precrime program was shut down, they were finally released. 
 They kept themselves safe and hidden from the world until now. Blake :  Hawk-Eye is an important   part of fighting crime. But remember, when you are out in the field, you are analysts, not cops. Process the data and help your officer assess the next best course of action. Tomorrow, you officially hit the streets. Dismissed. Has Dash actually had a job before? Precrime, remember? He used to work here. Blake : Dash, Vega. Well, the official partner handoff. I'll take good care of her, sir. Is a thing I hear people say. (chuckles) I know it's hard for you, Vega, after all of our time together. Not as hard as all of our time together. (chuckles) Good luck. Yeah. Cool! You've got the vintage '48. The-the watch. Oh, this? Actually, Wally retrofitted this for me. It monitors my body temperature and warns me before I'm gonna see a murder, because, you know, I tend to collapse and convulse. Dash. Yep. All right. See you later. (sighs) Are you okay? You seem a little weird today. I mean, weirder than usual. (chuckles) No, I'm fine, thanks. Okay, then. Big, official first day tomorrow. Yeah. Get some rest. Sure. Um... You know, we need to separete our work from our personal life. You know, someone you can talk to besides me. Okay. But how is that possible when the most significant thing about me is something that I can't share with anyone? Except me. That would be nice, yes. You want to get some food? (chuckles) (wristband buzzing) You need to go to the bathroom. Yes, I do. (bell dinging) How did you sleep? I want my money. And I will give it to you once you finish the job. Under the table, you'll find a package. Your instructions are in there, along with some funding to get it done. Follow them to the letter. So you're paying me my own money to do something for you. Think of it as a charitable donation, Charlie. I'd sooner kill you right here, right now than to be your errand boy to earn back what's rightfully mine. Look over my right shoulder. In 20 seconds, Sheriff Lasser is going to open that door, walk in, order oatmeal and whole wheat toast. So you'd better kill me quickly, Charlie, before you do something rash, and he finds out how you stole what's rightfully yours. (bell dinging) Same old? Let's mix it up today. Oatmeal and a slice of whole wheat, heavy on the butter. You can't outrun me, Charlie. I'll always be a step ahead. And it's not like you have anywhere to hide. Don't forget the package. (groaning) (winces) (doorbell dinging) Ask who it is. I know who it is. (groans) (door opens) Hey. Hey. (door closes) Wally : Wow, this just got very official very fast. Wally, I told you Akeela was joining the team. (scoffs) So, Vega tells me after Precrime went down, you made a ton of money inventing some game app? TimeRaft. You play? Once or twice. You're a level eight conjurer in a survival group with your niece, Samara, and her brother, Jude. I can still read the customer log. But you tell me, how did Sprawl punk who tattooed her face to fool facial recognition cameras wind up as a cop? You know, you used to cash a Metro paycheck, too. Or was your detail limited to giving Precogs foot massages? Vega : Knock it off. You're both pretty. Dash : How about we try to identify the face from my new murder vision? Vega : A confrontation. Blood splatters on a statue. A bracelet rolls away, and the kill. What kind of dog is that? Wally : Czechoslovakian vlcak. Pure-breds are rare. Must be licensed to someone. I'll run a search. No need. Already got them. There seems to be a few in the city. Marjorie Fox, Cayman Bello, Declan Brown. Cayman Bello? Of the Bello family? The very same. Mommy's a senator, Daddy was old money, just passed away, and just like that, Cayman is one of D.C.'s top philanthropists. Also easy on the eyes. That's him. That's the murderer. But who's the woman? I didn't see her face. You need to call your brother. He won't... I can't, I mean. He's out of town. You could start with Bello. His charity's holding a small function for its most generous donors today. The country house. I'll clear you on the guest list. Oh. Want to crash a party? Well, let me see what I have going on. Sure. What a generous donation, Mr. and Mrs. Canally. Thank you for joining us today. Just stay close and look for anything that stands out from your vision. The dog, the statue. You see Cayman anywhere? No. Oh, no, this guy. Lara. Mingle. (sighs) What are you doing here? Can't a cop have a favorite charity, counselor? (chuckles) How are you? Very well, thank you. Terracotta Army fan, are you? Yes. These are interesting. Oh, well, if you like these, he's got some jade at the vineyard that will make you swoon. Martha's. I don't know her. Ah, she's an old hag. Let me guess... artist? Yes, I... sketch occasionally. But your real passion is... uh... Don't tell me. I'm pretty good at guessing. I just got to warn you... So am I. I say perennial blue ribbon winner at your high school science fair. Actually, um, not much time for school. I started... working pretty early. You just became the most interesting person at this party. I don't think anyone here has worked an honest day in their lives. Which reminds me, I put together Cayman's guest list for this party. I don't believe you were on it. Relax, I'm not gonna throw you out or anything. (chuckles) I'm Fredi. Fredi Kincaid. Dash. Can I have it back? Uh... you're friends with Cayman Bello? I work at his foundation. I do some fundraising, but I'm babysitting Cayman mostly. Does he get into much trouble? Nothing he can't slip his way out of. Dash : Uh, Fredi? Do you have a dog? No. Allergic. Why? Just making small talk. Are you working tomorrow? Yes. Vega : There you are! Ah... Hi! Fredi here works at the Bello Group. This is Vega. Really? Hello. Who put this on? I'll take care of it. Yeah, do that. Something from this century? Please? Okay, so he hates good music. Noted. You get anything? Yeah. Her... she's wearing the bracelet. The one that I saw. Vega : She's the murder victim. Fredi Kincaid... 28 years old. She's been working for Bello for the past six months. But there's not much else on her. Which unfortunately means not much on who would want to kill her. I should stay close to her. Don't you mean "we"? If  we  stay close to her, we're following her. If I go with her alone, I'm right next to her. You want to ask her out on a date. It's called "going undercover." Why? You don't think she would be interested in me or...? No, no, I didn't say that. But, uh... Give him a wire. Okay, then. You wear these. And we'll be your eyes and ears the whole time just in case. No, I don't need any help. This is a police operation. You either put those on or I chaperone. (sighs) Activate lenses. Whoa! Okay, this is pretty cool. Vega : It's a sensory overload at first. Ask to hide data. Hide data! You can sub-vocalize it. Whatever you want the system to do, just think it with your tongue. (indistinct chatter) All right, here goes. She better be nice to him. Hey, Fredi! Dash, right? You said you'd be at work today. I did. I just wanted to check. Are you a crazy person? I don't personally think so. (chuckles) (quiet laugh) But it was loud at the party, and I wanted to talk more. So I was wondering if you might want to join me for dinner? Uh, that girl I saw you with? Is just a girl I was with. She's nothing. It's just a friend. I would argue better than nothing. Well, I-I have plans, but... What about tomorrow? For meals... or beverages? Uh, but what I was gonna say is would you like to join me? It's a barbecue at Cayman's. Barbecue, uh, for work? Not officially. It's just Cayman hanging out with his usual insufferable crew. I mean, he wants to talk to me about improving the foundation. That sounds terrible. I know. Want to come? (both laugh) Do you think I'll fit in? No, not at all. Thank God! Come on. Kid's gonna be all right. Yeah. (laughs) Water? Or something stronger, Mr...? Peele. But I'm looking to change that. I was told that you supply identities. I'm an estate planner. Yeah, I'm gonna need something with high security clearance, DoD with site access. Sure, we keep that in stock. I'm here because Agatha sent me. And she said I could count on a family discount? (sighs) Okay. Cayman : Fredi! You're here, finally. Huh, well, now looks like Cayman might be in to Fredi for more than just a work thing. Maybe she invited Dash to make him jealous. And land a rich sugar daddy. Dash, seriously? I can hear you. Then say, "Mute." Mute. Sorry? Nothing. We're thinking of catching the midnight Space Blue and grabbing brek in Singapore. Care to join? I work tomorrow. You work for me. And besides, we're gonna be back in plenty of time. You can bring your intern. He's my friend. This is Dash. Okay, Whit's a dick. Whitman Cho... Grew up with Cayman. High school, college, lacrosse camp. Oh, well, there you go. Don't hate on lacrosse! Fredi : Pretty big party, Cayman. But you said last night you wanted to talk about work. Cayman : I did? Doesn't sound like me. (barking) Oh, easy, easy. Muffy isn't socialized. There you go. (whispers): The dog. Vega : Yeah, we see it. Is everything okay? Yes. Yeah, I just, I'm a, I'm a cat person. Cayman : So, Dash? I don't think I caught your last name. Are you from around here? Leave it vague. Parker, Dash Parker. Hmm, of the Virginia Parkers? Did he just say "the Virginia Parkers"? They really talk like that? I'm, uh, I'm not sure. Not sure? Guys. It's okay. My drug addict mother had the good grace to almost carry me to term. Vega : Careful, Dash. I spent my infancy in an incubator. Childhood in foster care. And later years in lesser accommodations. So, yeah, I'm not sure if the name comes from Virginia, but I'll look into it. I'm sorry. That's, uh, that's awful. Isn't that why you ask? Seems like a good time to go. Dash, you can't leave her. -The murder could be happening tonight. I know what I'm doing. Wait. Dash? Dash, wait. I'm sorry about that. That's okay. Let's get out of here. I love it down here. Some people don't get it. Yeah, it's good energy. It's real. Cayman and company back there can be kind of soul-crushing. Why would you want to be friends with people like that? I don't. It's just, uh... complicated. It's personal. I'm a person. Tell me. Those guys went to college with my sister. They were her so-called friends. They all went to the cape one summer. And she really wanted me to come, but... What happened? Where's your sister now? Depends on what kind of god you believe in. I'm sorry. What sister? Get a name. What was her name? Alison. They were responsible. I know they were. That's why you took this job. To find proof. I don't know why I trust you, but I do. Is that crazy? I'm the wrong person to ask. (chuckles) Okay, tell me everything. And don't go wandering off like that again, Dash. You knew I was safe. Yeah, well, we don't know this girl. You saw the whole thing. We just talked and then I walked her home and we, you know, we hung out until dawn. And nobody tried to kill her? You seem disappointed. So far you haven't seen a vision more than three days out, which means the murder must be happening tonight. That is when she's planning to confront Cayman with the proof. That Cayman was responsible for her sister's death. She said she needed to get past his security system to find it. It's a high-tech system; I told her I would help. Help? You're getting pretty cocky with this girl. How exactly do you plan to do that? I know a guy. Arthur : She's kind of cute. You like her? I find her attractive. Charming, yes. Look, what we're trying to do here doesn't come close to Agatha's vision. Fredi is harmless. She doesn't seem like the Seventh Sign, you're right. And you could stand to have a non-cop girlfriend. These are the schematics for the security system. (whistles) Dash : Can you help? Top of the line. She's willing to pay. My guy's in the Sprawl. Tell him I sent you. I bet this is where you take all the girls. Arthur sent us. We're friends. So what do you have for me? The system's owner. Just grabbed it from his office. Hopefully the scotch won't cancel out the DNA. Should be enough. Let's get started, shall we? What is that? Tissue printer. I hope you don't have any plans for the next two hours. Where are they now? What'd I miss? The Sprawl. One of Arthur's guys. Gonna help them break Cayman's security. Could be a while. Wonder how they'll spend their time. You got something for me? I looked up Fredi's sister. There's no record of any Alison Kincaid. She lied about the name. But I did dig up some dirt on Cayman and his crew. Him, Whitman Cho and this guy named Matt Hildebrandt used to rent a place in the Cape. Every summer, actually, until two years ago. Two years ago? That's when it happened. Do we know who else they went up there with? Any girls? No, nothing yet, but I'm still looking. 
 
 It's ready. What is it? Fredi : Our key to Cayman's security system. Scientist : Peekaboo. We did it, Dash. We did it,  you  did. Just trying to help. Dash : So do you want coffee or this old coffee? (chuckles) Choices, choices. This is kind of all I got. I'm good. Thanks. This "Fiddler's Neck." Is this where you grew up? I didn't peg you as a country boy. Guess that explains the good manners. Well, we sort of moved there later in life. Dash : Fresh start. Must have been hard. I knew kids who grew up in the system. They all have a hard time getting close. Dash : I wish I could tell you that I couldn't remember everything that happened. But I do. So whenever it's quiet or dark or... anytime, really... I am back there... seeing it. Seeing what? Careful, Dash. More than any kid should ever have to. It was too much for too long to forget. And you want to forget. No, I don't. I don't want to forget it. And that way, it won't be a waste of my life. (chuckles) That's all I want too. For Alison, not to be forgotten. What happened? What did Cayman do to her? She was dating Cayman. The two of them and some of his friends were partying down at the Cape. There were drugs, and she overdosed. Cayman panicked, and... he just left her there. They all did. They let her die. And then they said that they weren't even there. They all had very good lawyers. Vega : Ask if she has proof. How do you know that he was there with her? I just know. If only I could place them there though with some evidence. That's why I need to do this. We'll get it. We'll get it tonight. I'll help you. Akeela : Did I miss the best part? All of it. Thank you. Bummer. What'd you find? My search turned up five girls who visited the Cape with Cayman and his pals that summer. Alison Carrigan. Different last name, but I'd say there's a family resemblance. But it gets better. Cayman's friend Matt Hildebrandt? You tracked him down? He's dead. Six months ago, swallowed a bunch of pills in his bedroom in rehab; ruled a suicide. And here's the good part. The day he overdosed, he had one visitor. Ricki Carrigan. Alison's sister. Ricki goes by the name of... Both : Fredi. So she could gain access to Cayman and his friends. Because Fredi believes that they killed her sister, she wants revenge. And she's already killed one man to get it. Okay, run everything you can. We need proof that Cayman was there the night that Alison was killed. Labor Day weekend, 2063. Yeah, I'll bet Cayman's lawyers ended it before the local sheriff got her pants on. Where are you going? I'm pulling Dash out. So how do you feel about Bermuda? We go in tonight, expose Cayman to the world, and then run away. (chuckles) Someone's at the door. I didn't hear anything. Not a good time. You just slept with a killer, Dash. What are you talking about? Fredi lied about her name. It's Ricki, Ricki Carrigan. And she's not after proof; she wants revenge. How do you even know all of this? Ask her about Matt Hildebrandt, he's one of Cayman's friends. He was in rehab, but conveniently O.D.'d right after a visit with your girlfriend. You don't know that for sure. Maybe... maybe she confronted him with the truth, and he felt guilty and killed himself. Dash, listen to yourself. This is going down tonight. She got to you too. She's not a murderer. And you know that how? Because I know killers, Vega. And I know her. (door opens) I heard yelling. No, we were just talking. Fredi : We met at the party. You two really aren't...? No. No. No way. Vega was just leaving. It's good to see you again. Do you need to follow her? No. No. In that case, get ready. It's time. Damn it, Dash! Sir. Something wrong? Could be the scanner. Got your badge? Yeah. Mother's maiden? Flitcraft. Have a nice day. Man : All right, next. He cut me off. He's off the grid. What do you mean he's off the grid? He took his earpiece and his lenses out. He's trusting her. Well, we know they're going to Bello's house, right? I'm on my way there right now. You have anything on the night Alison died? No, not yet, but I'm getting close. Well, you better hurry. I'm only authorized for the entrance. (scanner beeps) I told Cayman I needed him to sign something. He's waiting for me upstairs. He's expecting you? Of course. He expects me to be on call 24/7. And tonight, I'm only too happy to oblige. You coming? So where's the proof? What? The evidence. The proof that Cayman was with Alison the night that she died. Isn't that why we're here? There is no proof. We're here for the eyewitness. Cayman? I'm gonna get him to confess. Fredi. Fredi, wait. Fredi, stop. You can't do this. What are you talking about? (scanner beeps) Tell me about Matt Hildebrandt. Where did you hear that name? He was there that night on the beach with Alison, wasn't he? And now he's dead. An overdose. A suicide. Because you drove him to it? Is that what you're doing here, too? What difference does it make if it revealed the truth? Don't do this, Fredi. Maybe it was a mistake to bring you here. This part I'll do alone. He's going to hurt you. No. He won't. I'm not the one who gets hurt this time. (grunts) Fredi, don't do this! (scanner beeps) (grunts) Fredi! Fredi, you're better than this! Fredi! Hope I'm not intruding. Fredi. Didn't know you'd just come up. Glad you did though. Yeah, you're right. Look at me, walking around like I own the place. So what is it I'm signing for you? How about a confession? What are you talking about? ("Alison" by Elvis Costello playing) Remember this song? She said you used to play it for her. Turn it off. ♪ Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you ♪ (turns up volume) ♪ After so long... ♪ Did she tell you she had a sister? Ricki. Fredericka. You're... I am. Heard a lot about you, Cayman. Can't say it's nice to meet you though. What do you want? I want you to tell the truth. Just like Matt Hildebrandt did. Security breach! Emergency Richmond 10-41! (alarm beeping) Leave and we will never discuss this again. Otherwise, security will be up here in two minutes. Actually, they won't. (scanner beeps) (alarm stops) Which means we can talk alone. ♪ I only know it isn't mine ♪ 
♪ Alison ♪ 
♪ My aim is true. ♪ Dash :  Fredi! Akeela : Vega, I've got something. The night Fredi's sister died, Cayman's fixers tampered with the eye-dents, the surveillance feed. But he missed one thing: the music they were listening to. It's a subscription service, streams to personal devices. It also keeps geo coordinates. Send it through. I'm five away. Fredi! (dog barking) You're here when it happens. Good boy. Your sister died of a drug overdose. Her fault, not mine. She didn't want to die. You could've saved her. People like you pretend there's no such thing as personal responsibility. No one forced those drugs on her. But you loved giving them to her. She wanted to get high. Because she wanted to fit in. But she never did. I got to give her credit though, she really, really tried. So here's to Alison, may she rest in peace. She had a little bit of a drug problem, but she was a very talented girl. (Cayman screams, dog barks) You shot me! Dash : Fredi, wait! (groaning) Please. You need to listen to me. Dash, get out! I know what it's like. To obsess. You don't know the first thing. I know everything. My whole life, all I've seen are people making the same decisions that you're about to make. And it doesn't help. It never does. I'll take my chances. (grunts softly) The police are gonna come walking through that door in 40 seconds. How do you know that? Because I work for them. You lied to me? You need to leave. And let him get away with it again? I am not gonna let that happen. Fredi, you are better than this. You are better than him. I've come too far now. You have 13 seconds. Automated voice : Security override. Metropolitan Police. Vega (in distance) : Metro P.D.! You still have a choice. Go. Vega :  Go, go, go! Go! Weapons tight. Surround the suspect! Sweep the room. Officer : Clear! Where is she, Dash? Where did she go? I just got here. Go! Go after her! She shot me! I don't know who you're talking about, Mr. Bello. I'm here for you. What? You're under arrest for the wrongful death of Alison Carrigan. What are you talking about? I wasn't there. Actually, you were. And I found evidence to prove it. We searched the records from your music provider. You, two of your friends, and Alison Carrigan synced your devices on September 6, 2063, at 11:44 p.m. GPS pins you to Ballston Beach, on the Cape, at the exact time of Alison's death. I need to talk to my lawyer. You know, I tried reaching out to her already. She's in St. John. But you can wait in jail for her till she gets back. Medics! (indistinct police radio chatter) She wasn't a murderer. You were too close to this, Dash. You can't see your own future. I didn't need to. I saw her. I was listening. What you told her. What you never told anyone. I heard you, too. It's been a long day. (sighs) I ran the search you asked for. This is all I could find under "Photonic Containment." This is good, Charles. Let's talk money. I want my money. The rest of your cash is under the table. You can take it and leave. What I meant was it's time to renegotiate. In all my years as a security contractor for the Defense Department, I never saw schematics like these. Three connected neural interfaces, photon milk. It got me to thinking, what sort of government program would build a thing like this? And then I remembered one. Agatha. So now we both have secrets. But there's no time to threaten me, Charlie. U.S. Marshals will be here in one minute. And they don't want wheat toast. You called them. No. But I saw it coming. You got sloppy. Tipped an eye-dent scan, set off a location track. A fugitive should be more careful, Charlie. Have I been wrong yet? Wrong way. Go out the back door. And, Charlie? They won't take you alive. So run. Man : Charles Peele, this is the U.S. Marshal! Don't move! Put the gun down now! Bitch. Put the gun down now! (gunfire in distance)
