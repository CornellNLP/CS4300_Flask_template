 They're just getting the lobby ready for the big party.    
 [MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGH HEADPHONES]    
 CLAIRE: It's an annual fundraiser.    
 Like a carnival?    
 No, it's a swanky, black-tie ball.    
 You think a hospital lobby is swanky?    
 Not yet, but add some lights, a few decorations,    
 and, most importantly, alcohol...    
 It becomes a streamer- and balloon-infested hospital lobby    
 with a cash bar.    
 [SCOFFS] It's for charity.    
 Better to spend the money for the cause.    
 Actually, it's worse.    
 You need to spend money to make money.    
 I don't like parties.    
 Doesn't matter.    
 All residents will be expected to attend    
 and make a donation.    
 This is Dr. Alex Park.    
 He's the last of Coyle's residents    
 to be reassigned to our team.    
 Meet doctors Jared Kalu, Claire Browne, and Shaun Murphy.    
 Nice to meet you.    
 Welcome back. How was Costa Rica?    
 Beaches were awesome. Monkeys were horrible.    
 Little bastards stole my new camera and a pair of...

 That's even older than Dr. Melendez.    
 Dr. Murphy is a talented doctor who has autism,    
 which sometimes causes him to ask inappropriate questions.    
 No worries. Inappropriate questions can be very revealing.    
 I'm a late bloomer.    
 Park's being modest, which is very unlike him.    
 He was a cop for    years before he went to med school.    
 Now that we all know each other,    
 Reznick and Browne have dibs on cases this week.    
 You make your picks?

 I'm sure you're looking forward

 Mm, what I'm really looking forward to is... crowds.     
 You like crowds?

 I've never been in one.     
 I can't go to a normal school,

 Well, when a small bump could stop your heart, it makes sense.     
 But you still have a lot of friends?     
 Yeah, of course.     
 I mean, I just can't do anything fun with them.     
 If you can't do anything fun,     
 then how did you get them to be your friend?     
 Well, in case you haven't noticed,     
 I like to talk.

- And, uh...     
 We all do everything online now anyway.     
 The first thing I'm gonna do when I get out of here     
 is take all my friends to a concert.

 I don't even care who the band is,

 Oh, and I'm gonna hug everyone.     
 You've never hugged anyone?     
 Not even your parents?

 Well, it could just be a temporary flare-up.     
 We'll increase his anti-rejection meds

 We'll know more then.     
 You two, do the work-up.

 I've just never seen you anxious,

 It's just an excuse.

- Yeah.     
 Anyone can fake a photograph.

 I am doing a search     
 to see if our esteemed senator     
 from the great state of California     
 ever once... once...     
 talked about scuba-diving in an interview.     
 It doesn't matter if it's true.

 - Oh, Aiden Coulter? 
- Yes.     
 Oh.     
 What? I sat next to him once

 Don't look at him. Look at me.     
 I need you to answer me.     
 Why do NBA players wear headphones before games?     
 I don't know.     
 I guess they like music.     
 No, they  need  music.     
 Music helps them forget about everything else

 Yeah, now it is, but if you stay focused,     
 pretty soon, it'll stop feeling cold

 That's amazing.     
 Great job.     
 What's the catch?     
 He wants to be a donor, but he's not on the registry?     
 I mean, there's got to be a catch.

 No, but there is a ton of liability.

 He'll be guarded by state prison guards     
 on a separate level,     
 away from patients and all nonessential staff.     
 Everyone deserves the chance to turn their life around.     
 The guy wants to do something decent,     
 we should let him.     
 I don't think we owe a murderer anything.     
 But maybe he owes us something. He has a debt to society.     
 Which he would repay by donating his inner organs.     
 Isn't it a slippery slope

 Children don't consent to surgeries...

 His body's already rejected a perfect match.     
 There's no way it can tolerate an incompatible blood type.     
 No, the only way to save Eric

 That would actually grow along with the patient.     
 The surgery isn't reversible.     
 If it doesn't work,

 She has a life, and she'll be healthy     
 as long as she stays out of crowds,     
 doesn't hug anyone,     
 or do anything where she might fall.     
 I get you're autistic, but I know even you realize     
 when a patient cries and throws her phone against the wall,     
 they're not happy with their current health.     
 There's no reason to make this personal.     
 There is if his medical judgment is biased.     
 I saw she was upset.     
 You saw it, but you didn't  understand  it.     
 You're very competitive.     
 Are you trying to make Dr. Lim think I'm biased,     
 or are you trying to undermine my confidence?     
 I'm actually trying to help you and the patient.     
 She wants to be able to rub elbows,     
 and you need to learn how to trade elbows.     
 The resorbable plate is experimental and risky.     
 But my medical judgment is that it's worth it.     
 Make sure she agrees and then get her prepped.

 There's no actual policy against it.     
 I'm not talking policy, I'm talking optics.

 you'd use s*x to get a big donation.
