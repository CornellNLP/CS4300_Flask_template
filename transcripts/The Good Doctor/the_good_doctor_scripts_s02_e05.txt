 You don't want us to be a couple?    
 Or you don't want me thinking about us as a couple?    
 Neither.    
 If we get an apartment together, I feel like that's a signal that you and I might end up as boyfriend and girlfriend, and that's not going to happen.    
 You can't predict the future.    
 Feelings change.    
 I used to hate hugs, but now... sometimes I don't.    
 But I don't want my feelings to change.    
 I like being your friend, and romantic relationships a-are unpredictable.    
 So much can go wrong, especially when I am involved.    
 And if we live together, it's gonna be awkward.    
 You're bound to walk in on me when I'm naked or hear the weird s*x sounds I make with some out-of-work drummer or find me crying when that drummer dumps me,

 We're here about your urine.    
 How long has it been fizzy?    
 I hadn't even noticed. Is that a problem?    
 Ah, it can be a symptom of several conditions, many of them minor.    
 You're here for ortho, a scope on your right knee?    
 It's been sore. 
I've been training for a race.    
 Joint pain plus fizzy urine.    
 You could have emphysematous cystitis, bladder cancer, kidney problems...    
 Those sound serious. 
Should I call my husband?    
 Emphysematous cystitis is a treatable bladder infection.    
 Your symptoms could also be from a kidney stone or dehydration.    
 Could my issues be caused by...gastric bypass surgery?    
 It depends. When was it?    
    years ago.     
 I used to be     pounds.     
 That's a lot.     
 Your surgery wouldn't cause those symptoms, but we need to do a cystoscopy to find out what did.     
 I'll cancel the ortho and get Lim to sign off.     
 Hey, wait. What...     
 So, what is a cystoscopy?     
 It's like a knee scope, except the camera goes up your pen1s.     
 You administered amiodarone?     
 Rhythm's normal.     
 That's good, right?     
 It's better than when you came in.     
 Your heart is failing as a result of a condition called mitral regurgitation.     
 One of your valves isn't closing all the way.     
 Blood keeps leaking back into your atrium.     
 That's why you fainted and why we need to repair that valve ASAP.     
 How long have you been anorexic?     
 I've had issues with food on and off since I was   .     
 Mitral valve issues are a frequent complication of long-term malnutrition.     
 This bout started about a year ago... skipping meals, lying about eating, exercising excessively.

 I-I can't monitor her    hours a day.

 Okay?     
 You haven't moved your bowels.     
 Well, thank you, Shaun, for that announcement.     
 Saves me the trouble of tweeting.     
 The nurses already knew. They told me.     
 They also said you're no longer talking to your dead daughter.     
 Constipated, but no longer psychotic. A narrow win.     
 Your first defecation event is a vital part of the discharge criteria.     
 Event? What is this, the post-op decathlon,

 You have to walk a full lap of the floor.     
 But you canceled physical therapy this morning.     
 Those nurses have big mouths.     
 I canceled because my leg is a little sore.

 I-I have   minutes until my patient's cystoscopy.     
 Good. Be early.     
 Urethra looks clean.     
 No lesions, no stones so far.     
 How do we check for obstructions or stones further up?     
 Contrast cystogram.     
 Since you found this patient, how about you do the honors?     
 You know this guy used to weigh     pounds?     
 Thread the catheter further into the bladder.     
 That's a big drop. Good for him.     
 He did have gastric bypass.     
 That makes it less impressive?     
 - Now infuse the contrast. 
- Well, yeah, it is the easy way, compared to just diet and exercise.     
 The contrast dye is dissipating.     
 It's supposed to.     
 You said he's training for a race.     
 Obviously, he turned his life around.     
 Still dissipating.     
 Bypass made it physically impossible for him to eat as much as he wanted.     
 It's gone. The contrast is gone.     
 - That makes no sense. 
- Where did it go?     
 He probably has a fistula, a tunnel connecting his bladder to his intestine.     
 Air and bacteria moving the other direction caused bubbles in his urine.

 Bypass surgery shortens the digestive tract.     
 People with Crohn's disease need every inch of intestine they have, or they risk critical, even fatal malnutrition.     
 Okay, but I don't want my husband to know, and he'll be here soon.

 Well, I'll tell Spence about the Crohn's, and I'll tell him I'm having surgery... on my bladder.     
 Your husband doesn't know you had gastric bypass?     
 That would require him knowing I was obese to begin with.     
 That's not gonna happen.     
 Your husband must be very shallow.

 Surgical procedures have been effective for, uh, depression, OCD, addiction.
