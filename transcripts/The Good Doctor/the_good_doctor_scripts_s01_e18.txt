 The Saturday after Valentine's Day,     
 her favorite day of the year,     
 even more than her birthday.     
 The Chamber of Commerce would decorate this place     
 and put out a crappy buffet meal,     
 hire a deejay, and I'd put on a tux,     
 and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress,     
 and she'd...     
 pin my bow tie on me,     
 and I'd pin a little 
yellow corsage on her.     
 And we'd come and we'd eat and we'd... and we'd dance.

 No, Shaun, you should go.     
 Okay.     
 CLAIRE: Not all the cultures are back.     
 But since he's not responding to any antibiotics,     
 we can rule out bacterial.     
 It was never a great fit.     
 It's a better fit than surgical error.     
 What if it is bacterial but resistant to all...     
 Then he's dead.     
 What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria?

 Caden had normal flow cytometry.

 I know why Caden has DIC.

 Shaun, I hope you're referring to your patient,

 pretending to be in the bathroom,     
 - I kind of doubt that. 
- Yes, it's your answer.     
 We already...     
 We already have my answer, Shaun.     
 We can't do a biopsy on you     
 because of the arteries in the way,     
 like the arteries in Caden's abdomen,     
 but we can't move the arteries in your brain because...

 Your tumor is located at the base of your skull.     
 An open cranial biopsy would tell us what's wrong.

 The biopsy would cause an aneurysm or a bleed.

 MORGAN: So how do we do this? Do we file a report?     
 Talk to Andrews personally?     
 You want to report Shaun?     
 I don't  want  to. I think we  have to.   
 No, you  want  to.     
 And we'd certainly have to if our sole agenda     
 would be to take down Shaun     
 and to give you one less person to compete against.     
 And certainly, we'd absolutely "have to"     
 cover up and bury a possible fatal medical error     
 if our sole agenda was to protect a friend?     
 Protocol would seem to favor the bitch over the friend.     
 Thanks?

 I threw up.     
 We have a duty to report errors     
 so they won't happen again.     
 The process saves lives.     
 And exactly what errors are we trying to avoid a repeat of?     
 You worried about the next time an autistic surgeon operates

 We're really sorry.     
 It's okay.     
 It's okay.     
 I think he's going to be okay.     
 The protocol exists     
 so that we  don't ask questions like that.   
 That seems like a bad idea.     
 You  trust  your  judgment.     
 Do you trust  Morgan's  judgment?     
 Do you trust the judgment of all the doctors in this building?     
 If you can make judgment calls, so can they.     
 That's why we need these rules.     
 No, the protocol is fine for everyone in this building,     
 except for Shaun.     
 They'd reprimand any one of us, but they will fire him.     
 Okay.     
 We report it.     
 We get the investigation, make sure nothing like this ever happens again.     
 But we tell them I did it.     
 They'd fire you, too.     
 MORGAN: It's not a terrible idea.     
 Jared's out the door either way.     
 Can we get back to the medicine?     
 Caden is still alive.     
 If we can keep it that way,     
 there won't be an M&M review.     
 Which means no one will be asking questions,     
 and no one will have to give answers.     
 It all goes away.     
 If Caden dies, we tell the truth     
 and we face the consequences together.

 Don't cut him open.     
 Murphy, if we don't...     
 We should insert an endovascular graft     
 through his leg instead.     
 Fix it from the inside out.     
 I've done that for large abdominal aorta dilations,     
 but this is a lengthy dissecting pseudo-aneurysm.     
 It's safer.     
 The aortic wall is already compromised.     
 Could rupture completely.     
 Caden could die as soon as deflate the balloon     
 - inside the graft. 
- But doing nothing will kill him.     
 Not definitely.     
 There's still a chance Caden will simply come out of this     
 without any surgical intervention.     
  %,   % maybe.     
 PARK: Not nothing.
