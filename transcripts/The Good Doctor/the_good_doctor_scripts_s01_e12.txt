 LEA: You need to take a break, clear your head.   
 You need a vacation.   
 I'm gonna quit my job.   
 I'm not looking forward to moving   
 to Hershey, Pennsylvania.   
 I don't want kids.   
 Ever.   
 I've just been fired    
 for physically assaulting an employee.    
 Go ahead. Chop us in half.    
 GLENDA: When will they wake up?    
 They should've already.

 ♪    
 We were worried about you, Jenny.    
 So glad you're back.    
 I am gonna give you three words.    
 Try to remember them.    
 Apple. Ball. House.    
 Can you count back from     by   for me?    
 I'm going to Harvard, you know.    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 And what city are we in?    
 San Jose.    
 And what were those three words?    
 Apple. Ball. House.    
 [CHUCKLES] Look out, Harvard.    
 We'll be doing a lot more tests to know for sure,    
 but your heart does sound better.    
 How's Katie?    
 You woke up before her, so too soon to tell.    
 There's virtually no alpha or beta brain activity.    
 We must have missed something during the separation surgery.    
 We didn't.    
 Katie's BP was steady, sats were fine,    
 regional blood supplies were reconstructed.    
 Just like Jenny, yet she's awake,    
 Katie's in a coma.    
 KO: Katie's got the new sagittal graft.    
 A problem with blood flow in that vein could cause her condition.    
 An MRI angiogram should tell us if the graft is open or not.    
 SHAUN: Hello.    
 I will proceed with the angiogram.    
 Whoa!    
 Murphy, you've been gone for two days.    
 How about we start there?    
 Okay.    
 Just because you talked to the president    
 doesn't qualify as permission.    
 Okay. Yes.    
 I... will notify Dr. Melendez    
 next time I go on a road trip with my girlfriend.    
 Amazing.    
 "Road trip"?    
 Dr. Glassman said you were dealing with a personal crisis.    
 That is true.    
 Do you know the definition of personal crisis?    
 Yes. A stage in a sequence of events    
 at which the trend of all future events is determined.    
 - A death, an illness. 
- Yes.    
 No, not a road trip.    
 Okay.    
 You and Dr. Browne    
 get going on Katie's angiogram, unless, of course,    
 you have any personal emergencies to attend to.    
 No. My crisis is over.    
 [KNOCK ON DOOR]    
 Come in.    
 Hey.    
 How are the twins doing?    
 Jenny's in recovery.    
 Her numbers look good. She's talking.    
 Katie... not so good.    
 We need to talk about Murphy.    
 I told you he's on personal leave.    
 Yeah, well, that's not what he said.    
 You talked to him?    
 Yes.    
 In the surgical unit five minutes ago.    
 ♪    
 There's the sagittal vein graft we constructed for Katie.    
 It's open with good flow.    
 Graft is fine.    
 Which means we still have no explanation for her coma.    
 Go in closer.    
 [BEEPING]    
 The middle cerebral vein,    
 it has low flow out of the brain.    
 You're thinking low flow out means low flow in?    
 Yes, that is what I'm thinking.    
 We should look at the arterial inflow phase.    
 We'd like to look at the arterial inflow phase, please.    
 CLAIRE: So, what'd you do on your trip?    
 Well, sometimes when we take a road trip,    
 we're running away from something.    
 I kissed Lea.     
 And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.     
 - [BEEP] 
- What is he mad at you about?     
 It's almost entirely blocked.     
 And... there's a malformation in the Circle of Willis.     
 Katie is barely getting any blood to her brain.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 GLASSMAN: Excuse me. Shaun? May I speak with you, please?     
 Dr. Melendez... He was not angry.     
 Oh, no, Shaun. Dr. Melendez is angry with you.     
 He's also angry with me.     
 W-Why?     
 "Why"? Because I lied to him for you.     
 Why did you run away?     
 I didn't... didn't run away.     
 When you leave without notifying your attending,     
 when you drop all of your responsibilities at this hospital...     
 When you leave without telling anyone, including me,     
 then you are running away.

 Yes. Yes, it did.     
 Okay. How?

 For the first time in my life, I was alone.

 Wrongful termination.     
 Dr. Kalu assaulted an attending surgeon.     
 I don't think you have strong legal footing here.     
 There's more to the story.     
 And I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu,     
 but his ends don't justify his means.     
 Obviously we can't tolerate staff members...

 It's less than   millimeters.

 She's just been through a massive operation.     
 The brain tissue hasn't settled.     
 Another could very well stroke Katie out.

 I want to see Katie.     
 I know she's in a coma. I still need to see her.     
 I miss her.     
 We can't risk contamination for either of you.     
 She needs to know I'm there.     
 We understand.     
 You  can't  understand.     
 No one can.     
 We have always been there for each other,     
 and now when she needs me most, I'm not there.     
 You've just been through a   -hour surgery.     
 We need you to focus on your own healing.     
 And what about her heart?     
 We're going to do a cardiac catheterization test     
 to see if her heart circulation has improved.     
 Inject the contrast to evaluate the heart's blood supply.     
 How's my soul looking?     
 That's a different specialty.     
 Katie says the eyes are the window to the soul.     
 I say the eyes lie. It's the heart.     
 Well, then, so far your soul is looking good.     
 Strong, unobstructed blood flow.     
 Ventriculogram will tell us how the muscle function's doing.     
 So quiet. Is everything okay?     
 Ventricle's strained and dilated.     
 We were hoping for some improvement post-separation,     
 but it's barely pumping.     
 It just doesn't make any sense.     
 The separation was supposed     
 to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.     
 Half the need, half the work.     
 Jenny's heart was even sicker than it appeared.     
 Seems we couldn't see that because Katie's heart     
 was doing all the work for Jenny's.     
 What can we do to fix it?     
 Give her a new heart.     
 We're not gonna find a donor match in time.     
 Yes, we already have the perfect heart for Jenny.     
 The sisters are monozygotic and therefore a genetic match.     
 On the other hand, Katie is alive.     
 - She is GCS- . 
- Her heart is still beating.     
 Yes, but she is unresponsive.     
 And I don't see a way to return blood flow to the brain.     
 In all likelihood, Katie's not coming back.     
 Yes, Katie very well may die, but we can't predict when that'll be.     
 It could be today. It could be    years from now.     
 If Katie stays on the ventilator.     
 - That's not up to us. 
- I know.

 Jenny might not make it through the night.

 But what we can say with certainty     
 is that without Katie's heart, Jenny will die.     
 Can we wait?     
 Just a little. Maybe you'll know more.

 Do you remember that?     
 I do.     
 Your response was to settle with the nurse     
 while Dr. Marshall was let off with a warning.     
 There's another almost identical instance earlier in that year.     
 In both cases, the doctors in question were white.     
 They were censured. Dr. Kalu was fired.

 That I favor white people?     
 Then why the leniency then and not now?     
 They're stars...

 Doctors like Marshall allow St. Bonaventure     
 to compete with other West Coast institutions.     
 So, that's our defense?     
 "We're not racist. We just allow our doctors     
 to assault people as long as they bring in enough donors."

 They need each other. They always have.     
 The issue right now has become Jenny and her heart.     
 When Katie was in a coma, the metabolic demand on her heart was very low,     
 but now that she's alert and active,     
 there just isn't enough heart for both of them.     
 What does that mean?     
 We're awaiting test results.     
 We're not sure how long Katie's heart     
 can tolerate the strain of supporting Jenny's circulation.     
 We'll closely monitor them with cardiac labs and echoes.     
 We need to find a donor heart for Jenny as soon as possible.

 I've had CEOs settle for half of what I just got for you.

 That's beautiful. It's admirable, even.

 they hurt you,     
 we hurt them by making them cut you a massive check.     
 I don't want them to hurt.     
 I want them to give me my job back.

 Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.     
 Yeah, but does she know you're going there

 I'm not.

 Well, Lea's not the only one that can do that.

 Jenny Kunkler's cardio protein levels are...     
 I've never seen anything like it.     
 That's because the levels are for two hearts, not one.
