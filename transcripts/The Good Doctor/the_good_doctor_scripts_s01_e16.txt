 My neighbor Kenny and his girlfriend go all the time.   
 The rides were actually fun, Claire,   
 even though they hurl you through the air very quickly   
 without a proper three-point seatbelt.   
 It was worth the $    I spent.   
 What kind of carnival will cost you that much money?   
 It was not just the carnival.   
 Kenny's girlfriend wanted to go to see a movie afterwards,   
 but I just got the second edition    
 of Chaikof's "Atlas of Vascular Therapy"    
 so decided not to go.    
 And you paid for everyone?    
 I had to. I lost the bet.    
 Rounds will have to wait. We have a consult come up.    
 Hunter Denoble,   ...    
 Came into the E.R. this morning complaining of severe neck pain.    
 X-rays show anterolisthesis.    
 A herniated disc...    a little young for that, isn't it?    
 Unless there's a history of spinal trauma.    
 There is.    
 Hunter fractured seven vertebrae in his neck and back    
 in a motorcycle accident    years ago.    
 He's one of my first patients...    
 suffered complete paralysis from the chest down.    
 ...A few months back, just gnawing pain.    
 Ibuprofen usually took the edge off.    
 Every day?    
 Uh, yeah, give or take.    
 It's not that bad.    
 Last night things changed.    
 He couldn't move his neck at all,    
 and the pain medicine had no effect.    
 So, he wanted to tough it out, 
but I dragged him in here.    
 Yeah, it sounds like you.    
 - [CHUCKLES] 
- Feel that?    
 Yeah.    
 - And that? 
- Mm-hmm.    
 I made partner at the firm.    
 I don't like to call in sick.    
 And let's face it, I've spent    
 enough nights in hospital rooms for five lifetimes.    
 Can't argue with that.    
 Squeeze my hands.    
 You have any tingling or weakness in your arms?    
 No.    
 The plain films showed what looked like a herniated disc...    
 which would mean...?    
 Artificial disc replacement...    
 Day procedure, he'd be out by the morning at the latest.    
 You married him?    
 Yes, three years ago in Cancún. It was lovely.    
 Even though he's in a wheelchair?    
 - Shaun. 
- Oh, no worries.    
 I get this all the time.    
 Sure, she can never wear heels, but think of the parking.    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 [GROANS, INHALES]    
 MELENDEZ: What happened?    
 Pain shot right down through my legs.    
 - Your legs? 
- Yeah.    
 I haven't felt anything below my chest in    years.    
 What the hell is going on?

 [GASPS]    
 Well, there's my girl.    
 I don't want to see you.    
 But I haven't seen you in years.    
 Don't run away from me.    
 - Can we talk? 
- Since I don't want to see you,    
 it follows that I don't want to hear from you, either.    
 I just came in to get antibiotics.    
 My surgeon doesn't work on Fridays.    
 It feels fine.    
 Sorry, it's not fine.    
 This implant is definitely infected.    
 Just that one, though, right?    
 Yes. At this point,    
 your butt lift, tummy tuck, lipo, and breast augmentation    
 appear to be healthy.    
 But I need to remove this one and clean the area    
 before the bacteria spreads.    
 Well, can you replace it?    
 Once the infection is resolved    
 and you have a few months to heal.    
 I don't want to walk around with half of a face for a few months.    
 Isn't there anything you can do to save the implant?    
 I can't make any guarantees,    
 but if I can replace the implant without risking re-infection,    
 I will.    
 Okay, Doctor.     
 I didn't understand the lyrics, but I liked your mom's voice.     
 Is she a professional singer?     
 She is a lot of things.     
 Great mom wasn't one of them.     
 How so?     
 A lot of people have issues with their parents, nothing new.     
 But everyone's story's different.     
 How so?     
 When I was in high school,     
 I babysat the kids in my neighborhood.     
 I wanted to buy a laptop for school     
 like a lot of my friends had,     
 so I saved up  ,    bucks.     
 I came home one day,     
 and the money was gone and so was my mother.     
 And three days later,     
 she came back from Reno     
 with a designer dress and a guy named Ricky.     
 I never got the laptop.     
 ♪     
 My mom made pancakes.     
 They were good.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Mm, what is that?     
 I've never seen anything like that.     
 Maybe a spinal column tumor.     
 Hunter's initial spinal cord injury     
 from the motorcycle accident     
 that caused his paralysis was at T ,     
 but that part looks almost completely normal now.     
 Hunter's phantom pain is real.     
 My former mentor, Sonya Kung,     
 is head of the surgical residency program     
 at Denver Memorial Hospital.     
 If you want a meeting, I'll make the call.     
 Why?     
 You're gonna need a job after this year.     
 You just trying to screw with my head,     
 or are you actually being serious?     
 The opportunity is real.     
 I'm trying to be nice.     
 I do that when it doesn't hurt me.     
 And this definitely doesn't hurt you,     
 you getting rid of some competition.     
 True, although you're not high on my list of threats.     
 This would be a much bigger benefit for you.     
 Look, I fought to stay here.     
 I'm not going anywhere.     
 ♪     
 It's very rare, but after many years     
 with a bruised cord like yours that isn't severed,     
 it can start to function again.     
 So, this mass is causing Hunter's pain?     
 Yes.     
 If the cord is healthy,     
 why aren't I feeling more than pain?     
 The mass is compressing the healthy cord,     
 just letting the pain through.     
 We still have to do     
 some more advanced imaging to map the mass,     
 but I am fairly confident     
 that if we removed it that could change.     
 You may be able to walk again.     
 ♪     
 We were able to clean out the infection     
 and swap in a new implant. I am very pleased.     
 You think it looks okay?     
 I love it, and you are going to look great at the beach.     
 Wailea?     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 We went there on our honeymoon.     
 Thank you. [LAUGHS]     
 Ooh.     
 He's taking you to Hawaii. You should be hugging him.     
 Oh, I'm so relieved.     
 Satisfied customers...     
 This is why cosmetics is the most fun specialty.     
 Now, we're gonna monitor you closely.     
 There is a risk     
 the infection could have seeded to other implants.     
 - Keep me posted. 
- Yes, Chief.     
 I'll take the early shift.     
 Once I'm on my feet, I'm never sitting down again.     
 I'm gonna take Cora dancing.     
 She's a great dancer.     
 Oh, no.     
 I push myself.     
 No offense. It's my rule.     
 [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA]     
 Right.     
 If this works,     
 after a considerable amount of physical therapy     
 you may be able to walk,     
 but that doesn't mean you'll be a very good dancer.     
 After years of atrophy from not moving your legs,     
 you will likely be very bad.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 You know what the worst part is?     
 It isn't being in the chair.     
 It's that people see the chair first.     
 They don't see me.     
 You know what I'm talking about.     
 Why would I know what you're talking about?     
 My brother-in-law's on the spectrum.     
 So's my assistant.     
 I make it a priority of hiring people with disabilities.     
 Let me guess...     
 When you first started working here,     
 - no one believed in you. 
- They didn't know me.     
 They didn't know that I was going to make a good surgeon.     
 No.     
 You were different.     
 I guarantee you every other doctor     
 started with a basic level of respect.     
 It's implied they're competent.     
 We waste our time and energy trying to prove that we belong.     
 ♪     
 EMMA: I'm fine.     
 She's just being thorough, honey.     
 You've been over my body three times.     
 Early infections often mimic blemishes.     
 It pays to be thorough.     
 Is this sore?     
 [BREATHES SHARPLY]     
 Maybe a little.     
 What's wrong?     
 It could be nothing,     
 or it could be a carbuncle, an early sign of infection.     
 Dr. Andrews needs to have a look at this.     
 This varicocele is raising testicular temperature     
 and causing your sperm count to be low.     
 Surgically, I go in, ligate the varicocele     
 and re-check your numbers in a few weeks.     
 It's done under a local,     
 so no anesthesia risks, minimal blood loss.     
 There's a risk of low testosterone and impotence,     
 but recovery time's usually a week at most.     
 So, I could have kids, I just might not be able to make them?     
 As I said, it's low risk.     
 I only mention it because I'm obligated to inform you.     
 Well, you're obligated to inform me because it's a risk.     
 It's an unlikely complication, but, yes, it happens.     
 It's outpatient.     
 I do it right here in the office.     
 What I see here is a chance to fix a problem.     
 And I see a chance to create a new one.     
 [CELLPHONE VIBRATES]     
 I'm... I'm sorry, I have to go. I have a patient.     
 [CLEARS THROAT]     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Look, I see a lot of men with this issue.     
 Sure, they come in because they want kids,     
 but I think what they really want is to reaffirm themselves.     
 And that's a good thing.     
 Thank you.     
 It's a spinal arachnoid meningioma.     
 Have you seen one of these before?     
 MELENDEZ: Much smaller.     
 They usually don't get this big     
 because the pain and weakness     
 brings the patient into the E.R. fast.     
 But in this case, no pain,     
 no E.R. visit until it got this big.     
 And it's wrapped around the spinal cord tightly     
 and fused with the dura.     
 Can we get a fiber-optic laser and take it out in segments?     
 No, I don't think so.     
 It stopped growing and settled in this position.     
 But I do think that we can dissect     
 along the subarachnoid plane     
 down to the largest segment at T      
 and remove it in one piece.     
 That's an extension of the mass.     
 Mm, no. It's the medullary pyramids.     
 No. It's an extension of the mass.     
 The pyramids are more central and the color is wrong.     
 Murphy's right.     
 The extension's tightly adhered to the brainstem.     
 ANDREWS: Who caught it?     
 Jared did.     
 Nice work.     
 Most first-year residents would have missed this.     
 It's very small on the surface,     
 but I can feel the fluctuance under the skin.     
 What do we need to do to fix it?     
 [REMOVES GLOVES]     
 We need to remove all of the implants     
 and some of the healthy underlying tissue as well.     
 Unfortunately, it will cause significant permanent scarring.     
 No, no, no, you... you can't do that.     
 I'll look worse than I did before.     
 I-I don't get it. You removed the bad part from her face,     
 and it's fixed... looks good, no more infection.     
 Let's just do the same with the rest of 'em.     
 It's not that simple.     
 When we removed the infection from Emma's cheek,     
 it was under the pretense it was a localized issue.     
 If we just take out the infection from the new area,     
 it could jump again.     
 I won't do it.     
 When an infection spreads, it often moves very quickly.     
 What Dr. Andrews is saying...     
 I understand what he's saying.     
 I'm    years old.     
 When I went to drop my daughter off at Michigan,     
 we went to that bar on Liberty Street,     
 where we first met.     
 I saw myself sitting there   years ago...     
 young, confident, full of potential.     
 Then you raise a kid     
 and look after your husband, a home.     
 You lose touch with who you were.     
 You... you said it was an infection, right?     
 Like strep throat or something.     
 That's what antibiotics are for.     
 Couldn't we just use that?     
 We could try strong, broad-spectrum antibiotics,     
 but I really don't want to do that.     
 You could become septic.     
 You could die.     
 ♪     
 It'll work. It has to.     
 The brainstem is complex.     
 Even our best imaging can't provide a complete picture.     
 So, then, you would just leave the cyst in him?     
 SHAUN: Other than the pain, it's not harming Hunter.     
 It's stabilized now and done growing.     
 But what about the pain?     
 An implanted nerve inhibitor will completely remove the pain.     
 But I won't be able to walk.     
 No.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Exactly how risky is removing the mass from the brainstem?     
 Everything that keeps your heart beating     
 and you breathing is right there.     
 The nerve inhibitor is a day procedure.     
 You'd sleep in your bed tonight pain-free.     
 Give me a percentage on this thing.     
 Don't do this to yourself.     
 I don't like to give those kinds of numbers.     
 They're population-based,     
 and they don't apply to your exact circumstance.     
 I understand how statistics work.     
 But there's a number, and it's relevant.     
 There's a   % chance the surgery would kill you.

 I remember the moment I accepted I'd never walk again.     
 It wasn't when Dr. Melendez told me after the accident.     
 It was a few months later when I was in rehab

 I looked out the window

 you take a risk something bad could happen.     
 But you do it anyway,     
 you know, to make yourself better,     
 to make the world better,     
 sometimes just to have fun.     
 Sometimes to go to a carnival.

 In my experience, there are only two reasons     
 why a married person has this kind of cosmetic surgery.     
 Either you're halfway out the door or she is.     
 Emma loves me.     
 That's what I figured.     
 The antibiotics aren't working,     
 so your wife is going to die     
 unless you get in there and you convince her     
 that she doesn't need any of this cosmetic surgery     
 because you are a faithful, loving husband.     
 CORA: How's the pain?     
 You know, I think the adrenaline     
 of actually doing this is helping.
