 A diversion? 
  Why? 
  [SIGHS] 
  So we can get in. 
  Yeah, I got that part. 
  Why? 
  Remember when we used to get high, and you'd ask, every time, "Why is it blue?" And I would say, "It's always blue, man. 
  " Y-Yeah, except that never happened. 
  That's a fake memory. 
  I-I didn't meet you till the hospital. 
  But you remember it, right? 
  Fake, real, you remember it! 
  So it happened. 
  Are you you at all? 
  Lenny from the-the hospital, the corn flake girl? 
  Who couldn't stand the word "nipples"? 
  Or is this just a a mask? 
  [GROANS] 
  Does it matter? 
  Bodies and minds, humanity. 
  Nobody has ever asked a puma its opinion. 
  Or a stalk of asparagus how it feels. 
  My associate is who she needs to be at this moment. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Look, all I know is she said to help you Syd and I love her, I trust her, so I-I will. 
  Just, no more lies. 
  If we're gonna do this, if I'm gonna help you find your body, you're gonna give me back my friends, and we're gonna do whatever she Syd, future Syd Whatever she says. 
  But let me be ultra clear: nobody gets hurt. 
  You got it? 
  [THUNDER RUMBLING] 
  OLIVER: He agreed. 
  We go tonight. 
  OLIVER 2: Don't worry. 
  We'll find it. 
  [QUIETLY] 
  : When I spoke to the boss Fukyama. 
  He said the plan was to kill Oliver when we find him. 
  Let's make sure we find him first. 
  DAVID: Is he sh-she are they I don't know what to call them. 
  We call them Vermillion. 
  DAVID: Are they mutants? 
  Androids, I think. 
  Synthetic, artificial. 
  I'll be honest. 
  They made me nervous at first. 
  But now I find them soothing. 
  They've got no memories for me. 
  Just data. 
  How many are there? 
  No one knows. 
  All right, stop the truck! 
  SYD: Why? 
  We're here. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  VERMILLION 1: Lead us. 
  PTONOMY: What is that? 
  Syd. 
  VERMILLION 2: Chance the object is explosive in nature VERMILLION 3: 27%. 
  [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] 
  DAVID: What's wrong? 
  SYD: Nothing. 
  Just your asshole parasite messing with my head. 
  PTONOMY: Stay alert. 
  This feels like a trap. 
  No, they're gone. 
  VERMILLION 2: An error? 
  DAVID: Trick. 
  He knew I was looking, showed me this spot, - and then left. 
  - PTONOMY: So, if Oliver's not here, where is he? 
  Would you Like to swing on a star Whoa, ho, ho Carry moonbeams home - In a jar - [GUNFIRE] 
  Whoa, ho, ho And be better off - Than you are - Oh, ho, ho Or would you rather be a pig? 
  Bang. 
  [SNORTING] 
  A-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Or would you rather be a fish? 
  Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Stop, stop, don't. 
  Run away. 
  Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-doo. 
  I-It's advanced, but but not Shi'ar. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  That was my first guess, as well. 
  No. 
  I-I can't shake the feeling that somehow I constructed it, this-this orb. 
  Believe me, I know how that sounds, yes. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  OLIVER: A-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. 
  [OLIVER HUMMING] 
  [HUMMING CONTINUES] 
  [TEETH CHATTERING] 
  [CLINKING] 
  OLIVER: A-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. 
  Oliver. 
  It's me. 
  Cary. 
  Can you hear me in there? 
  - OLIVER [ECHOING] : Can you hear me in here? 
  - [SHOUTS] 
  Oh! 
  - [HISSES] 
  - [GROANS] 
  Let's dance, asshole. 
  [GASPS] 
  Kerry? 
  I'm scared. 
  [SHOUTS] 
  [GROANS] 
  Hey, you. 
  [REVERBERATING] 
  [FOOTFALLS THUNDERING] 
  [GRUNTING] 
  Where is he? 
  Cary. 
  [EXHALES] 
  Hey. 
  Are you okay? 
  Yeah, I'm-I'm okay. 
  Third floor's secure. 
  Report. 
  [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
  Come on. 
  [PANTING] 
  Um [GRUNTING] 
  - Can you feel them? 
  - Hmm? 
  Are they still here? 
  Uh No, they're, they're gone. 
  - [GRUNTING] 
  - Okay, come on. 
  Kerry? 
  What's wrong? 
  [CARY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] 
  Whoa. 
  [MELANIE MOANS] 
  OLIVER: Melanie. 
  Is he here? 
  The monk of the Mi-Go order? 
  Have you seen him? 
  Is he here? 
  At Division 3? 
  The monk of the Mi-Go order? 
  MELANIE: He was searching for a monk. 
  A member of the Mi-Go order. 
  Oliver believes he's hiding here. 
  Impossible. 
  Why? 
  VERMILLION 3: Many years ago, the Mi-Go monks were wiped out by The Miser Sunday. 
  Miser who? 
  I believe it was before your time. 
  But you've heard the same rumors I have. 
  When Amahl Farouk was defeated, his mind was separated from his body. 
  MELANIE: But his body was then hidden away with the monks. 
  So, if Farouk was looking for his body A Mi-Go monk would know its location. 
  Right. 
  So, is the monk here or not? 
  We will put this in simple terms. 
  David Haller, there's a 63% chance you've been lying to us. 
  Sixty-three? 
  MELANIE: Lie exactly about what? 
  Everything. 
  That's a lot. 
  VERMILLION 1: You led us from the building while the Shadow King broke in. 
  A diversion? 
  Working in conjunction with Farouk. 
  - Conspiring. 
  - SYD: He told you. 
  Farouk tricked us out of the building. 
  That's what he does. 
  Trick people. 
  - Syd - No. 
  Tell them. 
  I'd be careful who you blame right now. 
  Maybe don't piss off our only hope of killing the monster. 
  DAVID [ECHOING] : Nobody nobody nobody gets hurt. 
  Nobody nobody nobody gets hurt. 
  [KERRY GRUNTING] 
  KERRY: Ow. 
  That was too loud. 
  Is that what I sound like? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - CARY: Kerry? 
  - What? 
  - CARY: I'm scared. 
  - I know. 
  I'm scared, too. 
  DAVID: Kerry? 
  Are you okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Try getting flipped inside out and see how you like it. 
  You want something? 
  I need more help finding Farouk. 
  - DAVID 1: Liar. 
  - DAVID 2: Shut up, shut up. 
  Some modifications to the tank. 
  Do I look like the fix-it guy? 
  Or any guy? 
  I'm the X-chromosome ass kicker. 
  Or maybe you missed the part where there was an arm sticking out of my stomach. 
  - I just - DAVID 1: Tell her the truth. 
  I wouldn't ask unless DAVID 2: You need to talk to Syd. 
  Future Syd. 
  It's important. 
  DAVID 1: Is that did you just give her a nickname? 
  DAVID 2: She's looking at us. 
  Say something. 
  The sooner we find Farouk, the sooner we can get you guys, you know, back the way you were. 
  He said that made sense. 
  - Who? 
  - Cary. 
  In my head. 
  Right. 
  Well, I was thinking, if you modify the tank, if there was some way I could see past the right now 'cause his thoughts are shielded. 
  He's hiding from me. 
  But if I could find a way outside of space and time, see the past where he's been or maybe the future, where he's gonna be Multidimensional perception. 
  I just I need to get ahead of him. 
  Cary said it might be too dangerous and that you could explode. 
  Well I trust you him so so let's try to avoid that. 
  [WHIRRING] 
  Which one? 
  [DAVID SHOUTS] 
  Sorry. 
  [GROANING] 
  Yellow 40. 
  Speak up. 
  Oh [GRUNTS, INHALES SHARPLY] 
  Okay, which switch? 
  The one with the lightning bolt. 
  It's his funeral. 
  [WHOOSHING] 
  [GRUNTING] 
  Okay. 
  Cary says, "Hang on. " [GROANS] 
  More! 
  More! 
  Hello? 
  [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Syd. 
  It worked. 
  You are you real? 
  Possible. 
  Not possible. 
  To be here, for you to be here. 
  DAVID: Well, I'm here. 
  We're here. 
  I had to see you again to understand. 
  They killed people. 
  I-I let them. 
  I helped them because you said What? 
  I never thought I'd see you again like this. 
  What, am I dead in the future? 
  Wait, am I dead? 
  It's complicated. 
  Good complicated? 
  - Oh! 
  - [FEEDBACK SCREECHES] 
  Ow! 
  [GROANS] 
  Wha-What-what is it? 
  Ah, I tried to read your mind. 
  I don't think that works because I'm from the Future. 
  Yeah, I got that. 
  Look, I don't know what happens to me, to us, what disaster or monster, but you came to me because of love. 
  What we have You trust me. 
  And I trust you. 
  But what you're asking to help this thing, I got to know why. 
  It started like any other idea as an egg. 
  And then the few of us who are left went into hiding. 
  But we don't have long. 
  It's coming. 
  DAVID: What's coming? 
  - Farouk? 
  - No, he's dead in my timeline. 
  You killed him. 
  When? 
  About a week from now. 
  In the desert. 
  You bashed his brains in. 
  Huh. 
  Well, then, who? 
  It doesn't matter. 
  We need him when things turn. 
  He killed He killed a few. 
  This thing kills everyone. 
  Kills every-everyone. 
  You're so different. 
  Time does that to people. 
  Apparently. 
  You're how you were. 
  In the past, before. 
  Sweet. 
  Can I see you again? 
  You brought me. 
  It isn't my decision. 
  Well, if it was your decision, would you like to see me again? 
  Like this? 
  NARRATOR: A wise man once said, "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away. 
  " For the tick, reality is a product of temperature and butyric acid. 
  Its perception of the world is its reality. 
  The bloodhound has 200 million scent receptors. 
  Its perception of the world is based fundamentally on smell. 
  A dog doesn't reason. 
  A tick never thinks about the universe in any way separate from its biological interactions with the universe. 
  Human beings, on the other hand Imagine a boy. 
  From a young age, he is taught wrong. 
  This color is called red. 
  This one is green. 
  Red. 
  Green. 
  NARRATOR: Human beings are the only animal that forms ideas about their world. 
  We perceive it not through our bodies but through our minds. 
  Remember, red means stop, green means go. 
  NARRATOR: We must agree on what is real. 
  [CAR SKIDDING, LOUD CRASH] 
  [PEOPLE GASPING] 
  Because of this, we are the only animal on Earth that goes mad. 
  CLARK: Hi. 
  You have a minute? 
  DAVID: Actually, I was I was just CLARK: Oh, it'll only take a second. 
  I feel like this is our spot. 
  Are you 'Cause I got I was going in the tank to Oh, you were just in there, I thought. 
  Some modifications to get outside space-time. 
  Isn't that what you told Kerry? 
  Over my head, the science, but I got to ask did it work? 
  What? 
  That line you gave about seeing where Farouk was gonna be Or where he was. 
  - I'm - No, of course we know where he was. 
  He was here. 
  He killed 11 of my men, turned one into a pig, scared the sh1t out of a bunch of kids. 
  I feel like, in order to answer that question, I need to explain how telepathy works. 
  Did you find him? 
  Yes or no? 
  He hides. 
  I used to think it was just inside Oliver's mind, but then I realized he keeps other minds in there with him. 
  Lenny. 
  Maybe others. 
  And when he senses me looking, he brings one forward and hides inside of it. 
  So, uh, what you're saying is, you're useless. 
  Or maybe you're Maybe I'm what? 
  Are you familiar with the term "collusion"? 
  You're starting to make me mad. 
  Oh, are you gonna put more office supplies in my face? 
  Burn me alive? 
  That's You were the bad guy. 
  Yeah, that's funny. 
  I thought you were the bad guy. 
  CLARK: I know you're lying. 
  I think you're helping him, but I don't know why. 
  DAVID: And I think your job is to suspect everyone, and that makes everyone a suspect. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Why'd you take us to the desert? 
  I told you, I saw him there. 
  Amahl Farouk. 
  The Shadow King. 
  Yeah, but I-I thought you didn't know what he looked like. 
  Oliver. 
  He's in Oliver. 
  That's who I saw. 
  That's not what you said. 
  Just let me do my job. 
  This'll all be over soon enough. 
  Okay. 
  But just remember [SINGSONGY] : we see everything. 
  [SLURPS] 
  [TONE SOUNDS] 
  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P. A. ] 
  [SIGHS] 
  DAVID: Be strong. 
  Tell him we're in control. 
  Nobody else gets hurt. 
  Oliver, Farouk. 
  We need to talk. 
  [BELL CHIMES] 
  [WIND WHISTLING] 
  [BELL CHIMES] 
  Why so sad, my dear? 
  Where's Oliver? 
  Oh, wait, are you Monsieur Amahl Farouk. 
  You heard that? 
  It's a muscle, my dear. 
  The big gray meat. 
  You got to work it out, get it stronger. 
  Learn this stuff. 
  You decide what is real and what is not. 
  You. 
  Your will. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What is the phrase? 
  Um The kiddie table. 
  You got to get up from the kiddie table. 
  Come and sit with the big boys. 
  It's all about respect, my man. 
  You and I, we are les dieux. 
  Gods. 
  What did John Lennon say? 
  Bigger than Jesus. 
  Look at you, such a sad face. 
  Why you got such a sad face? 
  You read my mind. 
  You tell me. 
  Oh You feel boo-hoo. 
  Used. 
  Now we need to figure out if you're mad at me or yourself. 
  Ah [CROWD CHEERING] 
  Yeah. 
  Ah. 
  Le sport. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
 
 
 
  Physical. 
  Very physical. 
  What is the word? 
  Uh homoerotic. 
  - Huh? 
  - Shut up. 
  [BOTH GRUNTING] 
  [FAROUK LAUGHING] 
  Oh, you're strong. 
  Very strong. 
  [BOTH GRUNTING] 
  FAROUK: But you're playing the wrong game. 
  Shall we continue? 
  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  I told her I'd help you. 
  And I will. 
  But no more violence. 
  [GRUNTING] 
  Or what? 
  More violence? 
  Huh? 
  I don't trust you. 
  I don't need you to trust me, but you will respect me. 
  I'm not some cockroach that you can step on with a boot. 
  If you help me to find my body, I will be in your debt. 
  And where I come from, debt is something that must be honored. 
  No more killing. 
  [GROANS] 
  Promise. 
  Fine. 
  I promise. 
  I'll find your monk if he's at Division 3. 
  Wait for my signal. 
  [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
  [SQUEAKING] 
  LENNY: You know, I was thinking now that you're, uh, out of the closet, you and the kid talking again, face-to-face, that maybe I could go. 
  Go where? 
  You know. 
  Back to my life! 
  Right? 
  But you're dead, your body. 
  [SNAPS FINGERS] 
  But I was thinking maybe you could make me a new one. 
  Right? 
  Come on. 
  You'd be the ultimate badass. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  All I'm saying is, you got what you wanted out of me, man. 
  Right? 
  Your friendly neighborhood junkie. 
  You popped me like a tick, stole my face. 
  And I'm not complaining. 
  I'm not, it was it's-it's been a sh1t blast, really. 
  But you know, a little boring. 
  I mean, all-all that haunted house stuff. 
  All that [IMITATING FAROUK] : "David, I I am your conscience. " [CHUCKLES] 
  [NORMAL VOICE] : You know how long it's been since I got laid, man? 
  S-So I was thinking, you know, you-you keep Oliver, right? 
  And-and I can just I'll just sneak out the back door. 
  [PATTING LEG] 
  But I am going, right? 
  Eventually? 
  [ZIPPER OPENS] 
  What would you do? 
  A new life, new body. 
  [EXHALES] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [INHALES] 
  I-I'd live the living sh1t out of it. 
  Then what? 
  Uh Guess I'd die again? 
  [FAROUK GRUNTS] 
  And then what? 
  - [SHARP RINGING] 
  - [PANTING] 
  [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] 
  Speak up, I can't hear you. 
  Louder. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  No, he couldn't have. 
  That's not possible. 
  Uh I-I don't know. 
  Wha [SIGHS] 
  Look, what do we do? 
  I [SCOFFS] 
  like, how? 
  Think harder, okay? 
  Like, how do we? 
  No. 
  No, there's got to be a different way. 
  Because they'll hear me. 
  Look, I'm not embarrassed, I Yes, I want you to be able to get out, I-I just [SIGHS] 
  This better work. 
  Tra, la, la Tra, la, la, la Tra, la, la La, la, la, la, la Tra, la, la Tra, la, la, la [ECHOING]

  There's not much room to move in there. 
  Can you fix it? 
  This? 
  I'll try. 
  I-I I don't want to be out here the whole time. 
  Living life. 
  Like, the boring stuff, that was not our choice. 
  We never had a choice. 
  And for the time being, we're gonna have to learn to exist like this. 
  What is it? 
  What? 
  Uh, it's nothing, uh MELANIE: But Oliver had a dream. 
  He wanted to build a home for people like him. 
  You know, with abilities. 
  And, uh, I didn't have a dream, so I said sure. 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  And we built Summerland. 
  FAROUK: You and I. 
  - We are gods. 
  - His dream became my dream. 
  What did John Lennon say? 
  - Bigger than Jesus. 
  - so busy keeping his dream alive and trying to get him back that I never got around to having a dream of my own. 
  And now I'm older, and, uh, it's over. 
  I don't get a second chance. 
  I was wrong, son. 
  When I told you that your ability was a gift. 
  It's not. 
  It's an obstacle. 
  An obstacle to what? 
  Happiness. 
  Intimacy. 
  You want my advice? 
  Leave. 
  Now. 
  Take Syd and find a nice, quiet hilltop somewhere, settle down. 
  Look at the clouds. 
  Live. 
  But wh-what about What? 
  What about what? 
  Saving the world? 
  The world will be just fine. 
  It always is. 
  I mean, things might get worse for a while. 
  Maybe people will die. 
  Hmm, we all die eventually. 
  The real tragedy is forgetting to live. 
  Save yourself. 
  While you still can. 
  [RUNNING FOOTFALLS] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  DAVID: Syd! 
  [SIGHING] 
  Thank God. 
  [PANTING] 
  [CAT PURRING] 
  Uh hey. 
  SYD: Over here. 
  Y-You're Neat, huh? 
  Yeah, sure. 
  Okay. 
  - Something wrong? 
  - Uh I'm just feeling a bit I'm just I'm just questioning myself, and-and I know I promised I wouldn't tell, but if I tell you, and you're the one It-it's complicated, okay? 
  What are you saying? 
  I know who took me in the orb. 
  You lied? 
  Withheld. 
  What's the difference? 
  Look, do you want to know who took me, or not? 
  - Yes. 
  - It was you. 
  "Me," what? 
  In the orb. 
  Me, the cat? 
  No. 
  Can you? 
  Would-would you get can you switch back to your body? 
  - 'Cause I - [EXHALES] 
  Happy? 
  It was you. 
  In the orb. 
  But not you, you. 
  Like you are now. 
  You from the future. 
  Uh You told me to help Farouk find his body. 
  You sure it was me? 
  I'm not crazy. 
  I didn't say that. 
  You didn't have to. 
  When? 
  "When," what? 
  When in the future? 
  Tomorrow? 
  Next week? 
  A year from now? 
  Longer? 
  I-I don't know. 
  "The future. 
  " - The - That Was I old? 
  Older. 
  - Y-You were - And I asked you to help Farouk. 
  Why would I do that? 
  I, uh, because of the plague? 
  Why didn't you say anything? 
  Because I promised you I-I wouldn't. 
  And to keep my promise You see, I had to I mean technically, telling you your own secret probably is fine, I-I think? 
  I I don't know. 
  I'm still a little shaky on who I'm supposed to not tell. 
  The music box. 
  What about it? 
  It was mine as a kid. 
  Did you do that? 
  Me? 
  No. 
  That was Farouk. 
  It was I didn't like that. 
  Seeing it again. 
  He did that to me. 
  You told me to help him, not like him. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Okay. 
  "Okay," what? 
  If I said that you should do it, then you should do it. 
  Really? 
  Don't you trust me? 
  Her? 
  I mean, you? 
  Yeah, but Like you said. 
  Reality's a choice. 
  How do we start? 
  We find the monk.
