 [playful harpsichord music] 
  [monitor beeps] 
  Where are you right now? 
  Your head's off somewhere. 
  David. 
  Where are you right now? 
  Where are you right now? 
  [equipment beeps] 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  - [moans] 
  - Don't talk. 
  Don't talk. 
  It's okay, we're here. 
  You've had a good burn. 
  But we're gonna get you sorted out. 
  - [moans] 
  - Careful, careful, careful. 
  It's good. 
  It's good. 
  I'm thinking of growing half a mustache. 
  Maybe half a beard. 
  Or what's the look where it's just a beard and no mustache? 
  Darling, hush. 
  [sighs] 
  There's my handsome guy. 
  - Mirror. 
  - Maybe wait until - the swelling goes down. 
  - Give me the God damn mirror. 
  [harpsichord music] 
  [somber tones] 
  [indistinct TV chatter] 
  [laughter on TV] 
  Hey, are you good? 
  Okay, good. 
  [somber tones] 
  [indistinct TV chatter] 
  [thunder rumbling] 
  - Who are you people? 
  - I ask the questions. 
  [sighs] 
  The girl. 
  Where is the girl? 
  I think you're about to find out. 
  [electricity surging] 
  [yelling] 
  Code Black! 
  Do it, now! 
  [explosion booming] 
  Bureau 19 has recommended desk duty. 
  Perfect. 
  Except, you know, in the field. 
  - What? 
  - I said, that's great. 
  Desk duty. 
  Perfect. 
  I'll bring the desk with me. 
  That was my feeling. 
  Small desk, obviously. 
  Maybe it folds up. 
  But that way I'll have it while I'm making the world safe for democracy some more. 
  - Specialists don't - Yeah, okay. 
  Here's the deal. 
  I have burns over 40% of my body and I spent six weeks with a tube jammed into the head of my dick while my husband cried himself to sleep every night. 
  We were ambushed at the pool. 
  Men died. 
  And I am going to finish what I started. 
  So if you want me behind a desk, you better find a portable one. 
  Because the second I walk out of this room, I'm going to war. 
  [dramatic tone] 
  [dramatic music] 
  David. 
  [gun cocks] 
  Hello. 
  Well, love that headband. 
  I know. 
  Me? 
  Not so good. 
  Third degree, thank you very much. 
  Very painful. 
  [inhales deeply] 
  [sighs] 
  We have so much to talk about. 
  - Yeah, you can kill the others. 
  - [guns cocking] 
  No. 
  [dramatic music] 
  [men yelling, grunting] 
  [all yelling, struggling] 
  Put it away. 
  You're right. 
  We need to talk. 
  sh1t. 
  [thrilling music] 
  Team A's been compromised. 
  - Team B? 
  - Ready at the go point. 
  Wait. 
  Personal feelings? 
  Intelligence gathering. 
  Let's see what happens next. 
  So you're just gonna whip up some kind of peace accord, what, before lunch or by dinner? 
  Babe. 
  I don't care if you save me or the world if you don't save yourself. 
  You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia? 
  - You're not - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it. 
  That's the trick. 
  The mind killer. 
  Your disease convinces you, you don't have it. 
  So, for example, one day in the hospital, you meet a girl and she has some friends and they tell you you're not sick. 
  You have super powers. 
  And more than anything, you wanna believe it because that means you're not crazy. 
  It means you can fall in love and live happily ever after. 
  But you know if you believe it if you surrender to the hope and you're wrong, then you're never coming back. 
  I'm here. 
  I'm real. 
  The power is real. 
  You gotta accept it. 
  Otherwise, we can't move on. 
  I was in Clockworks for six years. 
  Drugged, doing nothing. 
  Contributing nothing. 
  And now, finally, I can be useful. 
  I can help. 
  Don't you get it? 
  I am so sick of myself. 
  This only works if it's not about me. 
  David. 
  [building string music] 
  [dog barking] 
  [children laughing] 
  And roger. 
  Be advised we are monitoring situation. 
  We have secure audio and visual. 
  Five by Five on all signals from your position. 
  Maintain current posture. 
  Tactical is in place. 
  We can initiate assualt and extraction on command. 
  Awaiting your signal. 
  Acknowledge. 
  Come on, just let Face-to-face. 
  Please. 
  No. 
  Well, if you've got a better idea Yeah. 
  Kill him. 
  - Kill them all. 
  - Grow up. 
  We can't just murder people. 
  Or is that who we are now? 
  That's who they are. 
  So if you don't want to be dead - Do you have to? 
  - Yes. 
  I absolutely have to. 
  If this thing fails, well you didn't see all of Walter's blood pouring out of his eyes. 
  All right. 
  We move, then. 
  Assume D3 knows our position. 
  Execute Plan M. 
  Just let me talk to him. 
  We have a - rapport. 
  - He tried to kill you. 
  - Twice. 
  - To be fair, the second time, he was just gonna kill you. 
  And anyway, with that kind of thinking - David. 
  - No. 
  With that kind of thinking, wars would never end. 
  David, read his mind. 
  You have the power. 
  You can control it now. 
  We may never get this chance again. 
  To know what D3 knows. 
  Their operations, their spies, their tactics. 
  Read his mind. 
  So use him, you're saying. 
  And then what? 
  - Kill him? 
  - 100%. 
  Hi look, whatever we do, we need to get this parasite out of David's head. 
  And fast. 
  The the halo is losing power. 
  Hey, kid! 
  And when it fails? 
  Think of the Shadow King as a computer virus. 
  It's been in David's head for decades. 
  Learning his systems, bypassing his defenses. 
  Now it's ready to override the original program. 
  Meaning me. 
  Exactly. 
  Meaning you. 
  If we don't get Amahl Farouk out of your head today, he will erase you. 
  Permanently. 
  It's sweet. 
  They think they can save you. 
  [overlapping voices] 
  [machine beeps] 
  [dramatic music] 
  I thought you might be thirsty. 
  [eerie string music] 
  On the table. 
  - Do you have a second to - Don't talk to me. 
  Right, sorry. 
  Just you should, um We should recharge. 
  I'm good. 
  - You two have a fight? 
  - Shut up. 
  She just we She thinks I left her when we were in the Astral Plane. 
  And I I've tried to explain that it wasn't my You need to leave. 
  [door opens] 
  He seems nice. 
  Have I seen you before? 
  No, don't tell me. 
  - I'll remember. 
  - Oliver, could we talk? 
  What's happening, space captain? 
  Uh W-would you like to have dinner with me tonight? 
  Well, uh, I'm on a mostly liquid diet. 
  - I like liquid. 
  - Mmm. 
  You know, uh, you remind me of someone. 
  Your wife? 
  No, that's not it. 
  Ah more No. 
  Ah. 
  Well, we can figure it out over dinner. 
  Hm. 
  Assuming we're not all dead by then. 
  - [beeping] 
  - Watch it, it's vibrating. 
  Oliver, there's vibration. 
  Oh, whoops, uh, that's me. 
  I should Ta for now. 
  [door opens, closes] 
  I'm sorry. 
  Well, if you're not now, you will be. 
  [sighs] 
  Can we move past the threats? 
  I don't think you understand. 
  There's 50 of you. 
  We're a tactical arm of the United States military, working in conjunction with government agencies all over the world. 
  And dinosaurs once ruled the Earth. 
  And remind me what happened to them. 
  Are you threatening the entire human race? 
  Is that do I have that right? 
  What's your name, son? 
  - Clark. 
  - Well, Clark, I'm Melanie. 
  I know. 
  Melanie Bird. 
  Wife of Oliver Anthony Bird. 
  Missing for 20 years and presumed dead. 
  Oh, he'll turn up. 
  They know where I am, Division Three. 
  They'll come looking when we don't check in. 
  I'm thinking 20 minutes. 
  And when they do, they'll bring an army. 
  Here's the thing, Clark: you caught me on a good day, so I'm gonna be honest with you. 
  You were right. 
  About David. 
  He's a world-breaker. 
  And if you'd killed him before he figured that out, then maybe your tactical forces and what is it? 
  World coalition? 
  Maybe that would've impressed me. 
  But not now. 
  Well, kid you better learn to fly like a bird, because the age of the dinosaur is over. 
  [dramatic music] 
  - Is this - It just doesn't, for some reason Is this real? 
  - Feel real. 
  - A simulation. 
  - Are you real? 
  - No, this is real. 
  What is the the point of life? 
  - I don't have - Pretty sure. 
  - An illness. 
  - What's the old - maverick saying? 
  - Trying to what? 
  - 'Cause I'm sick. 
  - Be happy? 
  - You're not - Fulfilled. 
  Schizophrenic. 
  [dramatic music] 
  War is over. 
  If you want it. 
  [machinery charging up] 
  I'm boosting the power, but it it won't last long. 
  You don't look so good. 
  I'm fine. 
  No, something's going on here. 
  Well, this has been great, but I think I hear my ride. 
  Does anybody see a warbird helicopter? 
  You don't have to be afraid. 
  - I'm not. 
  - You don't have to be afraid. 
  You don't have to be afraid. 
  I'm not. 
  You don't. 
  have - to be afraid. 
  - [voices whispering] 
  - Stop saying that. 
  - Why don't you just leave us alone? 
  - Yeah, to do what? 
  - I don't know. 
  Fall in love, have babies. 
  Well, see, now, that's a problem. 
  'Cause your babies and my babies, who wins that sandbox squabble? 
  You don't have to be I know, I don't have to be afraid, but I am because look at you. 
  All of you. 
  You're gods. 
  And someday, you're gonna wake up and realize you don't need to listen to us anymore. 
  [voices whispering] 
  Well isn't that the history of the world? 
  People of different nations, different languages, learning to live together. 
  [exhales] 
  David? 
  Hey, sexy. 
  You can't be here. 
  Why not? 
  'Cause David put a hat on? 
  Look, front door closes, I go in the back. 
  You like that, don't you? 
  - [squishing] 
  - A little backdoor action. 
  [fly buzzing] 
  You're gonna help me. 
  No. 
  [eerie sting] 
  I'm really not. 
  We're connected, kid. 
  You, David, me. 
  It's your fault. 
  When you were in his head, I was in yours. 
  And I may not be on his frequency right now, but you can hear me just fine, can't you? 
  Stop. 
  My mother died a few years back. 
  Cancer. 
  She tried all the things. 
  Chemo, radiation, surgery. 
  You know what they do with a tumor when they cut it out? 
  They put it in a bag and burn it. 
  Am I the tumor in this? 
  Your Lenny mask is running. 
  Oh, I've got other faces. 
  [eerie sting] 
  Stop it. 
  You're gonna help me escape. 
  You want me out of David? 
  Fine, I'm gone. 
  But you have to help me get away. 
  Why would I do that? 
  Because if you don't, I'll kill him. 
  Not if we kill you first. 
  You ever make soup? 
  Cut up the meat, vegetables, add broth, cook it for a couple hours. 
  You ever try to unmake soup? 
  I'm part of him. 
  And the only way you're gonna get me out without killing him is if I decide to leave on my own. 
  There it is. 
  Now you see. 
  - How would I - You're smart, for a lady. 
  You'll figure it out. 
  Look, even if I wanted to, I'm not even in the top three tiers of We're talking about three branches of government. 
  I just need a meeting, face-to-face. 
  Why? 
  So you can melt their heads? 
  All right, this meeting is over. 
  No, I need a meeting so that I can change their mind We need to get him to the lab. 
  So what's going on? 
  Is he sick? 
  Nothing. 
  Ptonomy, get him to holding. 
  He's not sick. 
  He has some kind of creature in his head. 
  A mutant. 
  Very old. 
  - Syd! 
  - No. 
  David's right. 
  Trust. 
  This thing attached itself to him when he was a kid. 
  Like a parasite. 
  It's trying to erase him. 
  But we're gonna get it out. 
  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you like David. 
  I think you feel something for him. 
  So I'm gonna give you a chance here. 
  You wanna help? 
  That's nice. 
  Take him to the cell. 
  I can't risk it. 
  [dramatic music] 
 
 
 
  [door closes] 
  [dramatic music] 
  Try anything and I snap your neck. 
  What happened to trust? 
  General? 
  Major Briggs wants permission - to launch the peacemaker. 
  - No. 
  Tell him to move one click closer then hold. 
  I'm giving your man another hour. 
  [string music crescendos] 
  Mm, what happened? 
  Doesn't matter, we'll probably all be dead in ten minutes. 
  Why am I tied down? 
  You tell me. 
  God, I can feel him inside, trying to force his way out. 
  Use your power. 
  You just have to hold on for a little while longer. 
  God. 
  And then what? 
  Then when we pull, you push. 
  What And boom goes the dynamite. 
  [intense music] 
  I'll be you know where. 
  Okay, here we go. 
  Wait. 
  How does it work? 
  We've identified a second set of brain waves inside David's head. 
  Now, this device targets everything that isn't David. 
  It creates a vortex A kind of a magnetic field Which sucks out hopefully every last trace of Farouk. 
  And leaves David intact. 
  - How will I know - [machine clangs on] 
  [electronic whirring] 
  - [Pink Floyd's "Breathe"] 
  - [woman vocalizing]

  [growling] 
  [Pink Floyd's "On the Run"] 
  [indistinct voices] 
  It's working. 
  See? 
  Yes.

  [dramatic music] 
  Hold on, it It's fighting back. 
  [machinery humming]

  Lenny. 
  Whoa. 
  [music box playing] 
  I was just wondering What am I without you? 
  You know, we've been together for so long. 
  Sun and moon. 
  You know, people lose a limb and in the night years go by And still, they reach for it. 
  You're the phantom. 
  Are you my phantom? 
  What happens to me when you're gone? 
  I'm not leaving!
