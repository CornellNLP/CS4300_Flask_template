Yes, but my condition has nothing to do with that. I didn't make her up. She's a real girl... a woman. Call the hospital. They've got records. We've spoken to the hospital, David. They have no record of Sydney Barrett ever being a patient there. Okay. Is it possible, Mr. Haller... and I'm not a psychiatrist, so... but is it possible that this whole thing... the girl, the incident... that it's just part of your illness, a delusion? Uh, yes, sure, fine. Then... well, how do you explain what happened to Lenny? Or all of them? Well, I can't. That's why we're having this... Talk to Dr. Kissinger. He knows. And Dr. Kissinger was your psychiatrist? Yes. Somehow I have a hard time believing your psychiatrist is gonna confirm the story that you're telling me now. Well, David, I think, don't you, that we should talk about it? Hmm? No. It's important you... if you want to go home... See, my job, part of my job, is to assess.

You're stupid. Weak! Did the voices tell you to do that? No, no. No, they tried to stop me. They didn't like it. And yet the police say they found no noose in the apartment. Just rope burns on your neck. [whispered voices] [clears throat] How do you feel now? Better. Well, let me ask you this. Do you still feel that, quote, "You have power over things and can control things with your mind"? Hold on. You think you can control things with your mind? I did, at one point, but they helped with that, the drugs and... is that why I'm here? Is that what this is? David... I... you think I did this, that I killed her with my mind? No, don't be ridiculous, but the girl is dead, David. She is. And it wasn't a heart attack, right? So we're just, uh... looking for the truth. Which you promised to tell. Look, I don't know, okay?

Well, he believes he's mentally ill, but at the same time part of him knows that the power is real. And are we clear on the scope and nature of this power? No, but if the readings are right, he may be the most powerful mutant that we have ever encountered. [chuckles] After what happened in Red Hook, I'd say that's an understatement. So he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it. I'd like to dig deeper, see if we can figure out what triggers it. Division One thinks we should kill him now, before he realizes what he is. We may never get the chance again. That would be a mistake. We've never had a subject like this before. I need...
