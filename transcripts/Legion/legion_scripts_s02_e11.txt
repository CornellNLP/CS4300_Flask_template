  [UPBEAT, OLD-STYLE JAZZ PLAYS] 
  "O dandelion, rich and haughty, King of village flowers! 
  Each day is coronation time, You have no humble hours. 
  I like to see you bring a troop To beat the bluegrass spears, To scorn the lawnmower that would be like fate's triumphant shears. 
  Your yellow heads are cut away, It seems your reign is over. 
  By noon you raise a sea of stars More golden than before. 
  " [BOTH LAUGHING]

  [PANTING] 
  Sure. 
  Let me just finish killing this asshole. 
  You haven't had a lot of girlfriends, or you'd know When a woman wants to talk, you talk. 
  Could you maybe not point that thing at me? 
  You read the stories. 
  The women who marry serial killers and have six kids Meanwhile, he's driving around Portland every night with a van full of duct tape. 
  What? 
  They have to know. 
  Right? 
  The wives, deep down. 
  At least a feeling, something's wrong. 
  I know, with you. 
  Now. 
  Syd, I'm the good guy. 
  He's the monster. 
  No. 
  You're not that. 
  A good guy? 
  I thought so for a long time. 
  And then I saw the things you hide. 
  And it hit me. 
  What if you're not the hero? 
  What if you're just another villain? 
  The real villain. 
  Why? 
  'Cause because I didn't tell you the whole truth? 
  Because I-I left? 
  - He kills people. 
  - You kill people. 
  Dozens at Division 3 last year. 
  No. 
  That was him. 
  He had c-control. 
  The Son of Sam had a dog who gave him commands, but every time he pulled the trigger, he pulled the trigger. 
  Seriously, why are you doing this? 
  I know. 
  That's the thing. 
  I've seen your true face. 
  You hid it so well. 
  I love you. 
  Maybe. 
  But here's what matters more. 
  You lie to me. 
  You leave me. 
  - You keep secrets. 
  - No. 
  You're doing it right now. 
  Unless maybe you don't know the difference truth, lie. 
  Maybe it's not even your fault. 
  He was in your head for so long, poisoning every thought. 
  Are you okay? 
  Y-Your neck, that's a lot of blood. 
  It's not mine. 
  Listen to me, I know it's been hard I saw what you did to Oliver. 
  To the soldiers at Division 3. 
  I saw the look on your face. 
  You liked it. 
  No, I did what I had to. 
  You tortured Oliver. 
  You were beating him to death. 
  That's not a love story. 
  Wait, I I'm just, we're just, this is We're just doing what you said. 
  You. 
  This is war. 
  We're in a war. 
  What am I willing to do? 
  How far am I willing to go? 
  - I know I said that, but - And that's all I'm doing. 
  That is all I am doing what you said. 
  No.

  And, look, I'm sorry if you have abandonment issues. 
  And I was taken away by you, if we're being If we're laying all our cards out on the table, so think about that. 
  I didn't leave. 
  You kidnapped me from the future. 
  Did you ever ask why? 
  Why would I do that? 
  Reach out from the future? 
  Why ask you to help Farouk find his body? 
  Because of the world The end of the world? 
  And who does that, end the world? 
  Not him, right? 
  Otherwise, why would I ask you to save him? 
  I don't know. 
  You wouldn't, you didn't tell me. 
  - It's you. 
  - What's me? 
  You're the one who destroys everything, who ends the world. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  No. 
  It never occurred to you that you're the problem, not the solution. 
  - H-How could you even - He showed me Farouk. 
  He went to see her, too me, in the future After you quit. 
  See, in her timeline, you killed Farouk, and then there was no one powerful enough to stop you - when you turned. 
  - When I So she tricked you into helping him your enemy So that he could stop you when you showed us who you really are.

  It's cold to do that to someone that you used to love. 
  Used to?

  So I deserve love. 
  No. 
  That's not She saved me. 
  She showed me what I could be. 
  She made me good.

  And they tell you it's you. 
  That you're disgusting, like somebody's used condom that keeps getting stuck to people's shoes. 
  You want to know the truth? 
  They're terrified you're gonna wake up one day and realize you're a god, that you don't need any of them. 
  So they put you in a mental hospital. 
  DIVAD: You are not helping. 
  He is sick. 
  I'm trying to DVD: No, they're sick.

  - After. 
  The moment he's dead, we go and never come back. 
  What? 
  Nothing. 
  You seem different. 
  Maybe it's me. 
  After everything we've been through. 
  We're together, now. 
  That's all that matters. 
  Don't you see? 
  It's over. 
  [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  It's over. 
  We won. 
  We won. 
  DAVID: How's it feel, knowing I beat you? 
  Knowing you lost? 
  Did I? 
  Well, you're in a cage, powerless, about to be executed. 
  Oh, no, they won't kill me. 
  I'm too [SPEAKS FARSI] 
  Valuable. 
  They'll put me deep in a basement somewhere, a secret weapon. 
  No, you're gonna die. 
  What makes you so sure? 
  Because if they don't kill you tomorrow, I will. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  You tried once, and yet here I am. 
  You know what I missed the most, being locked in that grave for 30 years? 
  Coffee. 
  Be a dear and make me a cup. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
 
 
 
  No. 
  I give the orders now. 
  It wasn't an order. 
  It was a request. 
  The last request of a dying man. 
  Don't do that Try to make me feel sympathy for you. 
  Why not? 
  Is it working? 
  Go to hell. 
  I'm leaving. 
  I just came to What? 
  Gloat? 
  No. 
  To say good-bye. 
  Good-bye. 
  It's really sick, what you're doing to her. 
  Don't you think? 
  Your love. 
  How do y The horse with the bridle can still walk. 
  I saw you on the hill, what you did to her Suppressing her memory, tricking her into loving you again. 
  I didn't trick her. 
  She loves me. 
  She just f-forgot. 
  Oh, and you helped her remember by controlling her. 
  What a kind man you are. 
  Shut up. 
  Trust me [SPEAKS FARSI] 
  You can't make someone love you. 
  I've tried. 
  With who, your toadies? 
  No. 
  With you. 
  For 30 years, since you were a baby. 
  My baby. 
  Oh, please. 
  You make me sick. 
  You know that? 
  Physically sick. 
  Every time I look at you, every time I hear your voice, I want to throw up. 
  Good. 
  Remember that feeling, because soon you will see it in her eyes when she looks at you. 
  [EXHALES] 
  SYD [WHISPERS] : I love you, too. 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  [BEEPING, TRILLING] 
  You look ridiculous. 
  I'm reconstructing what happened on the hill from available sensor data. 
  Did I tell you I cut off the head of a Minotaur? 
  Yes, you did. 
  In graphic detail. 
  Do you know what its blood smelled like? 
  Oh, please, Kerry Okay, this is weird. 
  You remember those, like, beef bouillon cubes - from when we were kids? 
  - Stop. 
  The kind that you would pour boiling water onto? 
  Stop.

  CARY: In the old days Not so long ago Madmen were packed onto boats and shipped off to sea. 
  They were said to be searching for their lost sanity. 
  They called these boats the Ship of Fools. 
  And for a long time, we thought we were the sane ones, left behind on dry land. 
  But what if we're not? 
  What if so much time has passed that we've forgotten the truth? 
  That we are, in fact, the fools afloat on an endless sea, pretending to be normal.

  VERMILLION 1: David Haller, your treachery has been discovered. 
  The inevitability of your future crimes. 
  VERMILLION 3: We are informed by Sydney Barrett and the Shadow King of events that will transpire in the days to come. 
  The remains of the orb that took you have been analyzed. 
  The probability that they have been created decades from now by the male Loudermilk is 98%. 
  [PANTING] 
  Th This is a mistake. 
  Future crimes? 
  Things I might do? 
  Are you Wha? 
  Wait. 
  What's what's really going on? 
  [PANTING] 
  - This is you. 
  - FAROUK: No [SPEAKS FARSI] 
  Seeing you like this what you have become the sweet boy undone by revenge. 
  It fills my heart with such sorrow. 
  Liar. 
  SYD: David, I know how hard this was for you. 
  What he did to you. 
  The life that you lived. 
  To think that you were sick for all those years, and then to be told that it was a lie, that you have these powers. 
  [FAINT, DISTORTED WHISPERS]

  Just let me think. 
  [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] 
  Uh [CHUCKLES] 
  Something I do in the future? 
  That hasn't happened yet? 
  That isn't even me? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Don't you see? 
  This is some kind of mass psychosis. 
  CARY: You're upset. 
  Your mind can't reconcile the person we see with the person you think you are. 
  SYD: But we can help. 
  Medicine and therapy. 
  Back to the psych ward?
