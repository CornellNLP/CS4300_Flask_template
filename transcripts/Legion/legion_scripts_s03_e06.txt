 [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  [WAGON ROLLING] 
  OLIVER: We were always finding things. 
  Pens. 
  Poetry. 
  Socks. 
  The astral plane was like a magnet for lost dreams. 
  Minds. 
  That was the other thing we found. 
  In the real world, when people lost their minds, they ended up here. 
  [COOING] 
  And who are we, then? 
  [BABY BABBLING] 
  Hmm. 
  What you got today? 
  A baby. 
  A baby? 
  Wow. 
  Look at that. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Can I have him? 
  It's a her, I think, and no. 
  If you want a baby, you can scavenge one yourself. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  "Scavenge. 
  " That's I'm a wolf. 
  Wolves don't scavenge. 
  We hunt. 
  You're lucky I don't hunt you. 
  Well, you live just next door. 
  Wouldn't be hard. 
  Have you told her about the Holocaust yet? 
  - The? 
  What? 
  - Got to tell her. 
  Prepare her, Oliver. 
  You can't grow up too fast. 
  That's my motto. 
  Also, herpes. 
  Make sure you tell her about herpes, like, right away. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  Get away! 
  Go on! 
  - [GROWLS] 
  Shoo! 
  Get away! 
  Get away! 
  Don't forget chlamydia. 
  [HOWLS] 
  Wife. 
  Husband. 
  - What did we scavenge today? 
  - Well, half a sandwich, a very nice sock and, uh, this baby. 
  Oh, baby. 
  Well, look at that. 
  [GASPS] 
  Oh. 
  Oh, aren't you adorable. 
  Let's get you inside. 
  [BABY COOING] 
  [THE WOLF HOWLING] 
  [HOWLING CONTINUES] 
  [SIREN WAILING] 
  Mm. 
  What should we call her? 
  The soup? 
  No, not the soup; the baby. 
  Oh, her name is Sydney. 
  How do you know? 
  She told me. 
  What else did she say? 
  Well, nothing. 
  She's a baby. 
  She looks familiar somehow. 
  Syd. 
  Sydney. 
  It's okay. 
  Everything's okay. 
  - Mama's got you. 
  - [POUNDING ON WALLS] 
  [THE WOLF HOWLING] 
  Don't. 
  I won't. 
  Although, he did blow the paper house down last time. 
  This house is straw, though Mighty Straw. 
  It should hold. 
  [WIND WHISTLING] 
  - [WIND HOWLING LOUDLY] 
  - [HOUSE CREAKING, RUMBLING] 
  I'll just go and chat with him, shall I? 
  [PANTING] 
  Oh, hey. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I was just, uh [EXHALES] 
  This is Cynthia. 
  I found her wandering alone in the woods. 
  She's lost her innocence, which is a win for this guy. 
  Plus, hey, she brought all these dirty needles with her, so I was thinking party? 
  Huh? 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Is that soup? 
  No. 
  [GROWLS] 
  Hello, Melanie. 
  - This is Cynthia. 
  - CYNTHIA: Hi. 
  She's given up all hope. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Isn't that great? 
  Look, we're trying to have a nice life here and raise this baby with wonder and magic, so we need to keep the real world out. 
  You guys like magic? 
  'Cause I can do magic. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  It was in my sleeve. 
  Go away. 
  - [GROWLING] 
  - Not you, hon. 
  Come in. 
  Have some soup. 
  Sorry. 
  [ROARING] 
  Listen, don't be mad. 
  [SIGHS] 
  We should move. 
  [THE WOLF HOWLING IN DISTANCE] 
  [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] 
  [INSECTS TRILLING] 
  There we go. 
  That's perfect. 
  Oh, yes, that's perfect for [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] 
  Why does some music make you happy but other music make you sad? 
  That's a good question. 
  Well, uh, do you know the difference between a major and a minor chord? 
  I'm five. 
  No excuse. 
  I'll show you when we get home. 
  Why do people use umbrellas in the rain but not the snow? 
  OLIVER: Quiet now. 
  Whose stuff is this? 
  [SIGHS] 
  People in the real world. 
  When they forget about something, when it stops being important, it comes here. 
  Oh. 
  - Oh. 
  - I'm gonna call her Heady. 
  Little bird. 
  Not that way. 
  Why not? 
  [MACHINERY WHIRRING] 
  What is it? 
  It-it's called the ostrich. 
  Oh, wait, that's not right. 
  It's the big bird, isn't it? 
  No, the city. 
  It's called the city. 
  Also known as the real world. 
  What makes it real? 
  I'll explain when you're older. 
  No, now. 
  That's not the way it works, little bird. 
  I'm the daddy, and you're the baby, and I'll tell you about the real world when you're older. 
  Now, come on. 
  Mommy's making stuffed animal pie. 
  Mmm. 
  We don't want to be late. 
  [FLIES BUZZING] 
  People think death is scary. 
  It's pretty scary, huh? 
  I mean, look at it. 
  All oozy, and what are those, maggots? 
  That's just nature. 
  Mm, kids die, too, you know. 
  Everybody. 
  Your parents. 
  Ooh. 
  That's got to be scary, knowing that, huh? 
  Mm. 
  My mom told me that death is just part of life. 
  [GROANS] 
  She did, huh? 
  OLIVER: Sydney! 
  - [THE WOLF GROWLS] 
  - Got to go. 
  Bye. 
  Wait, wait, wait. 
  Did she tell you about chlamydia? 
  Tell me a bedtime story. 
  MELANIE: Hmm. 
  Oh. 
  Once upon a time, there was a girl who had the most extraordinary ability. 
  She could feel everything the animals felt. 
  When a donkey stubbed its toe, her toe hurt. 
  Every time a monkey got sad, she got sad. 
  It was her special power. 
  And she called her special power "Empathy. 
  " And Empathy was her friend. 
  They did everything together. 
  But it's a hard thing for a little girl to share the feelings of others. 
  And she started to wonder, "Where do they end and I begin? 
 " No. 
  No. 
  No. 
  [DISTANT HOWLING] 
  [GASPS] 
  Cynthia. 
  Hey. 
  Do you ever miss your parents? 
  Your real parents. 
  Back in the real world. 
  Wasn't your mom a lush? 
  I love that word. 
  "Lush. 
  " It sounds so positive. 
  Which, uh Remember how she used to tuck you in at night with flecks of vomit in her hair? 
  I live here now. 
  - With the rivers and trees. 
  - Mm And Kenny? 
  Do you ever miss Kenny? 
  Kenny beat me. 
  Kenny's real sorry, baby. 
  He wants you to come home real bad. 
  He love-love-loves you. 
  I have to go inside. 
  - Hey. 
  - [GASPS] 
  Look what I found. 
  Hmm? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I don't do that anymore. 
  Aw come on. 
  Sure, you do. 
  Don't be scared, gorgeous. 
  You think the light bulb is afraid of the dark? 
  The light bulb loves the dark. 
  'Cause in the dark it can shine. 
  - [SIGHS SOFTLY] 
  - Shine for me, baby. 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  MELANIE: So, that's where babies come from. 
  And in a couple years, your body will start to change to be more like Mommy's. 
  It's the most natural thing in the world. 
  Any questions? 
  What's chlamydia? 
  Where'd you hear that word? 
  From The Wolf. 
  Uh, well um, you know how, when someone sneezes on you, you catch a cold? 
  Well, that's because the cold is a virus, and the sneeze transfers the virus to you. 
  And chlamydia is kind of like a cold, except for your v*g1n*. 
  And, uh, you get it by having unprotected s*x with someone who has that virus. 
  Does that make sense? 
  - Bodies are weird. 
  - [MELANIE CHUCKLES] 
  Well, I think the word you're looking for is "beautiful. 
  " [CRICKETS CHIRPING, FROGS CROAKING] 
  [LAUGHTER ECHOING] 
  [MAKING SMOOCHING SOUNDS] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [BIRDS SCREECHING] 
  [GASPING] 
  [DISTORTED SCREAMING] 
  [DISTORTED]: David. 
  [WHIMPERING]: No. 
  No. 
  No. 
  [CONTINUES WHIMPERING] 
  MELANIE: She's having dreams about it. 
  Is she? 
  "It" what? 
  Her life. 
  Outside. 
  Whatever happened that brought her here. 
  That'll pass. 
  Won't it? 
  Depends on if she decides to go back or not. 
  [CHUCKLING]: Back? 
  Why would anyone want to go back? 
  If she feels unresolved. 
  If there's something she needs to do. 
  I swear, I I feel like we know her. 
  From before. 
  There is no "before" for us. 
  MELANIE: Hmm. 
  Sydney. 
  - Yes, Mama? 
  - Come tell Daddy your dream. 
  I forgot. 
  Now little bird, you know that Mommy and Daddy can't help you unless you use your words. 
  That's okay. 
  When you're ready. 
  [CRICKETS CHIRPING, FROGS CROAKING] 
  DAVID: I'm sorry. 
  Don't worry. 
  None of this will happen. 
  No. 
  I'll fix it. 
  I promise. 
  [SCREAMING] 
  [INDISTINCT, DISTORTED CHATTER] 
  [SCREAMING CONTINUES] 
  [WHIMPERS] 
  [HEAVY, GRUFF BREATHING] 
  Good night, my sunshine. 
  [NIGHT BIRD HOOTING IN DISTANCE] 
  [DEEP INHALE] 
  [WIND WHISTLING] 
  [DEEP INHALE] 
  - [WIND HOWLING] 
  - [HOUSE RUMBLING] 
  [THE WOLF HOWLING] 
  OLIVER: We have to move. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Hey! 
  Hey! 
  OLIVER: Then the lean years came. 
  We moved from the woods to the gutter, trying to escape the knowledge. 
  Wife. 
  Husband. 
  - Where's daughter? 
  - She's inside. 
  Studying long division. 
  [INDISTINCT, LIVELY CHATTER] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  What ho, daughter? 
  - Math makes sense. 
  - Yes. 
  It does. 
  Just add up the numbers. 
  Or subtract, divide, multiply. 
  Like me, for example. 
  How I'm 16 now. 
  Ready to learn about the world. 
  Well, I can tell you everything there is to know about old shoes and how to live with them. 
  Hint: fumigation is key. 
  You know what I mean. 
  Did you have the dream again? 
  No. 
  It just feels like I'm supposed to do something. 
  But I don't know what. 
  That's normal. 
  It's a big world. 
  And there's so much you haven't seen yet. 
  Because you won't show me. 
  It's about the order of things, the order you learn. 
  When you were young, we let you be wild because wildness is important. 
  But as you got older, we gave you structure so you'd feel safe. 
  I can take care of myself. 
  Here's something. 
  The secret of life. 
  If you feel safe when you're young, you will feel safe when you're old. 
  I feel safe. 
  And we want that feeling to last. 
  - You're not old yet. 
  - Yes, I am. 
  No. 
  You have your whole life to be old. 
  But today, you're still young. 
  Trust me. 
  You're doing this right. 
  We have to learn about love before we can learn about hate. 
  Otherwise, everything goes to hell. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - [GASPING] 
  - [WOMAN HISSES] 
  [VIOLIN PLAYING A LIVELY TUNE] 
  [DISTANT, RHYTHMIC THUMPING] 
  [THUMPING GROWS LOUDER] 
  WOMAN: Better to leave it. 
  They get bitter when they come here. 
  Hey, sunshine. 
  Hey. 
  Where did you go? 
  Here. 
  Just here. 
  These are my kids, Sweetie and Blue. 
  You like vodka? 
  [CHUCKLING]: What? 
  No. 
  I don't know. 
  Oh, it's good. 
  They've got vanilla and strawberry. 
  Choke chain? 
  Are you How are Mom and Dad? 
  Good. 
  I'm sure they'd love it if you came by the shoe shop. 
  - The shop? 
  - Yeah, we live right right near the park. 
  [CHUCKLES]: Oh. 
  We like it over there. 
  We love it. 
  Maybe we could I mean, they probably don't remember me, right? 
  No, they do. 
  We talk about you all the time. 
  Look. 
  What are you doing right now? 
  Because we're just we were gonna We live down there. 
  Right down there. 
  Maybe you could come over. 
  We've got Hey, do you like video games? 
  And I've got all the cereals. 
  Cocoa nubs and fruity chews. 
  And movies about slavery. 
  Do you know about slavery? 
  BLUE: They're super cool flicks. 
  So much whipping. 
  Jerome would love to see you, too. 
  Jerome? 
  [FLIES BUZZING] 
  [HEAVY, GRUFF BREATHING] 
  I have to go. 
  Don't forget your heart. 
  [HEARTBEAT THUMPING] 
  I'm not going. 
  I'm never going. 
  Where? 
  The real world. 
  I don't want that. 
  Any of that. 
  I know, honey. 
  But here's the thing: The real world needs you. 
  All those bad things, they don't have to be bad. 
  They can be fixed. 
  See, you got this backwards. 
  We're not trying to protect you from the real world. 
  We're helping you be the person the world needs. 
  So you can save it. 
  What if I don't want to go? 
  We're not put on this Earth to think of only ourselves. 
  You know that, right? 
  [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] 
 
 
 
  [TURKEY GOBBLING] 
  Look what I found. 
  We talked about this, remember? 
  No livestock in the house. 
  - Are you livestock? 
  - SYD: Okay. 
  We're gonna save her. 
  Well, I think it's a he. 
  No. 
  Cynthia. 
  She ran into Cynthia. 
  - She's with The Wolf. 
  - And we're gonna save her. 
  - Now, hon - No. 
  You taught me to be a good person, and this is what good people do. 
  So we're gonna save her. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [STRING INSTRUMENTS PLAYING LIVELY TUNE IN DISTANCE] 
  [DOOR CREAKING] 
  SYD: Do you think she's okay? 
  Cynthia? 
  Well, she's a drug addict who lives with a wolf, so no. 
  Maybe he won't care. 
  Don't be naive. 
  Real grown-ups aren't naive. 
  You think I'm a grown-up. 
  If we survive this, you will be. 
  Do you remember that wall we built? 
  - The rock wall? 
  - Of course. 
  Why did we do that? 
  It didn't do anything. 
  It was a wall. 
  It did wall things. 
  You know what I mean. 
  Your mother and I taught you to work hard so you'd know how to work hard. 
  We taught you to ask questions so you'd know how to answer questions. 
  Plus, I like a nice rock wall. 
  [WHISPERS]: Did he see you? 
  No. 
  But he has our scent. 
  [GRUNTS, CHUCKLES] 
  [SNIFFING] 
  [GROWLS] 
  - MELANIE: It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  - [CYNTHIA PANTING] 
  - We're here. 
  It's okay. 
  - [BARKING, GROWLING] 
  SYD: It's me. 
  Listen. 
  I know you had a bad deal. 
  You think you don't deserve things. 
  Love. 
  [GASPS] 
  But you do. 
  We love you. 
  Come home. 
  It doesn't matter. 
  He's here. 
  [DISTANT HOWLING] 
  [INSECTS CHIRPING] 
  You can't have her. 
  Oliver. 
  - Jerome. 
  - [GROWLS] 
  You can't beat me. 
  I'm a wild animal. 
  [HOWLING] 
  I still have a few tricks. 
  There's only one way this can end. 
  A rap battle. 
  - [BEAT PLAYING] 
  - [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] 
  I'm the old wizard who lives in the shoe The slick mack daddy from the ice cube My body's quite muscular, blood stream's corpuscular If you step to me, farkas, you'll be sorry, sir Oh, yes You'll be sorry. 
  What?! 
  What you got?! 
  I'm the Big Bad Wolf, that's what I'm telling you I've got a sensitive nose, that's why I'm smelling you I'll roofie your daughter, hell, I'll roofie your son I'm faster than a gun, so you can hide But you can't run. 
  [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] 
  I'm an old-school warlock Slept in more bears' beds than Goldilocks Stay away from my kid or I'll beat you with my cock You may be an animal, but I'm a magical mammal Who can turn you into ash and then I'll go on sabbatical You got all of the id and none of the ego You're all bark and no bite, while I fly like an eagle. 
  I'm the supine lupine, my libido kills sunshine Moody and spicy like a fine-ass toilet wine I'm the new norm, like stepmother p0rn Like a snatch and grab in a college dorm I'm everything that's real Like the fact that veal is really adorable baby cows Who scream for their mommies when they die Mm, screams. 
  [GROWLS] 
  I'll take your reality and I'll break it in half Then I'll go take a shower or maybe a bath See, I'm classy, I'm elegant, like a diplomat or a delegate I've got balls of an elephant, by which I mean I'm masculine I've got a lot of nice feminine qualities, too You could say I'm the mother of disaster The battle master, you call yourself a wolf? 
  You're a shitty little b*st*rd. 
  I'm the loco lobo, and your name is meat Here is my lap, come take a seat I've got a spiky erection, like your daddy at bedtime Holding you tight and reading "Once Upon a Hate Crime" I'm a hepatitis outbreak in a homeless encampment I'm realer than real, I only got bad news Now get out of my way 'cause I win and you lose. 
  [CHEERING, SHOUTING] 
  You're a scared little boy and you're crying boo-hoo Because you know deep inside that nobody loves you I've got family and friends, I give money to charity Every year on my birthday People send me cards and letters My mom and dad still write to me Little old ladies still smile at me Puppies aren't afraid of me I get more hugs than hate mail And I go to bed happy Can you say that, you sad, sad man? 
  [CHEERING, APPLAUSE, INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  MAN: Are you crying? 
  - Stop. 
  - [APPLAUSE AND CHATTER STOP] 
  Don't kill him. 
  [CRYING]: The bad man was mean to me. 
  - I know, baby. 
  It's okay. 
  - [CRYING] 
  Thank you. 
  For everything. 
  But we belong together. 
  [SNIFFLING] 
  It's okay. 
  I don't understand. 
  She was my friend. 
  Not everyone wants to be saved. 
  - Then why do we - You had to try so you'd know. 
  Oh. 
  [MELANIE GASPS] 
  A-Are we [LAUGHING] 
  I think she's ready. 
  Ready for what? 
  Oh, my God. 
  [MELANIE CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  You see it now? 
  I have to go back. 
  MELANIE: Remember, it's not "us or them. 
  " It's us and them. 
  You're not coming? 
  I need you. 
  - OLIVER: We did our part. 
  - MELANIE: You can do this. 
  Just remember everything we taught you. 
  [GASPS] 
  [WHIRRING, RHYTHMIC WHOOSHING] 
  - [GASPS] 
  - [DEEP WHIRRING] 
  - [KERRY WHIMPERS] 
  - Ah-ah. 
  Stop fighting. 
  That's like me saying, "Stop nerding. 
  " S-Stay still. 
  Did we lose? 
  Yes, I think so. 
  So, does that mean we're just going to vanish when he changes things? 
  Or I don't know. 
  SYD: I can fix it. 
  The time door's still open. 
  I can fix it. 
  But I need to get in there. 
  Did you change something about you? 
  Other than that I just lived an entire second life in the last 20 minutes? 
  Maybe my hair. 
  [KERRY GRUNTS] 
  Cary. 
  The time door. 
  Yes, David had a bracelet. 
  - That you made. 
  - Yes. 
  I'll make more. 
  Why is it doing that? 
  - Cary? 
  - Yeah? 
  Why is it doing that? 
  I have a theory, but you're not gonna like it. 
  Okay, don't tell me. 
  I think the Time Eaters are back. 
  I said don't tell me. 
  Sorry. 
  Uh it's finished. 
  And this will get us into the hall? 
  I've keyed it to her signal. 
  The time traveler. 
  We're piggybacking on her power. 
  KERRY: How are you gonna find them? 
  The past is a big place. 
  Same way. 
  Just follow her signal. 
  Cary, she needs me. 
  I know. 
  I can't help like this. 
  I know, but you'll need me, too. 
  In case you need to find your way back or Oh. 
  But you can do what you do sitting down. 
  I can't. 
  What? 
  We need a minute. 
  Ready? 
  - M-Maybe there's another way. 
  - Kerry. 
  It's the only way. 
  Come home. 
  [WHIMPERS] 
  I'm so sorry. 
  [GRUNTING]

  [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] 
  Cary? 
  [GASPING WEAKLY] 
  Kerry, it's time to go. 
  [TIME EATER SNARLING] 
  Kerry? 
  Go. 
  [TIME EATER CONTINUES SNARLING] 
  No! 
  [TIME EATER GROANS] 
  [CARY BREATHING WEAKLY] 
  We're gonna win.
