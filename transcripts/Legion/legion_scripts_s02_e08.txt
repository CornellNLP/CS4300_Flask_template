 [WIND WHOOSHING] 
  SYD: The monk is dead. 
  So how are we going to find Farouk's body? 
  David? 
  I'm thinking. 
  Someone else must know. 
  Who? 
  What about me? 
  In the future. 
  - No. 
  - Hmm. 
  You asked her? 
  No, but we we're done. 
  Did we did [LAUGHING] : did we get in a fight? 
  No, but we're me and her, we're not seeing eye to eye right now, so - So we got in a fight. 
  - Syd. 
  - Should I be mad at you? 
  - No. 
  We just need we just need to find the body fast and finish this thing. 
  Are we helping him? 
  Farouk. 
  What about the end of the world? 
  One thing at a time. 
  Hey, hey. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] 
  Admiral? 
  [INDISTINCT ELECTRONIC CHATTER] 
  [INDISTINCT ELECTRONIC CHATTER] 
  [BELLS CHIMING] 
  BRUBAKER: What's that you're reading? 
  "Everything is unheimlich that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light. 
  " Is there a place we could talk? 
  In private. 
  I was a student here once, a lifetime ago. 
  The world was not innocent, but more so. 
  Our thoughts were our own. 
  Private. 
  Do you understand? 
  Not so now. 
  There are listeners, watchers, creatures from science fiction, telepaths who can read our minds, steal our secrets. 
  We are vulnerable, you and I our secrets. 
  But more important, senators, presidents. 
  And so there is a plan. 
  Create a mind that can't be read. 
  One of our own. 
  The secret keeper. 
  Why are you telling me this? 
  Because of your tests, the boy who's never been sick, who heals. 
  You have a gift. 
  You are a gift. 
  On your application you wrote you'd do anything for your country. 
  - [ECHOING] : Was that a lie? 
  - FUKYAMA: No. 
  BRUBAKER: Then do this. 
  [ECHOING] : Keep our secrets. 
  [INDISTINCT ELECTRONIC CHATTER] 
  DOCTOR [ECHOING] : How old are you? 
  Seventeen. 
  [INDISTINCT ELECTRONIC CHATTER] 
  HUSH WOMAN: "'You may not see it now, said the Princess of Pure Reason, looking knowingly at Milo's puzzled face, But whatever we learn has a purpose and whatever we do affects everything and everyone else, if even in the tiniest way. 
  Why, when a housefly flaps his wings, a breeze goes round the world, when a speck of dust falls to the ground, the entire planet weighs a little more, and when you stamp your foot, the Earth moves slightly off its course. 
  " "Whenever you laugh, gladness spreads [ECHOING] : like the ripples in a pond, and whenever you're sad, no one anywhere can be really happy. 
  And it's much the same thing with knowledge, for whenever you learn something new, the whole world becomes that much richer. 
  " [ECHOING] : You're in here, too? 
  [DIGITAL SCREECHING] 
  [MONKS THROAT-SINGING] 
  [INDISTINCT ELECTRONIC CHATTER] 
  [ELECTRONIC STATIC] 
  [GLITCH BUZZING] 
  [TONE SOUNDS] 
  [MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE OVER P. A. ] 
  Is there something? 
  David. 
  Yeah? 
  It's me. 
  Ptonomy. 
  Not funny. 
  I don't know how long I can-can-can keep control. 
  Wait. 
  Are you alive? 
  I exist in their machine, preserved. 
  Is that alive? 
  The Monk. 
  He hacked the Admiral's mind. 
  The mainframe. 
  Remember? 
  The wires. 
  Well, the mainframe hacked him back. 
  And I saw him, here, in the computer, his memory. 
  And? 
  I know where to five Five? 
  Five find-find-find Farouk's body. 
  Where? 
  A place called [GLITCH BUZZING] 
  Hey. 
  A place called? 
  Le DÃ©solÃ©. 
  Le DÃ©solÃ©. 
  Le DÃ©solÃ©. 
  Le DÃ©solÃ©. 
  [MORTEN LAURIDSEN'S "EN UNE SEULE FLEUR" PLAYING] 
  [CHOIR SINGING IN FRENCH] 
  [MUSIC CONTINUES FAINTLY] 
  FAROUK: Your mind's eye, can you see me? 
  In my true form? 
  DRIVER: It-it can't be. 
  As you were m-many years ago. 
  How? 
  No way to plan for such things. 
  The professor? 
  Is not here. 
  My body. 
  Where did you take it? 
  If I tell, will you give me the one and only? 
  ["NON PIANGERE MARIA" BY DOMENICO MODUGNO PLAYING] 
  [MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] 
  When you dream, this is what you see? 
  Mm. 
  Beautiful. 
  I miss this. 
  Driving. 
  Radio on, windows down. 
  Can't you see? 
  It's there, up ahead. 
  When does the dream begin? 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  DAVID: Right. 
  Le DÃ©solÃ©. 
  [WHIRRING] 
  [WIND GUSTING] 
  DAVID 1: We know where it is. 
  We need a plan. 
  Should we tell? 
  DAVID 2: No, if we tell, then Farouk can read their minds. 
  DAVID 1: Okay. 
  Who should we use? 
  ["COMANCHE MOON" BY THE BLACK ANGELS PLAYING] 
  sh1t. 
  DAVID 2: On your mark, get set, go. 
  We're tired of all this bad fortune Been fighting for all of our lives We'll reach into your socket Rip back your scalp as you cry We'll fight We survive Inside out, upside down All around, underground. 
  [FINGERS SNAPPING, ECHOING] 
  DAVID: You awake? 
  I'm not sure. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Don't do that. 
  What? 
  Look at me like I'm in a zoo. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [GASPS] 
  [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  How are you? 
  Who cares? 
  Me. 
  - I always cared. 
  - Hmm. 
  What? 
  Oh Amy did that when she was nervous. 
  Look, man, I it wasn't my call, okay? 
  I know, I just Is there anything left in there? 
  Of her? 
  Tell me something. 
  And don't screw with me, okay? 
  Am I? 
  Am I really here? 
  'Cause if I'm not, and I wake up back there, with him No, you're here. 
  Hey, you're here. 
  With me. 
  And I won't let anything bad happen to you. 
  MAN [OVER P. A. ] : Announcement two: - know your symptoms. 
  - [MOANS] 
  Confusion. 
  Irritability. 
  Repetitive sounds. 
  If you feel any of these symptoms, - tell your mental monitor at once. 
  - Hey. 
  This won't hurt. 
  MAN [OVER P. A. ] : Repetitive sounds. 
  If you feel any of these symptoms, tell your mental monitor at once. 
  [PAPER SLIDES] 
  [WATER BUBBLING] 
  DAVID: Gone to kill the monster. 
  [TEAPOT WHISTLING] 
  [WIND WHISTLING] 
  [WIND CONTINUES WHISTLING] 
  A poem. 
  "America, I've given you all and now I am nothing. 
  " "America, $2. 27, January 17, 1956. 
  " "I can't stand my own mind. 
  " "America, when will we end the human war?" SYD: She never married, my mom. 
  It was just boyfriend, boyfriend, fling. 
  Sometimes they were younger. 
  Sometimes they were married. 
  "Joan. 
  Oh, Joan. 
  Please, Joan. 
  " She was the tragic lay. 
  The one they couldn't touch. 
  Uh, what does this have to do with? 
  I'm saying maybe it's my fault. 
  Maybe I pushed him away. 
  Or maybe the universe just has a sick sense of humor. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the Untouchable Barretts. 
  No, that's not funny. 
  Nope. 
  Or maybe it's him. 
  Or maybe it's him. 
  - Did he leave again? 
  - Yes, he did. 
  Did he tell you where he was going? 
  No, he did not. 
  Has he done that before? 
  Officially? 
  Off the record. 
  Just girl talk. 
  All right, if you're saying something, you got to say it out loud. 
  I'm going after him. 
  I loved a boy in the army who kept jumping out of planes to get away from me. 
  And then? 
  Well, and then one day his chute didn't open. 
  - He's just different now. 
  - Mm. 
  In the hospital it was so romantic meeting him. 
  I needed that. 
  To be seen. 
  Love. 
  And then we escaped and went to Summerland, and it was addictive and intense and sweet. 
  He's a good person. 
  You know? 
  He tries so hard. 
  But can we agree that he's unwell? 
  What does that mean? 
  You tell me. 
  Maybe he doesn't know Go on. 
  The difference between things real and not real, right and wrong So he's delusional, you're saying. 
  No. 
  [WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY] 
  I don't know. 
  Have you ever seen him lie? 
  - CLARK: No. 
  - I know. 
  Me neither. 
  But I think he lies all the time. 
  What about? 
  What he does. 
  What he knows. 
  And yet And yet [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  Who teaches us to be normal when we're one of a kind? 
  You don't trust him. 
  No. 
  That's not I love what we were. 
  I'm just not sure we're that anymore. 
  All right, I feel like I need to say out loud that your boyfriend is an extremely powerful mutant who could potentially destroy the world if he wanted to, or if, say, you hurt his feelings real bad. 
  I'm going after him. 
  Because of what I just said? 
  Because love is what we have to save if we're gonna save the world. 
  I'm just not sure that's what he's doing. 
  [FOOTFALLS APPROACHING] 
  DAVID 2: On your mark. 
  Get set. 
  WOMAN [OVER P. A. ] : Reminder a loss of meaning is not normal. 
  DAVID 2: Go. 
  [DOOR CREAKING OPEN] 
 
 
 
  [ENGINE STARTS, REVS] 
  Is he following? 
  A day behind, maybe more. 
  [PANTING] 
  Ah, sacrement. 
  I know this place. 
  We have been here before. 
  My body. 
  So we're close. 
  Time and space is relative here. 
  Sometimes by the hour. 
  It's part of the trick To keep me from myself. 
  - [FAROUK CHUCKLES] 
  - [MEN GRUNTING] 
  [THUNDER RUMBLING] 
  OLIVER: And David? 
  FAROUK: Our lost boy will wander this no place for the rest of his life unless he figures out the secret. 
  [PANTING] 
  [JET PASSES OVERHEAD] 
  [JET'S ROAR FADING] 
  [CLATTERING] 
  To be fair, I left a note this time. 
  - "Gone to kill the monster"? 
  - I believe I also wrote - "I love you," but yeah. 
  - Is this because of something I said in the future? 
  No. 
  Maybe. 
  A little. 
  We definitely got in a fight. 
  You have a plan, okay, in the future. 
  Help Farouk now so that he can help us later. 
  But there's got to be another way. 
  Ow! 
  - I'm on your side! 
  - Aah. 
  Aah. 
  Asshole! 
  Whatever some maybe me in the future says. 
  - Got it? 
  - Yes, ma'am. 
  Aah. 
  - [EXHALES] 
  - Now What is this place? 
  Le DÃ©solÃ©. 
  DAVID: Really hurt. 
  SYD: So, where's the monastery? 
  DAVID: I saw it, but I think it's moving. 
  SYD: How can a building move? 
  DAVID: I don't know. 
  FAROUK: Hustle up, my man. 
  We are almost there. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  NARRATOR: And now we come to the most alarming delusion of all. 
  The idea that other people don't matter. 
  Their feelings. 
  Their needs. 
  Imagine a cave where those inside never see the outside world. 
  Instead, they see shadows of that world projected on the cave wall. 
  [MONKEY CHATTERING] 
  The world they see in the shadows is not the real world. 
  MAN: Three, two, one, liftoff. 
  NARRATOR: But it's real to them. 
  If you were to show them the world as it actually is, they would reject it as incomprehensible. 
  Now what if, instead of being in a cave, you were out in the world, except you couldn't see it. 
  [OVERLAPPING VOICES ON PHONE] 
  Because you weren't looking. 
  [PHONES CHIMING] 
  Because you trusted that the world you saw through the prism was the real world. 
  [CLUCKING] 
  [CAMERA CLICKS] 
  [TYPING] 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  [TYPING] 
  But there's a difference. 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  You see, unlike the allegory of the cave, where the people are real and the shadows are false here other people are the shadows. 
  Their faces. 
  Their lives. 
  This is the delusion of the narcissist, who believes that they alone are real. 
  - [PHONE CHIMING] 
  - [TYPING] 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  Their feelings are the only feelings that matter because other people are just shadows, and shadows don't feel. 
  Because they're not real. 
  [HORN HONKS] 
  But what if everyone lived in caves? 
  [LAPTOP CHIMING] 
  Then no one would be real. 
  Not even you. 
  Unless one day you woke up and left the cave. 
  How strange the world would look after a lifetime of staring at shadows. 
  [TYPING, PHONES CHIMING] 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  [THUNDER CRACKS] 
  [THUNDER RUMBLING] 
  Let's get inside! 
  [SYD PANTING] 
  DAVID: They're Us. 
  DAVID: Let's get inside! 
  [SYD PANTING] 
  They're Us. 
  I wonder what happened to them Us out here. 
  Nothing good. 
  This place. 
  Some kind of geographic disorder. 
  Is that a thing? 
  A crossroad of possibilities. 
  When this is over, we'll go home. 
  Home? 
  Where's that? 
  We'll get a place. 
  In the country. 
  Quiet. 
  Grow old there. 
  And die, like them. 
  Every story ends the same. 
  I don't believe that. 
  Hmm. 
  Hmm, that's sweet. 
  Do something for me. 
  Anything. 
  When the time comes, prove me wrong. 
  [WIND HOWLING] 
  You better have a plan. 
  [GASPS] 
  [GASPS] 
  DAVID [ECHOING] : Find the clock. 
  Of the Long Now. 
  [GASPS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P. A. ] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [MELANIE GRUNTS] 
  OLIVER [ECHOING] : Sunflower. 
  Sunflower. 
  Melanie. 
  [MELANIE GRUNTS] 
  Sunflower. 
  [GRUNTING] 
  [MAN SPEAKING BACKWARDS OVER P. A. ] 
  Melanie. 
  Melanie. 
  - My Bonnie lives over the sea - Sunflower. 
  - My Bonnie lives over the ocean - Sunflower. 
  So bring back my Bonnie to me. 
  Melanie. 
  It's done. 
  She's ours. 
  Mine. 
  Ours. 
  Come. 
  Come.
