 Tangentially on Legion War. 
  Where's Switch? 
  He took her. 
  The scientist. 
  Cary? 
  Took You, you want me to come with you? 
  Where we're going, you won't have to hide. 
  Nothing that hurts me is real. 
  I am God. 
  Thank you. 
  - For what? 
  - Always being there for me. 
  Here's the thing, I'm gonna need you to take me back. 
  - Not far. 
  - I don't, I don't think I can do another You're not gonna lose any more I'm sorry. 
  It was too far. 
  My dad collects robots. 
  Sometimes, at night, I go in there, pretend I'm a robot, too. 
  Do you believe that I'm a good person? 
  That I deserve love just like everybody else? 
  Of course. 
  Because we can fix this world. 
  All the bad things. 
  We just got to start over. 
  What are you doing? 
  Don't It's so chilly in here, I miss my snuggle buggle. 
  Clark, I'm at work. 
  Oh, my God, I think I forgot to wear underwear. 
  Clark, stop it. 
  Stop. 
  It's true. 
  Look, I'm just saying, you think that it's fair that I have to do drop-off and pickup every day? 
  Well, I'm on an airship. 
  Oh, well Attack imminent. 
  That's not dirty I have to go. 
  Turtle. 
  Collision imminent. 
  Please, please, don't kill me. 
  Don't kill me, please don't kill me. 
  Don't kill me Autopilot engaged. 
  Damn it. 
  That hurt. 
  Sit. 
  You can't make me talk. 
  Where is she? 
  Switch. 
  My mind has been trained. 
  - I can't be probed or manipulated. 
  - Oh, is that right? 
  Well, I guess training would be in long-term memory, hmm? 
  So, let's erase that. 
  What? 
  Now I'll ask you again. 
  Where is Switch? 
  Who-who are you? 
  I'm David. 
  Your friend. 
  We went to college together. 
  But I'm sad, because I'm lookingfor my friend, Switch. 
  She's Chinese. 
  Wears really funky clothes, headphones. 
  Oh. 
  The airship. 
  Sh-She's on the airship. 
  What airship? 
  Nobody move! 
  Wh What's What the? 
  Sir? 
  Oh. 
  Maybe you can help. 
  I can't seem to remember my name. 
  - Daddy. 
  - Daddy. 
  What is happening? 
  The word is out. 
  Your children are here. 
  - Daddy! 
  - Daddy! 
  - Daddy! 
  - Daddy! 
  Where's Lenny? 
  Still mourning. 
  - She needs your love. 
  - Daddy! 
  - Daddy! 
  - Daddy! 
  Lenny! 
  Lenny! 
  Enough. 
  Lenny? 
  We're going to war. 
  What's happening, Daddy? 
  Where'd all the children go? 
  Get everyone together. 
  Lenny! 
  You killed them. 
  Wh No, I I didn't kill them. 
  They're just someplace else. 
  Lenny, I need you! 
  Me. 
  Me, me, me, me. 
  God, you are such a narcissist. 
  I found Switch. 
  She's on an airship, moving fast. 
  - I think I can - Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
  I thought I was a narcissist. 
  But then I held my baby. 
  That wasn't your baby. 
  That was a trick, just like my mother. 
  No. 
  I held her. 
  And I thought, "I am such an asshole. 
  " Man, all those years, all those shitty, pointless years. 
  My stupid life. 
  Getting high. 
  Well, you're still high. 
  No. 
  I was better. 
  I was good, okay? 
  We had plans. 
  But then you ruined it. 
  Leave Daddy alone. 
  No, it's okay. 
  She's making a choice to mope. 
  Mope? 
  They killed my family. 
  We are your family. 
  Now get it in gear. 
  We got to go get Switch. 
  But, look, if we do this, change the past, then I don't know. 
  Maybe you get her back. 
  Liar. 
  Lenny, baby I need you. 
  You can't have me. 
  No. 
  You blockhead. 
  Why is it blue? 
  It's always blue. 
  Jia-yi. 
  So this'll hide her from him? 
  I-It's like a black hole, my chamber; it's invisible in space and time. 
  Also, if she's asleep she can't do bad time sh1t. 
  - Kerry - What? 
  This is a mistake. 
  If we are the rabbit, then he is the wolf. 
  We need a plan. 
  We can't fight him. 
  I can beat him. 
  I thought that he was stronger than you. 
  Maybe, but he's erratic, impulsive. 
  I'm a strategist. 
  Negative. 
  The risks are too great. 
  The mainframe is calculating a plan. 
  - Does he know where we are? 
  - David? 
  How could he? 
  We're in the troposphere, we're traveling at 600 miles an hour. 
  It won't be enough. 
  This ship is capable of low Earth orbit. 
  Space? 
  Space We're going to space. 
  You're saying we go beyond his teleportation range; that could work. 
  "Could work. 
  " Said the rabbit to the wolf. 
  Take us up. 
  Engaging main thrusters. 
  Zero gravity protocols initiated. 
  Hi. 
  There's my handsome guy. 
  Attention. 
  All personnel brace for low Earth orbit initiation sequence. 
  In ten nine eight seven six five four three two David. 
  David. 
  My beautiful boy. 
  David. 
  Seeing you like this what you have become. 
  The sweet boy undone by revenge. 
  It fills my heart with such sorrow. 
  Nearing atmospheric barrier. 
  We're going to space. 
  David. 
  Do what you want. 
  Take what you want. 
  Gods make rules. 
  They don't follow them. 
  And now it's time for them to pay. 
  Gotcha. 
  Spectrum analysis complete. 
  System normal. 
  Data stream functioning at nominal level. 
  Full phase array activated. 
  Life-forms detected. 
  Alerting security forces. 
  Move! 
  Move! 
  Move! 
  Be free. 
  Let's go, let's go, let's Huh? 
  What Bath time. 
  I should have killed you the first time we met. 
  Yeah. 
  Infrastructure breach. 
  Multiple targets. 
  Begin lockdown procedure. 
  Virtual control in three, two, one. 
  You shouldn't have trusted him. 
  Who? 
  Farouk. 
  He called me. 
  He didn't like our plan. 
  Did you find her? 
  Switch? 
  No, I can't see her. 
  Cary built a tank. 
  She's in the lab. 
  Did you ever think you'd go to space? 
  Why would you do that, tell me where she is? 
  You're gonna find her anyway. 
  I'm not mad anymore. 
  I was. 
  But I get it now. 
  You can't love halfway. 
  Syd. 
  David. 
  I'm gonna change the past. 
  Don't worry. 
  None of this will happen. 
  Only good. 
  Good things. 
  Did you kill everyone? 
  Mm. 
  No one who dies is really dead. 
  You see that, right? 
  The past changes, and the future disappears. 
  So Clark, Lenny, we all get a do-over. 
  What happened to Lenny? 
  She abandoned me. 
  Like my parents. 
  - Like you. 
  - No, no. 
  No, you left me. 
  Remember? 
  I listened to you. 
  I trusted you. 
  I know. 
  It's not fair. 
  I was jealous. 
  Of myself. 
  Isn't that crazy? 
  I should have trusted you. 
  But she showed me things. 
  Melanie. 
  You mean Farouk showed you things. 
  He put ideas in my head that you betrayed me, that you were evil. 
  And I believed him. 
  Now look at us. 
  You left me. 
  To fix things. 
  To be with you. 
  Well, it doesn't matter. 
  'Cause you're gonna change everything. 
  So none of this will happen. 
  We'll never meet. 
  Or fall in love. 
  Do you think that it hurts? 
  What? 
  Being erased. 
  Syd. 
  It's okay. 
  I want another chance, too. 
  I love you. 
  I love you. 
  You No. 
  - It's okay, David. 
  - No! 
  It's okay. 
  Don't fight. 
  - No. 
  - It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  I got you. 
 
 
 
  - No. 
  - Come with me. 
  - Where do you think you're going? 
  - Aw. 
  Oh - Wait! 
  - Daddy! 
  Did we do good, Daddy? 
  No. 
  No. 
  I'm sorry, it's not your fault, it's mine. 
  Kerry. 
  No. 
  Wait. 
  It's me, Syd. 
  I'm in David's body. 
  What are you doing in here? 
  You're not us. 
  David. 
  No. 
  David is gone. 
  She took him. 
  It's our time now. 
  Who the hell are you? 
  I am Legion. 
  I am Legion. 
  What's happening? 
  He's fighting me. 
  I don't know how much longer I can hold him. 
  Kill me. 
  Kill? 
  Kill you you or-or him you? 
  His body. 
  This body. 
  Kill it. 
  But you're in there. 
  I'll jump back. 
  No. 
  I am Legion. 
  Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  I am Legion. 
  Legion. 
  I am Legion. 
  Legion. 
  I am Legion. 
  Too late. 
  - I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  She's here. 
  She's fighting us. 
  - We need David back. 
  - How? 
  Touch her. 
  That's how she does it. 
  - Will that work? 
  - What if she tricks us again? 
  What if she uses her powers? 
  She can't trick us if she has no mind. 
  I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  I am Legion. 
  Come back to us, David. 
  Come back. 
  - I am Legion. 
  - I am Legion. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'll fix it. 
  I promise. 
  If you think about it, it's brilliant. 
  Really. 
  To bring your enemy to a place where he can do no damage. 
  - To contain - Kill him. 
  - Quiet. 
  I'm trying. 
  - We are so close. 
  You can't stop us. 
  "Us. 
  " - Who is "us"? 
  - Me. 
  I'm gonna get free, and I'm gonna kill you. 
  And then I'm gonna undo all the sh1t you did to me. 
  Oh, such language. 
  When did you become so uncivilized? 
  When you ruined my life. 
  Because you hate me. 
  My boy, hating you would be like hating myself. 
  Wake up, my child. 
  All is forgiven. 
  You were always so good at that. 
  Using words to say things you don't mean. 
  Of course I mean them. 
  You are my son. 
  And you're my cancer. 
  This is your problem. 
  Temperament. 
  No. 
  It's your problem. 
  I had the worst dreams. 
  I know. 
  But I came to wake you up. 
  Finish what we started. 
  Are they all dead? 
  Most. 
  Or none. 
  Once we go back. 
  That-that doesn't bother you? 
  As I walk through this wicked world searching for light in the darkness of insanity I ask myself Is all hope lost? 
  Is there only pain And hatred and misery? 
  And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing that I want to know What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  And as I walked on Through troubled times My spirit gets so downhearted Sometimes So, where are the strong? 
  And who are the trusted? 
  And where is the harmony? 
  Sweet harmony Each time I feel it slipping away Just makes me want to cry What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  Oh What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  So, where are the strong? 
  And who are the trusted? 
  And where is the harmony? 
  Sweet harmony 'Cause each time I feel it slipping away Just makes me want to cry What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  Oh What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  Oh What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  Oh What's so funny 'Bout peace, love and understanding? 
  Okay. 
  I'm ready. 
  If we do this, the monsters will come, - and they won't stop. 
  - We'll be quick. 
  One change. 
  One small change, and then everything will be different. 
  So, the baby again. 
  - Your mom? 
  - No. 
  I have a different plan this time.
