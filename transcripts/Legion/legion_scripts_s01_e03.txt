 Normally with memory work we go systematically, back to front, step-by-step through your life. 
 We show you that each instance of your illness was actually your power manifesting. 
 In this way, we discover your abilities together. 
 We learn what the triggers are, but because of your sister we don't have that kind of time. 
 So let's focus on the big events. 
 [stammers] What does that mean? 
 It means the sh1t that scares you the most. 
 Now, I've been doing some digging, and I think I found the memory we couldn't access yesterday, from the kitchen. 
 So if you're ready? 
 I'll be right here.

 Honestly, I've never seen a mind like yours before. 
 It's as if your brain is defending itself. 
 Certain memories, certain parts of your story have been walled off or erased.

 It means I can't do what I need to do to orient you, to train you. 
 And frankly, I'm concerned that I'm just making things worse. 
 You're giving up. 
 No. You're too important. 
 Why? Why am I so important?
