  ["THE CASTLE" BY THE FLAMING LIPS PLAYING] 
  Her eyes Were butterflies Her smile was a rainbow Her hair Was sunbeam waves Shining 'round like a halo Her face Was a fairy tale That has a poison apple Syd.

  This morning. 
  - He looks good.

  A month. 
  A year. 
  Forever. 
  Admiral Fukyama asked if you're ready to get back to work. 
  - We need you. 
  - It's how they control us. 
  Their absence [CLEARS THROAT] 
  distracts us from our lives, the things that matter. 
  I'm not sure what you're trying It's never their fault. 
  Our men. 
  And God forbid we should have a feeling about it. 
  Mmm, what choice do they have? 
  Destiny calls. 
  [KETTLE WHISTLING] 
  What kind of bitches would we be to stand in their way? 
  [WHISTLING CONTINUES] 
  [WHISTLING STOPS] 
  Do you know what the saddest words are in the English language? 
  "Vacant lot. 
  " Don't know why. 
  Vacant lot. 
  OLIVER: My Bonnie lies over the ocean My Bonnie lies over the sea My Bonnie lies over the ocean So bring back my Bonnie to me. 
  Well, that's most uninviting. 
  Get up. 
  Sugarplum, I-I must confess bewilderment. 
  - This isn't you. 
  - How would you know? 
  Where'd you go this time? 
  This quality of light. 
  Remember that rooftop in Bombay? 
  It's called Mumbai now. 
  One of many changes since you've been gone. 
  Holding each other tight. 
  Stars above. 
  A whispered dream. 
  You left me. 
  I always come back to the girl I left behind. 
  She's gone. 
  She's not. 
  Look. 
  [GASPS] 
  I was worried. 
  When you came back If you you came back. 
  All those years. 
  Did they make me unrecognizable? 
  What are years? 
  Just trips around the sun. 
  [WATER BABBLING] 
  [BIRD SQUAWKS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  FAROUK: We must leave soon. 
  And go where? 
  To find the monk. 
  Remember? 
  Le moine qui garde. 
  Have you seen him? 
  The monk of the Mi-Go order. 
  Is he here? 
  At Division 3? 
  He alone knows where the body's hidden. 
  Yes. 
  I remember now. 
  The monk. 
  - [SHUDDERS] 
  - [BEEP] 
  Hmm. 
  You should have burned it. 
  How's th how's that? 
  If you had, I wouldn't have been stuck in that hard ice cube. 
  You see, I'm still tied to my corporeal form. 
  But if you just burned me Burned you. 
  Mm. 
  I could have danced through a cosmic field of multidimensions with no outer limits to speak of. 
  Would've been beautiful. 
  Well, what about me? 
  Us? 
  You could have tagged along, to the beyond, where the real action happens. 
  Tagged along. 
  Is that the wrong word? 
  Followed. 
  Yes, followed. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  There was a time when you'd follow me anywhere. 
  MELANIE: Yes. 
  Yes, there was. 
  And where did that get me? 
  Things they've changed between us, haven't they? 
  Yes. 
  They have. 
  [GASPS] 
  [EXHALES] MAN [OVER P. A. ] : New symptom alert: a growing sense of outrage. 
  [ANNOUNCEMENT CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] 
  Seriously, Melanie, when are you coming back to work? 
  Did you ever wonder if all of this is just a dream? 
  What? 
  Life. 
  The world. 
  I mean, h-how do I know that you're even real? 
  - How do you? 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  I'm real. 
  How do you know? 
  'Cause when I hit people, they fall down. 
  MELANIE: Hmm. 
  Hmm. 
  Cause and effect. 
  Um, e-except that maybe they're not real either. 
  Maybe all of this is just a fantasy in his head. 
  Whose head? 
  Cary. 
  Cary. 
  Your-your other half. 
  I mean, think about it. 
  You might not even be here right now. 
  Y-You're just his fantasy. 
  You know, as if, you know, um deep down, he is yearning to be a strong, sensual young woman. 
  And-and I'm saying that-that you're his delusion. 
  Okay, I'm gonna go. 
  You're clearly having a senior moment. 
  No, no, wait, but-but Or, or h-he Maybe he's your fantasy. 
  Your fantasy, your desire for authority, and that the Cary you think you know doesn't exist. 
  Maybe he's your delusion. 
  Get real. 
  [WHISPERS] : Get real. 
  Get real. 
  You know, reality is a choice. 
  Who said that? 
  Someone. 
  Someone. 
  Stop talking weird. 
  You're saying a lot of words that don't make sense. 
  You know, I was I was married once. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Yeah, to Oliver. 
  I met him. 
  You did? 
  Wasn't he handsome? 
  For 21 years, he lived in an ice cube. 
  - Doesn't that sound nice? 
  - No. 
  Oh, I think it sounds wonderful. 
  An ice cube built for two. 
  We should go back there. 
  I told him that. 
  And then he said, "But what about the world?" And that's-that's when it hit me. 
  All these years, I'd been so focused on saving the world that I overlooked the most crucial fact of all. 
  You're gonna make me ask. 
  What is it? 
  There is no world to save. 
  It's all in my head.

  - That is not our job! 
  We're just supposed to deliver it. 
  To who? 
  I don't know. 
  We have to trust David. 
 
 
 
  I don't want to.

  ["MON ENFANCE" BY JACQUES BREL PLAYING] 
  Are you thirsty? 
  I'm thirsty. 
  What? 
  [MAN SINGING IN FRENCH] 
  Think about it, we We understand life backwards, but it's got to be lived forwards. 
  JANINE: Ain't that the truth. 
  No, no, it's a quote. 
  Quick. 
  Who said it? 
  - You? 
  - No, originally. 
  You. 
  Ah, forget it. 
  Only, don't ever. 
  [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] 
  [FRENCH SINGING CONTINUES] 
  [FRENCH SINGING CONTINUES] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Ever see an electric octopus? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Once. 
  But I kept my distance. 
  Where was it? 
  - When? 
  - Where? 
  Wait, did you say octopus? 
  Ah, I was thinking ocelot. 
  Bad dream? 
  [GASPS] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You know, man, when you walk with the Lord, the Lord walks with you. 
  In all my dreams, for as long as I can remember, I was never myself. 
  Now I'm only myself in dreams. 
  Isn't that funny? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm sorry. 
  Really, - I am. 
  - [MUFFLED SCREAM] 
  AMY: No, you're not. 
  Oh. 
  [GROANS] 
  What do you want from me? 
  You need to do what you're told. 
  By who? 
  By me. 
  David. 
  He's waiting. 
  He needs you. 
  For what? 
  I-I don't understand. 
  The electric octopus. 
  You've seen it, too? 
  It's My guess is Helsinki. 
  Or Stockholm. 
  Which-which one is in Switzerland? 
  Are you prepared to do whatever it takes? 
  For David? 
  Yeah. 
  You love him. 
  Don't be stupid. 
  Like the flower loves the bee. 
  He really needs me? 
  What about what's her name? 
  Ms. 
  Perfect. 
  S-Sydney. 
  She can't do what you can do. 
  [SNAPS FINGERS] 
  Amen, sister. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Lenore. 
  Okay. 
  Yeah. 
  If he needs me, I'll Whatever. 
  I'm just on the R and R right now. 
  - You know? 
  - Lenore. 
  What? 
  Neither Helsinki or Stockholm are in Switzerland. 
  JANINE: Your Majesty? 
  We're going to have a little prince. 
  They have cream soda? 
  Uh, it's unlikely. 
  Hmm. 
  What is it? 
  Nothing. 
  Well, I'm worried about Melanie. 
  She's not herself these days. 
  An impostor? 
  N-No, I just mean she's feeling blue. 
  Like the color? 
  N-No. 
  Sad or-or melancholy. 
  Then why did you say "blue"? 
  Eh, because it's a figure of speech, like having too much time on your hands or-or no. 
  Anyway, we're getting off track. 
  Maybe with Melanie it's a symptom of being alone. 
  She's surrounded by people. 
  True, but a person in a crowd can still feel alone. 
  But they're not. 
  And yet they are. 
  Okay. 
  I am gonna die. 
  - What? 
  - Someday. 
  I'm getting old. 
  And then you'll be alone like, like Melanie. 
  You're not gonna die. 
  No? 
  I would stab Death twice in the heart before he could get you. 
  While an implausible and, um rather gruesome image it is a comforting one, nonetheless. 
  Is that? 
  It appears so. 
  Uh [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  Is anybody out there? 
  [RADIO STATIONS CHANGING RAPIDLY] 
  Paranoia, they destroy ya Excuse me Hello? 
  Self-destroyer - Wreck your health. 
  - LENNY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
  [MUSIC STOPS] 
  Well, sh1t. 
  No, that's okay. 
  I put a tracking device on the weapon. 
  We can follow it. 
  [BEEPING] 
  Paranoia They destroy ya And it goes like this. 
  [ENGINE SPUTTERING] 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  [ENGINE STOPS] 
  [EXPLOSION] 
  MELANIE: Yes. 
  Yes, he's here. 
  He talked to her. 
  OLIVER: Are you sure? 
  Yes, I'm sure. 
  You should have heard it. 
  [WHIRRING] 
  Th-The yelling you could hear it all over the building. 
  If he's real, which which he isn't, but, you know, if he is And I think you've crushed him. 
  I really do. 
  Hmm. 
  Revenge. 
  Uh, what do you think he wants? 
  Some kind of plan. 
  Pluck out your eyes. 
  Hi-His eyes. 
  There was a letter for her. 
  The-the girl. 
  He wrote a letter, but he But he left alone. 
  He's coming alone. 
  Yes. 
  Yes, I'm sure. 
  I-If I exist then with certainty. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, I want to come, too. 
  N-Now. 
  Now. 
  Promise? 
  Just one one more thing. 
  Violence why does it always end in violence?
