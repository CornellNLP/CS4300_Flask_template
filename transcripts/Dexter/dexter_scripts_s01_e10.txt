 Previously on "Dexter"... 
 You still don't remember anything from before? 
 You know, before we took you in? 
 No. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique. 
 It might bring some things to the surface. 
 Mama! 
 It was a match. 
 Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad. 
 And this is Rudy. 
 Dexter. 
 Hey. 
 I have waited a long time to meet you. 
 Why the different nail polishes? 
 What the hell's this guy thinking? 
 And the real king is still out there. 
 Hungry. Ready. 
 He'll kill again. 
 It's just a matter of time. Dex, Rudy's different. I feel safe with him. I think  -- I'm falling for him. Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week. You think you can really make me back down? Are you f*cking my wife? The kids are already settled at Colleen's. You can have your visit when we get back. I just wish he'd go away. I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever? No! f*cking whore! Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday. Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off. What about breakfast? Made and eaten. And the kids' lunches? Packed and ready to go. Did you tell the locksmith? Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways. I want to talk to your mom for a sec. Are you gonna make out? None of your business. Are you? Astor. Rita, you don't have to do this, you know. Getting attacked by your ex-husband merits a day off. I'm fine. I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore. Those days are over. It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified. They'll find him. What if they don't? I got you some pepper spray. Just aim for the eyes. Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake. I had some at Kirk's birthday, 10 days ago. See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here. Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think. It started out vanilla. Guys, you should look at this. Put that thing down, for God's sake. It was addressed to Homicide. Put it down! Jesus, is that blood? Morgan, get your ass over here. Ass en route. You're the blood expert. What is this sh1t? It's a little watery for jam. Maybe you should open it. What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released? I got to wash my hands. So gullible. What is it? Well, it's definitely blood. Wait, there's something in here. Marina View hotel. It's a key. May be some sort of promotional gag. You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood. Show-and-tell's over. Let's try and find out who sent this. Grab Batista and get over to that hotel. Batista's still working on the explosion at the smack lab. Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me. A jar of blood -- Dramatic, cryptic, playful. Could it be him? Got an extra key from the manager. Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk. The guy who checked into 103 was white and normal looking. I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here. It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security. Better be ready to cancel your lunch. Police. Open up. Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room. Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8 out at the Marina View hotel. I need uniformed backup, forensics. f*ck it. Just send everybody out. It's been a while since we went prophylactic. Not me. Last night, I met this chick -- I'll stop you right there, Vince. So, they tell you anything about what's inside? No one's been inside. Too much blood. Dexter. Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there. Okay. I'm serious. Okay. She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there. Okay. You're going in first alone. Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up. Now I'm really curious. He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me? Mommy! Tell me you found something, Morgan. I talked to the guests in room 105. They didn't see anyone go in or out. What about across the hall? German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen. They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming. Oh, my god! Hey. Hey, you okay? I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there. Never should have skipped breakfast. Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there? No, I'm okay. I just need a little air. Something finally got to you. I guess you're human after all. Cut him some slack, all right? I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar. Tell us what you saw, Dex. How many dead? A lot. But no bodies, just blood -- 50, 60 liters. Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know. You're saying there was a mass murder in there, but they took the bodies? How is that possible? There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms. Someone would have seen corpses coming out. I don't f*cking know. Hey, Dexter, you all right? I can't go back in there. You don't have to. Fine. Just get yourself cleaned up and -- I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something. You're in room 422. Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags. Dade county sheriff's department. I'm looking for Rita Bennett. That's me. Did you find Paul? I'm sorry? Paul Bennett. My ex-husband attacked me last night. My boyfriend filed a police report. The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed. What? Wait. Paul filed a police report? For what? Assault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital. He's pressing charges against you. He attacked me! Not according to him. All right. Can we talk about this later? We need a formal statement. You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station. Fine. Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right? Sweet. You should really get in here, Dex. I never seen anything like this. Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts. Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see. Photos, Vince. Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting? The blood's not clotting? No. Genuine medical mystery. Just keep getting samples. I'll test it at the lab. Hello? Don't hang up. Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station. Paul's pressing assault charges against me. How's it even possible? I was defending myself. Just stay calm. I know a lawyer. I'll straighten it out. I am calm. They're the hysterical ones. They're charging me with a class-2 felony. Hello, Dexter? Are you there? Yeah, I'm right here. This is ridiculous. I could lose my job. I could lose my kids. I won't let that happen. Well, I'm glad you're so confident. Rita, just trust me. I know how the system works. Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you. Yeah, bye. Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out. What? A wall socket? Yeah. Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall -- Hey, you're right. There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up. Come take a look. Photos, Vince. Lots and lots of photos. Open Sesame. Blood samples for the fridge. And you better make room. There's a lot more coming. Shooters at the Bel Canto tonight. You in? I'm not in the mood. Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central. Look at this. They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond. You're in worse shape than I thought. Oh, hi. Hi. Oh, Masuka was looking for you. Something about drinks at the Bel Canto. Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection. A bit of an overshare. You want to talk about what happened today? Already did. Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died. Can talk to me, you know? Just got to open your mouth and move it. I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late. Deb, seriously. I puked. I'm fine. I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do. Why do you always do this? Do what? You shut me out! Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you. I still don't know how that makes you feel. I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call. Fine. Whatever. Did Paul force his way into the house? No. Did you ask him to leave? Yes, and he refused. But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom. He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading -- Cracked ribs and a broken jaw. And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent. Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you. Paul has a record of spousal abuse. Spousal abuse can be mutual. It was never mutual. Okay. But the man is a model parolee. His drug tests are clean. He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor. Corrections will want to see this guy transition. I don't care! He's not going near my children. Do you understand? Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children. Now, you have deposition in two days. Do not give this man any more ammunition than he already has. Okay. Damn. Just blood? What happened to the bodies? Hell if I know. I don't want to know. Blood was bad enough. No wonder you seem so amped. Your brother must have loved it. f*ck no. He freaked. Really? I thought, you know, blood was his thing. What happened? I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out. Did he say anything? Let's not talk about Dex right now. Was it like a panic attack? I don't know. He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed. Kiss me. What's the matter? You don't even have wood. Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk. Yeah, but not now. I'm horny. Maybe I should call him. Are you f*cking kidding me? What? We -- We bonded last weekend. Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family? Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants. Deb, that's not fair. You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn? I mean, your issues don't have to be mine. You know what? Forget it. Let's just go to sleep. Okay. I'm gonna go watch TV. She loved him so goddamn much. She took every one of his CDs in the separation. She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits. Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn." Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman." You got to love that sh1t. That's like the fourth chick you've driven off. Waitress! Is there a waitress? I need a drink. Waitress! Bro, you're a train wreck. Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce. I ain't ashamed. Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic. Look... Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask. Comprendo? Eighty-six the ring. I have to take a squirt. She's gonna f*ck me silly. My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her... Or with anybody. Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags. Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage... Until that boy in the blood. He scares me. I want him to go away. You awake? What? Are you sure you locked the door? Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain. What am I gonna do? Don't worry. I'll figure it out. And I will. I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own. Fortunately, Rita's has a name. Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103 left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for -- The killer's. This shows everywhere he went in the room. The question is why. Hold on. Aren't we missing something? Where are the victims' footprints? Give that lady a lollipop. Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103? Why would a guy stage a massacre and not have any bodies? And where'd he get the blood? I've just got a preliminary blood report. The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more. My fellow traveler had five victims. Ice-truck killer had 5 victims. 5 bloodless victims. I always wondered what he did with the blood. Wait, wait. The ice-truck killer did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the motherfucking Marina View hotel. Why would he do that? To chase me down the rabbit hole. What was that, Morgan? I didn't say anything. I'll remind you people -- We arrested the ice-truck killer. His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county. Bullshit. Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud. Try telling that to the capital. I did. Do we have any more evidence to support this theory? When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin. One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative. It means the blood's old. Plus the blood spatters' all impact and castoff. There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims. Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck killer's victims. You two get out to the Marina View hotel. Retrace his steps. Maybe it'll tell us something. And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck killer. All right, Astor, just stand up straight. Now, do you have the emergency phone number list? It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again? Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight. Rita? You're scaring them. Yeah, well, they should be. I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night. What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'? I smelled gas. I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan. Remember what the lawyer said. You don't want to do anything rash. Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time. Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on. Daddy, what happened? Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it. 
 
 Hey, we're going to the circus. We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember? Good. All right. Ready? Got your stuff? Let's go. You okay? I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one. If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight. All I need is a little proof of his inner monster. Harry would have insisted on that. Harry didn't believe in preemptive killing, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once. After all, Harry wasn't perfect. He lied about my birth father. The trifecta -- Weapon, ammo, and impaired judgment. Throw in a little domestic violence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter. Mommy! Hide your head, Dexter. Close your eyes. No! So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk... And then over to the bedside table. There's a clock radio and some smeared blood. Maybe he turned it on. No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again. We've been over it three times! Well, maybe the map's wrong. Call your brother. What? Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter? You don't even like him. What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish? No, it's just... It's Rudy. We had our first fight. Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it. I thought we were talking about your brother. We were. And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s. Turn that off. No, wait. I want to hear it. It's Devo. Turn that sh1t off. He said 103 fm. This is room 103. Leviticus 10:3. 10:3 -- 103. Son of a bitch. You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified." Hey. Hey. Deb's pissed at me. I need advice. So you came here? You know you know her better than anyone. Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew. Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing. Right. And the next, she wants to... jump my bones. I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know? She's my sister. I don't know. Can I help you find something? You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife. Thanks. Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you. Me? Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it. So, what do I do? Tell her it's all your fault. Seriously? You will eventually. Deb has a way of wearing you down. Just start from there. It's easier. I got to take this. You mind if I...? Hey. Where are you? Still at work, chasing a lead. Let me guess -- The bloodbath case. I don't want to talk shop right now. Baby, I am so sorry. You were totally right. I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you. My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk? I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter. Well, after. Yeah, but here's the thing. I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight. I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know. You understand, right? Yeah. I'll call you tomorrow. Care to dance? You dance to this? A bit. What about your wife? Tan line on your ring finger. Well, um... I'm not gonna talk about that tonight. Divorced? I get it. Mine was just finalized. Let's go. Will you excuse me? Excuse me. Police. I need to talk to you. I'm not a hooker anymore. I work for a legitimate escort service now. I'm not here to bust anyone. I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do. He was a real good client. You want to spend the night in a cell? All right. About a year ago, there was this guy. Guy or client? A john, okay? That's when I worked Calle Ocho. Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this. Then what? Then he changed his tune, got all turned on. Told me to take my fake hand off. He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it. To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color. I liked it, so I kept doing it. You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings? Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill? Is that the guy? No way. My trick, he's sexy. A freak, but sexy. Okay. From the beginning and with more detail. Well, thanks for the hospitality. Hey, thanks for the steaks. You know, I didn't get a chance to ask. Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene. Did she? Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me. Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk. Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories... For real? You know something about it? More than I ever wanted to. When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck. Who was she? I didn't know. Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back... My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car. I watched her die. How old were you? 4. I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter. Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it. What kind of memories are you having? They're still a little vague. Right. Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually. Maybe next time. When you see Deb, go with white roses. They're her favorite. That's a good tip. It's funny how life brings people together, huh? Rudy misunderstands my problem. I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back. Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now. Like forgotten cellphones. What do you got? Well, so far we're chasing a ghost. Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic. Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene. Screw the numbers. Who was killed? Where are the bodies? I heard some pretty wild theories out there. Just theories. We're still waiting for full blood results. Damn it, Maria, you're stalling. I'm just trying to avoid speculation. Well, you got to give me something and soon. This department can't afford another public relations disaster. Well... Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go. He's not the ice-truck killer. Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this. Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen. The D.A. takes his cues from us. If you just tell him you made a mistake... Not going to happen. Now let it go. First break in this case, you come straight to me. This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night. Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex. No, that's not what I mean. So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right? Would you shut up? It was a lead. On what? I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia. But don't let them hear you call it that. It sounds like a disease. No, they prefer to be known as "devotees." I knew you were the man to ask. Not really. I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip. You know who you should talk to? It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend. Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time. Thanks. No memory flashes here. No little lost boy in blood. Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex. Here's to hoping. Yo, Dex. Hey. So, this is what you do for a living? I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene. A power tool was used. Here you go. Oh, thanks. Circular saw. Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this. Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours. You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals. It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw. Yeah, I hear that. But this power tool was plugged into a socket. Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw. Come on, people. We're coming up empty. Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3. We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months. Think. 1-0-3. 103. Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate. What is it? I want answers. What are you doing here? How do you always do it? Do what? Make me feel like I'm 6 years old all the time. If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone. Where'd he leave it? My apartment. What was he doing there? Uh... eating steaks. And? Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer. And? Debra. And? Talking? Talking. You talked. You opened your mouth, and sounds came out. On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out. Oh. Yeah, "oh." You don't talk to me, Dex. You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance. But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones -- They were porterhouses. Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night. Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you. So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me. I think I have earned it. I'm late for Rita's deposition. Deb, it's hard for me. You know that. You Rudy Cooper? Angel Batista. I work with your girlfriend, Debra. Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. Sure. Let me just grab the door. So, does this have to do with a case? You could say that. Well, fire away. Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand -- Call girl, actually. Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee. You have a lead on this client? That's the bitch of it. I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky s*x stuff. I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos. I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off. Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that. But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you. That'd be great. How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh? You in a rush for this information? No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really. Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something. Will do. Good to meet you. Good to meet you. Last question. According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend. That's right. His father died. Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time? I told Paul I'd make it up to him. So, then he gave you permission? No. I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place. I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that. Could you give us a second? Yes, of course. Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement? I didn't know it was a big deal. I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else... No, that's fine. If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday. Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation. It's mandatory in these cases. The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing. For me? But he's the ex-con. It's standard. Rita, you should be fine. Should be? You mean she could actually lose this? Guys... I'm handcuffed here. You violated a custody agreement. You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom. He has a case. Mama, look at my henna tattoo. So, how much candy have you had? Lots. Thanks. Now she'll never get to sleep. She'll calm down soon. This one's already crashed. Mom, can my dad read me a story? I don't think so, honey. Please? Okay. But just one. Put your duds on, buddy -- Spider-man ones I bought you. I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left. Thanks, Betty. Thank you. Hey, Rita. It doesn't have to be this way. I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right? I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation. f*ck you. Hey, Dexy. You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation. If she loses that case, she could lose the kids. That won't happen. Never say "won't." We live in a world of wills -- Wills and wonders. That's what I'm trying to teach my children. And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget. Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right? Hey, I'm sober. Look. No needle marks. I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room. My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny bitch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt -- Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved. I think this is why. Astor, go brush your teeth. Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own. They were wrong. Paul? Dexter? Where were you? Taking out the trash. Did you see Paul? When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open. Hey, my dad's car is gone. Let's face it, Paul. You've been a problem. It's time for you to go away. The ice-truck killer case has been reopened. Officially. We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims. What about Neil Perry? Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck killer? All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews. He's been personally handling the Perry case. Oh, sh1t. I hope she told the Captain. Who knew? Who knew about this? This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain. The ice-truck killer is still at large. Sure. I'll call you back. You overplayed your hand, Maria. I gave you a chance to make it right. I told you -- You don't tell me sh1t! This is my department. I made you lieutenant. Me. You were just another spik detective. Nice, Tom. Real nice. Your true colors finally come out. Oh, no. No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria. But you're about to. Enjoy this office while it's still yours. Thank you. Dexter. What happened? What's wrong? It's Paul. I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law. He's back in jail. It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it. What's so funny, mom? Yeah, why are you laughing? No problem is insurmountable. Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami. Paul did need to go away. This is the police. Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television. - But death wasn't the answer. Police. Open up. We're coming in, Mr. Bennett. - Life in prison will do just fine. For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken. Hey, get over here. You're part of this family, too. I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street. A guy's been stabbed. Stay with us. Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us. Heard they're dropping ice-truck murder charges on Neil Perry.
