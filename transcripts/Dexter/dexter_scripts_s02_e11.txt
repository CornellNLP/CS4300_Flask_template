 Previously on  Dexter... 
 Subtitles: swsub.com Jesus Christ, you're the Bay Harbor Butcher. 
 I hate that name. 
 What's it gonna be, Morgan? 
 Kill me now or set me free! 
 James knows that I believe in him, so it was worth the risk. 
 To your job? To your career? 
 When you care about someone, you do what you have to do. 
 Your credibility was compromised when you failed to report a call from the subject of a goddamn FBI manhunt. 
 What really pisses me off is you might be right. 
 The kids have been through so much lately. 
 I don't want them to feel like they've been abandoned by everyone they love. 
 Does this mean we're dating again? 
 I track killers. That's what I do. They tend to move around. 
 I know that. 
 Then I'm not sure what you thought would happen when the case ended. 
 I like it rough. 
 Jesus. 
 I don't need Doakes dead. I just need his fingerprints to complete my frame job. 
 Every saturday, beginning dive classes practice underwater skills beside this dock. 
 Tomorrow they'll find a morbid little surprise. I wanna know if there's anything unusual about my father's death. He killed himself. The idea of a code was one thing, but the reality of it? Harry walked in on what he created... and he couldn't live with himself. I always thought hardening arteries squeezed the life out of my father, but it was me. Harry gazed into the eyes of his creation and saw evil, pure and simple. My evil... It killed him. That sh1t about your father... If you wanna talk about it... About what? Did you happen to be stuffing a human leg into a garbage bag at that point? If you wanna make a change, now's the time. All you got to do is let me out of here. It's over, man. It is over when I say it is! There's that anger again. You got to let that out, man. Careful, sergeant, you might get your wish. I'm flying without a code here. I can unleash the beast anytime. You know that's not the answer. But it would feel f*cking great. But you would hate yourself for the rest of your life. All the things Harry taught me... everything... It's bullshit. It's the only way I know how to live. Turn yourself in. Rule number one... Don't get caught. You're spinning. Let me help you. It's only a matter of time before you'll hurt someone else. I'm talking about your sister or your girlfriend or even those kids. I would never... No, not on purpose, but you can't control the sh1t that's growing inside of you. It's like cancer. And in case you haven't noticed, it's spreading. End it now. Take responsibility for who you are, man. We'll go to the station together. I'll help you. Morgan, don't answer that. Stay with me, man. f*ck! Yes, this is Dexter Morgan. My name is Dr. Hill. I work at Good Samaritan hospital. I'm calling on behalf of Lila Tournay. How did you get this number? - You're on her emergency contact list. Ms. Tournay was rushed into our E. R. In respiratory arrest. Could you come to the hospital? I'm two hours away. Call somebody else. There's a legal complication. What kind of complication? I can't discuss it over the phone. You really need to be here. Where are you going? Don't worry, I'll send the FBI your way soon enough. You're still gonna try to frame me? I'm kind of down a path here. You'll get your chance to tell them I'm the killer, and they'll ignore you like before, and I'll... And you'll burn in hell. Something like that. He's gone, Dex. Dad's heart finally gave out. Harry's heart gave out when he saw what's inside me. He thought he could tame it, give it a purpose, help it find a place in the natural order. Guess he was wrong. I need a second alone with him, okay? Thanks. We spoke on the phone regarding your girlfriend, Ms. Tournay. She's not my girlfriend. I thought she said she was. She probably did. So, you're... It's complicated. Look, why is Angel here? We found rohypnol, the date-rape drug, in Lila's system. With her bruising, the wound to the back of her head, we may be looking at a case of sexual assault. No, that didn't happen. Ms. Tournay has no recollection of what did happen. She's requested we perform a rape kit. I need to talk to her. You came to see me. You're so sweet. The doctors think Angel raped you. Did he? Everything's a bit fuzzy. This is desperate. It won't work. What are you talking about? I'm just glad you're here. I missed you so much. This is how you win me back? Framing a good man to get what you want? Which is precisely what I'm doing to Doakes. What's the matter, Dexter? You look so sad... lost. Don't do this. I won't press charges against Angel. I'll do whatever you want. If you promise to take me back. Why can't you just let me go? Because I'm your real soul mate. Not Rita. Me. I see you. Inside. And I'm the only one. Look where it's gotten you. You know that I could never do anything like that, right? You don't even have to say anything. You warned me about her, but my dick wouldn't listen. I could lose everything over this. What would I say to my little girl? The doctor said Lila has 72 h to press charges. Maybe she'll come to her senses. I should get home and grab a few hours of sleep. Let me get this. No, back off. I got it. If I got to choose a person... A real person... to be like... Out of anyone, it'd be you. I'm not really sure what that means, but, thanks, Dex. See you in the morning. I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone at the station. Of course not. Thanks. How did it come to this? I've always gone after criminals. Now I have the fate of two cops in my hands. Doakes was right. The cancer is spreading. We're out of yogurt. Add it to the list. We'll stop by the store tonight. The store's on the way to work. It's also on the way home. We're gonna be late. Who joined who in the shower this morning? How about, in the futur, I set the alarm 10 min earlier? Make it 20. "The future", I'm liking the sound of that. We're being ordered to work. You're the head of the task force, you do the ordering. Who's D. D. Adams? My boss. Mission accomplished. The weapons I tossed into the ocean were found as planned. One more nail in Doakes' coffin. All right, people. Listen up. This is FBI deputy director Max Adams. He just got in from Washington. He's going to be helping us out for a while. Once again, I have pledged our full cooperation and resources, so let's make him feel at home. The murder weapons before you were found yesterday by a beginning scuba-diving class. The instructor contacted the FBI directly which brought them to my attention. Fingerprint analysis ties them to one James Doakes. This doesn't prove a damn thing. Not now. Why wasn't I brought in on this? You just were, Frank. Now, we know sergeant Doakes... Lundy better watch his back. He's abandoned the tools of the trade that means he's probably on the run. This footage was taken four days ago at a mobile station just off highway 41, southeast of Naples. Ladies and gentlemen, sergeant James Doakes. I can't believe it. $3.49 for regular? So, we... have let our target get away once. Let's not drop the ball again. Asshole. Highway 41 runs through the Everglades national park. It won't be long now. I can hang this on Doakes and then... Then what? Years of trials and appeals with him[i] [i]pointing his finger and calling me killer?[i] [i]For such a neat monster, I'm making an awfully big mess. Where does this prick Adams get off taking such cheap shots at Lundy? I heard that Doakes walked off in the middle of Lundy's questioning and that Lundy didn't stop him. I might have heard that wrong. Peters. Nice hair, Borelli. I'm sure the johns up in Boystown are loving that Duran Duran look. What? You meatheads lose your sense of humor? Your joke wasn't funny. We have a warrant for detective Batista's arrest. Bullshit. For what? A woman named Lila Tournay has filed sexual-assault charges against him. That f*cking bitch! It's okay. I knew this was coming. It's not okay. Captain, lieutenant! Put those away or I will shove them up your ass! What's going on here? We've been asked to bring Batista upstairs for processing I'm sure that detective Batista will go along with you peacefully. It's not your fault. I'll be okay. It isn't my fault. I warned Angel. Still, I hate to see him disgraced in front of everyone. And LaGuerta about to lose her former partner, her friend. Even Lundy is caught in hurricane Dexter's path of destruction. Maybe this is how evil works. Destroying everything it touches... including my father. You're not gonna believe the morning I'm having. I know the feeling. My car is stalled on harper and 3rd. Think you can come get me? Hang tight. I'll be right there. Thanks, Dex. I'm the helpful handyman. How evil can I possibly be? I'm sparing Rita and Deb by framing Doakes. Right? Over here! Thank God. I've been held prisoner in a cabin for 2 f*cking days. f*cking hellhole. I don't wanna go to the cabin. I need you to get my ass out of here. I'm a police sergeant. Miami metro homicide. I gotta run upstairs. There's a whole Batista thing going on. Lunch today? Doubtful. I've got to write up a status report for deputy director Adams. Why'd they send that dipshit? Washington gets nervous when there's no movement on a case, especially one as big as this. No movement? You're the reason they found the blood slides in Doakes' car. I'm also the one who let him get away. We all let him get away. I was in charge. The evidence was there, but something inside me wasn't convinced he was our guy so... I let him walk. It was a bad call. Now we might never... Stop it. Stop what? Acting like me. You're a God. Don't you forget it. So, what do you think it is? Carburettor. Transmission. That round, black hose thing. I'm more a boat guy. The last thing I need right now is a major repair bill. Throw in a tow and rental car, there goes Astor's piano lessons. Take the mini-van. No, I can't. It's too big of an inconvenience. You'll drop me at work. I'll borrow one from the motor pool. I'll make it up to you. Dinner? I have a better idea. Pack a lunch, bring the kids, I'll take you out on the ocean tomorrow. The kids have school tomorrow. Think of it as a field trip. You don't know cody's teacher. Just one day... Just one more day. Is everything okay, Dexter? After everything we've been through lately, I just want... to be together with you guys. Is that selfish? No, it's lovely. Sergeant Doakes can rejoice. I come bearing real food. sh1t. All right. Suck my dick, m*therf*cker. You understand? Friends of yours? From what I can tell, they're friends of that drug dealer. They would've killed me once I had all that coke on the boat. Thanks, Morgan. Well, this is awkward. I think we made some alligators very happy. So, here we are. Back to f*cking square one. Not exactly. I'll tell you what, James. Can I call you James? Knock yourself out. I'm toying with an idea... I've been under federal investigation for two months. My trophies were stolen. Sorry. The code I live by has been shattered. And I have a co-worker in a cage. Things aren't going so well. No sh1t. I can see that. You told me... to take responsibility for what I am. You were right. Harry killed the wrong person. Morgan, you're not thinking about... Kill myself? No, that's pathetic. But I can't live in this house of cards anymore, waiting for it all to fall down. I need to do something, you know? I'm thinking about turning myself in. That's a good call, Morgan. That's a tough call, but that's a good call, man. I need some f*cking relief. Yeah, you can't keep running, man. That's for pussies. You're just gonna end up in exactly the same situation... sooner or later. Prison. I could finally get some sleep. Yeah. In the long run it would be easier on Deb... Better than watching me dragged in like an animal... Which, let's face it, will happen... someday. Morgan, we'll do it together. I'll go with you. Come on, let's go. If I do this, I need a day to get my affairs in order. Fine. Tie me up, throw me in the trunk. Let's go. I brought supplies. Fresh fruit. Mention that when they interview you for the story of my life. Don't leave me in this cage, anything could happen. What're you doing? I think we've seen the worst of that. I've really enjoyed our conversations, James. I lie to everyone I know... except my victims right before I kill them. It's hard to establish much of a rapport there. Sorry about the cage. f*ck. 
 
 What? It's me. What are you doing tonight? I'm about to get off of work, why? I've got some papers I need you to sign. Papers? What kind of papers? I'll explain when I see you. I'm meeting Masuka and Batista for drinks. Why don't you bring the papers and join us? How's Angel doing? How do you think he's doing? It's your fault he's in this mess. If you hadn't f*cked Elvira. I'm not the best brother, am I? Dexter, are you smoking something? I've always been curious to try. Do you have any weed? Okay, now I'm really worried. There's no need to worry. I'll bring by the papers tomorrow. It's strange. This should be difficult, but a sense of peace is settling over me. Calm. Maybe it's the moonlight. Tom? Can I meet you outside? Sure. I'll check in back home. I need a personal day. I hope it's a joke. Just one day. I think I can prove James is innocent. I talked to a couple of FBI agents who were in Haiti... Jesus, Maria. We're in the middle of a manhunt. You're down two detectives and now you want time off? No. We can't spare you right now. This wasn't a request. I won't be here tomorrow. I just wanted you to know that. - Diablo. What is this sh1t, Masuka? Hey, tequila's all the same. Not when it's made from pumpkins. We're not in the same pay grade. If I lose my job over this, bro, I won't have a pay grade. It won't happen. We all know you're innocent. How am I gonna prove it? I can't explain the roofies, the rough s*x. Rough s*x? It was her idea. Now it's my word against hers. I'm screwed. You have got to fight back. Dude, Morgan's right. You got to man up, get tough. Love's a battlefield. Or in your case, a restraining order. I appreciate you guys doing this, but you don't have to stay. Does it ever floor you guys that we had a killer right under our noses this whole time? I mean, who doesn't see that sh1t? That didn't come out right. It's all right. That stuff doesn't bother me anymore. Next round's on me. I was wondering when you'd show up. We need to talk. Sounds good to me. I'm making coffee. Do you want one? I'm here to ask you respectfully to drop the charges against Angel. If Angel molested me, as the evidence seems to indicate, then he should face the consequences. Don't you think? It doesn't matter what I think. But here's what I know. After tomorrow, I won't be around anymore, so there's no end game in this for you. You're going somewhere? It's looking more and more likely. Where? All that matters is that I'll be out of reach permanently. Come on! Tell me. I have a right to know. You're the one who taught me about accepting the things you can't change. This is one of those things. I don't understand how men can be so stupid. Not all men. Yes, every single one of you. I mean, how could Dexter and Batista be so easily duped by Lila? I took one look at her, I knew she was a walking nightmare. That's not stupidity. It's simply in our DNA. When a pretty girl smiles and bats her eyelashes, we're powerless to resist. I'm worried about Batista. This is so f*cked. I won't let him take the fall for this. What can you do? I was wondering if you might access those great, big FBI files of yours and do a search on Miss Lila Tournay. You see? Powerless to resist. Will Adams be pissed off when he sees you used FBI files for this? I certainly hope so. She has no warrants. No criminal record. Nothing with the DMV. And no social security number. What about visas or green cards or whatever? Nothing. No records. That's impossible. Everyone has a paper trail. Everyone real. That sneaky bitch. She's using an alias. That would be my guess. How do I find out Lila's real name? I think you know the answer to that. Cut off her head, look for a label. There's probably an easier way. You got something smaller? The last time she was in my apartment, she microwaved some popcorn. There's definitely gonna be prints on this. All right, got it. Next time, make her a cup of tea. This is Marlene from accounting. Hi, Marlene from accounting. She's also a notary public. Good for you. I met with a lawyer yesterday. He helped me prepare a living trust that gives you control of all my assets in the event of my death or... certain other situations. God. Go away. This is creepy. My financial planner said a guy my age should have a will. Just a precaution. We're all gonna die eventually. Is this why you were acting so weird last night? Probably. Sign here and I'll need to see an ID. Fine. Thanks for showing up last night to support Batista. I am supporting him. I stopped by Lila's this morning. And? I talked to her. I don't think she's gonna be a problem. Yeah, 'cause she certainly hasn't been one so far. I'm free tonight, you wanna stop by? We'll have beer, a couple of steaks? I wanna talk to you about something. Sounds good. So, what am I getting? I could use a new TV. Okay. But that's the one. Lundy here. It's lieutenant LaGuerta. I'm calling you from Haiti. Lovely this time of year. I know I'm not your favorite person in the station right now, but I really need your help. How so? I just met with Leones, the travel agent that Doakes saw. There's nothing new there. I had two agents question him for hours. Yet he never told them about the blood slides. What does he know about the blood slides? Doakes was looking for a lab to have them analyzed. Why? I don't know why. If he's our killer, he'd keep as trophies. He wouldn't have them analyzed. And I also have a list of special-ops missions that Leones personally knows Doakes took part in. Two of them directly conflict with murders we know to have been committed by the Bay Harbor Butcher. I'm not sure Leones is our most reliable witness. No, but... it's worth looking into, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. For starters, why don't you... brief me on both those missions? Give me all the details. Come on, Cody. Up and over. Okay, Astor. Up and over. There we go. Watch your step. Look, a pelican! There's a bunch of them, there. What's that? Welcome to the GPS 3000 teletracker. Previous destinations. For so long my boat has been a tool of my dark trade... A graveyard transport. I'd almost forgotten it could double as a pleasure craft. The thing is, if you catch a whale, we're probably gonna have to put it back. If it's a baby, we could put it in the bathtub. I'm not gonna take a bath with a whale. Yes, they always use up all the soap. It's peaceful out here. Rita, I've never been a very good boyfriend. I wouldn't say that. I just need you to know that... you and the kids are very important to me. No matter what happens, I want you to always know that. Everything's all right. I just need to take things slow. I have a gift for you. You don't need to. I want you to have this. It's the pink slip to the mini-van. I told you we're okay. You don't... Please. Take it for the kids. It'll keep them safer than a broken-down convertible. Thank you. Very generous. You're welcome. I know I've been taking things slow with us, but it's not because I don't have feelings for you. It's more like I have too many feelings, and I just wanna make sure to get it right. Me too. That's not exactly taking it slow. Sorry. I'll never do that again. Well, don't say never. I was looking for you. The boys looked at Lila's prints. We hit the jackpot. Her real name is Lila West. I ran her prints through the AFIS, which is tied to ICE. Get this... Her visa expired two years ago. Bad girl. I can have her deported. Not as easy as it sounds. Miami's swamped with criminal immigrants and refugees from 3rd world countries. They'll take priority over some British girl. Then I'll deport her myself. We got him. Talked to a park-service manager in the Everglades who remembers giving Sergeant Doakes directions 5 days ago. So you have a tip... not Doakes. The park manager said our target was headed into the Everglades 15 miles north of Sunday Bay. We will have the son of a bitch in handcuffs in 24 hours. I'd like to urge strong caution in apprehending the suspect. I'm looking into new intel that might come... I got your e-mail about Leones. He will say anything for a dollar. I agree we have to be careful about this, which is why I'd like some time. Show a little guts, for Christ's sakes. Why don't you show a little respect? You wouldn't be closing in on a suspect if it wasn't for his work. You know, as much as I enjoy hearing from the local talent, I'm really rather busy right now. I guess you don't need me to fight your battles anymore. Maybe you need me to fight yours. Aren't you a tough one? I'm just warming up. I thought I lived in a sh1t can. Officer Morgan, have you come to inquire about my welfare? I want you to leave Miami tonight. Don't ever come back. Don't ever contact Angel or Dexter again. And... why would I listen to you? Cause I'm a cop. And you're here on an expired visa. I know your real name, and I've contacted Immigration. Officers will be here any day now. They'll arrest you and deport you, and it won't be pretty. If this is true, why are you telling me this? Because I want you the f*ck out of here now. Whether you leave on your own or Immigration hauls your sorry ass away I don't give a sh1t. But I don't want to give you one more day to f*ck with the people I care about. I want you gone. Tonight. You don't want to do this. It's done. Tonight. Welcome. Previous destination. Starting route guidance. Left turn ahead. I keep expecting to come to my senses, but the pressure is lifting with each step I take. I've spent a lifetime keeping up my guard, watching my back, wearing my mask. Relief was never in sight until now. If anyone deserves to take me into custody, it's Deb. But how do I tell her what I am? I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher. Deb, I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher. Down on the ground, m*therf*cker. It's me. I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher. I'm him... the Butcher. This isn't going to be easy. I brought extra beer. We're getting drunk. Fine with me. What's the occasion? I ran Lila out of town today. Really? Turns out she's here illegally. You should have seen me, Dex. I was like an Old-West sheriff. You're really feeling good. f*ck, yeah. I got to say, great timing, Dex, getting together tonight. Lately, I was starting to feel like I had my head pretty far up my ass. No one blames you. Your world was turned upside down. Like mine is now. For the 1st time since that Ice-Truck Killer sh1t, I feel like I'm back. New and improved, even. When all that... stuff was happening... With rudy, I mean... ... did you ever consider doing something drastic? Are you kidding? All kinds of fucked-up sh1t ran through my head. Thank God I had you. Really? Every time I started to spin out of control, I had you to grab onto. Hell, you let me live here practically forever. It was tough, though. I'd have done almost anything to get out from under the weight of it all. How'd you finally do it? I just... saw through it. You know? You decide who you are, who you want to be... ... and you hold onto that and ride it out. Like an Old-West sheriff. Brother, this is worth living for. Right? You are absolutely right. What did you want to talk to me about? Nothing. Nothing at all. So this is me, riding it out. Harry may have rejected me, but Deb clearly believes in me, so why shouldn't I? I'm not turning myself in. This isn't Harry's life. It's mine. I made a plan to frame Doakes, and I'm going to stick with it. No sh1t? I'm on the way. They found Doakes' f*cking rental car. They found... Really? His car? Did they find Doakes? Not yet. But the search grid's closing in. We got to get to the station. Actually I got to make sure they don't find Doakes in a cage. Hallelujah. Hey, I'm in here! Who's out there? Anybody out there? Ending route guidance. Somebody in there? You have arrived at your destination.
