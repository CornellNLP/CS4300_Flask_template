 Earth. 
 Fire. 
 Air. 
 Water. 
 Only the Avatar can master all four elements  and bring balance to the world. 
 Republic City is at war! 
 After discovering that her father, Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy,  Asami turns against him. 
 And following another defeat at the hands of the Equalists,  Lin Beifong resigns as chief of police. 
 With the Equalist army growing stronger,  who will help the Avatar stop Amon and restore balance to the city? 
 You're finally here! 
 Welcome to Air Temple Island,  your new home. 
 Yes! 
 Welcome to my domain! 
 Well, aren't you sweet, little monk child? 
 What's that fuzzy creature? 
 That is a fire ferret,  an arboreal mammal  common to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom. 
 He's cute! 
 Yip yip. 
 Fly, sky bison. 
 Fly! 
 Thanks for sending the Air Acolytes to help us with the move. 
 Yes, they've been amazing. 
 Such tireless workers. 
 I thought you were only bringing a few things. 
 Trust me, it could've been worse. 
 No problem. 
 Everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome. 
 You're pretty. 
 Can I have some of your hair? 
 Looks like I have some competition. 
 And now for the grand tour! 
 The flying bison sleep in those caves down there,  and that's the temple Grandpa Aang built,  and that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat. 
 I have a couple questions. 
 Is this an all-vegetarian island? 
 Is that where you train airbending? 
 Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes? 
 Do we each get our own sky bison? 
 And final question, how many trees are on this island? 
 Yes, yes, no, no, 10,552. 
 So, where are we going to be staying? 
 You're a boy. 
 Boys have to stay on the boys' side. 
 I'd be happy to show you to the men's dormitory! 
 I'm a boy! 
 Meelo, why don't you go with the boys, too? 
 We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman. 
 Ikki and I will take you to your room, this way. 
 Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako? 
 No, I wasn't completely aware of that. 
 - Hey! 
 - Run along, Ikki! 
 So... 
 Here's your room. 
 I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to. 
 I think it's really charming. 
 And the best part about it? 
 Nothing here reminds me of my father. 
 Thank you for your hospitality. 
 Ikki, I swear, if you don't leave us alone, I'm gonna... 
 Tenzin! 
 Come right in! 
 Good day, ladies. 
 Asami, welcome to the Island. 
 Thank you for having me. 
 Beifong's replacement, Saikhan,  is going to be inducted as the new chief of police later. 
 I think we should both be there. 
 It was an honor serving under Chief Beifong for so many years,  and I wish her a speedy recovery. 
 It is with great humility  that I take her place as the new chief of police. 
 Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen. 
 But there is one man who has been effective against Amon's revolution,  Councilman Tarrlok. 
 That is why, for all matters involving the Equalists,  I will report directly to him. 
 The police department will lend any and all available resources  to the Councilman and his task force, until we quell this insurgency. 
 What is that weasel-snake Tarrlok up to now? 
 Tarrlok, I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket,  but I highly doubt it was legal. 
 Tenzin, always the conspiracy theorist. 
 Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents  and wants what is best for this city? 
 Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see. 
 Now that your little Pro-bending distractions are over,  I look forward to your return to my task force. 
 Forget it. 
 There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project. 
 That is unfortunate to hear. 
 But I am sure you will come to your senses,  as you have in the past. 
 Don't hold your breath, bub. 
 You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along. 
 You played me, you played Beifong,  and now you're playing the new Chief, too. 
 Well, I got news for you. 
 You need me, but I don't need you. 
 I'm the Avatar. 
 You are not, in fact, the Avatar. 
 You are merely a half-baked Avatar-in-training. 
 Which reminds me, how is your airbending going? 
 Made any significant progress with that? 
 I didn't think so. 
 If you will not be part of my task force,  then you had best stay out of my way. 
 I don't understand what's wrong with me. 
 I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms,  but I still can't produce a single, measly puff of air! 
 I'm a failure. 
 No, you're not. 
 You just need to work through this airbending block. 
 Amazing advice. 
 I'll get right on that. 
 I wasn't finished yet. 
 You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers,  but also his past lives to call upon for guidance. 
 Have you ever made contact with your past lives? 
 No, of course I haven't. 
 Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? 
 I'm a spiritual failure, too. 
 You may have made a connection without realizing it. 
 Perhaps something you mistook as a dream? 
 Maybe. 
 I had a few weird hallucinations,  but I hardly even remember them. 
 And did you see any of the previous Avatars in these visions? 
 I saw Aang. 
 It seemed like he was in trouble. 
 What do you think it means? 
 I don't know, but I urge you to meditate on these visions. 
 I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something. 
 Korra! 
 You out here? 
 Korra! 
 There you are. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Come on, what's wrong? 
 You can tell us. 
 How am I supposed to save the city when I can't even learn airbending? 
 I'm the worst Avatar ever. 
 I just feel alone. 
 No, that's nonsense. 
 You're amazing! 
 Yeah, and remember,  Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. 
 He was just a little kid! 
 And he wasn't alone, he had his friends to help him. 
 Look, the arena might be shut down, but we're still a team. 
 The new Team Avatar! 
 We've got your back, Korra. 
 And we can save the city together. 
 Yeah, let's do it! 
 What are we doing? 
 Get ready, Republic City. 
 You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar. 
 Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits. 
 I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon. 
 All right, let's ride. 
 Naga, away! 
 All right, scratch that. 
 Any other ideas? 
 I think I have the answer. 
 You think this'll do? 
 I like the new Team Avatar's style. 
 Unit 216, cancel that 10-58 at Harmony Tower. 
 Come back to the station, over. 
 My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. 
 I guess now I know why. 
 Calling all units, level four alert. 
 Jailbreak at headquarters. 
 Officers down, electrocuted. 
 Chi-blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large, armed and dangerous. 
 Last seen heading east. 
 I repeat, level four alert, Equalist jailbreak. 
 Chi-blockers! 
 That's them! 
 Let's get 'em! 
 Korra, Bolin, give me a ramp, now! 
 Help me out! 
 We gotta make this turn! 
 They don't know we made the turn. 
 Okay, get ready. 
 Avatar Korra, what do you think you're doing? 
 Hey, Tarrlok. 
 Nice of you to show up finally. 
 Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you. 
 What you did was tear up the city  and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals. 
 That's funny,  I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time. 
 If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would've gotten away. 
 This is your last warning, stay out of my way. 
 Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom. 
 But the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down. 
 The law I have proposed would make it illegal  for anyone to be a member of the Equalists  or even be associated with them. 
 It also puts into effect a curfew,  ensuring all non-benders are in their own homes by nightfall. 
 This is going too far, Tarrlok. 
 You can't punish all non-benders for the actions of a few. 
 That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. 
 We must pass this law. 
 All in favor? 
 All available units, please respond to the 5600 block of Dragon Flats Borough. 
 Equalists have taken to the streets. 
 Consider them armed and dangerous. 
 Proceed with caution. 
 I call front. 
 After you. 
 What a gentleman. 
 Thanks. 
 Why is the power out? 
 Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous. 
 Sure doesn't look that way. 
 All non-benders, return to your homes immediately! 
 Yeah, as soon as you turn our power back on! 
 Disperse or you will all be arrested! 
 You benders can't treat us this way! 
 Mommy, look, it's the Avatar. 
 Please, help us. 
 You're our Avatar, too. 
 Everyone, please stay calm. 
 I'm gonna put a stop to this. 
 Tarrlok,  you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone. 
 Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here. 
 We're not going anywhere. 
 
 
 
 You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals. 
 This is an Equalist rally. 
 There is nothing innocent about it. 
 They're not Equalists. 
 They're just normal people who want their rights back. 
 They are the enemy. 
 Round up all these Equalists! 
 Stop! 
 Hey! 
 Let me go! 
 You're under arrest. 
 What? 
 You can't do that! 
 Actually, I can. 
 She's a non-bender out past curfew,  and her father is a known Equalist conspirator. 
 Let her go! 
 Arrest him and his brother. 
 Tarrlok! 
 Unless you want to join your friends in prison,  I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple. 
 Korra, listen to him. 
 It's not worth it. 
 We'll be all right. 
 Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin. 
 He can get you out! 
 So sad to see your little Team Avatar broken up. 
 You had a good run. 
 This isn't over, Tarrlok! 
 I believe it is. 
 Take them away. 
 - Hey! 
 - I came as fast as I could. 
 Are your friends all right? 
 I don't know, these knuckleheads won't tell me anything. 
 I'll take care of this. 
 Saikhan, a word, please. 
 Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swamped at the moment. 
 Can this wait? 
 No, it cannot. 
 Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. 
 I'd like you to release them immediately. 
 They're not going anywhere. 
 They were interfering with police business. 
 Your so-called police business was rounding up innocent people  and claiming they were Equalists. 
 They should be released, too! 
 All Equalist suspects are being detained indefinitely. 
 They'll be freed if and when the task force deems  they are no longer a threat. 
 Those people are entitled to due process under the law. 
 You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok. 
 I plan to at the Council meeting, first thing in the morning. 
 You're officially the worst chief of police ever! 
 Calm down, Korra. 
 I'll get this sorted out. 
 We just need to be patient. 
 But you really are the worst. 
 Ever. 
 Wake up, Naga. 
 Let's go. 
 Wait for me here, girl. 
 Don't worry, I'll be all right. 
 You and I need to talk. 
 Are any of the other Council members here? 
 I believe everyone has gone home for the night. 
 Then you should do the same. 
 Are you sure, sir? 
 Leave us. 
 You obviously have something on your mind. 
 Spit it out. 
 Don't you see? 
 You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders. 
 You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people. 
 And you don't? 
 Of... 
 Of course not! 
 Isn't that what you came here to do? 
 Intimidate me into releasing your friends? 
 See, that's what I admire about you, Korra,  your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. 
 It is a quality we both share. 
 You and I are nothing alike. 
 Look, I'll make you a deal. 
 You fall in line and do what I say,  and I'll release your friends. 
 That's why you arrested them? 
 To get to me? 
 I need your answer. 
 No. 
 You might be able to manipulate Chief Saikhan into following you,  but it won't work on me. 
 You will regret that decision. 
 You need to be stopped! 
 You're just as bad as Amon. 
 I've tried to work with you, Korra, but you've made it impossible. 
 Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar? 
 What are you gonna do now? 
 You're all out of water, pal. 
 You're in my way, Avatar,  and you need to be removed. 
 You're a... 
 You're a Bloodbender? 
 Very observant. 
 It's not a full moon. 
 How... 
 How are you doing this? 
 There are a lot of things you don't know about me. 
 Where are you taking me? 
 Somewhere no one will find you. 
 Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. 
 You'll never see it again. 
 You can't do this! 
 Let me out! 
 No!
