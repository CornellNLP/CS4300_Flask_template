 Earth. 
 Fire. 
 Air. 
 Water. 
 Only the Avatar  can master all four elements  and bring balance to the world. 
 The Avatar has gone missing. 
 After President Raiko refused Korra's request  to aid the South in the War of the Water Tribes,  she headed to the Fire Nation,  seeking a new ally against Unalaq. 
 But unbeknownst to her friends,  a dark spirit attacked Korra  and dragged her into the ocean. 
 She has washed up on a desolate island  with no memory of who she is. 
 We found the Avatar washed up onshore,  but she doesn't remember anything. 
 Raava. 
 Raava. 
 Raava. 
 - A dark energy has infected her. 
 We must purge it before it destroys  her Avatar spirit. 
 Let the waters cleanse the darkness  that plagues your spirit. 
 - Who are you? 
 - I am you. 
 - Who am I? 
 - You are the Avatar. 
 - I don't know what that is. 
 - In order to remember,  you must regain your connection  with your Avatar spirit. 
 - If you don't, darkness will engulf the world. 
 You will die, and our era will end. 
 - How do I regain my connection? 
 - Go back. 
 Return to the beginning. 
 Find Raava. 
 - Are you Raava? 
 - No, but I can help you find her. 
 My name is Wan, and I will show you  how I became the first Avatar. 
 - Nobody steals from the Chou brothers! 
 - Really? 
 Because I just did. 
 - You're dead, Wan. 
 - Actually, I feel quite alive. 
 - Hey, stop! 
 Hey, fellas. 
 You're just in time for lunch! 
 - Oh! 
 - I told you no one steals from us. 
 Did you steal from the Chous again? 
 - Yeah, and I got nothing to show for it  except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises. 
 Hey, Yao, I got some food for you. 
 - Mmm. 
 Delicious. 
 Thank you, Wan. 
 - You guys are hungry too, huh? 
 - Wan, you should eat. 
 They need it more than I do. 
 Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps. 
 If only there was some way  to get into the Chous' food cellar. 
 We'd be eating like-- well, like Chous. 
 - If Chou the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace,  you'll end up dead. 
 Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds. 
 - No, don't get banished. 
 You don't want nothing to do with those spirits. 
 They'll get inside ya, scramble up your mind,  turn ya into this-- a monster! 
 - Don't do anything crazy, Wan. 
 You just gotta accept the world is the way it is. 
 Some people have power. 
 Some people don't. 
 And you don't. 
 Not yet, anyway. 
 - Are you strong? 
 Are you fearless? 
 Do you have what it takes to battle the spirits? 
 Then join the hunt. 
 - Count me in. 
 We're going to be out in the wilds for a week. 
 You wouldn't last two seconds. 
 - I can handle myself. 
 We all get fire, right? 
 - Yeah, but do you know how to use it? 
 - Well, not exactly, but I--  - Ah, let him come. 
 Not like we got any other volunteers lining up. 
 - All right. 
 Welcome to the hunt. 
 - The lion turtle. 
 - Great guardian of our city,  we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds  to bring back food for our people. 
 Please, grant us the power of fire. 
 - The power is yours to keep  until your return. 
 - You're first, kid. 
 - May the element of fire  protect you against the spirits. 
 - Whoa! 
 - Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay? 
 - Sure thing. 
 - Everyone stay close. 
 Spirits love to pick off stragglers. 
 - Uh, guys? 
 I don't think I can do this. 
 - Now, quit your whining. 
 We haven't even seen a spirit yet. 
 - I think I wanna go home. 
 - I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. 
 Go give your fire back to the lion turtle,  and don't ever show your face around me again. 
 - Wan, you're back. 
 - What goodies did you snatch for us this time? 
 - What did you do? 
 You can't steal from the lion turtle. 
 - Really? 
 Because I just did. 
 - You know it's forbidden  to bring the power of the element into the city. 
 Please, go back to the lion turtle  and return the fire. 
 - Jaya, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous  and show them we have the power to change things. 
 Hey, Chous! 
 Open the gate, and let us in. 
 - What are those filthy peasants doing here? 
 - Don't worry, father. 
 We'll take care of them. 
 - Hand over all the food you're hoarding,  and we won't give you any trouble. 
 - You're not getting past us. 
 We have the weapons. 
 You're powerless. 
 - Powerless, huh? 
 Follow me! 
 Grab as much food as you can. 
 - Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe we do have the power to change things. 
 - Stop right there! 
 - Looks like the Chous found backup. 
 - Get everyone out of here. 
 I'll hold them off. 
 - No, please. 
 Have mercy. 
 Wan? 
 - Even when you have the power, you're afraid to use it. 
 - Tell me who else was involved in the rebellion,  and I might take mercy on you. 
 - I'm not telling you anything. 
 - Then, you've left me no choice. 
 Wan, you are hereby banished. 
 - Yeah! 
 And give back the fire you stole. 
 - No! 
 Wait. 
 Great lion turtle, I am sorry  for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. 
 But please, I need to be able  to protect myself in the wilds. 
 - Never again may you return  to this city. 
 But I will allow you  to keep the power of the element. 
 - Bet he doesn't last till morning. 
 - Hey, watch where you're stepping, human! 
 - Who said that? 
 - Down here! 
 How'd you like it if I started walking all over you? 
 You're just a little frog. 
 - Who's little now? 
 Get off me! 
 Get off me! 
 - You are not welcome in my oasis, human. 
 - Please, help me. 
 I'm starving, and I haven't slept all night. 
 - Not my problem. 
 - Let me pass. 
 - You dare use fire against me? 
 Now, be gone with you! 
 - And who might you be? 
 - I am Bushy, the bush spirit. 
 And I would like to enter your oasis. 
 - Very well. 
 You may pass. 
 Wait a second! 
 Something stinks. 
 I knew I smelled a human! 
 Come on, let me in, just for a little while. 
 - No! 
 Go back to your lion turtle. 
 - Believe me, I'd love to go back home. 
 But I can't. 
 I was kicked out. 
 - That's too bad. 
 - Poor human. 
 - Don't pity him. 
 He's just like every other human:  ugly, destructive,  and lacking any respect for nature. 
 - Who are you calling ugly, ugly? 
 - Hmm. 
 - If you can't go back to your city,  then you should go live in another one. 
 - What? 
 There are other lion turtles? 
 - "There are other lion turtles?"  Of course there are, dozens of them! 
 Boy, you humans are stupid too. 
 - So which way to the nearest lion turtle city? 
 - Hmm. 
 I think it's on the other side  of None-of-Your-Business Valley. 
 - Real funny. 
 You know what? 
 I don't need your help. 
 I'll find it myself. 
 
 
 
 - Good luck! 
 It's okay. 
 I'm gonna get you out of there. 
 - Finally, we caught something. 
 Get it down. 
 - Back off. 
 - Wan? 
 What are you doing here? 
 - I'm saving this animal. 
 - That animal's our dinner. 
 Now, get out of the way. 
 - No. 
 - Ahh! 
 He--help! 
 Help! 
 - Get 'em off! 
 Get 'em off! 
 Ahh! 
 - Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan. 
 - I really hate humans! 
 - No, no. 
 - I don't know what he's screaming about. 
 He's better-looking now. 
 - I feel great. 
 What's in this water? 
 - It has special healing properties. 
 - Thanks. 
 So what did you do to that hunter? 
 - Spirits are able to take over  a human body for a short time. 
 If I stayed in there any longer,  I would've killed him, which I did consider. 
 - Thanks for saving my neck. 
 But Why'd you do it? 
 - I saw you save the cat-deer from those hunters. 
 I've never seen such an act  of selflessness from a human before. 
 - Told you I wasn't like the others. 
 - Guess I underestimated you, human. 
 - Are you off to find another lion turtle city? 
 - I was. 
 But I think I've had enough of humans for a while. 
 I've decided to stay here  and learn the ways of the spirits. 
 - What a great idea. 
 - That'll be fun. 
 - Oh, now, now, hold on. 
 A human living with spirits? 
 It's never been done. 
 - First time for everything, right? 
 - Hmm. 
 I guess we can try it. 
 I've never had a human as a pet before. 
 I think I'll call you "Stinky."  - The name is Wan. 
 - Stinky is more accurate. 
 - What happened in the wilds? 
 Where are the others? 
 - Gone. 
 Spirits took them. 
 They were protecting that kid Wan  like he was one of their own. 
 - Did you hear that? 
 Wan's still alive. 
 - And the way Wan moves fire,  it's like nothing I've ever seen. 
 He uses it like it's an extension of his body. 
 - Wan has proven that with the power of fire,  anyone can survive in the wilds. 
 We don't have to live  under Chou the elder's rules anymore,  so I say we leave this city and start over. 
 Who's with me? 
 - You ready to go, Mula? 
 - You sure you want to leave? 
 - Yes, it's time I see the rest of the world  and find the other lion turtle cities. 
 - I'm proud to call you my friend, Stinky. 
 Thank you for everything. 
 Good-bye, everyone. 
 - We'll miss you. 
 - The all-powerful spirits are battling. 
 - They're gonna wipe out the entire valley! 
 - Stop, or you'll destroy everything! 
 - This doesn't concern you, human! 
 - It does when the lives  of spirits and animals are in danger. 
 - If you're a friend to spirits,  then use your fire to help me break free. 
 - Don't involve the human. 
 This is between us. 
 - Please, save me. 
 She has tormented me for 10,000 years. 
 - 10,000 years? 
 Let him go! 
 - Thank you, human. 
 You have performed a great service for the spirits. 
 - Do you realize what you've done? 
 - Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you. 
 - You are gravely mistaken. 
 I was keeping him under control. 
 - And what gives you the right? 
 - You don't even know who I am, do you? 
 - Should I? 
 - Yes. 
 My name is Raava. 
 That spirit you freed is Vaatu. 
 He is the force of darkness and chaos. 
 I am the force of light and peace. 
 Since the beginning of time,  we have battled over the fate of this world. 
 And for the past 10,000 years,  I have kept darkness under control  and the world in balance,  until you came along. 
 - So by freeing Vaatu,  I let chaos into the world? 
 - Precisely. 
 The human and spirit realms  are headed toward annihilation,  and it's all your fault. 
 - Raava, I found you.
