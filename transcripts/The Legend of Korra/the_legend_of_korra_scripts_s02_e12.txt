 02x12 - Harmonic Convergence

 Earth. 
 Fire. 
 Air. 
 Water. 
 Only the Avatar can master all four elements  and bring balance to the world. 
 - Bolin's a hero. 
 The mover star stopped Varrick's kidnapping attempt  on President Raiko, proving his brother's innocence. 
 Mako and Korra were reunited,  but Korra has no memory of their breakup. 
 Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is still trapped in the spirit world,  and Tonraq and his Southern forces have been defeated. 
 Now it's up to team Avatar  to stop Unalaq before harmonic convergence. 
 - What's up with the coat? 
 And where did you get that pie? 
 - It's a Varrick ship. 
 You never know what you're gonna find. 
 There's a whole level filled with funhouse mirrors. 
 Of course, there's also the cat-gator deck. 
 I miss that guy. 
 He really knew how to make a long trip interesting. 
 So have you told Korra yet about how  you guys broke up and then you  kind of started dating Asami while she was off  getting attacked by dark spirits? 
 - You wanna keep it down? 
 I'm waiting for the right moment. 
 - Oh, Mako. 
 You know, a wise man once told me that delivering bad news  to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech. 
 You just have to do it fast and get it over with. 
 I hate it when you listen to me. 
 Fine. 
 - Unalaq will be waiting for you. 
 You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him. 
 - I'm going to close the spirit portals,  lock Vaatu in for another 10,000 years,  and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born! 
 Thanks, Mako. 
 - Uh... 
 um... 
 - Did you want something? 
 - Uh, no, no, nothing. 
 - As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe,  we'll blast through the blockade at the main port. 
 Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops,  crash through the defenses around the portal,  and enter the spirit world. 
 - Whoa, since when does my little brother  want to crash or blast through anything? 
 - I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter. 
 - We all want to save Jinora,  but I think your plan might be a tad overaggressive,  seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship. 
 - Really? 
 And what do you suggest? 
 - An attack like this calls for strategy. 
 I remember when I was surrounded by pirates  in the Hurricane Straits. 
 We managed to capture them all  with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses. 
 - I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now. 
 This is serious. 
 - Are we almost there? 
 - Asami: Almost. 
 But I just picked up a distress signal  from the Southern troops. 
 There's a problem. 
 . 
 Mom! 
 - I'm so happy you're here. 
 - Where's Dad? 
 - Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance  and captured your father. 
 - I'll get him back. 
 - Where is my mother? 
 - She's in the healing hut. 
 So many injured. 
 - What happened? 
 - Her soul is trapped in the spirit world. 
 - Oh, my goodness. 
 How long has she been away? 
 - Almost a week. 
 I've tried to keep her energy flowing,  but I can feel her slipping away. 
 You're the only one who can help her now, Mom. 
 - How much longer can she survive like this? 
 - I don't know. 
 But she's very strong to have lasted this long. 
 - I talked to the rebels. 
 They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded. 
 Harmonic convergence is only a few hours away. 
 - Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves  and get to the portal now. 
 - There's no use in talking anymore. 
 We know what our mission is. 
 - A suicide mission. 
 - You know, I was in a similar situation once. 
 My platoon had crawled through the desert  with no water for a week,  but when we finally located the only oasis for 100 miles,  it was surrounded by angry Sandbenders. 
 I realized our only chance to get to the water  was to drop in from above. 
 So I fashioned together a catapult,  and with the help of a few well-trained hog-monkeys--  - Enough of your ridiculous lies. 
 Can't you see that the fate of the world  and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today? 
 - Hold on. 
 Maybe Bumi's right. 
 We don't have a catapult and hog-monkeys,  but we have a flying bison,  and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. 
 Maybe we can attack from above. 
 - What are you thinking? 
 - Mako, Bolin, and I can use the plane  to create a distraction  and scatter some of the defenses. 
 You, Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya can fly  into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening. 
 - Let's get moving. 
 - What are we still doing here, Father? 
 - The invasion was completely successful,  and the Southern Tribe is under our control. 
 The spirit portals are open. 
 - You've restored balance. 
 Now we would like to go home. 
 - You don't understand. 
 Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison  with what I'm about to accomplish. 
 - What else is there? 
 The Water Tribe is united. 
 - After today, there will be no more Water Tribe,  no more nations of any kind. 
 The world is about to be transformed  into something magnificent and new,  and I will lead this glorious revolution. 
 Now go outside and get the troops ready  to defend the spirit portal. 
 - From whom? 
 We've already beaten everyone. 
 - The Avatar will be here soon. 
 She has no choice. 
 - Are you ready? 
 - I'm an Earthbender strapped to the wing of a plane  hundreds of feet in the air, so no. 
 - Don't worry. 
 There's no way they'll be expecting this. 
 - I think they were expecting it. 
 Asami! 
 - Get ready. 
 Fire! 
 - There are spirits everywhere. 
 I don't see an opening. 
 - Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in  from the other side. 
 Hold on! 
 The spirits are weighing Oogi down. 
 We're losing altitude. 
 - Get off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo! 
 Whoa! 
 If I go, you're coming with me. 
 Aah! 
 - Bumi! 
 - I wish Varrick was filming this. 
 We could call it "Nuktuk: Sky Warrior."  - Brace yourselves. 
 Dad. 
 - Korra, I'm so sorry. 
 I failed you. 
 - Don't give up. 
 Harmonic convergence isn't here yet. 
 We still have a chance. 
 - We tried. 
 - Congratulations, everyone. 
 You've all got front-row seats  for the beginning of the new world order. 
 - You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq. 
 Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful. 
 It will only make you a traitor to everything good  that's happened for the last 10,000 years. 
 - You think what Avatar Wan did was good? 
 
 
 
 Driving almost all the spirits from this world? 
 The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. 
 You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds,  but there shouldn't be a bridge. 
 We should live together as one. 
 - Even if Vaatu escapes,  I'll put him right back in his prison,  just like Wan did. 
 - It's true that, when Wan fused with Raava,  he tipped the scales in her favor. 
 But this time, I'll be here to level the playing field. 
 When harmonic convergence comes,  I will fuse with Vaatu. 
 And together, we will become the new Avatar. 
 A Dark Avatar. 
 Your era is over. 
 - Think about what you're doing. 
 I know that you've always had a deep connection  with the spirits, but you're still a man. 
 You're still my brother. 
 You're Eska and Desna's father. 
 Are you willing to throw your humanity away  to become a monster? 
 - I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. 
 The only difference is that,  while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power,  I will be in complete alignment with mine. 
 Vaatu and I will be as one. 
 No one will be able to stand against us. 
 Keep them locked up. 
 After the harmonic convergence,  I will come for Korra. 
 - Yes, Father. 
 - I failed in every way. 
 We've lost Jinora forever. 
 - There's still a chance. 
 They didn't get Bumi. 
 Oh, you want to play some more. 
 Well, bring it on. 
 Oh, we're playing dirty, huh? 
 Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here. 
 Reinforcements! 
 All right, soldiers. 
 Looks like it's on us to save the day. 
 Luckily, I've got a plan. 
 - Eska, Desna, listen to me. 
 You've got to help us stop Unalaq. 
 I know he's your father,  but Vaatu has made him completely crazy. 
 - We will never turn on our father. 
 - Please, if you let me out now,  I can still stop him from destroying everything. 
 Once he fuses with Vaatu,  no one will be safe. 
 Desna, he won't be your father anymore. 
 - You don't know what you're talking about. 
 Our father is the wisest man in the world. 
 If he says what he is doing is right,  I believe him. 
 - Huh? 
 - You know, if I wanted some ball of evil  lurking over my shoulder all the time,  I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law. 
 - All right, spirit army,  your general is here. 
 Follow me! 
 It's working. 
 It's not working. 
 Get me out of here! 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 - Aah! 
 - All right, guys. 
 Rescue time. 
 - Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment  on your own? 
 - I did it all with my trusty flute and--  oh, never mind. 
 You wouldn't believe it anyway. 
 Let's get moving. 
 - You run into the portal. 
 I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you. 
 - No, you're too hurt. 
 You need a healer. 
 Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - This is my fight now. 
 - Korra. 
 I love you. 
 - I love you too, Dad. 
 . 
 Yip-yip-  - Once we're inside, you go find Jinora. 
 Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq  while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape. 
 - Wait a second. 
 Worst-case scenario. 
 So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals,  and let's just say something happens to you. 
 Are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity? 
 - If everything goes as planned,  we'll all walk out together after harmonic convergence. 
 If not... 
 Let's go. 
 Tenzin, go find Jinora. 
 - Come on! 
 - You're running out of time, Raava. 
 I know you feel it coming.
