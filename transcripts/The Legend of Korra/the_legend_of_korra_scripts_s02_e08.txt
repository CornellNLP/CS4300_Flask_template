 Earth. 
 Fire. 
 Air. 
 Water. 
 Only the Avatar can master all four elements  and bring balance to the world. 
 - Should we pull her up? 
 - No. 
 She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories. 
 She must confront her own past  if she is to move forward. 
 We can only hope that she survives her ordeal. 
 - The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation,  and it's all your fault. 
 This is why humans have no place  interfering in the business of spirits. 
 - This world is home to all of us,  and what happens here is everyone's business. 
 - Thanks to you,  this world may cease to exist! 
 I only hope I can track down Vaatu  before it's too late. 
 - Let me help you. 
 - I don't want your help. 
 Don't interfere with me again, human! 
 - Let's get moving. 
 Do you see that, Mula? 
 People. 
 And they have some kind of wind power. 
 More humans! 
 I found you. 
 - Aah! 
 - Wait! 
 I'm friendly! 
 Huh? 
 The legends are true. 
 Another lion turtle city,  and it's flying. 
 I have got to get over there. 
 There. 
 Okay, Mula. 
 Wish me luck. 
 Oh, no... 
 Wow. 
 Hi, how are you? 
 I'm Wan. 
 I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while  since I've seen other humans. 
 - Where did you come from, stranger? 
 - Another lion turtle city far away. 
 For the past two years I've been living among the spirits  and exploring the wilds. 
 - Remarkable. 
 Come. 
 Sit with us. 
 We would love to hear of your travels. 
 - Vaatu. 
 - So we meet again, human. 
 - Why is the great spirit of darkness here  but not his other half? 
 - Uh, I'll explain later. 
 Leave these people in peace. 
 They've done nothing to harm you. 
 Be gone. 
 - How are you feeling since our split, Raava? 
 I've never been better. 
 When harmonic convergence comes,  I will destroy you forever. 
 - I told you not to interfere. 
 - I had to do something. 
 These people were in danger. 
 - Great spirit of light,  we thank you for your help. 
 But how did you become split from Vaatu? 
 - Ask him. 
 - It wasn't my fault. 
 Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. 
 I'd take it all back if I could. 
 - It's too late for that. 
 Now that Vaatu is free,  he is turning other spirits dark. 
 The more spirits he turns,  the stronger he becomes. 
 - He's getting bigger,  and you're getting smaller. 
 - As darkness grows, light fades. 
 - I'm sorry for endangering your village,  but I promise to set things right. 
 - How? 
 - Great lion turtle,  I ask that you grant me the power of air  so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late. 
 - You already carry the power of fire. 
 No human has ever held two elements at the same time. 
 - I'm not like other humans. 
 I can learn to do it. 
 - Hmm, perhaps. 
 But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you  until you master it. 
 - Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? 
 Especially one who's caused so much trouble? 
 - Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos  because of my mistake. 
 Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone,  but together we have a chance. 
 - You may be right. 
 Very well. 
 I will help you to master the power of air. 
 - Thank you. 
 And in return I will help you  restore balance to the world. 
 - What's this harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about? 
 - Harmonic convergence. 
 That is when Vaatu and I  must battle for the fate of the world. 
 - How long do we have until then? 
 - About a year in your time. 
 - Then we better start training. 
 All right, I'm ready to try air. 
 How's this gonna work? 
 - The only way for me to give you  the other element is to pass  through your body and combine our energies. 
 - Great. 
 So you've done this before. 
 - No. 
 This has never even been attempted. 
 It is very dangerous. 
 - That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds,  and I survived that. 
 I'm ready. 
 Give me the air. 
 It feels completely different. 
 If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years,  why hasn't one of you destroyed the other? 
 - He cannot destroy light any more  than I can destroy darkness. 
 One cannot exist without the other. 
 Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter,  darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. 
 The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me. 
 - That doesn't sound so bad. 
 Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back. 
 - Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. 
 Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. 
 Darkness will cover the earth for 10,000 years. 
 - If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu,  then I should visit more lion turtles. 
 Why is there so much conflict  between humans and spirits in the first place? 
 - This physical world is where humans come from. 
 Spirits come from another realm. 
 At the north and south poles,  the two realms intersect. 
 Over time, more and more spirits  have drifted into this world. 
 Humans have been forced apart,  settling on the lion turtles who protect them  and losing touch with each other. 
 - Most people think they live in the only human city in the world. 
 Most humans think only of themselves,  no matter how many others are around. 
 - When you pass through me,  I feel an incredible rush of power. 
 I feel like I'm changing. 
 The more we practice, the stronger I become. 
 Smells like smoke. 
 - Humans are nearby. 
 - Let's check it out. 
 - A Spirit! 
 - Easy there, fellas. 
 We're friendly. 
 - I can't believe it. 
 Wan? 
 - Jaya! 
 What are you doing out here? 
 - Ha ha! 
 You inspired us. 
 Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds,  we decided to try it too. 
 - Where's Yao? 
 Did he come with you? 
 - Yes, but sadly he didn't make it. 
 We... 
 we lost a lot of good men along the way. 
 So why were you protecting this spirit? 
 - This is Raava. 
 Don't worry. 
 She's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into. 
 - Dark spirits? 
 What's the difference? 
 We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. 
 Just like they attack any man. 
 - You have no idea what you're doing! 
 You're only making things worse. 
 - The spirits are coming back! 
 - Let's wipe 'em out this time. 
 We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to. 
 - What happened to you? 
 When did you become so violent? 
 - You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped  being so afraid. 
 Now we're doing it. 
 - This isn't what I had in mind. 
 - Get out of the forest, humans. 
 - Wait. 
 We can resolve this peacefully. 
 - Stinky? 
 You came back. 
 
 
 
 - It's good to see you again. 
 - You and Raava are just in time to help us  clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here  just like the old days. 
 - You're the one who's getting cleared out. 
 - There's no need for violence. 
 I know there must be a way to work out a compromise. 
 - You have a good heart, Stinky,  but these fire tossers aren't like you. 
 - Spirits like him killed our friends. 
 I can't let them get away with that. 
 - We are protectors of the forest. 
 We won't let you burn it down. 
 - It's Vaatu. 
 He's growing stronger,  using their anger to turn them to his side. 
 - Wipe them out! 
 - Stop, please! 
 Raava, we need to combine our energies. 
 Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this. 
 Enough! 
 You need to stop fighting now  before you destroy each other. 
 Stinky, w-what happened? 
 - He's controlling all four elements. 
 - Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you. 
 - No. 
 It's working. 
 If you leave, the fighting will start again. 
 - Wan! 
 We have to go back. 
 - Don't bother. 
 Your human friends have already been annihilated. 
 - No! 
 - Enjoy your final days. 
 See you at the end of the world. 
 - Raava. 
 - I'm sorry, Wan. 
 - We're almost there. 
 I was wrong about you, Wan. 
 I had no idea that humans were capable  of such nobility and courage. 
 I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together. 
 - Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. 
 Who knows what will happen? 
 After all, this is my first harmonic convergence. 
 - This is the southern portal to the spirit world. 
 Here Vaatu and I will do battle once again  at the place where the two worlds meet. 
 - Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? 
 Thanks to our friend separating us,  I think this time I may be rid of you once and for all. 
 - Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me. 
 - No human can stand against me. 
 - Haven't you heard the legends? 
 I'm not a regular human anymore. 
 Uhh! 
 - I lived 10,000 lifetimes  before the first of your kind  crawled out of the mud. 
 - Aah! 
 Oof... 
 oh! 
 - It was I who broke through the divide  that separated the plane of spirits  from the material world! 
 - To hate me is to give me breath. 
 To fight me is to give me strength. 
 Now prepare to face oblivion! 
 Raava! 
 The only way to win is together. 
 Ah! 
 Aah! 
 I have to leave you. 
 If I stay any longer, you will die. 
 - It doesn't matter. 
 If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. 
 We have to finish this together! 
 - The harmonic convergence is about to begin. 
 The era of Raava is over. 
 - Aah! 
 We are bonded forever. 
 - This is your prison now. 
 And I will close the portal so no human will ever be able  to physically enter the spirit world and release you. 
 The spirits must stop fighting with humans  and return to their home in the spirit world. 
 I will teach men to respect the spirits  so that balance will be maintained. 
 I will be the bridge between our two worlds. 
 The world is entering a new age. 
 Our time protecting mankind is over. 
 We will no longer give humans  the power of the elements. 
 - Different groups of people must learn to live together. 
 This is my mission... 
 To use Raava's light spirit  to guide the world toward peace. 
 - I'm sorry, Raava. 
 I failed to bring peace. 
 Even with Vaatu locked away,  darkness still surrounds humanity. 
 There wasn't enough time. 
 Don't worry. 
 We will be together for all of your lifetimes. 
 And we will never give up. 
 I remember. 
 - Do you know who you are? 
 - My name is Korra. 
 I'm the Avatar. 
 - We've been raising this herd of air bison  since the Hundred Year War. 
 I never thought I'd be able to present one to the Avatar. 
 - Thank you for all your kindness. 
 I wonder how long I've been away. 
 - That I cannot say,  but you do not have much time left. 
 The harmonic convergence is only weeks away. 
 - I have to close the spirit portal  before that happens.
