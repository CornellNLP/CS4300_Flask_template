 So that's two boys killed, four years apart. 
 What's happened? I don't think it's a single offender. 
 You wanted to see me, Mr Jones? 
 He's a child abuser and you're giving him a kid! 
 'I don't like her.' 'Neither do I.' 
 I give young people jobs. 
 More than can be said for some of you lot! 
 Edward, it's not your fault. I shouldn't have left him. 
 Hello, Joel. 
 I can't! Get help. 
 I don't know how! 
 I need to talk to you. Is it Edward? 
 No. 
 I've been offered a new position in Singapore. 
 Right. 
 Two years to start with. 
 Well, you obviously can't take it, can you? 
 I've already accepted. 
 I fly over the day after tomorrow to look at apartments. 
 The whole family will be coming with me Becky and the kids. Oh, no, they won't! 
 Now, you're gonna give me sole custody of the children. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 I'll be gone for the next two weeks. 
 When I return, these need to have been signed. 
 Otherwise, I'll tell everyone about your blackouts and you'll lose both your job AND the kids. 
 Sign, and you'll at least keep your job. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 You've always been a better detective than you have been a mother, anyway. 
 You can stop right there. It's never gonna happen. 
 Marcella, the kids stay with me and Becky because they don't want to be with you. 
 You've not been a proper mother to them for years! 
 And they probably don't want to admit it, but I think they actually hate you. 
 Jason? 
 Two weeks.

 Don't sit down. You're going out again. 
 The boy in the boot, Luke Howell, 15 years old. 
 Reported missing by foster parents Tuesday before last. Where'd he go missing? 
 They don't know. He was out with a friend, Andrew, and didn't return home. Mark's looking into it. 
 "Shop-lifting, minor assault, vandalism." 
 He first came to our attention when he was ten years old. 
 'Foster parents?' 'Yeah, check 'em out. Thanks.' 
 Did he live here long? 
 Just over 18 months. And the night he went missing? 
 Sent me a text saying he was going to the cinema with a friend. 
 Andrew. Do you know his surname? 
 Is that his? Yeah. 
 It's new. He got it from some charity thing. 
 And you believed that, did you? 
 Chose to believe it, yeah. 
 He wasn't very happy here, was he? 
 I don't think he would be very happy anywhere. 
 He hadn't had an easy life. 
 We did what we could. 
 I'd have chucked them, if I'd known. 
 So you didn't choose to believe that they were painkillers, then? 
 'A lot of foster parents do a good job, you know.' 
 Yeah, I'm sure they do. 
 Mine did. - Well, that's good for you, then, isn't it? 
 I got the feeling you had something against foster parents. 
 No, I've just got something against bad parents. 
 What, cos you're so flawless and perfect yourself? 
 What do you mean? - You'd have to be, going round judging other people! 
 Like I said, Charles, I apologise. 
 I hope the wonderful work you're doing with my wife will continue. 
 Thank you. Bye. 
 How many more of these do I have to do? 
 Four more. Are you up for it? 
 Yeah! Having to apologise to offended upper-class twats was at the very top of my "to do" list today(!) 
 It mean a lot to me that you do, so, thank you. 
 Well, it's the very least I can do, I suppose. 
 Mm. 
 All I have to do now is make all this other crap disappear. 
 Two of my major suppliers are reviewing whether they want to be associated with me in the future. 
 Vince... I'm not doing anything wrong. 
 You don't have to do anything wrong to lose if your opponent is stronger than you! 
 And they are. I know. This affects you, too. 
 But trust me. I'll sort it. 
 Aghh! 
 Same as the ones you found in Leo. Mm. It looks like it. 
 Oh, no -- wait. 
 This is new. 
 What the hell is that? 
 A-hem. Sorry. 
 I've never seen anything like them before. 
 Uh, this one shares some similarities with an Adinkra symbol and this one could be related to Jainism. - What's Adinkra and Jainism? 
 Adinkra are West African visual symbols from the early 19th century. 
 Jainism is one of the most ancient religions, of Indian origin. 
 Do you know what they mean? 
 No. They share some similarities, I said, but I don't know. 
 So you don't know why anyone would put them inside the body of a little boy? 
 That's where you found them? 
 Yes. They were surgically inserted, just underneath the ribcage. 
 No. 
 Can I hang on to these and discuss them with a colleague or two? Yeah, of course. 
 If you find anything, will you call us? They've found Andrew. 
 Luke told his foster parents you were at the cinema the night he went missing. 
 How do you know it was me? 
 We downloaded his contacts from his phone. 
 Off the cloud. There was only one Andrew. 
 Where and when did you split up? 
 Brixton tube, around 11. 
 This club offers sexual services. Do you? 
 Occasionally. 
 How old are you? 19. 
 Oh. You look younger. I know. 
 Did Luke ever work here? 
 Hm? 
 He was only 15 years old. Did you know that? 
 "Was" only 15? 
 Is he dead? Yeah. 
 Was he mixed up in something? 
 Andrew, he's dead. He was adopted. Probably abused and murdered. 
 Was he mixed up in anything? 
 Sometimes, clients... 
 Sometimes they'd want someone who was younger. 
 A lot younger. 
 So I'd give them the nod. 
 Luke wanted to. 
 Do you recognise any of these men? 
 Him. 
 He's been here. 
 Our latest ultrasound! 
 What did she say? 
 My blood pressure's a bit high, and I've got protein in my urine. 
 She took a lot of tests. 
 I asked. 
 What it is. 
 You were right -- it's a boy! 
 Jesus. 
 No! 
 What's going on here? 
 No. No f*cking way! 
 Why are you doing this? Can I have your hands, please? 
 Haven't you done enough? I don't think that's necessary. 
 Can I have your hands, please? 
 Phil! It's all right. It'll be fine. 
 This has gone too bloody far! 
 Look at the photo, please. I don't care what you think of me. 
 This amounts to an abuse of police power! 
 Never seen him before. 
 No. 
 He works in the brothel. 
 You dressed him up as a schoolboy and you wanted to pay him to have s*x. 
 But you thought he looked too old. Well, how old is he? 
 19. - So then what is the f*cking problem? 
 Or are you just looking for something else to leak to your friends in the press? 
 'Did he tell you off about Luke?' 'Who's Luke?' 
 'The boy who we found killed in the boot of a car yesterday.' 
 How's it going? 
 He was just wondering what the press were doing outside his house -- and so am I! 
 Another body. Young boy. s*x and the serial killer. Christmas has come early for them(!) 
 No, that doesn't explain why they were there. - No harm done. 
 So you're not gonna discipline her? 
 Who? 
 Marcella? We don't know it was her. 
 Oh, I think we do. But maybe your "friendship" is a factor here. 
 We don't know it was her, DI Sangha. 
 Don't hurl accusations around. 
 There we go. OK? 
 Sorry. 
 There you are. 
 Right. 
 Got any better ideas? - Quite honestly, anything would be better than this! 
 Such as? Something even vaguely resembling what a respected businessman would do! 
 A respected businessman would fire you for a comment like that! How many are here? Enough. 
 So let's do this. 
 Hello, everyone. Nice to see you. 
 You've been having a go at me, lately. 
 But I can take a fight, as long as it's a fair fight -- which this hasn't been. 
 If you think the terms of the contract and wage levels here are not good enough, too low, that's a political problem. 
 Campaign to change them -- go on. 
 But don't name and shame individual companies. 
 Don't name and shame me. 
 You've created some kind of greedy monster. 
 And that's not who I am. 
 And I'm going to prove it to you. 
 In here is 20 grand. 
 Be my guest! 
 Get out the way! 
 Let's go. 
 We found damage to the brain. 
 When we started to look for the origins, we found this. 
 A small hole in the skull bone, just behind the eye. 
 Once we knew what we were looking for, we found the same damage in Leo Priestley's skull. 
 A pointed object had been inserted at the side of the eye and pushed about five centimetres into the brain. 
 Are you saying they've been lobotomised? 
 That's your cause of death. 
 If you're gonna kill someone, why use lobotomy? 
 Maybe they weren't supposed to die. 
 Maybe he genuinely wanted to lobotomise them. 
 But why would he want to do that? 
 People used to think it could cure mental illnesses. 
 Yeah, but neither Leo or Luke had ever been diagnosed with anything. 
 And we've got these symbols. Do we even know what they mean yet? - No. 
 What the hell are we dealing with here? - Right. 
 Phil Dawkins. Has he got any medical training? 
 No. I've checked. Have we shown him the symbols? We can't detain him, Marcella. 
 We've got nothing that disproves his alibi for the bike accident, the car dealership fire, his phone was off and we found nothing on his computer. 
 We've got a link to Andrew. He said he never brought Phil or Luke together. 
 And there's nothing that links Luke's phone to Phil. 
 And quite frankly, your stunt with the press has not helped us. His solicitor's all over it. 
 Wait here, will you? 
 f*ck off! 
 Let's go to a hotel. 
 Hey! What are you doing alone? Where is everyone? 
 Why aren't you with them? It's boring. 
 Are you all right? 
 I mean, really. 
 About Leo. - I try not to think about it that much. 
 When you were at home, you said that you got scared. 
 And that you shouldn't have left him. - No. 
 What were you scared of? 
 Nothing. Why are you asking? 
 Because I've been thinking about it, and I want to know what you were scared of. 
 Marcella. Yes? 
 Can I have a word? 
 What, now? Please. 
 Sorry, I didn't know whether to ring you or not... 
 Edward called Samantha late last night and told her he'd killed one of his mice. 
 He'd what? - "Squeezed it to death", Samantha said. 
 Why would he do that, and why call your daughter in the middle of the night? 
 Well, boyfriend and girlfriend, the way they are at that age. 
 You didn't know? 
 No. God, you must have thought I was completely mad when I came round your place the other night! 
 Anyway, Samantha was a bit worried and I thought I should tell you. 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 What did she want? 
 She said you'd squeezed your mouse to death last night! 
 I didn't say that. I said I crushed it. Stepped on it by accident. 
 Why do you always treat me like I've done something wrong? 
 I don't. - You do. Always asking me these questions. 
 For f*ck's sake! Edward. 
 Will you come back here, now, please? 
 Go on, show her, Joel. 
 It may just be a muscle memory or a nervous spasm. 
 No, he knew what he was doing. I'm totally sure of it. 
 You spend a lot of time with him. You feel involved. 
 Sometimes, we see what we want to see. 
 But... 
 What are you..? 
 You didn't want her to know! 
 Can you turn that off, please? 
 Cheese, jalapeno and bacon, mayonnaise and cheese rice. 
 And you're planning on letting me eat that? 
 You're angry. No, I'm more surprised, if I'm honest. 
 I mean, you were one of those people down on the shop floor. 
 You made a pretty big deal about still being one of them. 
 You've fought for everything you've got, Vince, and to hang on to it, at any cost. And what happened? 
 I did exactly the same as you. 
 I handed out money to people who needed it. What's the difference? 
 [The person you are calling is not a...] 
 Sorry. 
 Right. Shall we give it a try? 
 OK. 
 A. 
 B. 
 C. 
 D. 
 Hold on. Sorry. 
 Mum. 
 Hi. Are you OK? 
 I didn't see you in the... I thought, um... 
 Why didn't you tell me about Singapore? 
 Dad didn't want us to. 
 But I would have liked to know. I've got a right to know if he's planning to take you half-way round the bloody world! 
 He asked us not to tell you. 
 It's tough, you know, when you two hate each other. 
 Em? 
 Em! 
 I've... I've got to go. 
 See you later, Mum. Bye. 
 Jane... Um, did you drive here? No, we took the bus. 
 Want a lift? That would be really kind of you. 
 I'm parked over there. 
 Are you ready to leave? I've got all your stuff. 
 I don't think I ever want to move back in here. 
 That's OK. 
 You can stay with me as long as you like. 
 Have you read about Phil? 
 Is there anything new? 
 Nope. 
 Nothing at all. 
 That's good, isn't it? 
 I think about it, every day. 
 I know you do, too. 
 Well... 
 Things are what they are. 
 Come on. 
 We should leave. 
 Do you remember Belgrade? 
 Why? 
 
 
 
 It's just I missed you in Belgrade. 
 What?! What are you talking about? 
 You know. Then. 
 The tour. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go home. 
 Thank you for the lift. No worries. 
 Would you like to come inside for a cup of tea or a glass of wine? 
 I can't. I've got to go. 
 OK. I'll see you. 
 Thanks again. You're welcome. 
 Bye. Come on, sweetheart. 
 Bye! 
 Yep? - 'I'm getting out of here. Fancy doing something?' 
 I don't know. I've had a day I'd rather forget! 
 That can be arranged! 
 Sour! 
 Alright. Come on. LeAnn. 
 Oh, here we go(!) What about her? 
 Exactly, "what about her?" Why did you bring her on the team? 
 Why not? 
 She's good. She's bright, she's self-motivated, she's you, 15 years ago! No, she is not! 
 You said that she was good. I was great 15 years ago, thank you very much! 
 Did I tell you Edward's got a girlfriend? 
 Well, good for him! It would be if he'd told me about it! 
 Us boys don't tell our mothers everything! 
 There's a difference between not telling somebody something and then treating them like a complete stranger! 
 Have you ever been to Singapore? No. Why? 
 Jason's talking about taking the kids there. 
 Here's to forgetting. Sorry. 
 Come on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I've got to go. What?! 
 Oh, no, please, come on. 
 I won't take about Ja... Whatever his name is, I promise. 
 It's work. - What do you mean, it's work? We're on the same case. 
 No, the other work. The charity. 
 Now?! Yeah, now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Will you be all right? 
 Yeah, I will be. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Well, isn't this nice! Well, you are welcome here any time. 
 I had an email this evening. 
 What, and you couldn't just forward it to me? 
 The Department of Education is withdrawing its grant of 300,000 from the Foundation. 
 Vince... has become a liability. 
 'Here. 
 'Good. 
 'Good stuff. You've been trying. 
 'Well done. 
 'Pretty boy, how you feeling?' 'Yeah, I'm good.' 
 I need to pee. 
 I can't do it if you're watching. 
 'A friend at work knows a therapist who uses hypnosis. 
 'If you'd like her details? 
 'She has treated dissociative amnesia before.' 
 'Are you feeling relaxed?' 
 I don't like people messing around with my head. 
 We're just going to explore memories that your conscious mind might have hidden from you, that's all. 
 Concentrate on your breathing. 
 They'll be your memories. I'll just guide you. 
 And since you're no longer actually in that situation, they'll be easier for you to deal with afterwards. 
 Just give it a try. 
 That's it. Close your eyes. 
 When I start counting down, you go back to the days the problems began. 
 The day you found Juliet. 
 Five... 
 .. four... 
 .. three... 
 .. two... 
 .. one. You are there. 
 Edward? 
 Everything's fine. 
 You're fine. You're here. 
 It was a traumatic event. It was always going to be difficult. 
 It didn't work! Why didn't it work? 
 You wouldn't allow yourself to get close to that memory. 
 You will remember, it's just going to be a lengthy process. - It didn't work! 
 We'll start with more recent fugues and work our way backwards, getting closer, step by step. I had one yesterday. I can start there. 
 I think we're finished for now, but we have a place to start next time. 
 All right? How are you feeling? 
 Better. 
 Is he OK? 
 Mm. 
 I'll be fine. You go to work. 
 Why don't you order some room service? 
 And if you need for anything... 
 .. you can ring me. 
 So, this is where we find them, at Brixton tube station. 
 And then this camera... is the last time we catch him. 
 After this, we've no idea where he goes. 
 Any cars you recognise in the area? 
 Any ANPR cameras? 
 None that we've found. 
 DS Backland. 
 Yes, this is Professor Malvo from the university. 
 'You left some photos of symbols with me.' - Yep. 
 I thought they could be Adinkra or perhaps Jainism, but the foundation of these particular variants are essentially regional. 
 'That's why I didn't recognise them. 
 'It's not my area of expertise.' 
 Salem. North-east USA. 
 Late 17th century. 
 Witchcraft? 'Yes. Well,' evil, to be exact. 
 'They're all different symbols for defending against evil.' 
 'Room service.' 
 Hold on. 
 Hang on. 
 Aren't you worried about your boyfriend abusing the baby? Leave me alone! 
 How does it feel to be pregnant by a convicted paedophile? 
 Leave me alone! 
 Please, please, please, leave me alone! 
 Leave me alone! 
 LEAVE ME ALONE! 
 Leave... Aghh... 
 No! 
 No! Aghh! 
 Oh, no... 
 He isn't? 
 Oh, God, no! 
 No! No! 
 No! 
 No! 
 No! No! 
 Help! Help! 
 Help! Help! 
 Help! Stop! 
 Help! 
 Stop! 
 Please, stop! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Please help me! 
 Hi. 
 I've just received these from the professor. 
 I mean, lobotomies, symbols against evil. 
 It's not sounding like a paedophile ring, is it? 
 We need to widen the search. This looks like some sort of cult or sect. 
 Mark's on to it, but so far, there's no connection between the two. 
 Why are you looking at that again? 
 I don't know. There's just something about it. 
 There you go. He's just crossing the road. 
 The most ordinary thing in the world, but it's the last time he'll ever do it. 
 Everything our kids do could be for the last time. 
 'Cos we can't always be there to protect them.'
