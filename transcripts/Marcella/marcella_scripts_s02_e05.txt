 What happened in 1986? 
 We've been good at keeping secret, you and I. 
 Let's not change that. 
 Eric, what are you gonna do? 
 Hello, John. I know you wanna tell me something. 
 You leaving? 
 I've cut my trip to a week and Edward's fine with it. 
 He's got Becky. No. He has me. 
 There was a blue lorry at the crossing. 
 He wasn't a witness. He pushed him onto the tracks. 
 I want to try again, the day I found Juliet. 
 You can't force it. 
 Well, I have to. He's coming back in a few days. 
 We're getting closer. 
 .. But we need to take it step by step, or it won't work. 
 Are there any other incidents we can explore? 
 One. 
 Three... 
 .. two... 
 .. one. 
 I have to find Grace. I went home. 
 You had thoughts of hurting yourself? 
 Apparently, but I... 
 But I didn't. 
 How did you know where to find Grace? 
 My name's Marcella Backland. 
 I found out that she'd been shagging my husband. 
 So, I went round to her house and she let me in. 
 I blacked out. 
 So, shall we go back to that incident? 
 No, I know what happened. 
 I was... part of the team that investigated her death. 
 There was blood on the table -- my blood. 
 She pushed me or I fell. 
 Lost consciousness. 
 That's when Henry, her brother, must have come round. 
 He's the one that killed her. He admitted to that. 
 But when I came round, I was still in fugue and I... 
 I thought I'd killed her. 
 So, I had to get rid of the body. 
 I buried her. 
 That's how I knew where she was. 
 Why don't we go back and find out for sure what happened? 
 No, I'm not going back there. 
 Why? 
 What if I'm wrong?

 Give me one second. 
 They've found the driver. Kevin Hoss. 
 Stabbed through the eye with a surgical instrument. 
 The lorry was spotted here on a mobile ANPR, 8pm the day before yesterday. 
 No-one acted on it until we put out an alert. 
 Do we know who parked it? No, and no CCTV. 
 Which is probably why he parked it here. 
 What are you doing here? Come for the tachograph. 
 Boss wants it analysed. What about what I want? 
 It's been ten hours. Give me a break. 
 Don't forget about it. 
 No, it doesn't look like you're gonna let me, does it? 
 DS Backland. 
 Yeah, um, OK. I'll be right there. 
 Hello. I'm Maya Whitman. Can I help you? 
 DS Backland. 
 We have phone records from an Adam Evans. 
 He called here several times over the last three years. 
 We want to know why he called, what he said. 
 Sure. Well, uh... let's see if we can find him. 
 Lex, can I steal your computer, please? 
 Thank you. 
 OK. 
 Aren't the calls supposed to be anonymous? 
 They are. We... 
 We have a system that allows our advisers to be able to read what the child told us before. 
 No, we don't take their real names. 
 They give us a personal code, so I'm gonna need that. 
 The passwords, user names from his mobile and computer. 
 OK. 
 Is this the uh... boy from the train crash? 
 How do you know that? 
 Tim Williamson. He's heading this up, isn't he? 
 We... work together. 
 He's the chairman of the board of the foundation. 
 Yes, I know. 
 Will you say hello to him for me? 
 Thanks. 
 HornedRat369. 
 There he is. 
 I'll print it out for you. 
 Thank you. 
 OK, these are transcripts from your son's conversations with Kids Call. 
 I want you to read them. 
 That's the father? Yep. 
 According to the calls to the helpline, he's been sexually assaulting Adam for four years. 
 He's our guy? 
 No. He was abroad when his kid was abducted, and he's got alibis for both the train crash and for Luke. 
 Will they hold up? Looks like it. 
 Why aren't you in there? 
 If I have to be in the same room as another f*cking sick paedophile, I'll probably kill them. 
 Let's go. 
 What's this? What? 
 That? I mean, what are you thinking? 
 Huh? 
 What were you thinking? We agreed, hm? Didn't we agree? 
 And then I find this sh1t in your room. 
 That's... That's... 
 "That's..." That's what? 
 It's a f*cking confession, that's what it is! 
 Yes, yes, but... that's me the blame, not you. 
 Come on. 
 Don't you understand you're gonna be questioned for hours? 
 All you've gotta do is mix up one "me" with "we" and I'm f*cked! 
 No, I... I need... 
 No. No, you need to do jack sh1t. 
 I do. No! 
 I'm dying. Yeah, aren't we all? 
 Cancer. 
 What? 
 Pan... P... 
 Pancre Yeah, yeah. I get it. 
 How long have you known? A while. 
 The Shepards leave the hotel in Epping at five to ten that morning, alone. 
 At 10:36, they're at the railway crossing, with Adam in the car. 
 According to their phones and the masts they connected to, they took this route. 
 Where they picked up Adam. The lorry, according to the tachograph, started here. 
 He drives within the speed limits along this route... and from here he's on the same route as the Shepards, to the crash point. 
 It then doubles back, turns here and heads down the layby. 
 The driver's phone confirms this. 
 Well done, Mark. There's more. 
 He makes a short stop at 10:29, seven minutes before arriving at the railway crossing. 
 He was going over the speed limit from the tachograph. 
 So I've got the speed and the time, which gives me the distance. 
 It means he stopped here for two minutes. 
 Where he meets his killer, who was chasing Adam, sees him get away in the Shepards' car, panics and then stops the first vehicle that he sees, which is our lorry. 
 So, Adam must've escaped from somewhere round that area. 
 Yep. Pretty remote. 
 There are not gonna be many houses there. 
 Let's send a team down. 
 Rav? 
 It's the other victims. 
 Leo. 
 Hey. 
 You all right? Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't you go and sit in the car for a bit? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 DS Backland. 
 What's your name, sir? 
 Nigel. 
 Well, do you have a surname, Nigel? 
 The house over there, do you know who owns it? 
 Have you seen any activity, any people arriving, leaving? 
 Any vehicles arriving or leaving? 
 You must've seen some activity, sir, they're your neighbours. 
 I haven't finish... 
 Prick. 
 Extend the cordon twice as far. 
 No-one gets anywhere near. 
 And nothing, absolutely nothing, gets leaked. 
 The press office will issue a holding statement... but nothing else. 
 Yeah, OK. 
 I sent Rav home. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Ready? Let's go. 
 Right. 
 This place is weird, man. Go. 
 This is the ward where Rosman Bell took two nurses hostage and killed them. 
 Right through here, guys. 
 She murdered them in cold blood. 
 She barricaded the door but in six minutes she stabbed them more than 60 times. 
 This is the wall... where she wrote her victims' names in blood. 
 What the hell was that? 
 What is it? Give me the camera. 
 Sh... What was that? 
 Go! 
 Yeah, he tapped his finger at the N and then at the O. 
 And then Flavia came back in, but "no", that's a word, innit? 
 I sneaked into Dr Lewis's office and it says in his records that he was in a car accident in Norway. 
 You broke into the doctor's office? 
 Well, it wasn't locked. 
 But "N-O"... maybe... maybe that's Norway? 
 No-one's seen this guy moving his finger before? 
 No. 
 You're the first one? Mm-hm. 
 What does Dr Lewis think about this? 
 That it's just spasms, that he can't control it. 
 Gail, you're the only one with a job right now. 
 You can't lose it. Yeah, but I'm not making it up this time, Eric. 
 I don't care. Just stop whatever it is you're doing with this guy, do you understand? 
 Gail, are you listening? I'm serious. 
 What the hell was that? 
 Oh, Liam. 
 What the hell was that? 'Hey.' 
 Liam, just editing the new video. 
 The one when you were sh1tting yourself. 
 'Please cut that out.' 
 I'm keeping it. You cried like a baby. It goes live tonight. 
 'Did you get the link that I sent you?' 
 No, no, what link? Let me check. 
 'It's that house where those kids were murdered. 
 It's all over the news.' 
 Hannigan? Yeah, yeah, we definitely filmed it. 
 That was last year. Hold on. 
 I have the video still. 
 Patrick Hannigan's house where he murdered his family. 
 I think this could be the most haunted house that we've been in so far. 
 Looks like some sort of operating table. It's weird. 
 Do you think this could be worth something? 
 I'm leaving them in a folder on your desk. 
 All you need to do is make sure Vince signs them. 
 Leave that to me. 
 Why are you doing this? 'Does it matter?' 
 'Yes.' 
 Well, why are you helping me? 
 You know why. 
 JoJo won't be completely happy until she's a mother, and I really want her to be. Well, that's nice. 
 I can relate to that... not being completely happy until you get what you want. 
 Leave the folder on the desk for me. 
 I'll get your money today. 
 Just to let you know I'm back. Rav? 
 I'll call you back. Close the door. 
 Right, I pulled in all the staff that we have available. 
 We've got a unit trying to identify these children. 
 What about an offender-profiling team? 
 They're sifting through the evidence. 
 They'll be at the site later. Great. 
 You'll have all the help possible to solve this, but I need to know that you're up for it. 
 Course I am. 
 This is the biggest case we'll ever work on. 
 You know, it's career defining. 
 So, I can't afford to have my lead investigator not being able to cope. Whoa. 
 What is that supposed to mean? Man up and do your job or I'll replace you. 
 That's it. 
 Hey. You all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
 Sure? I'm OK, thank you. 
 Right, everyone, can I have you round here? 
 OK, so how are we all? All right? 
 17 dead children. 
 Now, whatever way we look at it, we'll all be affected by it. 
 So, I need every single one of us to look out for each other. 
 OK, good. 
 Right, then, tell me, what have we got? 
 Well, we now know the house that Adam escaped from, which means we know that our killer must have been there just two days ago. 
 What about the DNA report? Fingerprints? Footprints? 
 Loads. Both male and female. We haven't got a match yet. 
 We're tracing that box of stuffed toys. 
 It's from China. It'll take a while. 
 OK. Who owns the building? 
 The last registered owner was Patrick Hannigan, but it's been empty for years. 
 He killed his family there -- wife and three kids. 
 Shot all four of them and then hanged himself. 
 No-one's lived there since. 
 An initial opinion from the profiling team. 
 He's organised. He plans, he kidnaps. 
 He kills in one place and he puts the bodies in another. 
 Organised serial killers are usually socially capable and tend to have a high IQ. 
 Right, so he's probably got a job, a family. Maybe some kids. 
 What we thinking about motive? 
 We know he doesn't have s*x with them, so it doesn't leave us with much. 
 Uh... power, thrill... 
 So, these kids are kept locked up. 
 They get to watch children's programmes. 
 Then those... wooden disks are surgically inserted, they're lobotomised... and then their bodies are left with stuffed toys. 
 Now, to me, that sounds like some kind of ritual. Agreed? 
 Those symbols on the disks, protecting them from evil, then he kills them. 
 It doesn't make sense. Oh, it does to him. 
 We just don't understand it yet. What about the photos? 
 Apparently it was quite common in the 19th century to take a photo of a child when it died... 
 "as a token of remembrance to honour the dead, to quell the sharpness of grief," it says. 
 So, he wants to remember them, right? 
 No, he would've remembered them, anyway. 
 These children mean something to him. 
 He's mourning them. 
 What are you doing sitting out here? 
 I wanted to see them, Emma and Edward. 
 They'll be back in a minute. 
 They're getting a lift with Samantha. Come in. 
 They won't want to see me. Oh, come on. 
 Course they will. Come on. 
 Thank you. 
 Where do you want this? Um... just on the side. 
 Thank you. 
 How's Edward? How's he doing, really? 
 You can tell he's still thinking about it. 
 Better than I'd have expected. 
 Would you see if he wasn't? 
 You've only known them a few months. 
 He's doing fine here, Marcella. 
 So's Emma. I'm taking care of them. 
 Sam, sweetheart, can you give me a hand? 
 Mum? What's the matter? 
 Nothing. I just... wanted to see you. 
 So, tomorrow, me and your other mum are gonna go and see the doctor and then you'll be in here... 
 .. and it will be nine long months until I see you. 
 But... I'm gonna film how you grow. 
 And this is gonna be where you will live, with us. 
 And this... is not quite finished yet. 
 .. because, well, we want to... see who you are first. 
 Hey. What you doing? Uh... deleting this. 
 Mm. 
 I'm gonna start a new diary for seven. 
 Do you want to do it with me? No. 
 That's your thing. 
 Oh, come on, it's getting harder each time I have to do it. 
 Then why don't you just keep that one? 
 Because it's not seventh's film, its six's. 
 I know that but if you're struggling to do them... 
 Sometimes it's like you don't even want this baby. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You know I do. 
 I'm just worried. Last time, you took weeks before you'd even get out of bed. 
 It will work this time. 
 I'm gonna start the new diary. 
 Why have you got a gun? 
 What you doing, going through my stuff? 
 Why have you got it? None of your business. 
 Yeah, it is my business. 
 If you hurt someone or you rob someone and then you get caught and you get put in jail, then what happens then? 
 How are me and Taylor gonna manage without you? 
 I'm not gonna rob someone. 
 I tried. 
 I did. 
 But I couldn't. 
 I got it when you moved in. 
 I can't let anything happen to you. 
 Something bad goes down, I'm not... 
 I'm not gonna walk away. 
 I can't. Not again. 
 But that was war. 
 If you hadn't walked away, you could've died. 
 I don't like that gun. 
 So, I'll stop what I'm doing with Joel and you get rid of it. 
 OK? 
 Where are we going? 
 Ew! What is that? Did you do that? 
 Did you kill it? 
 Don't. It's disgusting. 
 They eat it. 
 If you get them on you, they'll eat you too. 
 No, they won't. 
 I don't want to be with you any more. 
 Don't tell your mum. 
 Hi, Edward. Hi, Mrs Colletti. 
 Did you have a good time? Yeah. 
 Something happened? 
 We're not together any more. 
 
 
 
 Why's that? We're just not. 
 OK. 
 Whoa. What's this? 
 Overreacted, I'm sorry. 
 You don't want to go with a thing like that on your conscience, I get it. 
 My favourite. 
 I wanna play this at my funeral. 
 When the time's right. 
 Months, doctor said, at best. 
 We'll go to the police station tomorrow. I'll go with you. 
 We'll see how it goes. 
 We might be able to stick to your story that you were alone. 
 But... But if not? 
 I'll deny everything and say that your brain's been turned to mush. 
 Which is true. 
 Look, they can't prove anything. 
 It will be your woolly-minded word against mine. 
 And I'll take my chances. Thank you. 
 It's like a... like a last... 
 .. uh, um... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Supper. 
 Yeah. 
 Right, let's drink up. 
 Because we... are going out all night, drinking like it's... 1979. 
 Cheers. 
 You all right? 
 Can you imagine how many people will miss those children? 
 Parents, grandparents, siblings, friends. 
 No-one will miss me. 
 Come on, that's not true. 
 It is. You've got a family. 
 I've got two children that want to move to Singapore with their father, who calls me a disease. 
 Well, I'd miss you. 
 I would. And you've got Tim. 
 Have I? 
 All right, what's brought this on? 
 I... 
 I remembered, um... 
 .. something today. 
 And it frightened me. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Should I be worried? 
 No. You sure? 
 Yep. I'll be fine. 
 I'll buy you a beer. Come on. 
 Here, I want to show you something. 
 What, are we here? Yes. 
 Wow. You all right? 
 Wait. Watch the step. 
 Got it? Yep. 
 We've not been here ages. 
 But you do remember? 
 I do. 
 Our first. 
 Wanted you to see this place one last time. 
 Thank you. 
 And to give you one more. 
 Right, guys, I need you to go to Python's boxing club in Brixton. 
 We got an ID on one of the boys, Billy Johnson, went missing three years ago. 
 Was last seen training at the club, was driven home by Vince Whitman. 
 THE Vince Whitman? Yeah. 
 So, how can I help you? 
 Do you recognise this boy, Billy Johnson? 
 Yeah. I remember Billy. Good kid. Promising. 
 Have you found him? Do you know Vince Whitman? 
 Oh, Vince has been boxing here since he was kid. 
 And did he know Billy Johnson? 
 Vince was his sponsor. 
 Sponsor? Define that. 
 Well, it's somebody who kind of looks after a kid like a mentor. 
 They, you know... Sorry, is this about Karim? 
 No, Billy Johnson. Who's Karim? 
 He's missed training two days in a row. 
 So, I was just wondering if something had happened to him. 
 Well, have you tried to get hold of him? 
 Yeah, rung him, been to his place and that, but no-one's seen him since he left here the night before last. 
 Was Vince here that night? 
 Yeah, he was. 
 Have you got Karim's details? 
 Billy Johnson. 
 You drove him home after a training session of September 4, 2015, correct? 
 Yeah, that's right. Have you found Billy? 
 You dropped him outside his house? 
 Yeah. And then what did you do? 
 I'm sure you got that in your papers. I went to work. 
 At 9:30 at night? You don't build a multi-million pound business working office hours. 
 Can you please tell me -- have you found Billy? 
 Yes. We found Billy. 
 Is he dead? Yes. 
 You were his sponsor. Is that right? 
 I was. 
 Some of the kids have potential, no money. 
 I like to help them. 
 How kind of you. What else do you like to do to them? 
 One more remark like that from you and I'm out of here. 
 I was questioned and cleared three years ago, OK? 
 Has something changed? Yeah. 
 OK, so did you drive Karim home as well? 
 Who? 
 Karim Allanse was last seen at Pythons two days ago. 
 As were you. You know, he's one of the boys with potential but no money that you like to... help. 
 Yes. I know who he is. Good, we're getting somewhere. 
 Did you drive him home two days ago? 
 No. 
 Right, so where did you go after you left the club? 
 Straight home. I was a bit roughed up. 
 And have you got anyone that can back that up? 
 That I drove home alone? I don't think so, no. 
 Can you prove that I didn't? 
 I will. Oh, really? 
 This was voluntary, right? 
 Right, we should search his cars, see if Karim's been in any of them. 
 We haven't got enough for a search warrant. 
 Then we should arrest him. Do a section 18 instead. 
 We definitely don't have enough to arrest him. 
 Rav, we're dealing with 17 dead children. 
 We should be able to search Buckingham Palace! 
 I agree with you, but we've gotta do things properly. 
 There's something you gotta see. 
 PostFeed24 are releasing one minute each day for the next fortnight. 
 They're calling it The House of Horror. 
 We're here. Patrick Hannigan's house, where he murdered his family. 
 Where did they get it from? 
 Most of the content on this site is user generated. 
 Right. And when were they there? 
 There might be evidence on it, could give us some leads. 
 I want that film now. 
 .. this could be the most haunted house that we've been in so far. 
 Now, up these stairs were the rooms where he killed his family. 
 For f*ck's sake! 
 Just gonna have to wait like everyone else. Sorry. 
 No, this is a murder investigation, we don't wait. 
 Well, you'll have to. 
 You know, people send us stuff and if that ends up with the police, then they might not want to do it again and that means losing money. 
 Give me the film or I come back with a court order. 
 Right. Well, that film is on a server in Kiev. 
 Don't think British jurisdiction reaches the Ukraine. 
 Right. I will get a court order, I'll take your finances apart and find out who you're paying for the footage. 
 Who says we're paying? 
 OK. I'll tell you what. 
 You get me something else, something exclusive, something to get traffic and attract advertisers like this film does, and I'll see what I can do. 
 Are you serious? 
 Well, I have something that you want so, uh... yeah. 
 Now, you listen to me. People have been murdered. 
 Anyone I know or care about? 
 Did kids get hurt in that house? 
 Yes. 
 People should be kind to children. 
 Well, someone wasn't. 
 There was a red car parked down there from time to time. 
 What car? What...? What make? 
 A red car and a man. What man? 
 What did he look like? Like a man. 
 I want you to come to the police station, look at pictures of cars and meet a sketch artist. 
 I've helped you enough. 
 Nigel! Wait. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Did the police talk to you? Get off my property. 
 I'm guessing you didn't tell 'em about Karim, since they let you out? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You picked him up... after our little sparring session the other day. 
 Now he's missing. 
 And you really don't need more bad publicity, do you? 
 So, what's it worth... for these not to reach the police? 
 f*ck off.
