 I've got rid of your Lambeth problem, Andrew Barnes. 
 Leah! 
 A six-year-old girl was drowned. 
 God, no! 
 We found strands of hair, not hers. Your DNA from the babysitter. 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 Go and get someone please! 
 Get someone. Get... Get someone. 
 You killed my brother. 
 I didn't. I didn't. 
 I see you move that body. 
 You thought it was Hassan in the taxi, so you killed him. 
 I didn't. 
 I'm not going to hurt you if I get a confession. 
 He said the police is different here, you can trust most of them, so I'm doing it his way. 
 Talk! 
 I didn't kill your brother. 
 OK. 
 (OK.) 
 No! 
 No! No! 
 I said I wouldn't hurt you if I got a confession. 
 Talk! 
 I didn't kill anyone. I moved... 
 .. I moved the body, I moved Grace's body, but I didn't kill anyone. 
 You liar! You killed Hassan. 
 You killed Hassan. 
 You're late. 
 Bad night. 
 Like I-want-to-talk-about-it bad? 
 Laura, I'm fine! 
 OK. Then go and join Rav in the interview room. 
 Yann? 
 Yes. 
 Carol Fincher. 
 Sorry. 
 Carol. She was in your AA group. 
 Yeah. Yes, she was... 
 You had traces of alcohol in your blood when we brought you in. 
 Yeah, I erm... I had a small relapse. 
 Why? 
 Because I hate London. 
 So, you didn't drink to forget killing an innocent little girl? 
 Hey, I didn't do it! 
 I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. 
 What can I say to make you believe that? 
 Walter Davies. 
 Who's he? 
 He's the father of the man you and Matthew rented an apartment from in Norwich. 
 You dropped a keycard at his house, didn't you? 
 No? 
 Liz Harper. Benjamin Williams. 
 Grace Gibson. Beth Bachchan. 
 May. 
 I don't think it's him. 
 Well, we've got his DNA, there's evidence at his house, and he hasn't got any alibis. 
 Our man is a methodical, cold-blooded killer. 
 Yann doesn't fit that profile. 
 He could have faked the panic attack. 
 Uh-uh. He didn't. 
 If you're good at faking it, it's hard to tell. 
 Isn't it, Mark? 
 Sorry what? 
 Nothing. 
 The DNA from his hair was in the hand of a murder victim. 
 I know. 
 Have you got the forensic report on that? 
 Er, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 You're saying Andrew Barnes was murdered? 
 It seems like it, yes. 
 That's terrible, but what's it got to do with us? 
 You did business with him? 
 Yes, he was the chairman of the planning committee in Lambeth. 
 He was about to shut down one of your projects? 
 What are you insinuating, officer? 
 Nothing. 
 If you made a list of companies that might benefit from Barnes' death, DTG Construction would be number one, I'd say. 
 We had a new plan for Lambeth. 
 Henry and Jason had put together a proposal that would have saved it. 
 Jason...? 
 Backland. 
 Our head of Legal. 
 He was fired, wasn't he? 
 If there isn't anything else... 
 Not for the moment, no. 
 And if there is, please go through our legal department next time. 
 Hm. 
 What's this? 
 You tell me. 
 "15 grand. I'll be in touch." 
 What, you think I sent you this? Think I'm blackmailing you? 
 Why would I do that? I can't use it without incriminating myself. 
 Then who sent it? 
 It doesn't matter. It's just you giving me an envelope. 
 What are they gonna do with that? 
 So, what do we do? 
 Nothing. 
 It's useless, forget about it. 
 It's useless unless somebody knows what you did. 
 Nobody knows. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Hold on... 
 What's going on? What are you doing here? 
 Has something happened to Yann? 
 He's absolutely fine. 
 This is our home. What are you doing here? Where is he? 
 Mr Neil, can we have a word with you down at the station, please? 
 Yeah. 
 So, Matthew, I just wanted to ask, have you noticed anything strange about Yann lately? 
 Like what? 
 Like anything. 
 Has he been acting differently? 
 No. What are you holding him for? 
 How much does Yann know about your work? 
 He knows what I do and we talk like normal couples, why? 
 Does he know enough to get into a computer, Mrs Shaw's for example? 
 That was for a murder investigation. 
 Is that why you're asking about him? 
 Have you seen any of these before? Insulation tape, cable ties. 
 Er, OK. Is he here? I have to see him. 
 You've no idea how these got into your home? 
 No, I don't. 
 Do the names Liz Harper, Benjamin Williams, Grace Gibson and Beth Bachchan mean anything to you? 
 No. Grace obviously does. She was my best friend's sister. 
 But none of the other ones? 
 And you've never heard Yann talking about them? 
 Can I see him? 
 I'm afraid you can't. 
 But, you can help us with our investigation. 
 If you can let us know your whereabouts on those dates, there. 
 Mark? 
 Yeah? 
 Can you do me a favour? 
 Sure. Anything. 
 Hang on. 
 Ow! 
 What are you doing?! 
 Thanks. You said anything. 
 Hi, darling. 
 Hi, Mum. 
 Where do you and Dad want to sit? 
 Sit when, honey? 
 Tonight. The talent show. 
 Erm... 
 Don't say you forgot. 
 No, of course I didn't. It's eight o'clock, right? 
 Seven. Where do you want to sit? 
 I don't mind. Sit us wherever you want to, darling. 
 OK. 
 I love you. I can't wait. 
 Bye. 
 Bye-bye. 
 I'm investigating the death of Andrew Barnes. 
 Sylvie Gibson says you were involved in saving something called the er... 
 .. The Lambeth Project, is that right? 
 The committee felt that we broke our agreement. 
 Henry Gibson and I came up with a solution. 
 Will it be approved this time, without Barnes? 
 I don't know. 
 Because if it is approved, one could say that you really benefit from Andrew Barnes's death. 
 One could say that, yes, but wasn't he depressed and killed himself? 
 Weren't you fired from DTG? 
 Who told you that? 
 Marcella. 
 This is all about her, isn't it? 
 What is? 
 DTG have over 800 employees. 
 Are you gonna talk to each and every one like this? 
 No. 
 Good, you're here. 
 We've decided to send your new proposal for Lambeth to the planning committee, will you arrange that? 
 Absolutely. Glad you finally realised it's the best way forward. 
 It's not, but we're forced to use it. 
 Andrew Barnes was murdered. He was against the original plan. 
 Murdered? 
 If it went through now it might raise unnecessary questions with the public. 
 Sure, I'll send the new plans along. 
 Good. 
 How did Jason react to the news? 
 Henry, just do it. 
 You don't think he had anything to do with it, do you? 
 With what? The murder? 
 Don't be silly! 
 He was desperate to get his job back. 
 He said working with me was plan B. Perhaps this was his Plan A. 
 God, you really don't want him here, do you? 
 Forget it. 
 Jason's a climber. 
 You said yourself he'd do anything for this company. 
 Yeah? 
 They know he was killed. 
 Who knows? 
 The police. 
 This is a murder investigation now. 
 All right, just calm down. 
 I think I should pay. 
 No, don't panic. 
 I need to this to go away. 
 If that's what you want, but let me handle it. 
 Can we meet? 
 Yes. 
 Tonight? 
 OK. 
 Bendek. 
 We need to talk business. 
 Sure. 
 If it's gonna take more than a minute, it has to wait. 
 I have a case involving DTG Construction. 
 We should share information. 
 What kind of case? 
 A fake suicide. 
 Should your case be mine? 
 I don't think they're connected in that way. 
 They just involve the same family. 
 The Gibsons? 
 And possibly Jason Backland. 
 Guess the superintendent will have to wait. 
 Well? 
 Yes, considerably more. 
 I need pictures of all of them. 
 Absolutely. 
 Thanks, Mark. OK so... 
 This is the hair we found in Beth's hand, and this is hair I pulled from Mark's head earlier on today. 
 She did. It hurt. 
 And, as you can see, there's only two roots from the hair in Beth's hand and yet almost every single hair I pulled from Mark's head has a root. 
 This is hair from my hair brush. 
 Are you seeing the similarities? 
 I don't think the hair that we found in Beth's hand was pulled from the killer's head. 
 She could've grabbed his hoodie and got hold of it. 
 I think it was planted. 
 When we find DNA at a crime scene, it means that person has been there. 
 What if it was planted. What if...? 
 Who's got access to Yann's hair? 
 His barber. 
 Matthew Neil. 
 Yes, hers... Hers is better. 
 Why would he try and frame his own boyfriend? 
 I don't think it's Yann. 
 Because...? 
 What don't you get about this?! 
 I get everything about this. This is my investigation! 
 I think we should bring him in. 
 We can, and we probably will. 
 But, we've already spoken to him today. 
 And you let him go? 
 He's not a suspect. 
 Hi. 
 The police have Yann. 
 What? Why? What for? 
 They think he has something to do with the murders. 
 Grace? 
 But they're wrong. 
 Mum! 
 Hey! Hello, gorgeous. 
 Let me look at you. Wow! Are you nervous? 
 Not really, just for the rings trick. 
 Hey. 
 Are you not doing anything? 
 Are you kidding? 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Yes, I'm sure. 
 I can't have that picture ending up with the police. 
 I do this and it's over, right? 
 I'll make sure it is. 
 Good evening, if everybody would like to take their seats, please? 
 Where's Dad? 
 Come on, let's go in. 
 You got me into this situation. 
 And I'll get you out of it. 
 Here it is. 
 I've already taken my half as arranged. 
 It's all there. Don't you trust me? 
 It ends here, Bendek. Do you hear me? 
 No more blackmail. 
 He paid, didn't he? 
 I mean it. 
 Next time he wants help, he might not come to me.

 What happened? Why are you not here? 
 What? Where's "here"? 
 The talent show. 
 Oh, sh1t! I completely forgot. I'll explain it to Edward later. 
 I have to go back in. What do you want? 
 Listen, did you tell Tim that I was fired? 
 Erm, I don't know, I might have. Why? 
 Do you speak to him a lot? 
 Is that seriously why you called me? 
 Well, do you? He was at our house. 
 I didn't know you two were so close. 
 Bye-bye, Jason. 
 Look, Mar... 
 That was so good. I'm so proud of you. 
 You missed the start. And why didn't Dad come? 
 You'll have to ask him about that. 
 Why can't we ask you? 
 He loves us, so I guess he didn't want to be here with you. 
 No, that's not why. 
 Tell us why. 
 Why aren't you together any more? What did you do? 
 I didn't do anything. 
 Except ruin everything. 
 Emma, why do you always think everything is my fault? 
 Because you always acted so weird. 
 What...? 
 Do you really want to know why your father's not here? 
 Shall I tell you why your father's not here? 
 Yes! 
 Your dad's not here because he was having an affair for three years with another woman, and then he left me. 
 I acted weird because I was depressed because I'd lost my baby. 
 It was not a choice. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry I... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mum, don't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 God. 
 Hey. Listen... 
 Sorry I missed it. 
 Yeah, Edward was really disappointed. What are you doing here? 
 I was in my car on my way home and I still... 
 .. I still think of this as home. 
 And what do you want? 
 I don't know. I just know I need something good in my life. 
 We had something good and you threw it away. 
 Three nights ago you came to me -- 
 Old habits. It won't happen again. 
 I told the kids about Grace. 
 What did you do that for? 
 I was sick of them blaming me for everything, that's why. 
 You gonna turn the kids against me? 
 I'd never. They think the world of you. 
 When we're with the kids we'll be a family and when it's just us... 
 .. we're nothing. 
 I want you to give me the key. 
 No, I still own this house. 
 Just give me the key. 
 What, so you can give it to Tim? 
 Just give me the f*cking key! 
 It's rather late. 
 Don't you worry. This is not gonna take long at all. 
 Can you explain why you stole a keycard from a Premier Lodge reception? 
 No, I can't. 
 I can't explain the DNA, the stuff you found in my flat. 
 Anything, all right? 
 Can I just go back to my cell? I'm really tired. 
 All right, Yann, have a look at this. 
 This is a photograph from said Premier Lodge. 
 And this here, is an item of clothing taken from your home. 
 Now, if you look at this stitching here, this repair, yeah? 
 This is not... This is not mine. No. 
 And this is... 
 This is not me. This is Matthew's. 
 You're looking for Matthew. 
 That's Matthew Neil? 
 Yeah. 
 It was his hoodie on the CCTV at Premier Lodge. 
 We can't get hold of him. 
 His phone is switched off. No match on his car with ANPR. 
 OK. Thanks a lot. 
 The unit we sent to his house says he's not there. 
 Work? 
 He has his own company but works part time at DTG Construction. 
 I asked them to call if he shows up. 
 He was involved in the 2005 investigation as well. 
 What? 
 You're f*cking kidding me. 
 No, look. 
 He wasn't a suspect. He lived next door to one of the victims. 
 So how was he involved? 
 He was helping the police see if the victim had anything missing. 
 So he knows about the trophies. 
 Sorry, I'm failing to understand this. 
 Why didn't you tell us this earlier? We've talked about him for days. 
 I recognised the face. I didn't recognise the name. 
 He was in the case file for anyone to find. 
 We need to talk to him. 
 The job he's got at DTG. 
 His best friend got him it, Henry Gibson. 
 They spent a lot of time together. Yann sounded jealous. 
 He might know where to find Matthew. 
 Do we know where Gibson is? 
 No? OK, let's find out please. 
 Looking for me? 
 The door was open. 
 Doesn't mean you can just walk in though, does it? 
 So, when was the last time you saw Matthew? 
 Matthew? He was here yesterday. 
 What did he want? 
 He was very upset. 
 You'd just arrested his partner. 
 You think Yann had something to do with it? 
 We can't talk about that. 
 No, of course not. 
 Is this you and Matthew? 
 Yeah. Football camp when we were nine. 
 We grew up together. He's basically my brother. 
 You see a lot of each other? 
 Yeah, especially now he's back in London. 
 I helped him set up his business here. 
 When was that? 
 About four months ago? 
 If he's not at work and not at home, where might he be? 
 Sorry, what's going on? 
 Did he say where he was going when he left here? 
 He wasn't allowed to see Yann and didn't want to go home, so he said he was going away for a bit. 
 Away? 
 Yeah, just on his own, just to try and process all of this I think. 
 If he contacts you call me immediately. 
 Brother or no brother, yeah? 
 Of course. 
 Whatever it is you think he's done, you're wrong. 
 Thank you. 
 Vehicle found, alpha 476 golf, golf, whiskey. 
 Status of vehicle? 
 Abandoned. 
 Stuart? 
 Hey. 
 How was class? 
 Muy buen, gracias. Que quieres te? 
 Erm... 
 Do you want some tea? 
 Oh er, si. Pleaso. 
 How can you listen to that? 
 Can you ask him to turn it down? 
 Yeah. 
 Bendek! 
 Bendek! Come on! 
 Linda! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Turn that sh1t off. 
 Call an ambulance! 
 Ambulance service, please. 
 I wouldn't bother. He's dead. 
 Er, yeah, yeah, sorry erm... 
 Our lodger erm... 
 Can you send an ambulance, please? 
 Right! We've found Matthew Neil's car. It's in Dover. We informed Europol, and the French are investigating if he arrived in Calais. 
 When will we know if he did? 
 I don't know. 
 So, we carry on as if he's still in the country. 
 His car's being towed to London for forensic analysis but locals found this in the glove compartment. 
 Beth's? 
 Mm-hm. 
 May must have made it for her. 
 I've found two new connections between our victims and Matthew Neil. 
 Beth was a client of his. 
 He said he'd never heard of her. 
 Yeah. 
 Benjamin Williams was his physiotherapist. 
 Why was he seeing a physio? 
 I've got his medical records here. 
 He had herniated discs. 
 Lumbar disc herniation. 
 There's one, there's another. 
 A man with these problems could barely lift anything without extreme discomfort. 
 What if he does lift something heavy, like a body? 
 Out of the question, I'd say. 
 But what happens if he does? 
 Extreme pain, bedridden, or to say the least, severe difficulties moving. 
 Thanks. 
 That rules Matthew Neil out as well. 
 I'm just so f*cking tired of this case! 
 It doesn't mean he didn't kill Grace Gibson. 
 And what? Someone else came and moved the body? 
 Maybe. 
 He's connected to the victims, the car, the bracelet. 
 He had the opportunity. 
 You can't rule him out because he's got a bad back. 
 I didn't kill anyone. 
 You killed Hassan! 
 I didn't... I didn't kill anybody. 
 What happened in there? 
 I don't know. 
 Just a s*x act gone wrong. 
 No... 
 I mean, with you. 
 Stuart, is anything wrong? 
 You have to tell me. 
 I've got MS. 
 It's early stages but... 
 I can't provide for us any more. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because I'm supposed to take care of you. 
 We're supposed to take care of each other. 
 I've put some money aside but it's nowhere near enough. 
 You don't have to worry about money. We'll manage. 
 And I've done some pretty bad things to get it. 
 What bad things? 
 I'm sorry, Linda. 
 But, I do love you. 
 Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? 
 sh1t! 
 Night. 
 Hey, Laura, sorry. 
 Do you remember Bendek Krol? You know, the guy with the key card? 
 Sure. 
 He's dead. 
 Autoerotic asphyxiation. 
 He tied a leather belt to a door handle or something. 
 Is it really that much better without air? 
 Anyway, because he figured in our investigation, we got his stuff. 
 Anything interesting? 
 Yes, very much so. 
 This is his phone. 
 They found 7,500 grand but it looks like he's blackmailed someone. 
 Here. 
 If you look at that picture there, those two guys were both at Grace Gibson's funeral. 
 Do you want me to look into it? 
 No, I'll take it. Thanks. 
 Found him yet? 
 Oh! Sorry. 
 Mo? 
 Erm, no. 
 Have you heard about Matthew Neil? 
 That he couldn't have moved Grace's body? Yes. 
 I still think it could be him. 
 I know. Rav said. 
 I want to stay on him. 
 OK. 
 Well, I just wanted to say goodnight. 
 Goodnight. 
 Hi, Tim. 
 Hey, you're still here? 
 I've got something for you, Bendek Krol's mobile. 
 You found the place all right? 
 Yes. 
 Yup. 
 It's a beautiful house. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, it's your er, it's your first time here, isn't it? 
 Yes, it is. 
 Well, hopefully not the last. 
 Thank you. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheer. Glad you could come. 
 You said you had something to show us. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Are you aware of Battersea? 
 What about it? 
 There's a very special plot of land the council are hoping to develop. 
 Do you know what...? I'll just show you. 
 You're working late. 
 New suspect. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Why are you talking to Jason? 
 DTG came up in an investigation. 
 He's head of Legal... again. 
 Nothing about Grace? 
 No. 
 Have you got any idea why he got his job back? 
 Hm, they probably realised they couldn't do without him. 
 And you? 
 I've realised I can. 
 Obviously it's sustainable. 
 But, more importantly it's a tribute to Grace. 
 It's bold, elegant, forward thinking. 
 And it looks onto the river just like Dad always liked. 
 I think it's beautiful. 
 Sylvie? 
 I love it. 
 Really? 
 Come here. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, this is cause for celebration. 
 I have erm, some nice champagne downstairs. 
 Let me er... I'll be right back.
