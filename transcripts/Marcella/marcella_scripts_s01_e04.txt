 Grace Gibson has been found dead. There's evidence to indicate it's our murderer. 
 What did she want? 
 Just to know how our CCTV works. 
 I got hold of the CCTV from Hampstead Heath. 
 That's Clive Bonn. 
 We lost a witness today. 
 Where was Cullen at the time? 
 You've ruled him out and I think that's a mistake. 
 It's not what we agreed. 
 Be glad I pay you at all. 
 Ooh! You made me jump, Bendek. 
 Sorry. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I got the sack today. 
 Cullen's out. If he shows up, just get away from him. 
 He is sick. You do know that, don't you? 
 Sorry. 
 You lied to us. 
 About Carol Fincher. 
 You arranged a meeting via a dating website. 
 I did. I lied. 
 And when I realised she was an ex-employee... I backed off. 
 Nothing happened. 
 But you deleted the account after talking to us. 
 Why? 
 I have affairs. 
 A couple of years ago, for financial reasons, I signed over half the company to my wife. 
 And, as you know, there's nothing more... 
 .. greedy... than a deceived woman. 
 Just when I thought I couldn't like you any less (!) 
 What were you doing on Wednesday night? 
 This Wednesday? 
 Between midnight and 8AM. 
 I was at home with my wife. 
 You were seen leaving a black Fiesta on Hampstead Heath. You're lying. 
 And I'm sick of being lied to. 
 Is he co-operating? 
 He's offered us unrestricted access to his e-mail, bank details, travel itineraries. 
 What was he doing on the Heath? 
 The usual. Being a cheating dickhead, but this time with a Kassia Beckworth. 
 Good. Well, hold him. Keep me in the loop. 
 Dig into his alibi. 
 And I'll get Forensics to look at Kassia Beckworth's Fiesta. 
 Later. 
 Come with me. Both of you. 
 Can you shut the door? 
 You said you didn't know. About Grace Gibson and your husband. 
 I didn't. Not until Tim told me. 
 So why did you access CCTV outside her house? 
 I was asked. 
 No. Not almost 72 hours before anyone knew she was dead. 
 I was helping DI Williamson. I knew that she was listed as missing at that time. 
 Did he ask you to help him? 
 No. 
 I was learning about the system. I thought I might as well do something useful. 
 So you knew nothing about Jason and Grace Gibson... before she was killed? 
 Not at the time, no. 
 Did it lead anywhere? 
 Sorry. What is this? 
 No... minicab or delivery van. 
 Like the other crime scenes. 
 I wasn't looking for those then. 
 Look for them now. 
 Check all the CCTV footage the night of Grace's murder again. Immediately. 
 Hey! 
 Hiya! 
 What a surprise. 
 Do you live here? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I've just been seeing a friend up the road. 
 Yeah. So, where are you off to? Do you fancy grabbing a coffee or something? 
 I... I'd love to, but... erm... I'm already running late. 
 Do you know? I... I could think that you were trying to avoid me. 
 No. Don't think that. 
 I've just got this lecture and I can't miss it. 
 You can walk with me, though. 
 Great. 
 So, is everyone nice to you here? 
 At uni. 
 Everyone treat you all right? 
 Yeah, they do. Why? 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 I really care about you. 
 Anyway, Peter. Thanks for keeping me company. 
 My pleasure. 
 Oh, hang on. 
 I almost forgot. 
 Hope you like it. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you. 
 What do you say to having dinner together? 
 Yeah. Yeah, we should fix something up. 
 Yeah? 
 Definitely. 
 Good. 
 I'll see you, Peter. 
 See you. 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Don't! 
 Does this look overdressed? 
 For what? 
 I'm meeting Andrew Barnes about Lambeth today. 
 Well, can't you postpone that? 
 So we could... go somewhere, you and I? 
 Take care of each other, have a few days off? 
 I don't take days off. 
 Is Henry gonna be there? 
 No. Why? 
 Well, he's... familiar with the project. 
 Knows what Barnes wants to hear. 
 It's not his fault we're in the position we're in, you know. 
 He warned you about Lambeth. 
 So did Grace. 
 You let your personal feelings about Henry get in the way. 
 He irritates me. Always has. 
 Maybe you should change. 
 That doesn't do you any favours. 
 I inspected the Lambeth site earlier. 
 I'm afraid I've no choice than to issue you with a fail notice, Mrs Gibson. 
 On what grounds? 
 Green space, accessibility, sustainability. 
 You're breaking our planning agreements at almost every point. 
 In our view, these changes were well within its parameters. 
 You've got until Monday to submit a proposal detailing the measures you'll be taking, or else we'll shut it down. 
 And you risk being blacklisted from any further contracts on public land. 
 Surely there must be another way we can solve this... that benefits both of us. 
 I'm not sure I follow you, Mrs Gibson. 
 I think you do. 
 I hope I don't. 
 Erm... we've been going through a very... difficult time... recently. 
 I'm sure you've heard about my sister. 
 I'm really sorry for your loss. 
 But you can't ask me to ignore our planning regulations. 
 No. Of course not. But... 
 Given all that happened with Grace and how it's affecting us, I think we would definitely benefit from more time. 
 Your personal situation is why you're getting till Monday. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What an awful little man. 
 I'll bring someone in to... try and have a look at this. 
 Why don't you do it? 
 Me? 
 Yes, you. 
 Sure. Yeah. Absolutely. 
 I erm... 
 I'd love to. Thank you. 
 Oh. 
 I erm... 
 Just checking up on the place. 
 Sylvie wants it on the market as soon as possible. 
 I'm just collecting... some of Grace's things. 
 I miss her too, you know! 
 In we go. In we go. 
 Oh! Come on. Sit. Sit, sit, sit. 
 Sit, sit. Sit. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 What's the matter with you? 
 Oh! 
 Should be here any minute. 
 Hassan El-Sayed? 
 DS Marcella Backland. Can I have a word? 
 Your vehicle was parked at the junction of Hallum Street and Ferndell Road last Wednesday between 22:50 and 23:25. 
 So? 
 So... a murder was carried out around that time. 
 Murder? 
 Did you see anything? 
 Last Wednesday. 
 No. Sorry. 
 Your car was parked for 35 minutes. 
 You didn't see... anything? 
 No... man or... woman leaving the house? 
 35 minutes. Did I pick up or leave a ride? 
 No. 
 No. Ah! 
 Oh, I was er... on my break then. 
 I was probably trying to sleep. Sorry. 
 I wish I could be more helpful. 
 Thanks. 
 That's very helpful. Thanks. 
 There's a taxi right outside Grace's house at 22:51. 
 And he stays there for the next 37 minutes, till 23:28. 
 And it's all logged... here. 
 So the driver may have seen something. 
 No. I already spoke to him. 
 His name's... Hassan El-Sayed. 
 He was on a break, taking a nap. Nothing suspicious. 
 There's been another attack. Looks like our killer. Need you all down there now. Now! 
 Can you give us a description? 
 He was all in black. 
 It was over in seconds. 
 And then I found these. 
 What did he want? 
 Can you tell me about your movements today? 
 Yes. 
 I went down to the swimming pool for my senior swimming session. 
 And then I... I stopped off at... at Dusan's. 
 To pick up the dog. 
 Er, who's Dusan? Is that the dog-sitter? 
 No. I'm his. 
 Sorry. Mr Davies, are you saying that there's usually no dog in the house? 
 No. No. 
 What do you think he was up to? 
 Found this. 
 What's that? 
 I don't know. It's unmarked. It was by the wall where he jumped. 
 And that's all we've got? 
 No, we've got a footprint. Size nine. 
 We should have the make and brand in an hour or so. 
 Cullen! Cullen's a size nine. 
 Oh, God. So are ten million others. 
 He's out now. 
 We don't know the last time Guy Roberts left him unattended, Bonn's at the station -- we haven't got anything else. 
 It's not enough to bring him in. 
 Rav, please. 
 What about an invitation? 
 Off the record. Give me one last chance with Cullen. 
 All right. Fine. 
 If you can get him to talk, you bring him in. 
 All right? 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 How was running? 
 Yeah. Yeah, it was great. It was good. 
 Erm... I've been thinking. 
 About Bendek. 
 I'm not really happy having him here. 
 Why not? 
 Has something happened? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I just erm... 
 I don't know. I just don't feel comfortable with someone being in the house. 
 He's all right. 
 We need the money. 
 The thing is... we don't. Not really. 
 Well, like I said. You know. 
 It's good to save a little bit. 
 You know. For the future. I mean, anything could happen. 
 Like what? 
 Like anything. 
 I don't want you to worry. 
 "This is Ade. You know what to do." 
 Hey. Adrian, it's me. 
 Where the hell are you? 
 Call me. 
 Where were you between eleven and one today? 
 What, that's it? Straight to the point? 
 You're not gonna offer me anything to drink? 
 Would you like a drink, Peter? 
 Tea, please. 
 With milk. 
 Why did you do it? 
 Why did I do what? 
 Come here voluntarily. 
 I'm out of prison. 
 I've paid my debt to society and I'm trying to start anew. 
 You know, the sooner you realise that you're wrong, the better for me and the other people around me. 
 Maddy Stevenson? 
 You're ruining my chances of a normal life. 
 Where were you between eleven and one today? 
 Out walking. Enjoying my freedom. 
 Right. You're gonna have to do better than that. 
 Can I have your shoe? 
 Your shoe. I need to photograph it. 
 The sole. 
 If you're gonna keep them, I need some new ones to go home with. 
 Sorry to hear about the dog. 
 You can put your shoe back on. 
 I'm guessing all this has to do with whatever happened today. 
 We're gonna need to get into yours. I need your keys. 
 Or is it a key card? 
 This is the last time I'm helping you, Marcella. 
 You stay away from me. 
 Or what... Peter? 
 Why?! 
 So how's everything going? 
 I'm good. 
 Better. 
 And Jason? 
 Fired. 
 What? 
 Yep. 
 Yeah, it's a real... it's a real pity (!) 
 Um... 
 Have I missed my moment? 
 There was a moment, was there? 
 I wasn't really in a good place. 
 I know. 
 And that's why I didn't act on it. 
 Is... that why you've come? 
 I'm here because I still care about you. 
 Thanks. I'll... see you tomorrow. 
 What was he doing here? 
 What happened? 
 Jason. What happened? 
 I haven't felt anything since the morgue. 
 I needed to feel something. 
 So I paid someone to hit me. 
 It worked. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me right now? 
 I never meant to hurt you. 
 Well, what do you think getting your new girlfriend knocked up would do to me (?) 
 You take those... wait till they kick in... and I'll drive you back to Greg's. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 What are you doing here? Are you looking for Matthew? 
 No. 
 What do you... think of me? 
 I like you. You're er... you're... good for Matthew. Why? 
 It's just that we both care about him. 
 And I just thought it would be good if we were... friends. 
 Oh, God. I... I thought we were. 
 Better friends. 
 Sure. Yeah. Yeah. 
 I'm sure we can work on it. 
 Good. 
 Good. You got a moment right now? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Excellent. All right. Good. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. Matthew said that you weren't allowed to see her. 
 At the morgue. 
 You need closure. Believe me. 
 What the hell do you know about it? 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Better than I expected. 
 Thanks. 
 Sylvie showed some confidence in me yesterday. 
 That's good. 
 Yeah, it's good. 
 I want my job back. 
 You should've thought of that bef - Before I started a relationship with Grace. I know. 
 That's not what we did, though. 
 We loved each other. 
 She's dead. And now I have nothing. 
 So I really need this job. 
 'Before you started lying to me,' was what I was about to say. 
 We didn't lie, Sylvie. 
 We just didn't tell the truth. 
 Oh, quit the lawyer bullshit! 
 Sylvie. 
 This wasn't work. 
 We didn't want you to know. 
 I want my job back! 
 No. 
 You don't get things in life, Jason. You earn them. 
 Erm, listen, Jason. It must have seemed a bit -- 
 Aargh! 
 Shut it. 
 Am I allowed to grieve? 
 Yeah. Yeah, you are. 
 But I wonder what Sylvie would say about the way you do it. 
 Now tell me about the company. 
 Where are we with Clive Bonn? 
 Kassia Beckworth's confirmed she did pick him up at the heath and they had s*x. 
 We've had a preliminary report on Miss Beckworth's Fiesta from Forensics. 
 A 1.6L Ti-VCT Duratec I-4 engine. 
 Black, as we know. Mileage was just under 3,000, which is actually -- 
 Oh, Jesus! Mark. 
 Is there anything of interest in there? 
 Yeah. Erm... 
 No signs of damage to the glass or metalwork. 
 No signs of repairs... and no traces of blood. 
 Marcella. 
 Are you with us? 
 Well, we know it wasn't the car that hit Cara. 
 And Bonn was here during the attempted attack on Walter Davies. 
 Has anyone got anything on the white plastic card that was found in Davies's garden? 
 Short version. It's incredibly hard to retrieve information from them. 
 So I've asked a hacker friend to help me. 
 And there was nothing on the minicab. 
 We've got DNA results from the Gibson house. 
 Blood type O. 
 Cullen was O. 
 He's also a man (!) 
 The blood's from a woman. And there's no match on the DNA database. 
 Get DNA samples from every woman that might have been in Grace Gibson's house. 
 Surely you've done yours by now. 
 I never went to that house. 
 Doesn't matter. Nurse's office, second floor. 
 Marcella? 
 The driver is called Sergei. He will text you when he's outside. 
 Thank you. 
 No worries. 
 So, let me confirm the address with you. 
 Thanks, brother. 
 This is for my dog, you b*st*rd! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks. 
 What's Vannux? 
 Erm... 
 It's a... antidepressant. 
 Why are you looking at that? 
 It's just research for a client. 
 So erm... 
 It has nothing to do with what you said before. 
 You're... you're OK. I mean, we're... we're OK. 
 Yeah. 
 (OK.) 
 Oh. Bendek? 
 Is that you? 
 Can't even be bothered to say hello. 
 Well... if you've gotta go, you've gotta go (!) 
 Sorry. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry! 
 That's all right. Are you OK? 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 Excuse me for a second. 
 "Maddy. Are you all right?" 
 Sorry to bother you. 
 I'm just... I'm just getting a bit freaked out. 
 About what? - "I haven't heard from my boyfriend in days." 
 Right. Does Peter know about him? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Does he know where you live? 
 "Yeah. And..." 
 He gave me this perfume. It's my favourite. 
 "Adrian normally buys it for me." 
 Where are you right now? 
 "Hang on a minute. The lights are on" 
 It must be Adrian. I'll call you back. 
 "Look, you can call me any time." 
 But, Maddy, you've got to listen to me. 
 Can you get eyes on Cullen for me? Now. 
 Adrian? 
 You could've called, you know. 
 I thought we were getting on so well together. 
 Peter, I can explain. - 'The subject is looking for constant confirmation and is therefore easy to befriend and get close to.' 
 So, what do you wanna know? 
 What is so important that is worth deceiving and betraying me for? 
 Peter, please. 
 Do you wanna know if I killed them? 
 Do you wanna know if I'm the Grove Park killer? 
 Where's my backup?! 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 Get it off! 
 Get off her! 
 I told you to stay away from me! 
 Maddy! Can we get the medics in? 
 Breathe. 
 You're OK. 
 You're OK. You're OK. 
 Breathe. 
 It's all right. It's OK. You're OK. You're safe. You're OK. 
 Get him out of here! 
 Can we get medics?! 
 We caught him. 
 It was Cullen. 
 Rav. 
 Cullen used to sit and watch them die. 
 It's what he did to his victims in 2005. 
 It's what he was gonna do to Maddy. 
 He'd move a chair closer so he could get a better look. 
 Now, I haven't checked the crime scenes. 
 But whoever killed Liz Harper, Carol Fincher, Benjamin Williams, they didn't move anything. 
 So he couldn't have been sitting over them like Cullen did in 2005. 
 These latest victims... Cullen didn't kill them.
