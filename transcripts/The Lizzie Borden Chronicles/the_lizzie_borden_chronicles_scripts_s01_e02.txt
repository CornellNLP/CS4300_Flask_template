 Lizzie : Previously on  The Lizzie Borden Chronicles...  
 Please, can we buy it? 
 We have to leave 2nd Street behind us. 
 I got evicted. 
 William, you can come home with us. 
 Siringo : Well, Mr. Danforth, it's a beautiful place you have. 
 So what brings you to Fall River? 
 Siringo : I was hired to review the Borden case. 
 I want my cut, or I go to the police and tell them about the dead baby I found in the Borden sisters' basement. 
 [shouts] 
 You have no right to take my money! 
 You want me to go. Why can't we work together?

 If I hadn't seen him yesterday, I'd say he's been here for days. 
 I wouldn't stand downwind of this guy anyway. 
 Gentlemen, please. 
 I beg your pardon, Miss Emma. 
 All due respect for the dead, gentlemen. 
 Anything in his behavior make you ladies think he'd do something like this? 
 William was a sad and angry man. 
 I'm not fully surprised. 
 Hilliard : Why here? 
 I mean, suicide is usually intended to punish the living. 
 Think of any reason why he might want to hurt you? 
 Lizzie : No. 
 Except for that he hated us. 
 Let's cut him down. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Hold up. 
 We need to pay a visit to Mr. Almy. 
 Trotwood : I never figured William would go as far as killing Almy. 
 Hilliard : A man gets into enough of a rage, he can surprise you. 
 He can surprise himself. 
 With his bare hands? 
 You know, it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't use his hands at all. 
 Who are you? 
 You a reporter? 
 No. I'm with the Pinkertons. 
 Pinkertons. 
 What do you know about this? 
 Man's dead. 
 You're in charge. 
 That's about it. 
 You working for Almy? 
 No, no. I'm just passing through. 
 A crime scene? 
 Actually, I became interested after William Borden's murder, you see? 
 Suicide. 
 Right. 
 Hilliard : Who are you working for? 
 Like I said, I'm just passing through. 
 Someone please escort him out of here. 
 Marshal, I might be able to help you, you understand? 
 President Lincoln had Pinkerton help, and, uh, well, we saw where that got him. 
 We have the matter in hand. 
 Yeah, I'd say so. 
 A man's been murdered, you found his killer, and he's already been strung up... all before the coffee's even been brewed. 
 [chuckles] 
 Lizzie : 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 
 [grunting] 
 There you are, you little rascal. www That's it? 
 That's everything. 
 Now I would recommend putting this someplace safe for your records. 
 Neither the late Mr. Almy nor his estate have any further claim. 
 As horrible as his actions were, your half-brother did you a great favor. 
 You are now both very wealthy women. 
 I must be going. 
 William died doing the first considerate thing he'd ever done in his tragic, wasted life. 
 I think our father would be proud. 
 Again, condolences on your loss. 
 Thank you. 
 Emma. 
 Emma, are you all right? 
 This family seems to lurch from one tragedy to the next. 
 William gave no clue as to the child's location? 
 No.

 I could see it again, couldn't you? 
 I would love to get something to eat. 
 Delmonico's. Let's go to Delmonico's. 
 Perfect. 
 You're her, aren't you? 
 You're Lizzie Borden. 
 Yes, I am. 
 We both loved your performance. 
 I can't believe it. 
 You were in the papers more than President Cleveland. 
 I'm sorry, we were just about to go. 
 Oh, no, please don't go. 
 We're having a party inside the theater. 
 I'd love you to come. Please. 
 Um, I think we're just going to get a quick, quiet bit to eat before we get home.

 This is Nance O'Keefe, and she's inviting us to a party in New York City. 
 Filled with the most amazing people. 
 We have to go. 
 You have to.

 Emma : We should have waited at the station for a carriage home. 
 We would have been waiting there until dawn. 
 We should have just stayed at the party until dawn. 
 Oh, Lord, no. 
 Would have made it easier to get a carriage. 
 I don't know why you insisted on buying that hideous thing. 
 Oh, because our home is electrified, Emma. 
 So are you, clearly. 
 I just want to get home, get in bed, forget all about those people. 
 Everyone I met tonight was perfectly lovely. 
 Felt like I was trapped at the circus. 
 Well, the world is a circus, Emma. 
 Fine, but do you have to play the freak? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Shortcut. 
 Lizzie, would you slow down? 
 I wish you wouldn't condemn me for wanting to enjoy my life once in a while. 
 I'm not condemning you. 
 I'm just concerned by your choices. 
 Well, then be concerned. Don't be insulting. 
 A lifetime in Fall River and I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of walking this block. 
 Yeah, well, new experience. 
 [whimpering] 
 I'm telling you the truth. 
 The hell you are. 
 I gave you every penny. I swear. 
 [grunting] 
 Lizzie : Stop! Let go of her. 
 Well, if it isn't dear dead William's sweet little sister. 
 Lizzie, this is none of our business. 
 Yeah, you really should move along. 
 [grunting] 
 We'll call for the cops.

 Oh, this is gonna be fun.

 Are you hurt?

 Stand up, Adele. 
 That's my dress. 
 Of course it is. She'd never fit in one of mine. 
 Oh, it's perfect. 
 See how it brings out her eyes? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Take this. 
 Go upstairs. There's a bath waiting for you. 
 You'll feel much better without this layer of crust, I'm sure. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 Go, go, go. 
 She was so hungry. 
 You know you can't keep her. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 I'll be back with some shoes. 
 Adele, take your hand out. 
 What's the matter? 
 Adele. 
 Oh. 
 What happened? 
 I had a job in the mills. 
 My hand got stuck in a scutcher. 
 I told them I could make do with my left, but... 
 I couldn't find any work after that. 
 Real work, I mean. 
 Listen to me. 
 And you have to believe me. 
 You're through with all that. 
 You never have to go back to the Row again. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought... 
 Look. 
 [exhales] 
 You're a proper young lady. 
 And that's all anyone will see. 
 Adele, what is wrong? 
 What do you want from me? 
 I don't want anything from you. I just... 
 I want to help you. 
 You can't help me. 
 I... I don't belong here. 
 I need to go. 
 Nonsense. Nonsense. 
 That is all behind you. 
 You don't understand. 
 He's gonna come looking for me. 
 He owns me. 
 Who? 
 That ridiculous brute from the alley? 
 No, not him. 
 The man he works for. 
 What you got? 
 I do not believe it. 
 Oh. 
 That's quite a mark I gave you. 
 You'll want to wash that out. 
 You got some stout. 
 I'm looking for a Mr. Flowers. 
 Could you point me to him? 
 I'll point you to a boot in your ass. 
 Skipjack. 
 Well, you must be Mr. Flowers. 
 Why must I? 
 Because everyone in this room is afraid of you. 
 Not everyone. 
 It does my heart good to hear that Adele is being so well cared for. 
 She was as weak as a feather when I came upon her. 
 Poor, poor girl. 
 So you can understand why she won't be returning here. 
 There's where you and I see things a little differently. 
 [door opens] 
 You wanted me? 
 Ahem. 
 Bernard. Yeah. 
 Yes, I have something I'd like to show you. 
 It's Ginny. 
 Oh, are you positive? 
 Take a closer look. 
 Huh? A closer look. 
 She doesn't look like that anymore, does she? 
 Because you knocked her teeth out. 
 And for what? For what? 
 Please stop. 
 She gave you some lip? Is that what it was? 
 I'm sorry. 
 And so you think that raised her value or lowered it? 
 Maybe I ought to put you out on the street and paint you up like a whore. 
 How does that sound, huh? 
 You go bleed somewhere else. 
 [grunting] 
 I don't like it when people take liberties with my livelihood. 
 You'd be a poor businessman if you did. 
 Still, I think we can agree that Adele wouldn't last two more months out here on the street. 
 That's two months she could be making money for me. 
 This should cover your loss and then some. 
 Lizzie Borden? 
 The ax killer? 
 I prefer former Sunday school teacher. 
 You always get what you want? 
 When I don't, things get...  
 Messy. 
 The attention they deserve until my point of view is accepted and agreed to. 
 I'm sure you can understand that. 
 Perfectly. 
 [bicycle bell rings] 
 Mr. Siringo. 
 What do you got? 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 Thank you. 
 Good day. 
 Carriage? 
 Giddyup. Giddyup. Giddyup. 
 Linen napkins. 
 You've been following me all morning. 
 I assume you want to know what I bought. 
 I'm Lizzie Borden. 
 Excuse me. 
 Charles Siringo. 
 Would you care to join me, Miss Borden? 
 Lizzie. 
 Here you are. 
 Mm. 
 [clears throat] 
 So who are you? 
 You don't have enough grease on you to be a book writer or a reporter. 
 Mm, I'm a private investigator. 
 Oh. 
 How exotic. 
 Like Sherlock Holmes? 
 Mm, same idea, only I'm real. 
 [chuckles] 
 And, uh, are you privately investigating me? 
 I was in town, and you kind of piqued my interest. 
 I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. 
 [both chuckle] 
 So, Charles, what do you think? 
 Do I look like a brutal killer to you? 
 Well, Lizzie, looks might be able to fool an East Coast tea-drinking jury, but I've seen all kinds. 
 Now, there was a lady in Colorado... this was some years ago now. 
 She, um, she killed three of her husbands, four of her children, and the family dog before I caught up with her. 
 She couldn't have been more than 90 pounds wet. 
 But I'll never forget, I could barely hear her little neck snap when she hit the end of the rope. 
 That poor dog. 
 Well, I must be going. 
 Will you be staying long? 
 As long as it takes. 
 Well, good day, Mr. Siringo. 
 It's getting better, Miss Borden. 
 
 
 
 Emma : Hello? 
 In here, Miss Emma. 
 Emma : Where's Lizzie? 
 She went to dinner with Mr. Cavanaugh. 
 Who? 
 The play writer. He's up from New York. 
 Spencer. 
 Scandalous? 
 I can't wait to see it. 
 That's just it. 
 You see, my usual backers are only interested in spectacle. 
 Frilly songs, pretty faces. 
 They're fools. 
 Exactly. 
 You see what this could be. 
 I don't know that a few songs could hurt. 
 You could be right. 
 Yes, you could be right. 
 You see, this is just what I need in a producer. 
 [chuckles] 
 A hundred years from now, someone will mention the name Lizzie Borden, and do you know what will instantly come to mind? 
 Patron of the arts. 
 Wouldn't you rather discuss this someplace more comfortable? 
 I'm perfectly comfortable here.

 She was five when our mother died. 
 I was 14. 
 Father's new wife never paid us much attention, so... 
 Well, then, Lizzie's the lady she is because of your mothering.

 I got an old Texas fix for twisted ankles. 
 Please.

 May I? 
 Is this gonna hurt? 
 Eh, more than it does right now. 
 You want me to fix it, or do you want to hop around all day? 
 Go ahead.

 A what? 
 [Pop]

 There we go. 
 How does that feel? 
 How is that possible? 
 I don't know the science behind it.

 Uh, a very good morning, Mrs. Danforth. 
 You can't leave me. 
 You're my last hope for happiness.

 Leave me, and I'll die. 
 Spencer : You died years ago, Constance. 
 You must stay here with the past you cannot escape, with the ghosts you love more than life itself. 
 So now Tristan walks Constance over to the coffin. 
 Perfect. Right in there. 
 There'd be music here, of course. 
 Yeah and yeah. Just close... close your eyes. 
 Perfect. So now Tristan walks offstage, off to the war for freedom. 
 The house lights go down. 
 And as the audience sits in total darkness, we learn of his fate.

 Emma, what did you think? 
 [all chuckle] 
 Marshal? 
 Thanks, Trotwood. 
 Mr. Siringo, why don't you have a seat? 
 Thank you. 
 Ahem. 
 [exhales] 
 So how can I help you, Marshal? 
 I want you out of Fall River. 
 Is that a threat? 
 Next time you stick your nose in my business, I will have you arrested. 
 Mm, well, I was just trying to help you do your job. 
 That's all. 
 Have you stopped and asked yourself why William Borden killed Almy? 
 Every piece of evidence says he did. 
 The man's watch was in Borden's pocket. 
 You think he killed him over a watch, really? 
 I've seen people kill for less. 
 Marshal, think about it for a second. 
 Who benefits from Almy's death? 
 Maybe William Borden didn't want Almy to take the family's money. 
 William Borden wasn't in the will. 
 He wasn't getting a cent. Trust me. 
 So I ask you one more time. 
 Who profits from Almy's death? 
 Lizzie Borden didn't cause those injuries. 
 William's hands were...  
  Broken, yeah. I'm aware of that. 
 Let me ask you a question. 
 How do you tie a double knot when your hands are broken? 
 Take a look. 
 Lizzie wanted Almy dead. 
 [groaning] 
 And she needed a fall guy. 
 [Lizzie laughs] 
 Literally. 
 And then all she did is point everyone to William. 
 Hilliard : Where's your proof? 
 I'll show you. 
 I found a box of these in Lizzie's barn. 
 The pattern on the shoe... it matches the wounds on Almy's face. 
 [grunts] 
 William had blood on his hands, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's just think for a second that William made it up the ladder and had the time to put a noose around his neck. 
 Where's the blood on the rungs? 
 Or the noose? 
 You know we tried this once before. 
 The whole state against Lizzie Borden. 
 Mm. 
 It didn't end well. 
 I'm not about to be the man to drag us back into the same situation with little more to go on than the speculations of a Pinkerton man. 
 Let me guess. 
 You want to run for mayor, don't you? 
 But you don't want to step on your dick again, isn't that it? 
 Get out of my office. 
 Just food for thought. 
 Thank you, Marshal. 
 And we are in business. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Oh, you should thank Emma. 
 It was her reaction that sold me. 
 Isabel. 
 How wonderful to see you. 
 Lizzie, how have you been keeping yourself? 
 She just became a financier of the New York stage. 
 Really? 
 That's exciting. 
 Madam, do you have any champagne in your stores? 
 Sure. I'll be right back. 
 I'll have it sent to my room. 
 You and I should celebrate properly. 
 As difficult as it would be to sully my reputation further, I think you and I should keep our relationship strictly business. 
 Evening, friend. 
 You celebrating too? 
 I'm having a drink. 
 Well, what are you drinking to? 
 To get drunk. 
 To the lovely ladies of Fall River. 
 Mmm, mmm, mmm. 
 Not all of 'em.

 Lizzie? 
 Shh, shh. Please.

 You and I are the last people on Earth. 
 You've been drinking. 
 You should go. 
 You should raise your skirt.

 You understand? 
 [sobbing] No. 
 The police would have gotten involved, and then do you know what would have happened then?

 It kept me calm during the trial. 
 I will... I will fetch it for you. 
 Don't move, and do not look at him. 
 [sobbing] 
 Shh. 
 Shh! 
 Promise me that you will keep yourself together. 
 I don't think I can. 
 Well, you must. 
 You simply must. 
 What are you looking for, Emma? 
 Just making sure we're not leaving anything behind. 
 I've already checked. 
 There's nothing left in there but junk. 
 I'll have someone come haul it away. 
 The movers will be here soon.

 Good afternoon. 
 My sister and I are moving in next door, and I thought I'd come and introduce myself. 
 I'm Lizzie Borden. 
 I know you full well, Miss Borden. 
 You may be interested to learn that my late husband was the publisher of  The Daily. 
 Oh, oh,  The Daily.  Yes, I know  The Daily. 
 I read his paper's coverage of my legal journey religiously. 
 No doubt you did. 
 I wish I had a chance to tell your late husband how touched I was on the rare occasion when his reporters managed to report the truth. 
 Enjoy the pie. 
 [hammering] 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Excuse me. 
 Gentlemen, can you stop with the hammering, please? 
 Hank. 
 My apologies, sir. 
 Sorry, ma'am. 
 We'll come back later. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Ah, hammered. 
 Drink this. 
 That doesn't look like coffee. 
 So you can spike it and make yourself feel even worse? 
 What is it really? 
 It'll help with your head. 
 You mend sprained ankles. I mend drunks. 
 Go on. 
 [coughs] Oh. 
 It's horrible. 
 You should give that to the neighbor upstairs. 
 He might need some of that too. 
 He didn't come in last night. 
 Oh, lucky him. [Clears throat] 
 You have something in common. 
 What's that? Booze? 
 Lizzie Borden. 
 His name is Spencer Cavanaugh. 
 He's a theater person from New York. 
 The day he checked in, he and Lizzie had a meeting. 
 It looked like he was trying to separate her from her money. 
 What makes you say that? 
 Work in a hotel ten years, you can spot a swindler real quick. 
 Hmm. 
 All right. 
 When he comes back, let me know, will you? 
 I will. 
 Sleep. 
 [chuckles] Like the dead. 
 Emma : I just think it's strange, Adele disappearing without even a good-bye. 
 Oh, it's fine. Emma, you worry too much. 
 You think she's all right? 
 I think, wherever she is, she's thankful for the peace and the fresh start. 
 Well... 
 [thud] 
 [screaming]
