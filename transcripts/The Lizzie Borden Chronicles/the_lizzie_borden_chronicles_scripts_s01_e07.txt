 Miss Grimke, may we speak a moment privately? 
 Of course. Just let me give this to... 
 I'd prefer you didn't just now. 
 Is something the matter? 
 No. Hardly. 
 In fact, I believe I might know what happened to her. 
 For God's sakes, tell me. 
 I've seen people in her state before. 
 Typically, it's people who've witnessed a horrific or brutal event... soldiers reacting to the savagery of war, for instance. 
 Well, she's never witnessed anything like that. 
 We're from a very small town where nothing ever really happens. 
 She's spoken one word in the three months she's been here, and that word was "murder." 
 Is it possible that she might've experienced something terrible like that? 
 Where exactly did you say you're from? 
 Dr. Vose, you have a very fine reputation, and I'm sure it's well deserved, but, as you say, she has been here three months. 
 Matters of the mind aren't quickly solved. 
 They take time. 
 And money. A lot of money. 
 You requested the best care possible. 
 And the only sign of progress has been this single, vague utterance, which I'm sure is more a product of her current situation rather than a remembrance from the past. 
 Wouldn't you want to find out? 
 I don't need to. 
 My sister's condition has nothing to do with any of your gruesome imaginings. 
 Now, I think the best idea would be to take her home with me today. 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna have to fight you on that. 
 I'm afraid that would be unwise. 
 Miss Grimke, will you follow me? 
 I'd like to show you something.

 Hello, Daisy.

 Is there a point to this excursion, Dr. Vose? 
 When you consigned your sister to my care, you gave me full authority to decide whether she is well enough to be released, if at all. 
 I most certainly did not. 
 The admission papers you signed spell that out quite clearly. 
 You should read them again. 
 It's my professional opinion that your sister requires more treatment. 
 Some of those treatments will be expensive, I'm afraid. 
 If you should decide you cannot afford that kind of care for her, I understand, of course. 
 But she might need to be moved to these less opulent quarters.
