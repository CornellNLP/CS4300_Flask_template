 Previously on  The Lizzie Borden Chronicles...  
 Nance, what a terrific surprise. 
 I'm looking for my brother. 
 Aah! 
 Just chop him up and dump him in the bay. 
 You got a new business partner. 
 I'm fine on my own. 
 I wanted to tell you, Mr. Trotwood and I are becoming friends. 
 He's sure to know that you gave birth out of wedlock. 
 Stop it. Stop it. 
 What will you tell him? 
 You are an amazing talent. 
 Where did you get that ring? 
 Lizzie Borden. 
 What's going on between you and Charlie Siringo? 
 There's nothing going on between us. 
 I see the way you look at him. 
 [gunshot] 
 Ezekial : I can assure you Mr. Siringo is not looking back at you the same way you are looking at him. 
 [grunts] 
 Stop! 
 Aah! 
 Emma : "At our time of life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day. 
 But for your sakes, we would do anything." 
 "'Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I daresay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball. 
 'Oh!' said Lydia stoutly. 
 'I am not afraid. 
 For though I am the youngest, I am the tallest. 
 The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they would ask him for dinner." 
 Chapter three. 
 You know, Emma... 
 I really love this, but can this be enough for tonight? 
 Mr. Bingley's description is coming up. 
 I know what he looks like. 
 I suppose the adventures of the Bennet sisters will keep until tomorrow. 
 If I'm still here. 
 Would you like me to call Dr. Bowen back? 
 No, no, I'm fine. 
 I don't know why they couldn't delay the inquest a few days. 
 Oh. It'll be fine. 
 Don't worry. 
 After all you've been through, and you're comforting me.

 What's in the water? 
 What's that? 
 What makes you all so stupid? 
 [chuckles] 
 Say something about the Borden sisters now. 
 I dare ya. 
 [laughs] 
 Naw, I'll save it for the judge... 
 Judge ain't calling you. 
 What's that? 
 Yeah, I guess he did a little research. 
 Criminal... thief. 
 Liar. Betrayed your own compadres for a clean slate and, what, this job? 
 To make you look like some kind of Pinkerton hero? 
 Why don't you get your ass outta here and go get me Hilliard. 
 Who do you think gave the judge your history, huh? 
 No one wants to hear your bullshit. 
 [keys jangle] 
 You're certain... that Miss Borden was not the instigator here. 
 The aggressor, determined to quiet a woman who, as earlier testified by Miss Isabel Danforth, suspected that her missing brother had met some unknown misfortune at the hands of Lizzie Borden? 
 Well, I don't know what was in the mind of Miss Borden, but I can tell you what I saw in her eyes... 
 The need to survive. 
 And I'm not sure what drove the deceased to attempt murder, but she only failed by God's good grace. 
 A final question. 
 With the missing brother being a dope fiend, have you considered that the deceased might have been under some... narcotic influence? 
 Well, medical evidence showed no signs of current use. 
 But, given her presence at the Whale & Tar... 
 Her drinking... an act of violence committed against another patron there... 
 Well, that speaks to an afflicted mind of some sort. 
 [courtroom booing] [commotion] 
 Order! Order! 
 courtroom : Boo! 
 Order! 
 Final thoughts, sir. 
 If someone came at me the way I saw the deceased attack Miss Borden, I'd have no choice but to defend myself. 
 And that, sir, is not murder. 
 It's self-defense, plain and simple. 
 Thank you for your statement, Mr. Trotwood. 
 You are dismissed. 
 I have nothing further, Judge Franklin. 
 As the coroner of Bristol County, I have presented any and all information and witness testimony related to the death of Miss O'Keefe. 
 Judge Franklin : And the court thanks you. 
 That she is dead is quite evident. 
 It is now up to me to determine the manner of said death. 
 I have duly heard all of the testimony, and I can find no compelling evidence to dispute the conclusion that Miss O'Keefe's death, while tragic, was the result of self-defense on the part of Miss Borden. 
 [commotion] [judge banging gavel] 
 Order, order! 
 Further... finding that Miss Borden acted wholly in self-defense, she is free to go. 
 [commotion, shouting] 
 man : She's a murderer! 
 [overlapping shouting] 
 Let's not linger, hmm? 
 Oh! Let's have lunch at the Danforth. 
 I'm famished. 
 Oh, wonderful idea. 
 Would you just excuse me for a moment? 
 Oh, of course. Will you give him my thanks? 
 Of course. 
 Officer Trotwood. 
 Leslie. 
 Thank you for speaking on my sister's behalf. 
 I was just doing what's right. 
 And, um... 
 You're still firm in your position? 
 It's for the best. 
 How can you say that? 
 Leslie, there are things in my past Which forbid me...  
 Emma, I'm no angel. 
 At the risk of frightening you, I'll just assure you that my transgressions are much worse. 
 Let's not compare sins. 
 I love you. 
 I love you. 
 I said it, and I mean it. 
 Do you? 
 Do you love me, Emma? 
 Maybe I can help clarify your position. 
 Emma Borden, will you marry me? 
 Yes. 
 [laughs] Yes? 
 [laughs] Yes! 
 [giggles] 
 I'm gonna take such good care of you. 
 You've made me the happiest man in the world. 
 This is what kept Siringo out of the witness box. 
 The judge gave it to you? 
 Got it from Hilliard. Thought we should know what you might be up against. 
 Hmm. 
 Charles Siringo was born in Texas in 1855. 
 Average boy who, at 15, went off to be a cowboy. 
 Very good with a gun, apparently. 
 When he got tired of shooting cattle rustlers, he joined the Pinkertons to shoot more challenging game. 
 Pat Garrett got him his job. 
 Who is that? 
 Mr. Garrett killed Billy the Kid. 
 Oh. How many men has Siringo killed? 
 Oh, quite a few. 
 Uh, as a Pinkerton he's known for, as it says here, going undercover... blending in with the rough trade that he pursued. 
 If they cheated, so did he. 
 If they killed, he did too. 
 Well, he had to fit in. 
 Well, he rode with Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, worked undercover with Butch Cassidy. 
 This last case, he brought in the head of the, uh, the poor outlaw that he killed. 
 Oh, my! 
 Yeah. The dead man had been a friend. 
 He beheaded him after he murdered him for money. 
 He's lethal, dangerous, and unpredictable. 
 His Pinkerton badge makes him untouchable. 
 Something on your mind? 
 Your testimony wouldn't have helped. 
 Not in this town. 
 I need to keep you quiet. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 I don't want her knowing what we know. 
 We? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You know there's quite a bit more. 
 Story's grown some. 
 [keys clattering] 
 [clank] 
 So has my desire to nail that bitch to the goddamn wall. 
 Marshal. 
 Emma. 
 [breathless] 
 What happened? 
 [soft piano in background] 
 I'm... I'm sorry, I don't... I don't believe it. 
 What? 
 Leslie proposed. 
 He didn't. 
 He did. 
 That's wonderful news! 
 I know. 
 You accepted, of course. 
 I did. 
 [laughs] 
 You look so happy. 
 I am. I don't... 
 I don't think I've ever been so happy. 
 Though I... 
 I do hate the idea of leaving you alone. 
 Why would you... 
 Leslie and I will need our own place to live. 
 Yes. Of course! 
 Perhaps you can move to one of the other properties. 
 What properties? 
 On the Borden Estate. 
 Once we get rid of the neighbors, you could choose any one of the empty houses. 
 Wouldn't that be incredible? 
 [laughs] 
 It's too much to hope for. 
 Now, I'll need you to tell me everything you can about our Mr. Trotwood.

 [Siringo speaking indistinctly] 
 Hilliard : You think Cavanaugh died here? 
 Siringo : Early Monday morning, and I think the girl witnessed it. 
 Adele. When did Flowers show up? 
 Wednesday, the day of the party. 
 Adele and Flowers died that night. 
 Skipjack's the son of a bitch we oughta be talking to. 
 Other than Lizzie, he's the last person to see Nance O'Keefe alive. 
 They'll know where to find him at the Whale & Tar. 
 Ah, it's too noisy. 
 If he knows we're coming, he might run. 
 Phipps'll know where to find him... they hang out together Who's Phipps? 
 Fall River's local pornographer. 
 Mr. Phipps : Now... try to appear as if you're enjoyin' yourself, all right? 
 Now... let's have you lower your top a little, show a little rosebud. 
 Little lower. 
 Come on, now, love. 
 Lower, now. Think lurid thoughts. 
 Are you Phipps? 
 Madame, I am working here. 
 You can't just barge in. 
 I'm looking for Skipjack. 
 Who? 
 The bartender at the Whale & Tar told me I could find him here. 
 I oughta break that man's neck. 
 We need to talk. 
 Thought you might. Get out. 
 Take her with you. 
 Hilliard and Siringo are on their way here for you. 
 They think you have information about Spencer. 
 Siringo. He's dead. 
 No. He is not. 
 So what... you here to kill me? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 'Cause Phipps and the girl will testify to you being here. 
 Stop. 
 Tell me where you buried the body. 
 Why would I do that? 
 So I can get rid of it and save both our lives. 
 That sound like a good idea to you? 
 How much to keep me quiet? 
 What? 
 That's them on the stairs, maybe. 
 [footsteps approach] 
 Hilliard : No, he hangs out here. Come on. 
 Go up the stairs. 
 Okay.

 We're both in this.

 Indeed. And, please, call me Leslie.

 All right, then, Lizzie. I hope we have your blessing. 
 Of course! When is the happy day?

 I was hoping to keep it smaller, but...

 Dear Lord, man doesn't have butter for his bread. 
 Ah, no... 
 [whispers] Hello, Mr. Phipps. 
 [whispers] Jesus, Mary and Joseph! 
 I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 It's just that my sister will be marrying soon, and I wanted to know if you photographed weddings in addition to naked ladies and the occasional corpse. 
 What do you want? 
 I want to know if you photograph weddings. 
 I do. 
 And your rates? 
 Reasonable. 
 Oh. Because you make so much money doing other things... 
 Things that your wife knows nothing about. 
 If you're worried about that, I won't be tellin' anyone. 
 Oh, ha. I know. 
 But after tonight, it won't matter anyway. 
 Why's that? 
 Because you and I are going to make this disappear. 
 Now, without telling your dear wife... take your equipment and follow me. 
 Wha... I can't just leave. 
 Of course you can. 
 Wh...

 You took the picture. You tell me.

 Judge Franklin : This is Skipjack we're talking about. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Mr. Flowers' factotum. 
 The man responsible for the Wickham fire and all those dead horses. 
 That was never proved. 
 Didn't need to be. 
 Now, why the hell would I give that man a full pardon... from all future prosecutions? 
 Just prosecutions stemming from this current investigation. 
 Who are you investigating? 
 Lizzie Borden. 
 She was acquitted. 
 No, no, new crimes. Spencer Cavanaugh, Nance O'Keefe, William Almy. 
 Her brother. 
 Wait a second. 
 Judge Franklin, she staged the suicides. 
 Her brother never killed Almy. 
 Why would she do that? 
 Well, Almy was trying to break her. 
 And we need proof. 
 And he can help us with that. 
 For a price. 
 Original case files don't have the lock that Skipjack can provide. 
 Do they? 
 You've seen the evidence files? 
 How did that happen? 
 Well, he... 
 Did you just let him walk in and see them? 
 No, sir. 
 Where are those files now? 
 Those files are state property! 
 Where the hell are they? 
 They're in my room at the Danforth, and he had nothing to do with this. 
 Who the hell do you think you are? 
 You present those files to me intact in the next five minutes, or I will kick your ass all the way to Charleston Prison myself! 
 Excuse me. 
 Sorry, I...

 No.

 Huh? How many times?

 How many times did you hit her? 
 Three. 
 Three? 
 Three! 
 Isabel. 
 Yeah? One more. 
 Get up. 
 Unh! 
 You touch her again, I'll kill you... I'll kill you! 
 Mr. Phipps. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 I'm curious. 
 What about, ma'am? 
 About your sideline, your dirty pictures. 
 There is an art in the scandalous, you know. 
 Oh, I know. I do, believe me. 
 But I'm curious as to what you think your wife's reaction would be should she find out about your art. 
 Would she leave you? 
 She loves me. 
 But does she love the pornographer too? 
 Oh... she's a good woman then. 
 The best. 
 Well, maybe she'd forgive you. 
 I'm sure I can only hope. 
 Well, what do you believe, in your heart of hearts? 
 If she found out your most... awful secret, would she stay? 
 I believe she would. She would stay. 
 Why? 
 Love. We're a family. 
 We're all that we have. 
 Of course. 
 What else is there? 
 Now, where is our chilly friend? 
 [Lizzie laughs] 
 Oh... he looks terrible. 
 Well, I'll be goin' now. 
 I'll need help getting him out. 
 Getting him out? Miss Borden, I really must go. 
 Listen, you have secrets. So do I. 
 Two can work faster than one. 
 Work, Miss Borden? Work at what? 
 Covering our tracks. 
 Now, come on. 
 This can be fun. 
 Not everything has to be so doom and gloom, does it? 
 No. Don't suppose it does. 
 What would you have me do? 
 Hand me that saw. 
 You can read, right? 
 He almost blinded me. Give me a second. 
 You got ten seconds. 
 Start reading. 
 Nothing here about my protection from her. 
 This'll do. 
 Not if you're dead first. 
 You have to kill her. 
 We can't deliver until you do, so... 
 This... stays with me. 
 Fine. 
 You wanna see him? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 You... get up! 
 It's a nice place for an ambush. 
 You think somebody's waitin' for us? 
 They might be. 
 Be careful. 
 That bitch might be here waiting to cut your throat. 
 Things go bad, I'm killing you first. 
 Let's go! 
 Skipjack : Stop! 
 [whispers] Oh, no... no! 
 [breathing hard] 
 Where is he? 
 I didn't... 
 I didn't do this! 
 I didn't do this! 
 Do what? 
 He's gone. He should be right here. 
 Well, he's not now, goddamn it. 
 I know that. He's gone... I don't know... 
 Oh! 
 Hey, hey! 
 Who else did you tell! 
 I don't know! 
 Did she know Where you put him? 
 I wouldn't tell her anything! 
 You lying to me? You lying to me? 
 Who else knew where Cavanaugh was? 
 No one! It's just... just me!

 What? 
 What? 
 Ha ha ha... sh1t! 
 That son of a bitch! [laughing] 
 He... I hid him here. 
 Phipps! Ha ha!

 Hey, hey. 
 Put your hat on. Let's go. 
 Let's go. Put your hat on! 
 All right. 
 Ahh! 
 Come here. 
 Mmm! 
 Now... is there anything else... or can I go home now? 
 Of course you can go home. 
 We just need to discuss our arrangement. 
 What arrangement is that? 
 Please don't make me shout. Come here. 
 That's better. 
 Now, I need to know exactly who else besides you, me, and Skipjack, know about Mr. Cavanaugh's demise and cold storage. 
 No one. 
 No employees of the ice house? 
 No, of course not. 
 And you didn't tell any of your scantily-clad ladies, perhaps to impress them? 
 Is that thinking or admitting? 
 No, I haven't told anyone and I won't tell anyone. 
 Thank you. This is our secret. 
 Of course. 
 To the grave. 
 Have I made myself clear? 
 I have a wife and children. 
 I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize their safety or their future. 
 I think it's a little late for that.

 Hell, probably. I'm sure she did for him just like she's gonna do for you bastards. 
 What's his connection?

 Now.

 I can't. On what charge? 
 She's probably chopping up Cavanaugh as we speak, Marshal. 
 [laughing] You dumb sons of bitches. 
 Shut up! 
 You can't do that. 
 I got paper. 
 I don't give a sh1t about any paper. 
 I'm a Pinkerton man. 
 Siringo. 
 Step back or you're gonna get splashed. 
 You gonna let him do this? 
 We asked you a question. 
 If you had to get rid of a body real fast, how would you do it? 
 I don't know where she took him. 
 How would you do it? 
 I... I'd sink him in the bottom of the bay. 
 I don't know. 
 Siringo! 
 You want this to end with a murder charge?
