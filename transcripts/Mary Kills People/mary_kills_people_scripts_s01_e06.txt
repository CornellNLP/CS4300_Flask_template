 What is this really about? 
 Well, we're just trying to clarify the circumstances of your husband's death. 
 Troy had cancer. He died. 
 Seems pretty clear to me. 
 Your client is a primary suspect in a murder investigation. 
 Define "cooperate." 
 He wears a wire. 
 [dramatic music] 
 I think it's really unprofessional of you to come to a counseling session high. 
 Don't go. Please. 
 [shuddering] 
 I can't trust you anymore. 
 I guess I'd say that. 
 Is this your mom's? 
 The best thing to do when your mom's a drug dealer is to just pretend it's not happening. 
 The first time I did this, I was 16, with my mother. 
 Your mother didn't die of cancer, did she? 
 I really thought I knew you. 
 Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound to the upper thigh. 
 Did you have anything to do with that guy's disappearance? 
 Yes. 
 I'll take him from here. 
 Come on, Grady. 
 It's too late. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gasps] 
 [phone ringing] 
 [phone buzzing] 
 Oh, God. 
 Ugh! 
 Poor Sid. 
 We are going to get caught, and I cannot get caught. 
 ♪ 
 Remember yesterday, when I told you to leave I want answers about my son. What he needed was someone to say, "Keep fighting." Instead, he found someone that said, "You can give up." Well, look who it is, the Angel of Death. I want a new partner. ♪ Do you think our past dictates our future? Everything that's happened in our lives That would be the past dictating the present, and no, I think we have more control than that. How much do people pay? $10,000. And Desmond? Des is out. He's an addict. I can't rely on him. I want to keep doing this, so I need a supplier and I need a partner. Why do you want me to be your partner? I've come to accept certain things about the work I do. It's dangerous. [laughs] I need protection, which I think you can provide. Mm-hmm. But it's up to you. Uncle Grady? Hey, monkey, what are you doing out of bed? I had a bad dream. Monsters again? Yeah. Hey, come here. [groans] I got ya. I got ya. It was really scary and they were chasing me. It's okay, baby. There's nothing wrong. Maya... I'd like you to meet my friend, Mary. Hi. Hi. You know what I do when I have a bad dream? I go right back to sleep, or else the monsters win. [ominous music] ♪ To our future. [bluesy rock music] ♪ Mary Kills People 01x05 
Morning Glory 
Original Air Date:  February 22, 2017 Dr. Jeffrey, to Admitting. Dr. Jeffrey, Admitting. Look, I said I was out. I know, I know. I respect your decision. This is for Morgan. He was your patient. He talk about medieval torture? In disturbing detail. [chuckles] Big weirdo. Well, see ya. Annie, wait. [groans] You just said you respected my decision. It's not about that. I have a favor to ask you. A favor for you is like the kiss of death. I need you to go to this address and babysit on this guy for the day, make sure he stays sober. Not interested. I'll pay you. Look, I know I'm an asshole. And I've been reckless... but everything I've done was to try to protect us. And I can fix this, but I need your help. Who is he? He's a friend. $50 an hour. You really will be a millionaire one day, Annie. I know. [tense music] [whistles] Hey, I bet this is one of them self-melting driveways. Yeah. I bet you should've been a football player. Yeah. [knocking at the door] Mrs. Dixon? What's going on? We have a warrant to search the premises. Thank you. Hi. Thank you for meeting me. I didn't know I had a choice. I want to take you somewhere. You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today. You know, like, I could have tests and stuff. Do you have a test today? No. Okay. Well, then, come on. [plucking at out-of-tune guitar] ♪ [pounding at the door] Come in! Christ. [door opening and closing] Did I order you? No. Mary did. She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean. Said you had somewhere to be later. I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view. Hello, Angel. It's Annie. And you look exactly like I thought you would. Dashing. Depraved. [groans] Okay, that's enough standing. Come on. Now, sit. Stay. Drink this. It's a protein shake. I don't want it. Drink it. Fine. God, you're so bossy. Force of habit. I'm a nurse. Wait, you're that Annie? [groans] I'm calling my lawyer. This is ridiculous. I already told you everything. Well, You didn't tell us that your husband withdrew $10,000 three days before his death. Yeah, that's right, we have access to his financial records as well. Maybe you do need to call your lawyer. You didn't tell us about this either. I did... I didn't do anything. You withheld information. I can only think of one reason why you'd do that. Because Troy had help ending his life. You were there. Yeah, well, I wasn't there. My husband needed me and I wasn't there. [sobs] A few weeks before he died, he came apart. He said he couldn't take it anymore. He wanted it to end. So he asked you to help him die. And instead of listening to what he wanted, I got angry. And we had this huge fight. I told him he was selfish. Why didn't you tell us about it? Because I realized that he'd found someone to help him do what he wanted, someone to help him die. And I was grateful. [phone buzzing] I'm sorry. It's the station. Excuse me. [sighs] Wesley. Prentice here. And Hull. Yeah? We found the body. Can you be more specific? Sid Thomas-Haye. Guy who escaped from the hospital. Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head. Okay, nice work. Not so nice for him, but could be good for you. We found his phone. A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call,  so we ran that number. Name came up as part of the Harris investigation. What's the name? Morgan Lewis. [ominous music] Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected? Sid had a charge for possession. Maybe he was Morgan's dealer. We got probable cause. Morgan, you home? Morgan? [ominous music] Frank, I got something. Yeah? What do you got? Car service receipt. Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night. Maybe he got drugs and a hooker. One last hurrah. I know that look. He went to meet Mary. All right, let's go check out the Larimar. ♪ [sighs] ♪ I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it. Okay, well, you did at one point. Mary would never force anyone into this. Why did you do it in the first place? I work in the ICU. I deal with the heaviest sh1t in the hospital... People at their worst, their most desperate. Before Mary, there was only so much I could do for them. Handing them that pamphlet, it gave them... Comfort. Yeah. Also I want a million dollars. Uh, what? I have financial goals. How much do you have so far? [laughs] Oh, come on, I'm not gonna rob you. It's too much work. Not enough. Enough for what? Freedom. So you're breaking the law for freedom? The law is wrong, and it will change. Until then, there's no reason that I shouldn't supplement my income. Then why stop? [ominous music] I have this vision. Me, Mary, and now you, all of us in the woods somewhere, like a camp. No, a retreat. A death retreat. People come from all over the world to experience the finest death possible, from the best of the best. ♪ Sounds kind of nice. Did you bring me here to stare at the lake? No, I brought you out here to understand why you're so angry with me. You know, you're at the age I was when my mother was really sick, right before she died. Before she killed herself? Yeah. It happened right there. I was 16. I was so angry. I remember feeling like everything was always about her, you know, she was so consumed with her own life, her own misery, and Jess, I don't want you to ever have to feel that way. I want you to know that you can come to me about anything whenever you want. Jess, I can tell you're in pain. What's going on? It's Naomi. What do you mean? We just have a complicated relationship. I love her. Like, I mean, like, I'm in love with her. Or I thought I was, I don't know. I thought she... She loved me too, but sh... Oh, honey. I'm sure she does love you in her own way. [scoffs] And if she doesn't, it's her loss. I mean, who could not love you? You're perfect. I am? Jess, you're perfect in every way. Why did you lie for her? What do you mean? Naomi took the drugs, you know, the drugs you had in your shed for Casper? She told me, she told me that you lied for her. Why would you do that? That wasn't a lie, that was doctor/patient confidentiality. She didn't... No, that's bullshit. A mom would tell another mom something like that. Just please tell me the truth. Okay. Okay, I was scared. I was scared if your dad and Louise found out that I had left that stuff lying around, I could lose you and Cambie. That could happen? Yes. That's why I didn't tell anyone. But Jess, I can, and I will if it would make your life easier. I thought you were lying because you were a drug dealer. [both laughing] Honey, I'm not a drug dealer. I know. [laughs] [sighs] That must have been really hard growing up without a mother. Like, with all your flaws still, I couldn't imagine life without you, so. Well, you don't have to. [tense music] Mr. Lewis did request a late check out, but... It's urgent. Since he's not answering the hotel phone, I can let you in. Uh, actually, we should probably go in alone. Yeah. Room 214. Thank you. ♪ [beeps] sh1t. What do you think? I think Mary finally figured out a way to kill Morgan. Holy sh1t. You got more and more beautiful since I last saw you. How do you do that? What is your secret? It's youth. And she's clever too. I haven't seen you forever. Mom, can I stay for a bit? Yeah, if it's okay with Nicole. [stuttering] I'm gonna put you to work if you're gonna stay, so get changed, and there's an extra pair of gloves by the door. Okay. Don't dig too deep, okay? Why? Is this where you're hiding all the bodies? Kind of. Remember when Mom had that problem with the morning glories? Yeah, she was obsessed. I mean, they're beautiful, but she said there was too much of them, too much beauty. Yeah. If you don't control them, they end up taking over the whole garden, strangling all the other plants. So you have two options. You can either pull them all out, start fresh, or you can ride the chaos. So which is it for you, Mary? [soft music] If anything ever happened to me, you'd take care of them, right? ♪ Normally I'm not usually happy to see to see a dead man but I'm happy, I really am. Finally got a body. Yeah. Well, if pento shows up in the autopsy, then it's over, right? She basically handed us the case. We rattled her with the wire, she slipped up. [phone buzzing] Frank Gaines. Mr. Bennett. How can I help you? Okay. Meet me at the station. Desmond Bennett wants to make a statement. Probably wants to make a deal. Can't wait to wipe that smug British grin off his face. Cool. I'll wait for forensics. Yeah? Yeah, and then I'll go arrest our girl. All right. [dramatic music] 
 
 My patients... Morgan Lewis, Ethan Grant, Troy Dixon. What's this? That's a video statement. Each patient has one. Is physical evidence really a good idea? We decided we needed an insurance policy. In case we ever got caught, we have a legal contract and statement that proves the patient gave consent. You think this is gonna hold up in court? I hope I never have to find out. How do we find our patients? They come to us. Well, we're gonna have to do something about that, maybe hire some death dealers. I'm not soliciting death. [laughs] You should be. What else? [chuckles] Now we practice injections. Hold your arm out. You're a funny girl. Relax, it's saline. I think you misunderstand the nature of our relationship here, Mary. I provide the supplies, you provide the service. If we're gonna be partners, we need to share the risk. Same deal I had with Des. So you need to know how to do this. I know how to do it. Properly. [snaps glove] Like a doctor. How about if I inject you? Whole purpose is for me to show you. You can talk me through it. [ominous music] First, you have to find a good vein. Press up and down gently. Mm-hmm. This will expand the vein and make it easier to see. Just like people. You apply enough pressure and they show what they really are. Now take the syringe. Insert the needle. Pull back slightly to show a bit of blood. That's good. You want a slow and steady release. Too fast, you'll send the body into shock. You always remember your first time, right? We should celebrate... our partnership. Want a drink? Can I use your bathroom? Yeah, just down the hall. [droning music] Let me get this straight. Your dealer is behind this whole thing. That's right. Grady Burgess. Because you owe him money. All of a sudden you had to get this off your chest, huh? To be honest, it wasn't really my idea. After yesterday, Mary found out that I was using again, and she hired a private nurse to come to my house and make sure I stayed clean. Nice friend. She demanded... [inhales sharply] That I come down here and I-I tell you the truth. And what is the truth, Desmond? [ominous music] [phone buzzing] Mary. Mary, I was just about to call you... I'm in trouble. What... what do you mean? [breathing heavily] Grady Burgess, Des's dealer. I came to see to him to tell him to leave Des alone. Help me, please. He drugged me. He's going to kill me. Okay, stay on the line, okay? Keep talking to me. Where are you? 1287 Monu-ment... Monument. Mary? Mary? sh1t. ♪ So you're saying Mary had...  nothing  to do with this. Mm-hmm, that's right. The truth is, I couldn't pay my drug debt because of the whole lost license ordeal. Grady knew about my work with the terminally ill. He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid. Go to Grady's house. You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital. [ominous music] You like scotch? I do. Here. [clinks glasses] Cheers. We're both healers, you and me. We help people end their suffering. Give them a moment of euphoria and take away their pain. I thought he just wanted to sell them pain relief, you know? Weed, morphine. I guess he saw an opportunity. To kill people? Must be an entrepreneurial genius. Well, if you think about it, he... he is. I mean, apparently, people are willing to pay top dollar for a good death. You know, it's true, what you said. You never forget your first injection. Mine was Yvonne. ALS. You know what that is? Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. You shouldn't underestimate me, Mary. Yet you didn't... you didn't think to mention any of this when we were in this very room together. Okay, you see, the way I saw it, I had two options. One was to tell the police... tell you that I'm a drug addict. Two, wear the wire, and I could prove that Mary and I are just ordinary end-of-life counselors. You lose all control, limb by limb, organ by organ... until you can't breathe. Is that where you come in? To take back control? Or else the monster wins. You said that was saline. It was. You're a smart man, Detective, smarter man than I. Why do you think you have nothing on us? Because there's nothing to be had When I killed Sid... I looked him in the eye and I told him that he was going to die. So just tell me the truth. You do realize that we can still charge you for accessory. Confessing won't change that. Oh, I'm prepared to accept whatever the punishment may be. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead. Tell me there was pento in the needle. There was. Watered down pento. [laughs] Hmm. I don't understand the game, Mary. The only crime that Mary's guilty of is trying to protect me. Save me, really. She can't help herself. It's just what she does. We're not the same, you and I. You sell drugs to addicts. You murdered Sid. You came after my daughter! You're not a healer. You create pain. [tense music] ♪ I don't like games, Mary. Police! Put the weapon down! [groaning] [sighs] Mary, you okay? [groaning] Mary? I need something to stop the bleeding. Here. [groaning] You okay? I'll call the ambulance, okay? [whispering] Mary. [wheezing] Yeah, hey, this is Detective Ben Wesley. [whispering] Help me. Help me. I need an ambulance to 1287 Monument Drive. Yeah, male, 40s, gunshot wound to the chest. [whispering] Help me. Help me. Help me. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. [groaning] [long, slow breath] And then he pinned me down and shot me with pento. And I really thought, "This is it." And it's true, you know, that cliché? Your life really does flash before your eyes. And then you were there. Uh, look, we can take it from here. We'll get the results back shortly. Okay. I'm glad you're okay. Am I okay, Ben? Ma'am. I'm here to take you home. Yeah, wait, you sure you don't need to go to a hospital? I'm sure. I'm a doctor, remember? Yeah. [sighs] Grady's gun is a 9-mil, same as the bullet we found in Sid Thomas-Haye. Yeah, we're gonna have ballistics compare. Okay, good. I think we just solved a murder. [sighs] [ominous music] The sun is in our eyes and in our hearts even when it's night and when it's dark. The moon still glows, the stars still shine, Now and forever until the end of time. What do you think? I think you need to dig deeper. What does that mean? I can't tell you that. It's just, like, part of the journey. You look pretty, Mama. Thank you, baby. I'm gonna go get my notebook, okay? I wrote more poems. That's great. So, keep an eye on Jess and Naomi, shut down any fist fights, and... Yeah, I shouldn't be too late. So are you still in business? As a doctor, I remain a member of society with a special obligation to all of my fellow human beings. I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation. What do you mean? I want in. We could be partners. I already have a partner. Well, then I'll be your receptionist. [laughs] It doesn't work like that. Mary, I need a career change, and we'd make a great team. Let's talk about this later, shall we? You need me. I love you. [laughing] I love you. Hey, where are you going, anyway? A funeral. Think it's good for him to watch that video. I mean, it's... worth more than a conviction, right? Grady Burgess had the patients' videos, the files, the pento, the whole operation. We have enough evidence to close off all three cases. We seized $1.2 million in drugs from Burgess's place. [scoffs] Thought the chief was gonna plant a big wet one on me. Yeah, hopefully got Des on the accessory charge, so that's good. Eh, if it all works out. You know, put his ass in jail for a while. Although his lawyer did request our files. As for Mary, she'll be crazy to counsel anyone ever again. Yeah. Yeah, she would be crazy. [ominous music] ♪ I don't know if anyone's ever gonna see this, but I, Ethan Grant, choose to take my life. Can I say more? Can I say why? I want my family to know, there's nothing that I would've done differently, so please, forget about the trials... and the treatments and... And that one more year that I didn't get. Just... just know that... That I love you all. I have no regrets. [sighs] [sad music] Are you ever gonna talk to me again? Talking to you right now. I didn't mean to start a fight with you, Jess. I didn't mean for any of it. I just thought we were... experimenting, or whatever. I guess it started that way, but... I thought it was more than that. Well, it... wasn't... for me. And that maybe sounds bitchy or something, but I'm just being honest. [sighs] Well, I honestly think that you're a train wreck. [sighs] Hi. Hey. You look nice. Thank you. I'm glad you called. Yeah. Um, I called to give you... this. [soft music] ♪ Found it... Grady's, yeah. He asked me to take my shirt off to see if I was wearing a wire, and the mouse ears, I don't know. You don't have to do that anymore. Case is closed. Okay, so how does it work, the dying part? Well, in Switzerland, a doctor would give a patient such as yourself a lethal dose... Oh, my God. Of sodium pentobarbital with a drink. There is no pain, no suffering, you just fall asleep. An option is to go to Switzerland and be what they call a death tourist, and fly... So? Did you ever find out if your mom was a drug dealer? Oh, yeah, she's like a kingpin. She has a whole empire. [both laughing] You're such an idiot. [cat meows] Hey. Who's cat is that? [cat meows] It's Casper. I gotta go out of town, for another job. How long will you be gone? Maybe a few months. And who will you be this time? Hard to say. You love it, don't you? What? The thrill of a new case. [dramatic music] I'll see you around. Don't fall for your target. What are you watching? Ooh. p0rn? No, it's just something for this case. Mm. I'll get it out of you. [chuckles] Right. [people chattering and laughing] [both laughing] Oh! You're late. Yeah, I had to meet someone first. Mm-hmm. Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun? Keep your enemies close. Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close. Duly and diligently. Hey. I'm glad you guys could make it. Wouldn't miss it. Morgan was one of our favorite clients. Yeah. You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died. Yeah, we heard that. Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know? Oh, he wasn't alone. Well, no man is an island. We are all... connected. Right. This should be a good show. Yeah, it's just like Morgan, going out with style. S-s-so, Annie was a doll. ♪ [woman singing "In My Time of Dying"] ♪ Glad you two had fun. We had some interesting conversations. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm, about the business model. What we've been doing right, wrong, how to expand, where to get more pento.
