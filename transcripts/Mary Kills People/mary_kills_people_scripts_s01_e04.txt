 Morgan Lewis. Cystic Fibrosis. 
 He's ready. 
 You collapsed during your performance. 
 Did you take anything? 
 That stuff that was in your shed. 
 Is this your mom's? 
 I just think we should put it back. 
 I do know  that my mom is crazy, and she is a lawyer. 
 Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound to the upper thigh. 
 You came by Grady's place last week, mouse ears. 
 I need you to get Sid out. 
 That's not my problem. 
 I think you're gonna do what I'm asking you, Mary. 
 I'll take him from here. 
 Two drug convictions plus a weapons charge, that equals you making a deal with the police. 
 Come on, Grady. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gasps] 
 How I ended up risking my job, my life, my kid to help a psycho drug dealer murder someone right in front of me, and the only thing I could think of is you. 
 This is my number. 
 If you need anything at all, you just... you call, all right? 
 Why'd you ask me here, Mary? 
 Why did you come? 
 [dramatic music] 
 Hey. 
 I thought you'd left. 
 Uh, I did. 
 Got coffee. 
 I didn't know how you took it, so I guessed black. 
 Black is right. 
 I know I called you last night, but I shouldn't have. 
 That's okay. I get it. 
 Yeah, I get it, you know, uh, harsh light of day and all. 
 I just thought, I don't know, we could hang out and talk. 
 I kind of get the feeling that you need someone to talk to. 
 I can't. 
 Are you working? 
 Yep. 
 [sighs] Yeah, me too. 
 [dramatic music] 
 ♪ ♪ Yeah, I kind of get the feeling you're always working. ♪ ♪ [radio chatter] The good news or the bad news? Uh, bad news. We're out of muffins. Damn it. The good news? Good news: Troy Dixon was diagnosed with depression a few months before his death. Based on this and the parallel to the Ethan Grant case, I got approval for a wire. I'm gonna crack this Desmond Bennett. Frank, Mary called me last night. [chuckles] Tell me you did not have s*x with this woman again. I can get her to confess. Yeah? Is there truth serum in your dick? You're a God damn liability, man. Come on, man, she called me because she was alone. She was afraid, and for some reason, I don't know, I make her feel safe. I will get her to talk. Do your damn job. Get a confession. [tense music] [bluesy rock music] Mary Kills People - 01x04 Raised By Wolves Original Air Date: February 15, 2017 What are you doing here? I love this view. Why are you here? Did you know that the penalty for dealing pento is the most severe in the legal system? More than heroin. When Des came and asked if I could get him some pento, I thought, "That's odd." You know, it's not a drug people often use recreationally, but drug choice is subjective, and who am I to judge? But then one day, you showed up at my door, and you were asking for pento. You, Dr. Mary Harris. Remember yesterday, when I told you to leave me and my family alone? I meant it. Ooh. [laughs] And what is pento used for? It's used for capital punishment, euthanasia. Death. It's used for killing people. So here's what I think. I don't think Des is using pento. In fact, I think he's probably sober. He looks fantastic. But I think you and Des have a little side business, where you're sending people off into the long good-night. Grady, you really need to stop messing with me. Why? Because it's making me want to kill you. [laughs] I don't think I've met anyone like you in my life, Mary. I mean, you seem so straight, this perfect little doctor with an nice house and pretty little daughters, but I see you, man, you are right there on the edge. Yeah, I am. I mean, I like what you're doing, it's good. It's a little dark, but I'm into it. I want a cut. 'Cause that's the way I work. So the next time you come to me to buy pento, you be prepared to negotiate. Mary. [ominous music] [phone dialing] Hey, this is Jess. Text me, it's faster. [beep] Hey, Jess, it's me. You're not answering your phone. Maybe you're still mad at me. I just wanted to see... make sure you're okay. If we're okay. Call me back, all right? Love you. [dramatic music] [intercom beeping] Ah! Oh. [radio chatter] Your shoes, dear. You need a new pair. You're on your feet all day. I know. Good shoes pay for themselves. Well, my money's tied up at the moment. Annie? When you're done, come and see me in the boardroom. The boardroom? Why so official? It's confidential. Am I getting a raise? No. Uh-oh. [tense music] Hey. It's, uh, Detective Wesley. I need you to do a local check for me, okay? It's north of the city. 876 Bridgton Road. [gunshot] Call me back with it, okay? [gunshot echoes] [suspenseful music] You know you're aiming for the can, right? Well, then, show men. You just have to be one with the gun. It's an extension of you. Just... just be the gun. Mary. What are you doing here? Who is this? Who are you? Is that gun registered? What are you, a cop? Ben, Nicole. Nicole, Ben. My sister. My... stalker. Yep, he's a cop. Mary, Mary. What have you gotten yourself into? You realize you're trespassing, right? Yeah, I do. So why are you following me? We said good-bye, decided this was a mistake, remember? I remember, I just... don't really care. What's with the gun? It's a new hobby. Are you in some kind of danger? All right, listen. The hardest thing about shooting a weapon is controlling your subconscious. So just relax. Okay? Breathe. Aim. When you're ready, slow and steady, pull the trigger. Am I making lunch for two or three? Three. [soft music] [grunts] [heavy breathing] That's a '63 Vintage Telecaster. You play? Always wanted to, but I never found the time. Yeah, time is funny that way, huh? There's either too little or way too much. [bluesy strumming] That's nice. What is it? "In My Time of Dying." [chuckles] [strums] So... You're a progressive end-of-life counselor, huh? Yeah. We like to think of ourselves as a... an alternative to palliative care. [coughing] Your, uh, your file says that you were diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when you were two? [coughs] Yeah. I was born sick. Born broken. Wasn't supposed to make it this far. You're 33, right? You've already beat the odds. Hmm. You ever consider a lung transplant? Was at the top of the list two months ago. Doctor said I was too sick. I wouldn't survive the surgery. Yeah. I'm sorry. I've had a good run. Live fast, die young, you know? I mean, don't get me wrong, um, I mean living's great. [inhales deeply] I'm just ready. Okay. [exhales] Okay. [sighs] I'm gonna have to talk to my colleague. We'll figure out a time. We will help you. Thanks, man. [quiet sobs] Where is your colleague? I thought she'd be here. Uh, she's busy today. Actually...[chuckles], we had a fight. I'm sorry. I'm sure she'll be here for the main event. Oh. You should apologize. Take it from a dying man. Sometimes friends are the only things that keep you going. Thanks. [soft music] In all my years working in hospitals, I've never had to deal with [bleep] like this. Excuse my language. What's going on? We need to talk about Sid Thomas-Haye, the patient who disappeared yesterday. I don't know anything about that. Well, we're working alongside the police, who are idiots, doing an internal investigation. So I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Sure. Ask away. Sid was transferred from the ER to ICU, correct? Correct. And the transfer was requested by Dr. Mary Harris? Yeah. But his injuries weren't life-threatening. So why did Dr. Harris transfer him to intensive care? I don't know. I'm a nurse. I do what I'm told. I take instruction. You don't think that request was just a little unusual? I really couldn't say. I barely know Dr. Harris. [phone dialing] You've reached Dr. Mary Harris. Leave a message. [beep] So I met with Morgan. Nice guy. Musician. He wants to wave the white flag. So he gave me his guitar, a Tele-something or other, as a deposit. Anyway, I thought I'd call, see when you're available. [dramatic music] You know what I was thinking about? About how when two bucks fight... or anything with antlers, really... you know, sometimes they get their antlers locked together. And they can't unlock them, and they can't live like that, so they both just die. Locked together. I don't know, point being, if they lock antlers, they both go down. [siren wailing] [clearing throat] [chuckles] You got me, Officer. I was talking on the phone. Old habits die hard. Desmond Bennett. Do I know you? I'm Detective Frank Gaines. Oh, is there a problem, Detective Frank Gaines? I'm going to need you to come with me to the station. For talking on the phone? Please, step out of the car. Come on. Let's go. No, thanks. I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on it. What's going on? I'll explain on the way. Am I under arrest? If it'd make it easier for you, I can do that. [sighs] No. No, this is bullshit. This is harassment. I'm not going anywhere with you. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Tried to do this the nice way, but, we can do it the hard way. Here you go, mate. [sighs] Mm. It's fabulous. Gourmet. You a football fan? And I don't mean that English "Footy" bullshit. I mean pigskin, cheerleader, pompon football. Troy Dixon football. Yeah, yeah, we know about Troy. Listen, look, I understand. You want to help people, you know, end their pain and suffering. I went through it with my grandpappy. Yeah his death dragged on and on. I remember thinking, "I wish..." "I wish there was something, someone to help him." Oh. I am so sorry for your loss. Come on, Des. You and Mary, your business. Mary and I sometimes volunteer with people that are dying. We talk to them. That's all. Like how you talked to my friend Joel? Is conversation against the law? Hmm. You know, Mary was with my partner last night. Yeah, yeah, she called him all messed up about something. Just think you should know, because I think you should know the truth, Des. My partner, Ben... that's his real name... he's one of the best UC guys out there. He can crack anyone. Mm, by sleeping with them. If it helps, yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm saying, how do you know that Mary isn't bearing her pretty little soul to him right now? You should talk to me. I'm only trying to help you. Okay. Okay, I have a question. Shoot. Do you even need a high school education to be a cop, or do they let just anybody join? [laughing] [both laughing] Gonna be telling jokes when you're on trial for murder? Well, I mean, trials could use more humor, right? I'd like a lawyer. Mary, what's going on? You only show up here when something's wrong. That's not true. You want to learn how to shoot a gun. You have a cop following you? Tell me. There's nothing to tell. Bitch, please. I know when you're lying. You taught me how to lie, remember? Okay, but you have to promise to stay cool, all right? I was born cool. You were there. I started providing a service for people. People who want to die. And I help them. I'm sorry, what? I kill people. How? There's a drug. It's fatal. Mary... I know. I know. But these people need me, okay? No one else will help them. I'm a doctor, and it's medicine. Is he investigating you? Yeah. My God. This is bad. I mean, you could go to jail. What about Jess and Cambie? Nicole, you said you would stay cool. What are you gonna do? [suspenseful music] I was thinking maybe we could go for a walk. Yeah. Sounds good. ♪ ♪ 
 
 Okay, turn it. Ah! I'm gonna kill myself from boredom. Okay, we need to plan an escape. Dad, can we go to the beach, please? Beach? What are you talking about? You're learning fundamental skills here. Yes, measure twice, cut once. I really have it for life. I promise. Uh, that's not reno-attire. I know. I got called into work. Oh, my God, this is so unfair. You guys are making us be child slaves on this beautiful summer day. All right, we are young, and we are restless. And dramatic. Yeah. No kidding. Look, we're pretty much done here, so, um, can, uh, you drop the girls off at the beach? Yes. Let's go. So that's the house you and your sister grew up in? Yeah. With your parents? Didn't I tell you we were raised by wolves? Ah, so that's why you're so guarded. We lived there with my mother. She passed away when I was 16. Cancer. And Dad left long before. How about your parents? Uh, Janet and Gil Wesley, they are retired, and they live in Florida. You ever been to Florida? No. No. Maybe we could go someday. Can I ask you something? Yeah, why not? How many people have you helped? I don't know what you mean. Okay, let me put it this way: how many people have you killed? How many people have you killed? Two. Two's a lot. Mm-hmm. Self-defense? Yeah. One of them wasn't, though. Uh, this undercover operation, I got pretty close to this suspect, I got close to his family, and then he killed himself. Why do you count that? Because I became his friend, and then I sent him to jail, and that's where it happened. Many ways to kill a man. You didn't kill him. You couldn't save him either. It was his choice. Mm-hmm. Ethan Grant? Did he have a choice? I don't know who that is. Well, Ethan Grant is the son of Lucas Grant. Judge Lucas Grant. And he believes his son was murdered. You know, Ethan, he had this journal. I mean, he didn't name names, but he wrote about this doctor and this nurse who were helping him out, and that's why I went undercover. [laughs] The thing is, Mary, I mean, there's no case, 'cause you're smart. You're good. But then, uh, we came across Troy Dixon. And then this all got very real. You shouldn't be telling me this. No, I shouldn't. I shouldn't be telling you this, I shouldn't have seen you last night, I shouldn't be here right now. Well, maybe you're here because you don't think there should be a case. [phone buzzing] I'll let you get that. [phone buzzing] Yeah. Hey. Did a search for you on that address, 876 Bridgton Road? Yeah, all right, thanks. I already know who lives there. Yeah? Nicole Mitchell? Mitchell, not... not Harris? No, definitely Mitchell. Okay, can you do a search for any records on Mary Mitchell? Sure thing. I'll call if I find anything. Yeah, is... is Frank around? He has your boy Desmond Bennett in the interrogation room. Okay, all right, um, get him to give me a call when he's out, okay? I know all about you, Des. Mm-hmm. Big shot plastic surgeon, lost your license because you were operating while you were high. I mean...[laughing]. It's hilarious, I mean, that's... That's pretty funny, right? Yeah, yeah. You make a living putting double-D's in 20-year-olds, and you can't even get that right. Mm. Ha! I mean, come on. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Mary, I believe she wants to help people. I do, I do, but you? Nah. Not that deep. You lost your job, and you found out what Mary was doing, and you saw an opportunity. I mean, that's all these people are to you. A steady stream of income. How pathetic. Wow. Staggering. You... you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Oh, so... so you care? [laughs] You're God damn right that I care. You know, these people are... Are in pain. And suffering. And scared. They're going through something that most people are too afraid to even mention, much less face. They... they need someone that... that they can talk to! They need someone... Yeah? What do they need? Help. And you help them, don't you, Des? You help them. [buzzer blaring] Gentlemen. This interrogation is over. So, on what grounds are you holding Mr. Bennett Nice shoes. Yes, they are. Too bad they don't come in your size. Oh, I like you. Don't talk. Okay. No, unless you want to charge Mr. Bennett, and I don't think you do, because then I would have to go into the whole SIU investigation into your conduct last year. That kid who almost died in your custody? You didn't have grounds to hold him either, did you? Or you can do whatever you like, and I'll apply for a habeas corpus. Fine. But before you start filling his head with crazy ideas, I have an offer. Your client is a primary suspect in a murder investigation. He doesn't have to be if he cooperates. Define "Cooperate." He wears a wire. Gathers evidence against his partner. We offer him immunity. Offer dies at midnight. Hmm. We will get back to you. Do. Door? [buzzer blares] Mr. Bennett? Of course. I'll just... leave. [suspenseful music] Ladies. Hey. I didn't know you'd be here, Tristan. Yeah. Naomi texted me. Oh, jeez! Oh! Said you guys needed to escape from reno-jail? So, your mom is dating your dad, right? Yeah, they're all in love and sh1t. So you guys are pretty much sisters now, huh? We... we're not like sisters, no. Hey, look, this is that stuff I was telling you about. Let me see it. What are you doing with that? It's okay... I took too much the first time. Yeah, yeah, you ended up in the hospital. I looked it up, okay? And apparently, if you only take a little bit, there's a euphoria. Oh, my... what the hell, Jess? What is your problem? You have a death wish. I'm over it, okay? I'm so over it! You good? Are you cool? Mm-hmm. Thank you. So. You're the best criminal lawyer in the city. Yeah, some people think so. Why? Well, because that's what I told Richard I wanted. Yes, he told me that he represented you in your malpractice suit. Which I lost. And now, you're being investigated for murder. Mm-hmm. I'm having a very litigious year. [laughs] You know, this is such bullshit, you know? They should be focusing on real murderers... I'm gonna stop you right there. I only want to know what I need to know. I'm gonna ask you some questions, and I'm gonna give you some options. All right? Mm-hmm. So the cops are investigating you and your partner for murder. Assisted suicide. That depends on how you look at it. Now, hypothetically speaking, if there was any validity to their claims, and you were out there helping people die, you're doing this what, out of the goodness of your heart? Mm-hmm. That, and a... one-time fee of $10,000. That complicates things. Are these people terminally ill? Yeah. Well, a few could be debated, which is the nature of the problem. Which brings us back to our immunity offer. Would you consider wearing a wire on your partner? I don't think I could do that. Do you think your partner would say the same? In my experience, an offer like this goes to the most willing party. So, you have until midnight to decide whether that's going to be you or him. So, how was your walk? Wow, it was that good, huh? What do you do, Nicole? Oh, I make people beautiful. Hair, esthetics. I have a salon in the house, pays the bills. Kind of. So how did you two meet, anyway? It's a long story. I have time. Well, your sister was actually my doctor. A doctor-patient relationship? That's very unethical. Yeah, it is. Mm-hmm. Very unethical. What was wrong with you, Ben? I had cancer. You had cancer? Mm-hmm. And it was really bad. I thought he was gonna die. It was awful. Then he got better. Yeah. And then you fell in love. [phone buzzing] Uh, I got to take this. Excuse me. Just one second. Mary Mitchell, now known as Mary Harris. She changed her name at 18. Was investigated for the murder of her mother. No, her mother died of cancer. Ben, her mother was found dead in Chalk Lake with her hands tied together. He likes you, and you like him. And you, like, really like him. He's okay. I think you should tell him the truth. Why? Because he cares about you, and maybe he can help. Just tell him what you told me, that you're a doctor, and it's medicine. That I get illegally from a drug dealer, who's now threatening me. Yeah, all the more reason to turn yourself in. Look, I know you think that you can control everything, but you cannot control this. And murder investigations, they don't go away easily. You know this. There's a transcript. Uh, okay. Read it. Detective : "When did you notice your mother was missing?" Mary : "In the morning." "What did you think happened?" "She killed herself." "But she was found with her hands tied together. How could she have done that?" "Can I please go?" "Did you tie her hands behind her back?" "No." "So you're saying she tied her own hands?" "I tried to save her." Goes on and on. [sighs] Uh, okay, but, uh, there wasn't enough? Not enough to charge her. But enough for her to change her name. Ben, you don't know who this woman is. She's been involved in the death of God knows how many people. She... she preys on people. She's been doing this since she was 16. Okay, she's lying to you. She is manipulating you. I'll call you back. I have to talk to you. Yeah, you do. I want to be honest with you. Good. Hold on. What are you doing? Mary Mitchell? Your mother didn't die of cancer, did she? Why'd you lie? Because it's easier. Easier than what, telling people that you killed her? Come on, Mary. You want to be honest? Let's be honest. Be honest. Come on. You think you get it, but you don't. Okay. So explain it to me. I think you should go now. [snorts] Know what's funny, Mary? I really thought I knew you. You do know me, Ben. No. Who are you? I'm Mary Harris. I'm an ER doctor. And I work at Eden General Hospital. [dramatic music] You know sometimes they get their antlers locked together And they can't unlock them, and they can't live like that, so they both just die. Locked together. I don't know, point being, if they lock antlers, they both go down. [phone ringing] You can get that. [sighs] It's okay. So you want heroin. Yeah, you have a problem with that? No, I only have a problem if you're setting me up. I'm not setting you up, Grady. I'm trying to get high. Is this about my conversation with Mary? You talked to Mary? I did. This morning. At her house. Hmm. I know about your business, yeah. It's okay, Des. Although, I am unhappy that you lied to me. I think this might be a really good thing for me. Like it was meant to be. And the timing: I lose Sid, and then, I meet Mary, so... Bit fortuitous, wouldn't you say? Yeah, yeah, well, I'm done with Mary. Done with all of it. I'm finished. Does she know that? I'm not like her. She's trying to help people, fight the good fight. [sighs] I'm just a junkie looking for a fix. [ominous music] [screaming] ♪ ♪ [phone dialing] You've reached Louise Malick, attorney. [beep] I'll take the deal. What happened? He asked about Mom. I guess he found out. What did you tell him? Nothing. God. Some things never die. It'll die when we die. We killed her, and now he knows. No, we saved her, and you're still saving people. I didn't tell you everything. I charged them. Oh. How much? $10,000. Jesus! People pay? You know, I don't think I'm a very good person. Why, because you provide a service, and people pay for it? Because I like it. It's hard to explain, but there's something about it. Being with them in their last moments, when everything matters and doesn't matter. Mary, you need to stop. I don't want to stop. I think there's something wrong with me. Well, I mean, yeah. Obviously. Maybe there's something wrong with all of us. Am I crazy like Mom? No. You are nothing like her. What the hell, Nicole? I was just seeing if you still had the will to live. ["Open Water" by Steady Holiday] ♪ ♪ You do. [breathes deeply] ♪ ♪ [laughter] ♪ ♪
