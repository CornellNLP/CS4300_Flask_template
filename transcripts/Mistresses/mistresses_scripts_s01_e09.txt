 [Harry] If the baby isn't mine, you have a choice to make... 
 Me or the baby. 
 Previously on "Mistresses"... 
 I'm keeping this baby. 
 Sam's become infatuated with me. 
 Maybe you could tell him you were screwing his father. 
 That should break the spell. 
 [ Samantha Fox ] 
 ♪ Naughty girls need love... too. [Girl] Mom, over here! Where is she? Where's her bathing suit? ♪ I'm in love with you. Don't worry. No one's looking. Yoo-hoo! Savi! Joss! Hey, mom! She's out there kind of far, isn't she? ♪ Oh, it's only you I adore. ♪ So much more than my body. She's just trying to get the beefcake to save her. It's okay, Joss. He'll blow his whistle any minute. ♪ Even still there's a thrill in my heart. Any second now we'll hear it. ♪ Naughty girls need love... ♪ Naughty girls need love... ♪ Baby, don't let me... [Whistle blowing] [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Beeps] Joss? Karen. What is it? Okay. I'll be right there. [Beep] [Voice breaking] I suppose I should've seen this coming. But how could I have known? The whole time, Elizabeth was acting like my friend. I mean, how could I possibly have thought that... You couldn't. She held your hand at the funeral. The woman was obviously trying to mess with your head. Unless she didn't know then. Maybe it was the sunglasses. What sunglasses? I accidentally left my sunglasses in Tom's apartment. Sam thought they were his mom's, so he gave them to her. That may be how Elizabeth found out that Tom was having an affair. [April] That's crazy. How would she know they were yours? Sunglasses are sunglasses. Hey. Unless they're awesome sunglasses. I'm just saying, if somebody's rockin' a killer pair of Tom Ford's, I take note. [April] Okay, okay, stop. What you need to do right now is listen to your instincts. What are they telling you? She's known the whole time. Um, which means she's a sociopath. Okay, can we not... What? Well, she is still my client. So dump her. Joss, I can't just dump her. Why not? Karen is your best friend. Where is your loyalty? [Sighs] Karen, if she knew, when she knew, I mean, what difference does it make now? If she's known from the beginning, she's been lying to me from day one. And if that's the case... What if she lied about the way Tom died? [Crying] What if... Elizabeth killed Tom because of me? [Sobs] If his death was somehow my... my fault, I can't... No, it is not. Hey, and if we want to look at the silver lining here, he was gonna die soon anyway. So as far as murders go, it's, like, not the worst kind of murder. And I'm gonna stop talking now. Savi, you've met her. What do you think? Do you think she's capable of something like this? How do you know if someone's capable of murder? There must be some way to find out. There is no light at the end of this tunnel, okay? You have to let this go. [Exhales] [Door opens] [Zips bag] [Door closes] Uh, sorry. I'm in here. I thought you'd be at work. You call this a hide a key? First rock I tried. [Laughs] Janet. What are you doing? Hey. [Laughs] Harry, come here. Aside from handsome, how are you? Oh, let me look at you. Oh, screw it. Let's keep hugging. I can look at you later. Savi's not expecting me. Is she here? No, of course she's not here. The girl's always working. Uh, no. Um... can I get you something? Would you like a drink? Yes, please. What a trip. What a freaking nightmare the bus system is in this country. You took the bus? No, I hitched with a couple I met in Santa Fe. We got hit by a bus somewhere along the 40. Had to rent another car. No convertibles available, needless to say. Sharp pain in the ass. Yes. Nice. [Lids clatter] So how are you, darling? Good. Yeah? So packing up the kitchen, I see. You got catering camp? Uh... I moved out of the house. What? I don't know what else to say here except, if you want to know more, you should probably talk to Savi. And I should probably get to work. It's really great to see you. Yeah. I... Brought you a present. It's a Pirate Parrot. You know I'm a Dodgers fan, right? I think he's kinda cute. [Chuckles] I'm so excited to see you. I want to hear everything. What did you say? What did Lucy say? When I told Madi about it, she got so excited, she started crying. She said Lucy already seemed like a sister to her. Uh, not that we're getting married or... or anything like that. Oh. Wow. You didn't tell Lucy about us yet. I... she got sick and... [Chuckles] Wow. Uh, I don't believe this. You said you were ready. I wouldn't have told Madi if you... Honestly, it got away from me. Things got crazy. She had a stomach flu. It was a long week, Richard. I'm sorry. I just forgot. Something happen? Yes, but it's over now. Miranda left. Yes, she did. I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget how much you have going on. But look, it's... it's over now. She's gone. You can move on with your life, right? We... can move on. And I am gonna tell Lucy about us tonight. I promise. Now sit down. I want to hear all about your trip. Okay. [People speaking indistinctly] [Woman] Webbed fingers and toes are poking out from your baby's hands and feet. His tail is just about gone. Sorry. Uh, thought you were out. Uh, I was just dropping off some things for you to sign. It's okay. Come in. Um, I'll just pick 'em up later, yeah. I'll just do 'em now. It'll take a minute. Okay. [Clears throat] Heard you, uh, stayed till midnight last night. Yeah, I wanted to get a jump on that Hayes case. Logging extra hours isn't gonna get you back on partner track. Not since your husband went all Russell Crowe on me. Yeah, luckily making partner isn't a priority right now. Marriage comes first. [Sighs] Harry moved out of the house. You all right? Honestly, I don't... I don't know. [Telephone rings] [Sighs] Hello. Savannah Davis. [Harry] Hey. Harry. Hi. Yeah, look, I know this isn't the best bit of news, but I thought I should warn you. Your mother's in town. Oh, my God. I knew it. Had your dream again, huh? Yeah. Same drill as always. I don't hear from her for months and then I have the dream, and bam... She shows up the next day. I'm like a dog who knows when an earthquake's coming. Yeah, well, I thought you should know, I ran into her at the house... When I was picking up a few things. Oh. Yeah, I tried to cover, but she's too smart for me, I'm afraid. I told her I moved out, but that's all I said, okay? It's up to you if you want to tell her the rest. Thanks for the warning. Uh, so how are you? You get the paternity results back? No, not yet. Right. Well... That's it, then. [Line clicks] [Dial tone droning] [Inhales sharply] [Receiver clatters] [Speaking inaudibly] Here you go. Oh, thanks. But I'm not sure I need coffee. I'm already anxious enough. Trying to solve a murder mystery all by yourself will do that. Even Angela Lansbury had a helper. You remember that little old guy? He was cute. Want to be my little old guy? If you're really serious about this, I think you should hire a professional. A professional what? When I was trying to figure out what to do about Miranda, Savi hired this guy to look into her for me. Well, granted, he wasn't as thorough as I might have hoped, but he was helpful. I don't think I can ask Savi. No, but if you're willing to pay, I'm sure there are people out there who can help. Or you can... Move on. Focus on the positive things in your life. That's what I'm trying to do with Richard. What's happening with Richard? Oh, we don't have to talk about that. I'd so much rather talk about that. [Sighs] Basically, I'm trying to figure out if it's worth telling Lucy about Richard when I still haven't told Richard about Paul. And if he's just gonna break up with me when he finds out. Come on. Richard is not going to end the relationship just because something terrible happened to you. And if he does, he doesn't deserve you. I know. So really, why haven't you told Richard about Paul? Honestly, I don't want to deal with his feelings about the whole thing. He's bound to have an opinion. Everything is just so serious from the get-go. I mean, I just want to enjoy the beginning, the fun part. So don't tell him. Paul is back in Florida, right? Yeah, he's gone but, isn't honesty kind of a big deal when you're starting a relationship? Like you said, this is just the beginning. You don't owe Richard your past. Well, my clients aren't willing to go a penny above 2.5. [Elevator bell dings] They don't care that the house is in the third street elementary district, Bob. They're 80 years old. Who's up for a cocktail? I gotta go. Oh, my freak. Mommy! When the hell did you get here? This morning. Hi! Hi. Hi. Hi, I'm Janet. Todd. Nice to meet you. Love the ascot. Thank you. Yeah. Oh! I am so happy you're here. I am in desperate, desperate need of a pick-me-up. What is it, baby? My life's officially gone to crap. Your life is exactly as it's supposed to be. It is a process. No, it's a joke. For starters, I'm a realtor with no place to live. I thought you were in Savi's guest house. No, we got in a wicked fight. Totally her fault, by the way. Plus, my new tyrant boss hates me. Mm. Woman? Man. Well, you must have a fabulous boy or three in your life right now. Well, no boys at the moment. But there is a girl who's pretty great. So you're a homeless lesbian with a crappy job and a withholding older sister. What do you say, fill me in over lunch? [Exhales] That would be great. [Elevator bell dings] [People speaking indistinctly] Hi. Hi. Uh, mom's in town. Yeah, I know. Oh. How do you know? I spoke to Harry this morning. Oh. How'd that go? It was fine. Where is she? In the car. Waiting while I convince you to come to lunch. I can't. I have to get through all this work. Come on. Work later. When's mom ever in town? Okay, please don't make it seem like I don't want to see her, because I do want to see her. Just, if she had given us some warning, I could've cleared out my schedule. What do you want? She's spontaneous. Besides, I think she has news. I am not standing up at another one of her weddings. Oh, I don't think it's that. And I'm sure she'd love to hear your big news. The... the baby stuff, not the divorce stuff. First of all, I'm separated. And second of all, are you high? I'm not telling her about the baby. She won't judge that you don't know who the father is. Unless you do know. Uh, did the results come back? [Gasps] Oh, my God. The results came back? Yeah. And? I haven't looked yet. What? Why? Wow. Savi, I really don't understand you. Yeah, this just in. Okay. Well, fine you don't have to tell her anything just please come to lunch with us. She'd be really hurt. Okay, fine. Thank you. You don't say anything to her either, okay? Wow. You really don't trust me at all, do you? So he tells me, "you puke in a bucket for six hours". "You commune with your soul," thank you. "Then you touch the hand of God". So what did you say to him? I said, "it sounds like every one of my Saturday nights in the '90s". "Go to Peru without me. I'm not drinking some psychedelic roots". [Laughs] Mm. Well... Did you notice anything, mom? What's that, honey? It's the necklace you gave her for her 7th birthday. Oh! Yes. Oh, "fabulous". Oh, I can't believe you still have it. Mm. It's kept me fabulous all these years. It sure has, baby. Ooh. So, Jossy, tell me all about this, uh, Alex. Oh, Alex. She's... She's authentic and she's beautiful. And... She would've really loved to have met you, but she's doing this yoga thing in Santa Barbara. Oh, well, maybe next time. Mm hmm. What? Did I say anything? I might still be with her when mom comes back to visit, Savi. Well, that depends. I'm... Going away for a while. What do you mean? I'm moving to... Rio! Oh, that's... oh, unbelievably cool, mom. Seriously? Why? Why not? Santa Fe's getting dullsville. I woke up one day, and all the cute men had become old and doddering. [Josslyn] Mm. I said to myself, "Janet, it is time to infuse some life into my life while I'm still young enough to enjoy it". Amen. How long will you be gone? Mm. Don't know. At least a year. Maybe two. Put most of my stuff in storage. Bought a one-way ticket. Well, obviously, we need to have a going-away party. Oh, that's a great idea, but it'll have to be tomorrow, because I'm leaving the day after that. I don't think I have time right now to have a party. Oh, Savi. Don't stress. I'll handle everything, I just need to borrow the house. Okay. So... Brazilian theme, clearly. Caipirinhas, of course. [Josslyn] I love that. Caipirinhas. [Phone rings] This is George. [Karen] Hi, uh... I got your number through a friend of a friend. I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm not sure how to start. I've never hired a private investigator before. Person, place, or thing? Person. Male or female? Female. Friend or foe? The jury's still out on that one, huh? Well, what did she do? I think... I think she may have killed someone. I see. Uh... [clears throat] And is this something that you are trying to pursue legally? Does it matter? Depends. The work I do, uh, let's just say it... Wouldn't be admissible in a court of law. It's illegal. Well, no, I didn't say that. I said it wasn't admissible. You still interested? [Sighs] [Doorbell rings] [Sighs] Yes. Can you hold on a second? [Rings] [Gasps] I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to call you back. [Jangles keys] Wow. That's a big commitment, changing teams. This is just the tip of the iceberg, my friend. I told Lucy about us, and she was so excited, she hugged me for ten minutes straight. If I knew I'd get so much love from that girl, I would've told her ages ago. I'm glad it went well. Also, uh, Joss is throwing an impromptu party tomorrow, and I want you to come and officially meet my friends. And you'll get to meet Janet, too. Who's Janet? Savi and Joss' mom. She's great. Lucy thinks she hung the moon. Oh, and you should bring Madi with you. Are you trying to prove something here, April? I know I broke your trust. I want to earn it back. Well... it's totally working. I have a sitter for another hour. Opened a bottle. Wanted to share. Oh, that's sweet, mom, but if I drink this late, I'll be up all night. Plus, I have all this work that I have to get through. Well, you certainly didn't get the responsibility gene from me. No, I did not. Or from your father, for that matter. I don't think he was irresponsible, mom. I think he was just heartbroken. Too heartbroken to stick around for you? Well, you had a baby with another man, so... And that baby was Joss. I don't regret it. Do you? Let's not do this right now, okay? Okay. [Exhales] It's a deal. Listen, um, I didn't want to say anything in front of your sister because I know you girls are in a thing, but, uh... I'm worried about you and what's going on with Harry. It is what it is. That doesn't sound like you, Savi. You fight tooth and nail for everything you want. [Sighs] You can tell me, Sweetie. I won't judge you. I'm always here for you. [Whispering] I just... I... Well, I'll let you get to your work. We can talk about Harry tomorrow... If you want. Good night, Sweetie. Night, mom. [Door closes] 
 
 You realize I was at your funeral, right? I know. What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Florida. I know. And so? So I haven't gone yet. I can see that. Why, exactly? I need to talk to April. April doesn't want to talk to you. I believe she made that clear. She did. I was just hoping she might have cooled down a bit. [Chuckles] You think she's gonna cool down after what you did to her? Are you out of your freaking mind? I'm still not leaving L.A. until I get another chance to discuss things with her. What do you want from me? Okay. So I went to talk to April this morning, but she was with a guy. Her boyfriend. And... Richard. Right. Right. She's got a boyfriend and she has her own shop and she's got this whole life... Of course she has a life. You've been dead for three years. Karen... I need your help. You've always been the reasonable one of the group. Just give her the heads-up that I haven't left and I want to talk. If you can convince her to have one more conversation with me, I'll take care of the rest. Why on Earth should I help you, Paul? Because I don't think she wants me surprising her at her door again, but if that's what I have to do, then... [Sighs] Please, Karen. Who's coming? Oh, all the usual suspects. Is something burning? [Gasps] My pao de queijo! [Josslyn] Uh-oh. Wow. Cheese balls, honey? [Laughs] You said it, not me. Too much? Not enough. I should probably go change, huh? Oh, there's no time. Our first guest is here. Hi. Hello. Hi. Oh, you look pretty. Thank you. You're welcome. Is April here yet? I need to talk to her. No. Karen, bem vindo. Janet. It's so good to see you. [Singsongy] You look gorgeous. [Normal voice] Tell me everything. How's your love life? Oh. Hey, Joss. Over here. I'll take one of those. Well, I obviously have the right house. Oh, my God. My mother hired a stripper. He's not a stripper. He's a bartender. Hola. Diego, is it? Yes, Ma'am. Hola. [Laughs] Ma'am doesn't live here. I'm Janet. Hey, guys. You remember Richard. All : Hi. Mm hmm. Janet! Oh, my gosh. You're a giant. Uh, Diego, would you grab my camera? All right, everybody. Group picture. Don't by shy, handsome. All right. And everybody say... Rio. [All] Rio! [Camera shutter clicks] [Telephone rings] [Beeps] Hello. Hi, Mr. Mitchell. Uh, no. I wasn't planning on coming into the office today. Do you need me... When did that happen? New evidence in the Thomas Grey case. But Dr. Kim's notes were handed in, like, two weeks ago. Você tem pés bonitos. Can I join the party? [Janet] Mm. Oh, sure, honey. All right. He's cute, mom. I hadn't noticed. [Laughs] [Sighs] I'm really glad you're here. I missed having a mama. Oh. I can't believe you're gonna be so far away for so long. You can always come visit. Well, actually... I was thinking I could come visit now. Help you find a place, get you all set up. It'd be a blast. Well, what about your job, your new girlfriend? Oh, I have two weeks of vacation coming to me, and Alex would totally be supportive. Well... Unless you don't want me to come. Oh, are you kidding, honey? I would love nothing more. Yeah? You're my girl. [Chuckles] Okay. [Sighs] Did you see how cute Richard was being with Janet? He is so good with parents. I think even my mother would like... him. What? Did you wind up telling Richard about Paul? No. You told me not to. I know, but not everyone listens to my advice. I do. Paul's still in L.A. What? What... how do you... what? I had the same reaction. [Exhales] How do you know? He came to see me. What?! I know. What? I wasn't sure if I should tell you or not, but I thought you should know and decide for yourself how to handle it. How to handle it? What am I supposed to be handling? Why is he still here? That I don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you. [Sighs] He's staying at the same motel. Oh, I'm so sorry, April. Should I not have told you? No, no, no. I mean... Damn it. What am I supposed to do now? I have no idea. Am I supposed to talk to him? Is that what this is? No, not if you don't want to. Do I have to tell Richard now? [Sighs deeply] Son of a bitch. [Elevator bell rings] What the hell happened? Nothing. Nothing has happened. [Chuckles] I'm gone for one week, and I come back to find out that I've lost my entire settlement? I understand you're upset, Mrs. Grey. Just let me bring you up to speed. Now new evidence has recently emerged that seems to imply that your husband may have been... Suicidal at the time of his death. That's ridiculous. These notes were submitted by your husband's psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Kim. And in a few places, she indicates that he had said... Let me see the notes. Well, this is impossible. Of course, this is just one woman's opinion, we're prepared to argue... No, it's impossible that she took these when she said she did. I'm sorry? These notes are referring to a session that seemingly took place January 28th. [Scoffs] Tom and I were in Hawaii the last two weeks of January. You're sure about that? I keep all our receipts on file. I can show you a copy from our hotel. No, I apologize. I haven't been lead on this case. Mrs. Davis is out with the flu, and I just... Look, I don't care which one of you fixes this. I just want it fixed. Obviously, this woman is lying. Now why would someone want to do such a thing, I have no idea. But I expect you to find out. I assure you, we'll get to the bottom of this. Please have a seat, and I'll go get Mr. Mitchell. [Woman] All right. Here we go. Guess what. I'm going to Rio. Are these rice balls or cod fritters? [Sniffs] They are cod fritters. Go on. Go ahead and tell me the nine million reasons why it's a bad idea. Actually, I think it's a great idea. You should go, you will have a great time. Ow! Uh, do you want me to get some butter or something? You don't use butter or ice. Run that under cold water. Hi. What are you doing here? Mom harassed him to come over and say his good-byes. Give me your hand. [Turns water on] [Savi] It'll mean a lot to her that you came. Well, I always did have a soft spot for Janet. There you go. Are you, uh... Are you gonna tell her you're pregnant? No. What would be the point? [Object clatters] Might be nice to have someone around. Well, that's not really an option, since she's moving to Rio. [Laughs] Well, maybe if you told her, she wouldn't go. She'd be bored within a week. Gone within two. At least give her a chance to do the right thing, Sav. After all these years, do you really not know her? Well, I've been surprised by people lately that I thought I knew well. I'm gonna go say hi. [Lucy] Ready or not, here we come! He's not here. Oh, uh, check the kitchen again. Hi, mom. Bye, mom. Okay. [Man] Psst. [Girl] Let's check in here. [Lowered voice] Are they gone? You know, this game's not that bad when you're just a little drunk. I'll have to remember that. You okay? You look kind of funny? I know. I'm... I'm sorry. I... I don't think I feel so good. I, um, I think I'm coming down with Lucy's stomach flu. Oh, no. Yeah, I'd hate to break up the party. Everyone's having such a good time. How about I take the girls tonight? That way, you can go home and puke in private. Oh, really? You're okay with that? I'll rally the troops. [Laughter] Thank you for the great party. I gotta go. Careful driving. Yeah, me, too. Oh, don't be such a poop. Come on. Stay the night. Oh, n... mom, it's okay. No, the three of us will stay up and talk. Oh, come on, you two. You love each other too much to let your egos keep you apart. People make mistakes. Mom, let's clean up. Well, it... it's no big surprise that men can't keep it in their pants. Mom. Mom! Okay, kids. Let's go to the car. Right behind you. Is that what you told her? No. Of course that's not what I told her. I didn't tell her anything. I didn't need to be told. [Door closes] Marriages break up over one of two things... Money or cheating. Obviously, money's not an issue. I mean... [chuckles] Look at this house. So somebody slept with somebody else. What else could it be? [Sighs] You? [Sighs] Savi. Savi. Please just leave me alone. I didn't know. How could I know? I mean, after all the hell you gave me for what I did to your father... And ten men after that. It's not the same. Oh, I didn't mean that. I... I don't fault you. I don't care. Have I ever judged you, Savi? I have never judged you. Nope. You have never judged me, mom, because that actually would have required some attention. Wow. [Sighs] You really hate me? Was I such a terrible mother? No. You were a great mom when you were there. But unfortunately, you were hardly ever there. What are you talking about? I was always there when you girls needed me. Are you kidding me? Name one time when I wasn't there. One? Okay. Uh, what about Joss' 7th birthday? You didn't give her that necklace, mom. Of course I gave her the necklace. It was her birthday present. You were in Cabo with some guy we had never met. And you left me alone once again to take care of her. I was 15 years old, and she was 7. And she pestered me the whole weekend... "What do you think mom's gonna bring me back for my birthday?" And I knew you'd forget. I knew it, if you'd even show up at all. And I just... I couldn't... I couldn't bear the heartbreak on her face so I took every single penny that I had saved. And I bought her that necklace and I just said it was from you. The necklace wasn't from me? Well, I... Did my best. [Sighs] [Sniffles] [Knock on door] [Exhales] [Knock] Thanks for calling me. I didn't invite you in. Right. Sorry. Force of habit. Why are you still here, Paul? I want to see Lucy. [Door opens] [Door closes] Morning. Morning. I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't see you often, which is on me, I know. And I feel like I have such a short window to say all the right things. And invariably, they come out all wrong. It's okay, mom. You're not like me. And what I was trying to say the other night... About you not being like your father... You're so much stronger than he is... Than he ever was. You have always been your own little miracle of a person. [Sighs] In so many ways, let's face it, you raised yourself. [Sighs] Your accomplishments are all your own. And I am absolute awe... Of the woman that you've become. A cheater? A woman of great character. Who's facing a mistake. Yeah. I'm sorry about interfering with you and Harry. I... I hope you two work it out. You have a bond I could never forge with another person. And I've always thought you'd make an outstanding mother. [Exhales] [Sniffles] You better hurry, though, before those eggs go and die. I've done some preliminary work on this Elizabeth Grey. [Coughs] You want some coffee? No, thank you. You didn't say she was loaded. Does that matter? Well, gated communities have tighter security. You know anything about firewalls? Not really. Well, I won't trouble you with the details. Let's just say that this whole thing is going to, uh, take a little longer than I initially thought. Oh, really? So you're saying her I.S.P. provides better security because there's a gate in front of her house? Well, obviously... [clears throat] I was speaking of the metaphorical firewall. Look, if you don't have any information... Look, I can get you a whole bunch of facts on this lady. But none of 'em are gonna give you the answer you're looking for. I'm not gonna find an e-mail that says, "I killed my husband". I'm a good P.I., but I'm not a mind reader. I can't get inside her head. Thank you for your time. Why don't you just ask her yourself? There's no point. I already know she lies. Well, everybody lies. But you seem to have a pretty good knack for cutting through people's crap. Richard, hi. What are you doing here? Chicken soup, which is either perfect or gross, depending on how you feel. If it's gross, I also brought bagels. You're a good man. I try. Come in. There's... Something I need to tell you. [Footsteps approaching] Hey. Hey. I thought you had to go into the office today. Yeah, I'm leaving soon. Just wanted to see you off. [Kettle clatters] [Turns water on] [Turns water off] Where's mom? I don't know, she's uh... She's not answering her phone. She's not in the guest house but, maybe she just went to go get cash for the trip, you know? Yeah. You're probably right. [Cell phone rings] Oh. There she is. Hola, mama. ¿Cómo estás? Where you at? Oh, you're at the airport already? Diego? Oh, oh, the... yeah the, right, the bartender from last night. Yeah. Oh, well... Yeah, that's probably a smart idea. He knows the city and... He can... [chuckles] Lug all your boxes and stuff and... [Voice breaking] Yeah. Um... No. Yeah. [Chuckles] Let's be honest. He's pretty hot, right? Okay. Um... yeah. Actually, it's... it's probably better for me to... [sniffles] To come when you're all settled in and... [laughs] I don't know what we were thinking. Totally, yeah. [Sniffles] Okay. Okay. Yeah, we'll make a girls' weekend out of it. Okay. [Chuckles] Ciao. [Clicks] [Sniffles] She's taking Diego. Bleh. [Chuckles] I heard. God, she couldn't like... Be a mom for just a couple of weeks, you know? [Sniffles] [Sighs] Now I finally understand why you've... Always been so frickin' tough on me. Oh, Joss, please don't... No, no, no, just stop, because it's gonna get nice, I promise. [Sniffles] You've been so tough on me because that's what mothers do. You know, to... Make sure that you grow up right. Oh. I missed you. I missed you, too. [Sniffles] [Exhales] [Sniffles] I need you to do something for me, okay? Yeah. This is the results to my paternity test. You want to open it now? There's no good answer in there. I mean, if it's... Dom's... What? I'm not gonna be in a relationship with him. But if it's Harry's, well... I certainly don't want him to come home just for this baby. [Inhales deeply] [Exhales] My job now is to take care of this baby. In love and in peace. And until he or she is born... The baby belongs to me. Will you keep this for me? [Voice breaking] There is no one in this world... That I trust more with it than you. [Cries] Okay? Yeah. Okay. [Crying] [Sniffles] [Exhales] [Sniffles] [People speaking indistinctly] Hi, Lila. Uh, sorry to do this, but I need to cancel my afternoon appointments. I'm heading out to Zuma and I'm not sure what time I'll be back. Great. Thank you. [People continue speaking indistinctly] Are you Karen Kim? Yes, I am. You've just been served.
