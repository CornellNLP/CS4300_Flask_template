 Case dismissed. 
 Previously on "Mistresses"... 
 That was amazing. 
 Was that amazing or has it just been so long? 
 No. That was amazing. 
 [April] I saw Paul. I just saw my dead husband. 
 Hi, April. 
 I want a second chance. 
 You committed fraud. 
 Well, I'll turn myself in. 
 I wanna be with my wife and my little girl, who I love. 
 I'm pregnant, Harry, but it might not be yours. 
 I don't regret what happened that night, not for a second. 
 If the baby isn't mine, you have a choice to make... 
 Me or the baby. 
 This is the results to my paternity test. 
 Will you keep this for me?

 ♪I've been trying to hide. 
 ♪We held our breath to see our names are written. Hey, Harry, it's me. Listen, the paternity results are gone, okay? And they were here when you were here, so... [slaps thigh] You wanna give me a call just, like, as soon as you get this? [Doorbell rings] Okay! Okay, I'm coming! ♪Found out. Since we found out. ♪That anything could happen. ♪Anything could happen. ♪Anything could... [Vocalizing] ♪But I don't think I need you. W... [Women] ♪And many more. [Laughter] Oh! Thank you. And thank you so much for that amazing gift! That you left on my doorstep this morning. Not from us. Mm? [Josslyn] But... This is! [April claps] Aw! Ta-da! It's our gift to you... An all-expenses paid trip to luxurious Palm Springs! Just us girls and a T-Bird. We road trip tomorrow. [Chuckles] This is so sweet, you guys. Wait. So... None of you sent me flowers? Um, we just got you a trip, Sav. [Laughs] No. I love the trip. Thank you so much for this, really. Someone sent you a bouquet? Yeah, and the card read "Happy Birthday". No sender and no florist. It's obviously from Dom. That sneaky little... Joss. What? I wouldn't be too sure of that. Well, they could be from Harry. Do you think he had a sudden change of heart for some reason? [Clear throat] Let's, uh, cut the cake. The important question is, who do you want them to be from? I really don't know. Oh, come on. You must've had a wish or a flash of a feeling. I have flashes of feelings all the time about both of them. But I certainly can't trust myself to choose which sliding door. Why? Because I'm a lunatic. The other night, I was so sure that I wanted to kiss Dom. And then I did kiss Dom, and I found myself pulling away. You kissed Dom? What? Yeah. Yeah. Uh... April, your horror? I... [sighs] Uh, see your inappropriate kiss with Dom. And I raise you one scandalous make out with Paul. What?! Oh, my God. When?! What is going on? I didn't plan it. Believe me. But... I can't deny how it felt, smelt, tasted like... The happiness of my past. Look. Of course I was conflicted. I ran out of there as fast as I could. But the longer Paul is around, the more vivid the old Paul becomes... The Paul I knew for 17 years. And the Paul from the last three? He did a terrible thing, an unspeakable thing, but he is willing to face it. To go to jail to make things right. And where does that leave Richard? Richard is a great boyfriend. He's a terrific father to Madi. He makes me laugh. So what's the problem? It just quite feel like it does with Paul. Like battered wife syndrome? [Cup clatters] Did I just say that out loud? Mm hmm. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just that's how it seems. I mean, Paul made your life and Lucy's life a living hell for three years. You know, I can't even believe you'd consider taking him back. Yeah, the man is beyond redemption at this point. And of course, Paul is taking more space in your mind. It's been days since you've even spoken to Richard. You know, every one of you has done something you wish you hadn't done. You've each made horrible mistakes, told despicable lies... And you've done nothing but plot and scheme and beg for forgiveness ever since. And you stand here telling me, the one person who hasn't hurt anyone, that I'm not allowed to consider forgiving Paul? Well, I don't know about you guys, but I feel dirty. [Taps countertop] I say we hit Palm Springs today, get exfoliated or something. I can't. I have to work. I have to pack Lucy for Jane's. All right. Karen? Me? [ Inhales deeply ] I have to tie up some loose ends. So as you can see, it's been quite a year. [Exhales sharply] To say the least. Which you always do, until I drag it out of you. You know, you could've come to me for counsel. Can you tell me about the affair, this man that you loved and lost? His name was Tom Grey. Oh. What? What? Your reaction. What? I... I didn't... I did? [Chuckles] I can't get anything past you. Yeah, Thomas Grey, the trial lawyer? Yes. Did you know him? Yeah. Married to Elizabeth? How did you... I used to see him here in the halls. He was... Practically a resident on the psychiatric floor. What? Tom was institutionalized? No, it was his wife. I'm surprised he never shared that with you. But Elizabeth told me she'd never seen a shrink. Well, she didn't. She saw a whole team of them. What the hell are you doing? [Sets down glass] Where did this come from? You steal it from your father? No, I didn't steal it. I took it myself. When? When did you have occasion to take candids of Dr. Kim? We were friends, all right? When did this begin? During your father's affair with her or after she killed him? You're delusional. You know that? I'm delusional? Let's talk about this when you're sober. How's Tuesday sound? Don't you talk to me that way. Yeah, go. Cower. Walk away, just like your father! Just like him. That's right. Lonely, shut out, living with a woman who's forbidding and cold. You drove him to Karen, just like you drove me. She came to me. You know that. You never asked me why. She was concerned that you were in love with her. Embarrassed for you, really. To her, you were nothing more than a... Pathetic child with a misguided crush. Yeah? Then why did she sleep with me? [Bell dings] [Dominic] So he's gonna come in later? Okay. Tell you what. Just make sure he gets this, all right? Thank you. Happy Birthday, Savannah. Hey. [Chuckles] I told you not to make a big deal of my birthday. Is "Happy Birthday" a big deal? From the partners, Mrs. D. You're officially a member of cheese of the month. See, that's a big deal. No, that's a big wheel. [Laughs] Just keep it behind your desk. Got a meeting. That's it? Best wishes? [Cell phone rings] Oh. [People speaking indistinctly] Hi. Uh, hey. Yeah, um... I'm just calling to, uh... [Sighs] Well, first of all, Happy Birthday. Thank you. [ Inhales sharply ] Listen, I left you something at the house. Did you get it? They were from you. Well, who else would be handling our personal bills? Uh, oh. Uh... Yeah. I mean, our bills are our bills, right? Yeah. I, um, I forwarded the utilities and the other big stuff to me, but... There were some statements from your O.B. that I probably shouldn't be handling. Okay. Yeah, there was a-a $600 bill for a single visit, does that sound right? Yes. Uh, that was for the ultrasound. So... Okay. Good. Well, I'll... I'll go ahead and pay that. Um... [taps hatch door] Look, I hate to talk about this on your birthday, Sav, but... It might be better if you handle your medical stuff yourself. Right. Sure. Much better. Okay, well... Happy Birthday. [Closes trunk] [Auto dials] Joss, it's Savi. Gas up that Thunderbird. We are hitting Palm Springs today. [ Sally Seltmann ] ♪Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. ♪Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. ♪Found magician it's late outside. Welcome to the Palm Sands Resort. Oh, thank you. Did I hook us up or what? Mm. ♪Car with a drum and a guitar. The Palm suite, ladies. Ooh-hoo. Look, more flowers. Oh, let it go, woman. Oh, by the way, um... Brendon, our friends who arrive tomorrow seem to be booked on another floor. Is there any way you can convince the... Sourpuss down at reception to free up an adjoining suite? My sister likes to be close to her girls, especially around bedtime. Mm. Well, such a beautiful creature deserves to have the weekend she wants. Oh, good. [Laughs] Because she's preggers and it's gonna be a big birthday. It's not that big of a birthday. Are you kidding? Last birthday without a kid. Do you have any idea how hard her life's about to get? Excuse me. But this old lady's gotta waddle off to the loo. That'll be all for now, Brendon. Oh, thank you. Mm hmm. Thank you. Mm. Flowers in here, too. Savi, stop. [Keypad beeps] Okay, you know what? You're right. You're right. Sorry. Harry, hey, it's me. Where the hell are you? Do you realize what you're doing to me? She trusted me with those results. Look, I know that you don't care about your relationship with her, but can you at least please care about mine? [Sighs] I'm out of town for the weekend so I strongly suggest that that envelope end up back in the guest house before I get back. [Rings doorbell] [Knocks] Richard, it's me. Hey, Molly. It's me. Any intel on those flowers yet? [People speaking indistinctly, water splashing] Okay. Yeah. Just text me. Bye. [Sighs] [Boy] Daddy, I can't. [Water splashes] [Man] Come on. Come on, Izzy. Come on. Jump to daddy. Come on. It's fun. Just do a Superman right into my arms. I don't want to, daddy. Come on, buddy. You got your floaties on. It's okay. You're cool. I promise I'm gonna catch you. Okay? Bro, you've been excited about this for weeks. You're my brave guy. You can just jump right in, come on. [Chuckles] Come on, buddy. Come on. Ready? [Gasps] All right! [Squeals] Great job! Oh, look at you. [Laughs] That was great, Sweetie. You did it. You're so brave. Joss, wake up. Hmm? [Sighs] What? [Objects clatter] I gotta go home. Huh? I gotta go home. [People laughing and speaking indistinctly] So I went over to Richard's to remind myself what a terrific guy he is. And guess what. He's gone. Yeah, whole place packed up, abandoned. He is pulling a Paul. Why does this keep happening to me? Another freaking magician... Hey, April. Looks like I missed a few phone calls. [Chuckles] Um... Scratch that. I found him. Richard, where have you been? At work. I usually turn off my phone during interviews. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. And after the last few days, I wasn't expecting you to call. [Huffs] Your living room was... Packed up. Your place was all empty. I thought you had... Taken off. I just had it painted. It was peeling like fruit. [Chuckles] Why, after everything, would you think I would just up and leave? It's happened to me before. April, listen to me. I'm not Paul. [Sighs] I know you're not. Savi, what are you doing? What's going on? Do you have the valet ticket I thought I had it. But I can't find it. I think it's in the room. Yo. I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what is happening. All day I've been obsessing about the flowers. Who are they from, Dom or Harry? Thinking that my destiny would somehow be decided by the name on that little card. And then I saw that family. What are you talking about? The family by the pool. The little boy and the dad. Okay, so? So... [sighs] Joss, this entire time, I've been asking myself the wrong question... Who will star with me in my romance? But it's... it's not about that. It's about a... A different kind of romance. The... the romance of a family for this baby. You know, the kind we never had and always wanted. [Sighs] Well... what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go get those Genzide results. What? Right now? The baby's future depends on the name in that envelope, okay? And I have to find out so that I can at least try to make it work. Okay, but what about our weekend? Well, I'll just go and bring the envelope back and open it... With my closest friends. Savi... Hey, just tell me where the envelope is. [People speaking indistinctly] Uh, it should be in my nightstand. Uh, really? Not a safe deposit box or... [chuckles] Your undies drawer even? Look, I am totally with you on this decision, but I don't love the idea of the pregnant lady driving all the way back in the dark... Alone. All right? So just do me a favor. Sleep on it. You can always go in the morning, it's not like... The envelope's going anywhere. Huh? Okay. Okay. [Exhales] Perfect. Back to the pool, hmm? Yeah. [Knock on door] [Sighs] I didn't expect you so early. I know. Sorry. Okay. How fancy are we getting? California fancy. After all these years, I still don't know what that means. [Chuckles, hangers clatter] Honey, would you kill me if I asked to drive separately? No, I'll be ready in ten minutes. No, Richard wants to have brunch this morning. Considering the past week, I think I'd have a better time in Palm Springs if things were more settled. Why didn't you call me to ask me this, April? Talk. [Sighs] Okay. I've been thinking about yesterday, how defensive I was about Paul. The truth is... I'm ashamed. How could I have feelings for him? Depends on what they are. It's not hatred anymore. Not anger. Love? No, not love. How can I even be thinking this? Feelings are feelings. You can't guilt them away. Believe me. I tried that with Tom. But I couldn't deny that he's who I wanted. What do you want? A partner, a father for my child, a family. There's no easy answer. I mean, Richard is an amazing guy, not a felon. And Paul... Close your eyes. You can't hypnotize me. I'm way too uptight. Just close your eyes, April. Come on. [Sighs] Everyone else's judgments aside, mine, Savi's, Joss'... Who do you see a happy life with? I gotta go. Mm. [Gin Wigmore's "Man Like That" playing] [Buzzing] Hi. This looks nice. ♪I guess I'll move on. ♪And if you need me. I'm so sorry, Richard. ♪Close your eyes and dream. Hello, Karen. Elizabeth, what are you doing? Look, I... [exhales] I know this is awkward. Look, Elizabeth, I'm on my way out. I just came to say... I'm really sorry, Karen. Just give me five minutes. Oh, come on. Come on. 
 
 ♪ Girl, you gotta wonder about a man like that. ♪ 
♪ Girl, you gotta wonder about a man like that. ♪ [Cell phone buzzes] [Buzz] Good morning, sleepyhead. I don't have Bluetooth in this thing, so you better make it quick. Where exactly are you? I'm on the 60 near L.A. Savi, pull off the freeway. [Chuckles] What? No, I'm not pulling off the freeway. I can't tell you bad news when you're doing 80 miles an hour on the freeway. Pull off. Oh, you're serious. Okay. I'm pulling onto the shoulder. [Exhales deeply] [Brakes squeak] [Grunts, gear shift clunks] Are you stopped yet? Yeah, I'm stopped. The Genzide envelope isn't there. [Exhales] Harry stole the results. What are you talking about? He was over the other morning, and I was... Wasted and out of it, and he took them when I wasn't looking. [Exhales] What was he even doing there? Why did you leave it out? I promise I'll explain everything to you if you just please come back to Palm Springs. So Harry knows. Maybe or... Maybe he didn't open it. Or maybe he couldn't bear to mention it when he called. Savi, I'm so sorry. I'll see you in an hour. [Sighs] [Groans] [Gear shift clunks] [Horn honks] [Tires squeal] I just don't understand. Yesterday you were panicked when you thought I had left. And I was. I was heartbroken and sad. But as the hours passed and... I convinced myself that you had really left me, I felt... What? Relieved. [Scoffs] That's a crappy thing to say. Not relieved that you were gone, Richard. Relieved that you were the one to hurt me and... Not the other way around. So he's gotten to you, huh? I can't believe it. You're going back to Paul. I got back with my ex a bunch of times. Each time, I convinced myself that it could be good again. Ended up just wasting another five years of my life. People change, Richard. But they don't change back. Mom. [Exhales] I'm headed to the airport. Leaving for good if you want to do a good-bye thing. [Hinges creaking] [Beeping] [Latch clicks] [Karen] Ice? No, thank you. Your home is lovely, Karen. Sparse. [Chuckles] I mean that in a good way. Tom never could stand knickknacks or clutter. Elizabeth, let's not. I didn't mean it that way. [Chuckles] I have no vitriol left. It's made me sick, frankly. [Sighs] If I'm gonna get on with my life... I need to settle things with you. How can I help you with that? Where are you headed? Palm Springs. It's my best friend's birthday. Actually, I'm late so I should get on the road. I know I should let you go, but I have a few questions. Why don't you take a seat? [Cell phone rings] [People speaking indistinctly] Yeah, hello. Yeah, that's me. Yeah, okay. I'll be right there. [Keypad beeps] Uh... Hey, Joss, it's me. Joss, Joss, Joss, let me talk. Savi's been in an accident. This is Paul. Leave a message. [Horns honking] Hi, it's me, April. I am on my way to Palm Springs for Savi's birthday. If I ever get there. God, this traffic is insane. [Call waiting beeps] Anyway, I was hoping that we could meet up for lunch or something when I get back. Call me back. Bye. [Keypad beeps] [Josslyn] Sorry I missed you. Tell me everything. Joss, you just called, probably wondering where I am. Sorry. This traffic is at an absolute crawl. [Siren wailing] Oh, you know, it looks like an accident or something. [Wailing continues, hydraulic brakes hissing] [Emergency radio chatter] [Motor whirring] [Wailing continues] Oh, my God. No pictures of anyone anywhere. [Sighs] I guess that's what happens when you don't have a family of your own. I should really call my friend, tell her when to expect me. Uh, my cell's upstairs. You were leaving town for the weekend without your cell phone? Must have forgotten it. [Cell phone rings] [Huffs] [Ring] [Ring] Don't pick it up, Karen. [Ring] [Gun clicks] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Stupid machine! [Cell phone rings] [Sniffles] [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Paul. No, no. Savi was in a car accident. I don't know. It was pretty bad. I don't know. Um, Ontario General hospital. I'll call you later, all right? April, hey. Where is she? Apparently still in surgery. They won't tell me a damn thing because I'm not family. Hey, excuse me. [Slaps countertop] Hello. I need whoever's in there with Savannah Davis to know that she's pregnant. All right. One step at a time. Who are you? I'm her husband. [Indistinct conversations] [Woman speaks indistinctly over P.A.] Harry. Where... where is she? What's happening? She just got out of surgery. She's critical but stable. Critical? But stable. She's in recovery right now. Not out of the woods, but so far, so good. And the baby? The baby's okay. She didn't lose it. Oh, my God. April. And, uh, you might want to give Dominic a call. Why would I do that? Because he's the father. [Cries and exhales] I thought you quit years ago. [Sniffles] [Sirens wailing] Considering starting again. Mm-hmm. [Huffs] [Inhales deeply] [Exhales] Hasn't been the easiest couple of months, huh? [Inhales deeply] Piece of cake. [Sobs] Harry, this is all my fault. If I would've just told her the truth last night... Joss, come on. If it's anyone's fault, it's mine, okay? I stole the damn thing. What if she doesn't pull through this? What if... [crying] Josslyn... No, you're a survivor, Harry. I'm not. I know it may seem like I am, but I'm not. Joss... I don't know what I'd do without her. Hey. She's gonna be fine, okay? And you're gonna be fine. What about you? Come on. Let's go inside. [Sniffles] Come on. [Exhales] Fourth floor. What is it you want from me? An apology would be nice. I am sorry, Elizabeth. I never meant to hurt you. Really? What did you mean to do, Karen... When you stole my life from me? Let's just put the gun down, Elizabeth, and talk about this calmly. I'll answer anything you want. Anything? Yes. [Voice breaking] Did you see Tom's face when you were screwing my son? Let's just... Talk about this. Can I make you a drink? Sure. Why not? What can I get you? Scotch. Uh... Sorry. I only have vodka. How do you like it? In my hand. Karen, why aren't you answering? Where are you? We're all here. April. Harry, Joss. Paul, what are... what are you doing here? I heard your voice, and you were distraught, I had to show up for you. I'm never not showing up for you again. Good news, folks. Savannah's awake. Oh, thank God. She had a Hemothorax. Her lung collapsed from the impact. But we put a chest tube in, and she's breathing fine. She's still groggy and she needs her rest. But why don't we start with one visitor at a time? Yeah, Joss. Go ahead. Okay. [Monitor beeping rhythmically] [Crying] Hey, baby. I really screwed up our weekend, didn't I? [Chuckles] You kidding? We just moved the party. [Sniffles] It's raging out there. [Laughs] Mm. [Sniffles and exhales] Everyone's here except for Karen, but she should be coming soon. Is Harry out there? Yeah. Did he... did he open the results? Yeah, he did. And he's here. Yeah. [Sighs] So good. Okay. [Scoffs] After all that... You guys are gonna talk about it, just... [Inhales] Get some rest. [Exhales] [Monitor beeping rhythmically] [Woman] I.V. tech to 309. So... So... So we're having a kid. I'm not the father, Sav. But... You're here. Savi, God, of course I'm here. You're my love. You're still my love. Harry... When I got the call about your accident, I just... Mm. [Voice breaking] I'm such an idiot. [Sniffles] I don't care who the father is. Yeah. I choose you, Savi. I'll always choose you. [Breathes unsteadily] Please put down the gun, Elizabeth. Just listen... I said don't turn around! [Woman] Ma'am, 9-1-1. What's your emergency? All I'm saying is, Holly Oak is a quiet street. The neighbors will hear the gun. Bronson Canyon is a small community. [Glass clanks on tabletop] Shut up. Just shut up. You sure you want another? Oh, this one's for you, dear. Ma'am, please answer me. Are you all right? Ma'am? [Hinge squeaks] Ma'am, can you hear me? Someone's... [Huffs] Get up. Now! Move. Where are we going? Upstairs to your bedroom. Considering your recent shame, I don't think people will be surprised... That you end your life with a fistful of morphine and a bottle of vodka. Now go. [Pounding on door] [Sam] Karen! [Pounds] It's Sam. [Whispers] Don't say a word. [Pounds] Karen! Please, let me in!

Have you heard anything from Paul, because... We haven't had any contact with him in days, and he was supposed to come back Thursday, but he... He never showed up, so... Is that daddy? No, honey, it's not. Um... April, I beg you. Can you just... Can you tell him to call his son? [Sniffles] Can you please just... I don't... Tell him that his son wants to speak to him. Of course I will. Thank you. [Sighs] Okay. Perfect. [Whispers] See you soon. Bye. Was that Karen? [Sighs] No, I don't know where she is. But I do know the identity of your flower fairy. Who? Ow. Ow.
