 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan :  This relentless pursuit of terror. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... 
 Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. 
 This was an act of terrorism. 
 It was a despicable and cowardly act. 
 The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. 
 ...until something stops him. 
 Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. 
 Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
 Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? f*ck! Carrie :  I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on (grunts) I'm on to Brody. He knows something about Walker's death and he's covering. Let's have some fun. (tires screech) Yeah! (laughing) Oh! No! See, she's fine, Dana, okay? He's calling 911. There's nothing we can do about it. Okay. My name is Nicholas Brody. People will say that I was turned into a terrorist. My action this day... I was right. You were right. Get down on the ground! (Brody groans) You're a disgrace to your nation, Sergeant Nicholas Brody. You're a traitor and a terrorist, and now it's time to pay for that. (breathes deeply, yelps) (groans) When's the attack?! Talk, you m*therf*cker! Get the f*ck off of me! I can do this, Saul. It's my turn. What is Abu Nazir's plan? I don't know. But there is a plan, right? Yes. Who does know the plan? Roya : Nicholas. We're at war. You need to choose sides. Jessica : I need the truth, Brody. No more secrets. You're gonna think this is a little crazy, Jess. I'm working for the CIA. (indistinct chatter) Quinn : Why is she stopping? She know she being followed? I don't think so. Looks like she's just clearing the area. She's on the air in half an hour. She's going somewhere. Going somewhere? Bold prediction. I mean, meeting someone now. Carrie : Okay, she's moving. Blue 1 in pursuit. Towards Garfield Plaza, it looks like. Virgil, heads-up, she'll be coming to you. Virgil : I'm on it. Quinn : We're re-deploying. Blue 1, take up position Pennsylvania Avenue. Blue 2, southeast corner and stand by. Virgil, Max, get on her. Copy. Okay, Max. She's past. You can open your eyes now. Max, wake the f*ck up, will you? What? We're on. Oh. Where is she? Oh, and if it's not too much trouble, bring your damn mic. I got it. Okay. Uh, it's pretty wide open. Anyone with a camera's gonna be pretty hard to miss. It's a public plaza. There'll be security cams everywhere. Galvez? Yeah, got it. (typing) Here's where she'll be going. I mean, she's a public figure. She has to accept that she might be seen, but she won't want to be heard. (sighs) Mm. (rushing water) Quinn : Where's audio? We got to get ears on this. Got to move closer. (Roya speaks indistinctly) Virgil, it sounds like Niagara Falls. (indistinct conversation) You recognize him? No. Galvez? A facial recognition won't work. Not with those glasses. This is it. This is the meet we've been waiting for. Virgil, where the hell is Max?! We need to hear this. (indistinct conversation) C-Can you clean this up? I'm trying. Are you recording? We've got to get this. Carrie. (indistinct conversation) (sighs) (voices fade out) Damn it! We've got nothing. (sighs) Quinn : Okay, Blue 1, Blue 2, do not let that man out of your sight. Virgil! I got him. (quietly): Come on. (subway approaching) What the hell is going on? Virgil?! We just lost him. (groans) (opening pill bottle) How's your hand? (inhales deeply) Mm. (groans) Here. Every four hours. (sighs) (sighs) (sighs) (sighs) Glad you're back. You are. Yes. But I have..ike, a million questions about this CIA thing. 50 million. Jessica. (sighs) I know. You can't talk about it. I'm not supposed to have told you I was even involved with them at all. What do you want to know? Ask me anything. I'll tell you if I possibly can. No, it's nothing. sh1t, it's late. Dana's not even up yet. Dana. Come on. It's almost 7:30. You're gonna be late. (groans) Come on. I'm sick. Since when? You feel fine. I'm not. Come on. Up! Let's go. Galvez : There he is exiting the Meridian Hill station a few minutes later. Without the sunglasses. No match from facial recognition though. Great, so we don't know where he is or who he is. Did you try her classmates at Oxford? Yeah. Uh, coworkers from the TV station in Yemen? Yep. And everyone else related to everything we know about her. Tried them all. No match anywhere. Well, keep trying. We got a clean picture. We can see the m*therf*cker clearly, still no ID. And no sound. That's as good as it gets. You know what we need to do. Bring Brody in, see if he can identify the guy. Think that's a good idea, letting Brody in on this? He already knows more than enough to sink us. If he wants to take stuff to the other side he already can. Look, the only reason we even knew to follow Roya is Brody. The only reason we saw her meet that man, whoever he is, is Brody. Okay. We made a deal with him. It's in his best interest to help us. I said okay. Bring Brody in. But don't trust him; that's all I'm saying. Is she moving? Didn't look like. (sighs) Dana! Where's Chris? He had early practice. Left an hour ago. (phone vibrating) Dana! Dana : I'm coming! There's something going on with her, Brody. I don't like it. Brody. Huh? What is it? Langley wants me. Hey. Really. See for yourself, take a look. Jess? I'm not saying I'm deserving of your trust, not at all... Who are you working with? You asked me what I wanted to know. That's it. Who are you working with at the CIA? Is it her again? Carrie? No. The nut? No. I told you, she had a nervous breakdown. They kicked her out. She's not even at the CIA anymore. If I have to go to school, I'm going to need a ride. Come on, sleepy. (Brody sighs) No good? Just not hungry. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Stop, Dad. Let me out. Thanks for the ride. (passenger door closes) You look tired. Yeah, so I've heard. Just take it easy. Sure. After we hit someone with your car, just take it easy? She's going to be okay. You don't know that. Yes, I do. Someone called 911. We saw that. There's a hospital a couple miles away. An ambulance would have gotten her there in, like, ten minutes, max. She's gonna be fine. Okay? Yeah. (school bell ringing) Come on. School's about to start. I got an AP history test first period. I think that I'm gonna just..ake it easy a minute. Okay. Yeah. See you at lunch then. (buzzer sounds) Guard : He's here. I'll get him. Hey. You texted for me to come here? Yeah. How are you? Not too bad, actually. Yeah. Taking a lot of painkillers for the hole in my hand. Is he here? Yeah. Quinn? Did it go all right when you got home? Yeah, I think so. Told Jessica I was working for the CIA. She seemed to believe me. Asked if you were involved. I said no. Okay. So, what am I doing here? Um, the deal we talked about. You helping us get Abu Nazir in exchange for immunity. If you're still willing, it starts now. I'll help you through it. What do you want me to do? We're hoping you can identify someone in a photo. That's it? For the moment, yeah. I mean, generally won't be this easy, but for now, that's what we need. Never seen him before. You're sure? Yeah. And by the way, I don't appreciate having a car on my tail when I'm driving my daughter to school. Lot of things about this arrangement far from ideal. You know what? I think I should get going. I have a busy day ahead of me. Quinn : You're absolutely sure? You're absolutely sure that you don't know anything that could help us? Yeah, like, I said, I've never seen him before. That's not what I asked, though, is it? I don't know anything about him. But you know something. Carrie : Brody? I told you about this guy. The tailor from Gettysburg who made my suicide vest. Carrie : Yeah. We still can't find him. You're not gonna. He's dead. Roya asked me to move him on the day of that fund-raiser I missed. I was supposed to take him to a safe house, and, uh... (clears throat) ...he died on the way. He died? Yeah, it was an accident. Yeah? Yeah. He thought I was trying to kill him, and he bolted, and he fell. I have got a six-man surveillance team round the clock watching a storefront in Gettysburg, waiting for somebody that you couldn't be bothered to tell us is never coming back! I didn't know you were watching the storefront. You never tell me anything. The deal is full f*cking disclosure, not pick and choose what you say! Wait here. (sighs heavily) (whispering): The guy is a pathological liar. No, it's my fault. I never pressed him in the debrief. Yeah, and I wonder why that was. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know, Carrie. In the interrogation room, you said you wanted him to leave his wife and run away with you? And you put a knife through his hand. The difference being, what I did worked. So don't worry about  my  objectivity. Worry about your own. At least we know now that the tailor's not coming back. We can lose the surveillance, go in and search the shop finally. Maybe find something. I'll put a forensics team together and take him to Gettysburg. Thank you. The tailor's dead. He handled their munitions. If this new guy turns out to be his replacement, we need a line on him fast. We need to run Brody back to Roya. Have him try to get something out of her about the guy's identity. Yeah, good luck with that. Take a look at him. The guy's a f*cking mess. I think he's all we've got. Fine. Your call..ut Carrie... Don't trust him. Yeah, you said. (horn honking, rain pouring) So you're a Marine? I am. It shocks me, too. With Tom Walker? Yeah. And Mikey here. So do you know what happened? To make him crack? I have a few theories on that subject, yes. Actually, like I said on the phone, Detective, we were hoping that you could give us some facts about how he died. Oh, I found him here. Homeless guy heard a gunshot, alerted a patrol officer who called Homicide. He was lying, uh..ea, head there. Single bullet right between the eyes. Point-blank, more or less. Blood spatter, uh... there. You probably can't see anything now. Single nine-millimeter casing on the ground right there. Lauder : It's nine-millimeter. Standard military issue. It's standard everything issue. Sure. But you know what I'm thinking? No, Lauder, what are you thinking? This place? Not exactly public. I wouldn't step foot in here at night, except with someone I knew and trusted. Sir, can we see your report? Report? I thought you knew. After 20 minutes, the CIA swooped in and shut us down. CIA. I wonder what elected official they were covering up for. Lauder. What national figure. Shut up! Uh, maybe I'll, uh... I'll give you two a moment. What was our deal? No mentioning Brody. Well, don't pretend you're not thinking he's suspect #1. You're a military intelligence officer. There must be some way you can find out what happened. Yeah, I might know a guy. You might know a guy. That's f*cking rousing. At the CIA. I reckon he's not going to give me any classified information. He might just nod if we're on the right track, though. Okay? (elevator bell dings, indistinct voice over PA) (rhythmic beeping and machines whooshing) Do I know you? No. I'm sorry. Do you know my mother? No. I... I was looking for someone else. Will she be okay? Your mom? They don't know. She  was  doing okay. And a few hours ago, a clot kicked loose in her head. Some idiots hit her in a car, then took off. So..hich one's yours? Who are you visiting? I'm... not. You said you were looking for someone. Oh. Um..y dad. He's a doctor. He's, um... a cardiologist. A doctor. You're lucky. I didn't know him when I was little. He wasn't around. The nurse-- she said call our priest. (rhythmic beeping, indistinct chattering) (door opening) Man : Have a line going. (indistinct chattering) (loud breathing) (indistinct chattering) (breathing loudly) (panting) (loud panting) (banging on outer door) (panting) (elevator bell dings) (door opening) (door squeaks shut) It's late. I'm just gathering my thoughts. I'm going to hit Brody tomorrow about approaching Roya. So I've heard. (sighs) I also heard it got a little nasty with Quinn today. Yeah, well, in my opinion, it  starts  nasty with that guy, but whatever. Wait. Is that why you're here? I just want to make sure you're good. He said not to trust Brody, Saul. (laughs) He's right. Yeah, well, if you'll remember, I'm the one who came up with that theory, back when everyone else was calling him the patriot of the century. You don't know what it's like. What? Having everyone assume you're at your worst, like you can't see straight. No one thinks that. Really? (scoffs) I don't, not at all. I do worry about you being so close to Brody again. It's not like before, Saul. Good. I saw his suicide tape. My eyes are open. How could they not be? That's all I wanted to hear. (tires squeal) 
 
 Man : All clear. Make sure the evidence response team has whatever support they need. And crack the whip, huh? We should have been in here weeks ago. All right, everybody, we're looking for names of contacts, material suppliers, anything out of the ordinary. If you have a question, ask. No detail is too small. Uh, you? Chapman, sir. You and you, come with me. Start here. (chimes tinkling) Small town. Likely to be some theorizing about our presence here, so, any lookie-loos drop by wondering what we're up to, tell them, um... Tell them... What? Sales tax audit. (sighs) Greg said you had a committee meeting at 10:00. I thought I'd grab you beforehand. What do you want? (sighs) The photo we showed you yesterday. I told you, I don't know who the guy is. I know. Well, it's the truth. I believe you. But his appearance here means whatever Nazir has planned is happening now, and that guy is a part of it. We can't ID him in any of our databases. We need your help. (grunts) Roya has an interview with Congressman Mackie at noon today in this building. Well, I can't just walk up to her and ask her who the guy is. I know. Oh, she tells me what to do. That's how this works. You told her we've been seeing each other. Right? I told her we've been f*cking, yeah. Okay. Good. So, tell her you were at my place, you overheard me talking on the phone about a Hezbollah operative who recently entered the country. Is that what he is? Hezbollah? That's our guess. What if it's wrong? It shouldn't be a problem. Shouldn't be... Brody, this is how it works. You put out a little feeler, you see what comes back. Just don't push it, and you'll be fine. Okay? You ask me to approach Roya, I say it's a bad idea, then you do this. For what? What is this? s*x? Understanding? If that doesn't work, then what? You remind me of the deal that we made, how much it hurts, you're even bringing it up, how my entire family will be destroyed if you're forced to tell them the truth? Brody... Don't worry. I'll talk to her for you. The new phone I gave you-- have it on you. (sighs) (elevator bell dings) Mike Faber? Yes. Saul Berenson. I understand you had some questions about the investigation of Tom Walker's death a year ago. Yeah. I'm meeting a friend of mine here, Glenn Peterson? Glenn passed your request for information onto me. This way. Okay, do you want to tell me what's going on? Please. (sighs) Sit. (sighs) We spoke once before, you and I. I remember. It was right after Brody got back. You, uh, strong-armed me into getting him to enlist. What I did was discuss with you what was best for Sergeant Brody and his family, and for this country, which is what we need to talk about again. I'm told you've been making inquiries into Thomas Walker's death. I have a few questions, yeah, but... I don't need a GS-15 to answer them. I'm afraid I don't have any answers for you, Major. I'm surprised. Homicide cop told me that the, uh, CIA took over the investigation. Oh, we did. And nothing yet. So, in other words, sir, I'm being stonewalled. Well, I wouldn't use those words. Do you know who killed Tom Walker? No. Because I'm thinking it was a coconspirator. Saul : Major? You're being told by fellow intelligence officers, respectfully at this point, not to pursue your unauthorized freelance investigation into a matter of national security. Nod your head if you understand. (indistinct chattering) Thank you. Roya! Roya : Congressman Brody. I hope this is Congressional business. No. Then follow protocol. I'll contact you. I got something I think you should know. Okay, here we go. I was at Carrie Mathison's apartment last night. She got a phone call, late. Heard her talking about some person just landed in the country. Hezbollah, she said. Who called her? I don't know. But you're sure she said Hezbollah? Uh-huh. Brody : It's a pretty distinctive word. I just thought you'd want to hear. I do. Thank you. What happened to your hand? Oh, home improvements. Hurts like a m*therf*cker. (touch tones sounding) Carrie : Okay, Virgil, what happened to our audio? We lost audio. Virgil : No, they're just not talking. Carrie : Well, f*cking say something, Brody, say something. Virgil : They're worried about that guy back there. FBI forensics went into the tailor shop. After sitting on it for two weeks, they finally went in today. Any idea why? Brody : No. Will they find anything? They might. (school bell ringing) Dana, what the f*ck? You've been avoiding me. I'm not avoiding anyone. I'm standing in the middle of the hall. She wasn't all right, Finn. She was dying. What? She died in the middle of the night. We can't talk about this, Dana. If not here, then, okay, where? Nowhere. We can't talk about it anywhere. We have to tell someone. No, we don't. We agreed to stay quiet. Yeah, that was before she... died. It's even more important now. Finn... I met her daughter. You what? At the hospital. She's all alone now. You went to the hospital. Are you crazy? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? What the f*ck is wrong...? Jesus... your dad is a congressman. Mine is going to be president. Yeah, and her mom is dead. She needs our help. No, I do. All right? I need our help. I was driving, not you. This comes down on me, and, swear to God, I'd rather die than have my father find out. If you say anything about this, I'm dead. I mean it. Anything? Doesn't seem like it, not yet. (phone ringing) Yeah, Carrie. Brody just talked to Roya. Yeah, how'd that go? I'm not quite sure. She knows you're at Gettysburg. She does. How? Maybe they're watching. I don't know. She said there's something there. Have you found anything? A lot of cigarette butts and receipts. Seems the guy was quite a record-keeper. I got six guys going through it all. Yeah, I don't think she was talking about receipts. I think it's something bigger. Like what? I don't know. Well, what did she say? It wasn't what she said exactly. It was... Another one of your hunches? Just... I'll keep my eyes open. Thanks. Galvez. Yeah? Call for reinforcement. I want armed backup here. So, uh, what is it that you're looking for exactly? Something I lent your dad. Good luck finding it. Mom says it's like the wreck of the  Hesperus  in here, which I don't really get what that is. The  Hesperus  is a ship that sank a long time ago, bud. Some guy, uh, he wrote a poem about it. Hey, Chris, do me a favor. Go into the kitchen and grab a flashlight. It's a little dark back here. Okay. ♪ ♪ Galvez : Sir. We've got, uh, FBI SWAT coming. They're about an hour out. State troopers will be here sooner. Good. Can I ask you what this is about? (clattering) (grunting) ♪ ♪ (tools whirring) ♪ ♪ (gasping) (explosion on television) (door opens) Mike, what brings you here? Chris : He needed to borrow something from Dad. Right. Could I talk to you a second? What is it? You know I care about you, right? Of course. No, not of course. I mean, I care about you, and I'm not sure I should tell you this, but I think you need to know. What? What is it? When Lauder came over here the other day, making accusations about Brody... He was drunk. Drunk, yeah, but not wrong. See, I've been looking into some stuff the past couple weeks. What stuff? Who killed Tom Walker. It was Brody, Jess. No. Yes, it was. I just checked his ammunition in the garage. I know this is hard to hear; it's hard to say. He hasn't been okay since he got back, and I'm worried about you, about the kids because I love you, and he's not getting better. I know. I know he's not who he was. (softly): But he's working for the CIA. What? He told me, Mike. He swore it was the truth. Okay, it's, it's not that simple. Whatever he said-- there's got to be some kind of a cover-up. I-I really think you should go. I'm just trying to look out for you. I know... but don't. Please. We're doing the best we can here. Just go. (explosions and grunting on television) (door opens) (door closes) I need a minute with the congressman. Wait. Who are you? I'm a constituent with some urgent business. Sir. It's okay. You should go home, Betsy. It's late. Did you know? What? Did you know? Know what? What are you talking about? I have got seven casualties in Gettysburg. Slow down. Did you know that was going to happen? How could I have? Just answer the question! Have you been lying to me? When you talked to Roya... You made me do that. ...you told her something. You must have. No. Don't you lie to me! Carrie. Don't you touch me. Don't you f*cking dare! I didn't lie to you. I don't know anything about any of that. I don't know what you're saying. Really. Shh. Hey. (sobbing) Hey. Shh. (sobbing)
