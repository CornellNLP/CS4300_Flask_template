 Hey, you, uh, you have a second? 
 Depends on what you want. 
 It's about work, actually. 
 What did, uh, judge Redding have to do with the father Andrew case? 
 We thought we might need her to weigh in on what she knows about the judge on our case. 
 So, it's just a coincidence she was also the judge on the Nate Lahey case? 
 That's just a coincidence. 
 So... 
 Are you gonna be nice and come over later, like you said? 
 Does a dog like to bury his bone? 
 You two are that stupid, huh? 
 Yo, Franky D. 
 When we hitting the ladymarket in fishtown again? 
 Really? You want to talk about picking up other girls in front of your girlfriend? 
 [Chuckling] W-what? 
 No, man. I... 
 He knows, Asher. 
 You told him? 
 No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students. 
 But don't worry...  I won't tell Annalise. 
 Or maybe I will. 
 I'm gonna think on that. 
 [Knock on door] 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Speak. 
 [Woman gasping] 
 [Indistinct arguing] 
 The cop could identify us. 
 We he caught her coming back from the sorority house soaking wet... 
 Duped us. Her original confession tape is true. 
 I keep telling you that she killed Lila. 
 [Indistinct arguing] 
 Shut up! [Arguing stops] 
 Please, Wes. Make sense of this. 
 Everything they're saying is true. 
 So you think Rebecca killed Lila? 
 Sam might've been innocent. 
 [Door slams] 
 [Sighs] 
 They've all lost their minds. 
 That's the only thing I know for sure right now. 
 And I'm gonna clear everything up, the entire mess. 
 But first, I need you to tell me that it's okay to take the tape off of your mouth. 
 You're not gonna do anything stupid? 
 I'm so sorry about all of this, Rebecca. 
 Help!! 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Lila : Do you lie this much to your wife? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Your receptionist said you were out of town. 
 At Yale, right? 
 You're taking that job? 
 I'm just giving a lecture. 
 What's going on? You were fine when I left. 
 I tried to fix it. Have s*x with Griffin. 
 So he'd think the baby's his, but he wouldn't. 
 He just kept talking about God. 
 It's all gonna be okay. You still have time. 
 I'm not having the abortion. 
 I know that. I just... 
 Look, I'll be back in a few more days, okay? 
 And we'll talk more about it then. 
 I need to see you now. 
 I told you, I have my lecture. 
 Can you cancel it? 
 You know I can't do that. Because you want the job. 
 So that way you don't have to deal with me. 
 That is not why. 
 Look, e... [Sighs] Everything is gonna be okay. 
 I'll call you later, and we'll figure everything out. 
 Okay? 
 Lila. 
 I'm telling Annalise. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Sighs] 
 We're gonna try this again. 
 No one here is gonna hurt you. 
 I'm not gonna let that happen. 
 But you have to behave. 
 Otherwise... Frank? 
 We stow you in the basement. 
 You won't like it. 
 I'll be good. 
 Un-tape her hands, too. 
 What? No, she's gonna... 
 She'll just run out of here. We're not monsters! 
 We don't tie people up and hold them captive against their will. 
 Who have you all become? 
 What do we do? 
 You tell me. Where's Bonnie? 
 Still trying to get ahold of her. 
 Find her. 
 [Cellphone buzzing] 
 [Sighs] 
 Was that Frank again? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Yeah, it kind of does. 
 Not to mention, it's hard to focus when his grizzly man beard keeps popping up in my head. 
 He's not gonna tell Annalise about us. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I have personal knowledge of things he's done that are way worse than what we're doing. 
 Now, can you focus, or should I go ask the cute guy next door for help? 
 [Chuckles] No. 
 Homeboy needs no help in the snack-attack department. 
 Mm. 
 Sam : I was afraid you'd think I hurt her. 
 But I could never do that. You know me. 
 So I skipped my lecture, came back to see her, but I couldn't find her. 
 She stopped answering her phone. 
 Sam : I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her. 
 Didn't you? No. God, no. 
 Let's have the trial. 
 You've all convinced yourselves that we were wrong, that Sam didn't kill Lila. 
 That we got Rebecca off for nothing. 
 And you feel unfairly persecuted, trapped. 
 I don't blame you. 
 So let's be fair to everyone and figure it out once and for all. 
 Let's finally give Rebecca her day in court. 
 [cellphone rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 Give me some privacy. 
 Okay. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Did you get the job? 
 No. They haven't decided yet. 
 But you told them you were open to moving, even if that meant leaving your wife? 
 Annie...  I know. 
 We'll talk about it once you get the job. 
 How'd the lecture go? 
 [Pounding on door] 
 [Crying] I need to see Annalise Keating. 
 Is this about Frank? 
 I don't know who Frank is. [Sobs] 
 Is Annalise in there? 
 Do you need a lawyer? 
 You can talk to me. 
 No. I just need to talk to Annalise. 
 Tell her it's about her husband. 
 She's not here. 
 That's her car, isn't it? 
 Annalise! Listen. 
 I don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but I guarantee you're going to regret this. 
 So just take a deep breath, calm down, and go home. 
 Leave, or I call 911. 
 Fine. 
 But tell her I came to tell her something important. 
 He can't keep it a secret anymore. 
 Who was that? 
 Some girl looking for Frank. 
 Oh, good God. 
 [Crying] He knew she was pregnant. 
 Oh, it's just you. 
 Who else did you leave a thousand messages for? 
 What's going on? Not much. 
 Just figuring out if Rebecca killed Lila after all. 
 Bonnie, glad you could make it. 
 I'm sorry. I was just at a dinner... 
 This is a recording I made of Rebecca's psych evaluation with Sam. 
 You taped that? 
 With all the lies you've told, I'm glad I did. Watch it. 
 Look for any discrepancies with what she said compared to police interviews. 
 One hour. 
 Then I want to hear each of your cases against the defendant. 
 Connor : If Rebecca's case went to trial, then the prosecution would have argued that Griffin and Rebecca were so high that they killed Lila after she found them sleeping together. 
 What if Rebecca acted alone? 
 In her taped confession, Rebecca stated... 
 I was standing there watching Griffin pin her down. 
 "His hands were around her neck." 
 Meaning Rebecca already knew Lila was strangled even though that was not yet public knowledge. 
 Look at this. 
 So, how did you end up with her phone? 
 She left it at my apartment the night before. 
 But according to Sam's phone records, Sam talked to Lila on her burner several times after that. 
 What was her motive then? 
 It's obvious... jealousy. 
 Lila was beautiful. She was wealthy. 
 But nowhere in this confession tape do the detectives say Lila was strangled. 
 Because Lila still had her phone, which means Rebecca was lying during her psych eval. 
 When she found out that Lila was "breaking up with her," 
 Rebecca snapped. Thus explaining... 
 She took Lila's phone...  
 Teen offenders with multiple arrests... 
 Why Rebecca's DNA...  
 The photos of Sam to pin the murder... 
 Wes... 
 I don't have anything. 
 Michaela : Of course you do. 
 Rudy. He saw Rebecca the night Lila was killed wet, and... and she dosed him with PCP because she knew he was a potential witness. 
 PCP doesn't put you in a mental institution. 
 Rebecca's right. 
 And where's the actual evidence that this was a crime of passion? 
 Or are we supposed to just trust you, Mr. Walsh? 
 And the detectives could have told Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession. 
 And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer. 
 I mean, where's the facts? 
 An explanation of how she got Lila's body up to the water tank? 
 She didn't. They were already hanging out up there. 
 We never did that. 
 Annalise : Exactly. 
 Because everything that you're presenting is speculation. 
 You've been working with me for nearly six months now, and this is the crap case you present me with? 
 [Knock on door] 
 Do I need to get the tape? 
 [Door opens] 
 Bonnie : Can I help you? 
 Emily Sinclair. 
 I have an appointment with Ms. Keating. 
 Regarding? 
 I'm the new prosecutor assigned to the Nate Lahey case. 
 Ms. Keating was kind enough to agree to give me a statement before trial. 
 Now is actually not a good time. 
 Hm. Well, she did confirm with me yesterday. 
 I'm sorry. I'll have her call you. 
 Ms. Sinclair... 
 Would it be okay if we met at your office? 
 I have some house guests who could get in our way. 
 How about we meet at my office in an hour? 
 Great. 
 Bonnie : You're testifying for the prosecution? 
 Of course. Frank? 
 Don't let them out of your sight. 
 Got it. 
 Emily : According to your initial interview, you went to Mr. Lahey's apartment after your fight with your husband? 
 Yes. 
 How did Mr. Lahey react? 
 He was concerned for my welfare. 
 Was this before or after you engaged in sexual activity? 
 Before. 
 Did you have s*x more than once? 
 Is that question really relevant? 
 I need a detailed timeline of that night as we have no other witnesses to Mr. Lahey's movements. 
 We had s*x one time. 
 And then you made your way home. 
 Yes. That's when I noticed that he was following me. 
 Mr. Lahey followed you home that night? 
 Yes. 
 He wanted to make sure that I got home safely. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, but you never reported this in your first interview. 
 I wanted to protect Nate. 
 Protect him? 
 When Nate and I arrived at the house, Sam was in the driveway getting into his car, about to leave town. 
 Sam? 
 Sam was drunk, yelling at me. 
 Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down. 
 Sam!! 
 Sam wouldn't. 
 So Nate had to hold him back until I got inside. 
 So, let's be clear... 
 You're claiming that there was a physical altercation between Mr. Lahey and your husband that night. 
 [Voice breaking] I'm not claiming anything. 
 It happened. 
 I'm outside the coffee shop. Where are you? 
 Lila, I drove all the way down here. 
 Talk to me. 
 I'm on the roof. 
 I just walked in on Griffin screwing someone else. 
 Can you believe that? 
 Wasn't God, I guess. 
 It was me. 
 That's not true. 
 It is. You don't want me. 
 It'd be easier if I just... Went away. 
 Me and the baby. 
 I'm coming to you there, okay? 
 Griffin : Lila! [Cellphone beeps] 
 Damn it, Lila, where the hell are you?! 
 I looked for Lila all night. 
 I called her friends. 
 I went to her room. 
 I was probably there when she was getting strangled on that roof. 
 Griffin called Lila 28 times that night. 
 It's on the phone records. 
 But you didn't call her once. 
 'Cause you already knew she was dead, right? 
 Or I'd just had s*x with her boyfriend, and I knew she didn't want to talk to me. 
 [Cellphone buzzing] 
 How's it going with you two? Do you trust him? 
 Shut up. 
 Been together about as long as me and Wes. 
 I trusted him. 
 You were right not to trust him. 
 After he lied to us about that night, that Annalise knew...  
 You think this is gonna work? 
 You can just get inside my head? 
 You're all spending so much time trying to figure out if I'm a killer when we already know somebody who is. 
 And he got us to go along with his plan that night. 
 He was doing that to save you. 
 Yeah, and then he turned on me. 
 Probably just like he did to his mother. 
 She killed herself when he was 12. 
 At least that's what he says. 
 Laurel : So? Did you get anything out of her? 
 You mean anything other than the fact that she insinuated that Waitlist killed his mother? 
 She said that? 
 It's not true, is it? 
 No. See? 
 She's a pathological liar. 
 Or maybe she's been honest this whole time. 
 She keeps lying, yes, but isn't that what we would all do if we looked guilty of a crime we didn't commit? 
 Meanwhile, we know Sam was on the roof that night. 
 So, what? You team Rebecca now? 
 I'm team whatever really freaking happened. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Asher : Hey! 
 Hey, let me in! 
 Since when do we ever lock this door? 
 Here we go again. 
 [Knocking continues] 
 Frankie D! What it do? 
 Office is closed today. 
 Then why is Connor's car out here? 
 My guess is that you don't want me here 'cause you're pissed about me and Bonnie. 
 Shut up and go home. No. 
 First I want your word you're not gonna tell A.K. about us. 
 What I choose to tell or not tell Annalise... 
 What the hell are you doing?! 
 Is none of your business. 
 Look, man. 
 She's not just a hookup for me. 
 It... it actually feels pretty real. 
 Whatever. 
 Just go home. 
 You guys all here? What'd I say? 
 Look, I'm not gonna let you blackball me from this office. 
 If everyone else is working today, well, then so am I. 
 Okay, fine. I was wrong. 
 But I'm still not leaving this office until you swear to me that you're not gonna tell A.K. about us. 
 Seriously, man. 
 Just 'cause my facial hair's not exactly as luscious as yours doesn't mean I can't still kick your ass. 
 What do you need, Mr. Millstone? 
 Don't be so mad. 
 I just wanted to make sure Frank wasn't gonna out us. 
 And you risked Annalise finding out in the process. 
 Are you...  Are you embarrassed of me? 
 Is that... is that why you don't want her to know? 
 No. That is not... 
 [Sighs] 
 Annalise and I have a complicated relationship. 
 Like, she's a lesbian who's in love with you complicated, or... ? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You need to go. 
 Not without a little sugar first. 
 Michaela : She texted someone. 
 What? 
 "Eggs 911. Lawyer's house." 
 What the hell does "eggs 911" even mean? 
 And whose number is it? 
 I don't know. 
 Why don't you call it and find out? 
 Whoever it is, they have my number now. And they know Rebecca's here. 
 We'll deal with it later. 
 Just like you'll deal with me later? 
 What are you gonna do to me, by the way? 
 Are you just gonna leave me down here forever? 
 Or are you gonna kill me Sam-style? 
 Everybody upstairs. 
 Especially you. 
 Lila. 
 Lila? 
 Lila : You came. 
 Of course. 
 Get down from there. 
 Just tell me you didn't go to my house. 
 Relax. 
 I just knew saying that was the only way to get you to come here. 
 I came here because I was worried about you. 
 You mean you were worried Annalise would find out about me. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Now, look. 
 I know how messed up all this is, but I am here now. And after now? 
 When you go home to her? 
 I'm alone again, having a baby all by myself. 
 You don't have to do this, Lila. You're 21 years old... 
 I want this baby even if you don't. 
 So stop trying to change my mind. 
 I'm not going to. 
 You said you loved me over and over. 
 But you don't, do you? 
 You love her. 
 No. I don't. 
 Don't say that if you don't mean it. 
 I mean it. 
 I don't love her anymore. 
 I love you. 
 [Sobs] 
 
 
 
 Annalise : I bet you the boyfriend did it. 
 You've been evaluated before. 
 Juvie. 
 Let's get to it. You want to know if I killed Lila, right? 
 No, no. This was a standardized psychological test. 
 Still barking up that tree. 
 It just helps present you as a credible witness. 
 One of them killed Lila. I'm just trying to figure out who. 
 So... Bonnie and Asher? 
 Gives you the heebie jeebies, right? 
 It's just surprising, especially since she threatened to fire me if I started seeing you. 
 But you didn't listen to her, now, did you? 
 You're not seriously thinking about s*x right now. 
 I always think about s*x when you're around. 
 Stop it. 
 Frank, what's the endgame here? 
 If Rebecca talks to the police, we all go down. 
 But that's not gonna happen, right? 
 Because you're gonna take care of it? 
 Her? 
 You think I'm gonna whack Rebecca? 
 Is that what you think I am? Some freaking hit man? 
 Wow. No wonder you dumped me. 
 Frank, can you tell Bonnie I had to run out? 
 I have lunch scheduled with Aiden's mother, and she... 
 Do whatever you want. 
 What's wrong with him? 
 Nothing. You're going to have lunch with Aiden's mother right now? 
 She'll show up here if I don't go. 
 What does she want? What do you think? 
 She wants the ring back. The real one, not this fake. 
 Mary : How's your new semester going? 
 I imagine well, knowing how well you always have done in school. 
 Now, last I remember, you were interviewing for some associate's jobs, which I think is...  
 I'm not giving the ring back. 
 Aiden gave it to me with a promise to spend the rest of our lives together. 
 This technically means it was not an engagement ring, and according to the Pennsylvania supreme court case of Lindh V. Surma...  
 I'm not here for the ring. 
 Michaela, I'm here for you. 
 Whatever this break you and Aiden have been on, it's lasted long enough. 
 Tell your son that. 
 I did. Many times. 
 Let me be clear here. 
 I was unfair to you. 
 I apologize for that and all the hurtful things I said to you. 
 I have seen the error of my ways, and you're not the girl I said you were. 
 So... Would you reach out to him? 
 I know he acts strong, but he's waiting to hear from you... 
 I am that girl. 
 The one that tried to slap you, from the backwater bayou, that Southern ghetto trash. 
 I just spent a long time trying to hide her away so I could claim the prince. 
 Your shining, black, perfect son of a prince. 
 And I did. 
 But that girl isn't me. 
 Sweetheart... 
 I know what you're trying to do here, win this contest between us. 
 But this is not some ploy. 
 I want you in our family. 
 He just needs a little prodding, that's all. 
 He's gay, Mrs. Walker. 
 Aiden's gay or bi or experimental or... 
 I don't know what he is. 
 But I think you do. 
 Or else you would not be here scared and nervous, begging a girl you do not like very much to marry your son. 
 I'm sorry. 
 He doesn't love me. 
 But here's the thing... 
 I love me. 
 So I'm done. 
 [Door opens] 
 I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved. 
 Because of you. 
 I saw you for who you were. 
 I recognized you. 
 You're angry, you lash out, you use people. 
 But only because you don't know better. 
 Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone. 
 And here is a boy who so clearly loved you. 
 He still does. 
 Even if he doesn't know who you are anymore. 
 And he hates himself right now for doing this to you. 
 He came to us so innocent. 
 And he believed you when you said you didn't do it. 
 But now he's grown up. 
 You and I have made him grow up. 
 Rebecca, tell me what happened that night. 
 That's all you need to do to do right by him. 
 I did it. 
 I killed Lila. 
 Or maybe Sam did it. 
 That'd be easier for you, right? 
 So you could live with yourself for turning on your own husband. 
 Who knows who did it. 
 Annalise : Get up. 
 I said stand. 
 You feel bad because you dragged us into this mess. 
 You want to wear that on your sleeve. 
 But I'm done making you feel okay while you sit around here and mope. 
 You want to make this right? 
 Be a man and go and get your girlfriend to talk. 
 She doesn't trust me anymore. 
 Then make her, damn it! 
 Are you a man or not?! 
 Sure he shouldn't take the trophy? 
 Look at me. Look at what you did to me. 
 You said you loved me. 
 I still do. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I told you everything about me. 
 Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me. 
 But you know what? You're the worst one. 
 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you. 
 You don't. 
 You just need to tell me what happened that night. 
 I have told you. I've told you again and again. 
 You don't believe me. You lied about Rudy. 
 Oh, my God. Will you shut up about frickin' Rudy? 
 Not until you tell me what happened to him. 
 Please, Rebecca. 
 I want to trust you. 
 Tell them all I was wrong, that you're not a bad person. 
 But you have to give me a reason to. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 You were right. 
 I gave him PCP. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Shivering] 
 Rudy : What happened to you? 
 What do you want? Nothing. 
 Just... Is everything okay? 
 I heard you fighting earlier with Lila, and... 
 How the hell do you know her name? 
 Th-the walls are really thin. 
 Still, I shouldn't have been spying. 
 Do you feel like hanging out? 
 Rebecca : But I gave him something else, too. 
 It's called... Purple X. 
 You don't get high a lot, do you? 
 No. 
 But people always tell me I should. 
 I mean, I take something for my anxiety and stuff, but people are still always like, "lighten up, Rudy. 
 You're such a stressball." 
 Well, this'll definitely help with that. 
 I'd never taken it before, but I-I knew what it could do if you took too much. 
 Rudy : Please! Mommy, please! 
 911, what's your emergency? 
 Help me! 
 My neighbor's having a nervous breakdown. 
 Don't let them kill me, please! 
 I don't want to try it, mommy! Please! 
 Why are you letting me die?! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Aaaah! 
 Please hurry. 
 Why are you letting me die?! 
 I'm an awful person. I know, I know. 
 I was just so scared that he was gonna talk to the police. 
 Why were you wet? 
 Because of the water tank. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Laughter echoing] 
 Wes : She was hiding in the water tank. 
 She went onto the roof to find Lila, and she did. 
 Dead in the water. 
 Then she heard people coming. 
 And she knew they'd assume she killed Lila, so she panicked. 
 She was on drugs, not thinking... 
 Then why didn't she ever tell us that? 
 Because she knew no one would believe her. 
 You can't possibly be buying this. 
 Wes, she's manipulating you again. 
 She's messed up! 
 That's what happens when you grow up like she did. 
 People take advantage of you. 
 You think everyone's out to screw you, so you do stupid things like lie and deal drugs and hurt people before they can hurt you. 
 But that doesn't make you a murderer. 
 Please... 
 I believe her. 
 We're done trying this case. 
 Come on! 
 What?! She's a pathological liar! 
 What have I told you time and time again? 
 There's no truth in the courtroom. 
 There's just your version of what happened versus theirs. 
 That's how the justice system works. 
 It's not what's right and what's fair, it's who tells the most convincing story. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 And right now, none of you have been able to convince me that Rebecca did this. 
 So, what do we do now? 
 [Ringing continues] 
 The hell if I know. 
 [Sighs] 
 Bonnie : Annalise... 
 I had no choice. 
 The prosecutor approached me. I had to make a statement. 
 You mean make up a statement. 
 I know how it looks. 
 All you do is lie. 
 Again and again, then you expect me to trust you. 
 Nate, please, there's a reason. 
 You're trying to win my case. I know. 
 If I had physical contact with Sam that night, it explains why my print is on his ring. 
 The jury will have their reasonable doubt, and I go free. 
 Tell me I'm wrong. 
 I know you didn't kill Sam, and I know you think I set you up to go down for this. 
 I didn't. 
 It's hard to believe, I understand, but you need to try. 
 I'm doing everything that I can to help you. 
 Trust me. 
 All right? Will you do that? 
 Try to trust me. 
 [Door closes] 
 We know what to do. 
 We pin Sam's murder on Rebecca. 
 We know that seems hard, especially since we already did the same thing with Nate, but it makes sense. 
 Sam killed Lila, so Rebecca killed Sam. 
 Connor : And then those of us that actually killed Sam, we testify that Rebecca was the one that did it. 
 You just have to convince Waitlist. 
 We thought we can get the surveillance tape from the store where Nate first approached Rebecca. 
 That way, we can establish that she came to the house with the thumb drive and she put...  
 Stop. 
 We can't go changing stories with the police, telling a different version every time we feel like it. 
 Told you. 
 But... 
 It's over, miss Pratt. We have to let it go. 
 What? No! 
 We haven't proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 She's gonna go straight to the police. 
 Not if I convince her not to. 
 How? 
 I'm gonna ask her nicely. 
 Michaela : [Scoffs] 
 That's not gonna work. 
 Laurel : We abducted her. 
 Taped her to a chair. 
 She'll get over it. 
 Michaela : No, she won't! 
 She only thinks of herself. 
 That's not true. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You're not still into her? 
 Laurel : Please, Frank, there has to be something else we can do. 
 Don't you dare put this on Frank. 
 We have gone above and beyond here to try to fix this for all of you because this, from the very start, has been your mess, each of you. 
 And Frank and I have been more than willing to try to save all your stupid asses. 
 Not to mention Annalise, who for reasons beyond me, continues to protect you. 
 And after what you did to her, what you took from her... 
 Annalise : Rebecca! Rebecca! 
 What the hell happened? 
 She was gone when I got down there. 
 Who was it? 
 Tell me. Who let her go? 
 Who let her go, damn it?! 
 I didn't let her go. 
 You have to believe me. 
 I do. 
 All of this... 
 Rebecca, Sam, Nate... 
 It's all my fault. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 [Sobbing] 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Sam : I don't love her anymore. 
 I love you. 
 I know that now. 
 It's just... 
 Just taken me a while to accept it. 
 But Annalise and I, we... 
 We've been over for years now. 
 And when I met you... 
 [Sniffles] 
 I haven't felt this way in a long time, and I don't ever want to not feel this way again. 
 It's you, Lila. 
 I love you. 
 Annalise : Because what matters now is that... 
 Sam killed Lila. 
 He did. 
 Sam killed her. 
 We don't know that. 
 No. 
 But it's what the two of us need to choose to believe. 
 Hey. You don't know me. 
 My name's Nate Lahey. 
 Annalise Keating gave me your number. 
 With everything that's happened, it's the version of the truth that makes the most sense and will let us move on. 
 Rebecca : Griffin is not the guy that you think he is, all right? 
 I-I hardly even had to try. That was not his first time. 
 Okay? Please...  Please, just call me back. 
 100 bucks she comes home without her underwear again and brags about screwing some lacrosse player with [mockingly] The prettiest pen1s ever. 
 [Normal voice] Like, what pen1s is ever pretty? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Uh... Hi. Can I help you? 
 Emily Sinclair. 
 I'm the new prosecutor on the Sam Keating murder trial. 
 Do you have time for a few questions? 
 Uh... About...  About what? 
 Annalise, mostly. 
 Not that that should surprise you. 
 So, can I come in, or would you rather us do this at the police station? 
 Annalise : Say it. 
 Say it, and it will become true. 
 Sam killed Lila. 
 Sam killed...  
 Rebecca : Lila! 
 Look, don't ignore me if you're up here. 
 Michaela : Well, look who finally made it. 
 I'm on my third. You need to catch up. 
 I figure if "eggs 911" and Rebecca are about to take us all down and this is our last night of freedom, I want to be drunk enough to take home one of those bankers. 
 Michaela... 
 How the hell do you have that? 
 I found it Connor's car as soon as you said you'd lost it. 
 You were a disaster that night. 
 I could tell you wanted to go to the police, but I knew if you thought they could find it, you'd stay quiet. 
 Rebecca : Fine. 
 Ignore me. 
 [Cellphone buzzing] 
 Connor : Oliver? 
 What's the matter? Are you sick? 
 Depends on what you mean. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I was gonna tell you when you called, but you didn't have your results yet. 
 And I thought maybe you'd have it, too. 
 [Voice breaking] And that we'd be in this together. 
 Oliver... 
 I tested positive. 
 Rebecca : Look, I know you're up there. 
 Just... 
 Just... just let me explain, please, why... 
 [grunts] 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 Don't be dead! Please don't be dead! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no! 
 [Sniffles] 
 I haven't felt this way in a long time, and I don't ever want to not feel this way again. 
 It's you, Lila. 
 I love you.

 I need to tell Annalise right now. 
 I'll call you when it's done.

 Asher : Okay. 
 If Frank's not a lawyer, then what is he? 
 Is he Annalise's bodyguard? 
 [Gasping] 
 Frank : I know you said not to worry, but she's snooping around everywhere. 
 You want me to handle it, just say the word. 
 [Gasping] 
 Is that what you think I am? Some freaking hit man? 
 [Gasping stops] 
 Annalise : Sam killed Lila. 
 Annalise and Wes : Sam killed Lila. Sam killed Lila. Sam killed Lila. Sam killed Lila. Sam killed Lila. Sam killed Lila. Sam killed Lila. 
 See? Doesn't that feel better? 
 [Sighs] I don't know. 
 It will soon. 
 [Sighs] 
 Shh. 
 I promise you, Wes. 
 I got you.

 [Lid closes] 
 Rebecca... ? 
 If we don't find her? 
 Don't worry. 
 We will. 
 Was it you? 
 Frank : No. 
 Annalise, you know I'm not that guy. 
 Besides, I thought it was you. 
 Because I'm that guy? Of course not. 
 Now what?
