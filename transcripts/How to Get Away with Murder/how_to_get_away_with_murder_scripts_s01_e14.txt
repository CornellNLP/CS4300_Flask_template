 Previously on season one of "How To Get Away With Murder"... 
 Lila : I met a new guy. Mr. Darcy. 
 A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta house. 
 Reporter : Two suspects, Griffin O'Reilly and Rebecca Sutter, were arrested. 
 Rebecca came over. Next thing I know, we're in the middle when Lila walked in. 
 And that's when I see Rebecca smiling. 
 I knew then she set the whole thing up. 
 Let's go. 
 Griffin's gonna pin it on you! 
 Your client just confessed. Got it all on tape, too. 
 I didn't kill her. They made me say those things. 
 There was nothing going on with me and that girl. 
 Sam, why is your pen1s on a dead girl's phone? 
 So, how did you end up with her phone? 
 She left it at my apartment the night before. 
 Lila was six weeks pregnant. 
 I bet you did...  Killing her, huh? 
 You enjoyed it, didn't you? 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 
 Michaela! 
 You have to get here right now! 
 Michaela : Get him off her! Do something!! 
 Annalise : Were you able to pinpoint Mr. Keating's phone on the night of August 29th? 
 I was. 3204 Spruce Road. 
 That's the address of Kappa Kappa Theta sorority house. 
 Bryce : You recognize this ring? 
 I gave it to my husband on our wedding day. 
 Any idea why we found it in the woods? 
 I'm on it. 
 Former Philadelphia detective Nate Lahey was arrested in connection with the death of Professor Sam Keating. 
 Wes : Rudy? 
 He's the freak who lived here before you. 
 She said he had a nervous breakdown. 
 Actually it was a drug overdose, which put him in a mental institution. 
 Wes : You know her, right? 
 Her name's Rebecca. 
 Wet. 
 "Wet"? 
 The water tank. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 Laurel : You're reaching. 
 He pointed at her photo. 
 And said "wet." 
 Maybe he'd just seen her getting out of the shower. 
 On the night Lila died? 
 Then, the next time he looks at a picture of Rebecca, all he can say is "wet"? 
 Finally! 
 I'm a jerk. 
 Uh, I just got... 
 Bound up in work, and... 
 Then pick up the phone when your girlfriend calls and tell her that. 
 My phone died. 
 Nobody in the library had a charger? 
 I'm sorry, okay? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Lila was in the water tank, not the person who killed her. 
 Yeah. Maybe she drowned her. 
 No, the autopsy would've shown that. 
 [Sighs] 
 I need to ask her. 
 No. 
 If I'm wrong, she'll clear it up. 
 Or she'll freak out, Wes. 
 You know her. 
 Rebecca : Is something wrong? 
 What do you mean? 
 I just feel like something's wrong and you're not saying anything. 
 Nothing's wrong. 
 You sure? 
 Rebecca was the one Sam attacked and the only one of us who didn't help us get rid of the body. 
 That is what she's gonna tell the police if she gets scared. 
 She can screw us all, Wes. 
 I've been stressed, distracted, yeah, more than I've admitted, but... 
 It has nothing to do with you... 
 At all. 
 Wes : We should tell Annalise. 
 Tell her what? 
 That Rebecca maybe killed Lila, which means what we did to her husband was all a giant mistake? 
 Please tell me how that's a good idea. 
 No, we go home, we act normal, at least until we know more. 
 Promise me you'll do that. 
 Rebecca : You promise you're being honest with me? 
 I'm always honest with you. 
 I love you. 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 Just shut up, okay? 
 Shut up?! What do you mean, shut up?! 
 Lila, I have no idea what you're talking about! 
 I don't need this right now. 
 I don't need all this, like, talk, okay? 
 What do you mean you don't need this? 
 Okay, you just came into my house and started yelling at me! 
 What happened? Shut up! 
 What is wrong with you right now? 
 Stop, okay?! 
 Tell me what happened, and I can fix it. You... 
 Take it! 
 No! 
 Just take it! 
 No, not until you tell me what happened. 
 Nothing happened. I... I just don't want to do this anymore. 
 Okay, look, if you don't want to deal anymore, that's fine, but at least tell me what's going on. 
 I'm getting back together with Griffin. 
 What, are you crazy? Why? 
 I love him. 
 No, you don't. 
 I do. 
 Why the hell do you care so much? 
 Because he's bad for you. 
 You know that. He's trying to control you. 
 And, yeah, Darcy's an ass, but at least he's not trying to make you feel like a slut for having a s*x drive! 
 [Voice breaking] Everything bad that's happened to me is because of you. 
 What... 
 What are you talking about? 
 [Crying] 
 Ever since I met you, I've started acting crazy. 
 What, because you had s*x? 
 How is that my fault? 
 I would have never even flirted with Darcy if you weren't in my head all the time. 
 Okay, um... 
 Look, okay, I know you're upset. 
 I get it. 
 But I'm...  I'm your friend. 
 I'm the only friend you have, according to what you've been telling me over and over again. 
 So, maybe if you could just t... 
 [laughs] 
 I was just trying to make you feel better. 
 You were just a way to escape my stupid life for a little while. 
 I was bored and confused, but I'm done acting like some trashed-out druggie whore. 
 That may be fine for you, but my parents raised me better. 
 Get out of my house. 
 And don't ever call me again! 
 That's what I've been trying to tell you... 
 I'm not going to! 
 You need something?! 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 Mm, no. No, no, no! 
 No. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I've been a good boy for so long. 
 Now I just want to do something bad. 
 We need to get tested. 
 What? 
 You're a drug addict who cheated on me with some stranger. 
 And how many other guys has your pen1s touched since then? 
 See? 
 You can't even remember. You're a slut. 
 Hey. 
 Now, I'm... I'm... I'm... 
 I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that. 
 I just... you know, one in five gay guys is HIV-positive, and half of them don't even know it. 
 Okay, Dr. Oliver. 
 I get it. 
 I just want to do this the right way. 
 We can go to the clinic together. 
 It'll be romantic. 
 You're insane. 
 But smart. 
 Think about how much better the s*x will feel when we don't have to worry. 
 I-I hate you. 
 That thing I feel in your pants is telling me a different story. 
 Judge, my client has extensive ties to the community, no prior record of any kind, and an ailing wife in hospice care. 
 She's got stage-four ovarian cancer. 
 Oh, don't play the cancer card in my courtroom, counselor. 
 Without weighing in on the guilt or innocence of the defendant... 
 Traffic. 
 Darn. 
 I was hoping you got laid. 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 My heart goes out to Mrs. Lahey, but given the gruesome nature of the crime, coupled with the defendant's police background and the potential for flight risk, I am denying the request for bail. 
 Stockton : Judge, please, there's no reason... 
 The court's made its decision. 
 Put your energy into the trial, counsel. 
 [Gavel bangs] 
 We are gonna get through this, okay? 
 I'm gonna do everything I can. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Frank : He didn't stand a chance in there. 
 Judge Redding's punishing him for what this is doing to the police department's image. 
 [Sighs] He's an idiot for not firing that lawyer. 
 You can't get involved, Annalise, not if you don't want them to...  
 Don't tell me what I can or can't do. 
 Look at that...  The team's all here. 
 You're the one client I can count on to be on time. 
 Let's go. 
 Annalise : This is your life on the line, father. 
 I'm gonna beg for the possibility of parole, but it's not gonna happen unless you convince them you deserve it. 
 I murdered a fellow man of the cloth. 
 I deserve no concessions. 
 You asked God for his forgiveness, right? 
 So, now you have to ask the court's. 
 Convince them that you're remorseful, and if you feel yourself breaking down, that's okay. 
 The more emotional you are... 
 You mean give a performance? 
 Lie? 
 You can't tell me that there aren't times you spout sermons you don't believe in. 
 This is no different, father. 
 Who the hell is she? 
 Father? 
 Agnes. She works at the church. 
 What if I wanted to change my plea? 
 You pled guilty at the arraignment weeks ago. 
 I know. What if I changed my mind? 
 Be honest with me. Are you two... 
 No, absolutely not. 
 I've never been unfaithful to God in that way. 
 Then why did her coming into this courtroom cause you to change your mind? 
 Tell me what's going on. 
 Nothing's going on. I just... 
 I want to fight this, that's all. 
 When we met, you said you'd keep me out of jail, so that's what I'm asking you to do. 
 Please. 
 Bailiff : All rise. 
 Judge : Keep your seats. 
 This is the sentencing hearing in the case of the commonwealth vs. Andrew Crawford. 
 I understand that the state has agreed to... 
 The defense has a request, your honor. 
 [Sighs] Which is what, counsel? 
 My client would like to withdraw his plea. 
 [Spectators murmuring] 
 What's the withdrawal based on? 
 Father Crawford felt pressured to take the plea. 
 Your honor, we pressured the defendant in no way. 
 The state did not pressure him. 
 Then who was it, Ms. Keating? 
 Me, your honor. 
 At my first meeting with my client, I was in the middle of a major personal crisis, as the court probably knows. 
 I didn't take the time to properly explain his options to him. 
 That's my mistake, not father Crawford's. 
 And now that I've had the time to look over the case, he's changed his mind. 
 Please don't punish him for my own error. 
 [Up-tempo music playing in distance] 
 Griffin : What's in this again? 
 PCP. [Exhales sharply] 
 Doesn't that crap make people jump off roofs? 
 Yeah, if you're a dumb-ass. 
 [Sniffs] 
 So, does Lila know you're here? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 I was kind of a jerk earlier. 
 Mm, shocker. 
 Come on. 
 You don't feel like she's been kind of weird lately? 
 Eh, a little, I guess. Why? 
 You think something's going on? 
 I don't know. 
 Just... 
 She barely wanted to hang out all summer, and then, all of a sudden, she's up my ass. 
 She wants to hang out all the time, and she cries when I say no. 
 Mm. 
 I got enough pressure without her being needy. 
 You know? 
 Yeah. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Laughs] 
 You know, this is my first time in an actual frat house. 
 Seriously? 
 My parents didn't give me $100,000 to throw away on college, so...  
 Mm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, you want to, uh... 
 Give me a tour? 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Kind of, uh, snuck up me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckling] Lila's gonna be pissed. 
 Lila's not gonna find out. 
 Back at my room with her, clothes are off... 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 What is that? 
 The transcripts from Rebecca's first police interview. 
 Okay, but why? 
 And where did you find them? 
 These files are in the cellar. 
 You stole files from Annalise?! 
 We can't talk to Rebecca directly, fine, but we can go over all the things she's said about that night and see if her story makes sense. 
 Wes... 
 Wes, if Annalise sees that... 
 In... in... in her police interview, Rebecca said that she left and went home after Lila caught her with Griffin, but in the confession tapes, she said she went to Lila's sorority house. 
 Yeah, and that confession was coerced. 
 Or was it? 
 Michaela : What's all the whispering about? 
 [Sighs] 
 Kan and I had a fight. I was just venting. 
 You two talk about your little love lives? 
 Cute. 
 What do you want? 
 The judge just accepted father Andrew's "not guilty" plea, so Bonnie wants us to take a field trip. 
 Your client has admitted that they've committed a crime. 
 How is it possible to argue a "not guilty" defense? 
 Why is that not considered perjury? 
 Ms. Liebowitz. 
 Liebowitz : Two reasons... 
 One, it's not sworn testimony, and two, entering a "not guilty" plea doesn't mean "I didn't do it," it just means that the state has to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 And that heavy burden is a defense attorney's best weapon, and you got to milk it for all it's worth. 
 Joe : About 10:00, I come through to light a candle for my wife, who passed last year. 
 I come around this pew here, and I see father Bernard laying there with his head cracked open. 
 You never seen so much blood. 
 The wall was sprayed with it. 
 His Bible, sitting on the floor beside him, was practically floating in it. 
 Want to rack up a couple sins, give the good lord a little show? 
 Then I saw the thurible laying next to him on the ground. 
 "Thurible"? 
 The murder weapon. 
 Joe : Usually holds the incense, but that's what did him in. 
 According to what you told police, father Andrew was the first person you suspected? 
 I heard them fighting earlier that week. 
 Father Andrew hoped to take over as head pastor once father Bernard retired, but father Bernard wasn't seeing it go that way. 
 Annalise : And what about your own ethics? 
 You know for a fact that your client is guilty. 
 They've told you as much. 
 And yet you have to stand in front of that jury every day and lie to their faces. 
 Is it fair to assume that you and father Andrew are close? 
 Um, well, I'm close with all of the priests. 
 Yes, that's my job, to allow the priests to focus on their divine office and their teaching. 
 Is there anything that you know that could help in father Andrew's defense? 
 I assume that's something you're interested in. 
 Why would I want to do that? 
 Because just the sight of you in the courtroom gave him second thoughts about spending 30 years behind bars. 
 I know what you're implying, but father Andrew is a pious man. 
 A man you love. 
 Well, it's not like we're in a position to act on that. 
 We've made our choices. 
 Excuse me. 
 You lie to yourself. 
 That's how you do it. 
 You lie. 
 And you tell yourself that that client who you know did it did not. 
 Because dwelling in that truth won't let you do your job. 
 Michaela : A student killed himself? 
 Brian Kamens. He hanged himself in his grandma's garage. 
 Let me guess... he was an altar boy getting the... 
 Holy treatment from some of the priests here? 
 Not all priests are pedophiles. 
 Since when? 
 Truth. 
 Zach : Brian and father Andrew spent a lot of time in the dark room together... 
 Doing... Photography. 
 Then he killed himself. 
 That tell you enough? 
 Were you molesting Brian Kamens? 
 Of course not. 
 Father Bernard confronted you about what you did to Brian, and he was gonna report you. 
 I did not touch that boy. 
 You had to silence father Bernard because he knew your dirty little secret. 
 How dare you? 
 I humiliated myself in court for you, father. 
 You do not get to lie to me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Brian and I spent considerable time together. 
 The dark room had become a place where he felt safe enough to tell me, his friend, what was troubling him... 
 That he was being abused by someone. 
 And shortly after his death... 
 I came to learn that person was father Bernard. 
 That's why I killed him. 
 And I'd do it again. 
 I was devastated knowing that Brian had been abused, that whoever did it had driven him to kill himself. 
 I wanted to find that monster. 
 I prayed on it. 
 And then, one night, God brought him to me. 
 Father Bernard : Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. 
 He never mentioned Brian by name. 
 I tried to stop myself...  I did... 
 Praying to God for his mercy, but each time I went near him... 
 I couldn't stop myself. 
 Father Andrew : I finally had my answer. 
 Give thanks to the lord, for he is good. 
 For his mercy endures forever. 
 Father Andrew : I thought about breaking the sacrament, reporting what he'd told me, but I knew they'd just transfer him... that he'd find another Brian. 
 I waited for the guilt to come, and when it didn't, I was confused. 
 Part of me wondered if I hadn't done his will... 
 For Brian. 
 I know what I did was wrong. 
 I just don't feel it was wrong. 
 Michaela : So we plead manslaughter instead of murder? 
 We can't. Father Andrew feels that it's a sin to testify to what father Bernard said in the confessional booth, and evidentiary law agrees with him. 
 So, without that piece of information, we can't convince a jury this was manslaughter. 
 What about the "Thorn birds" angle? 
 The miniseries? 
 You know, Richard Chamberlain, he's a priest, gets down with his lady friend? It's pretty good. 
 Both Agnes and father Andrew claim that their relationship was platonic. 
 Well, yeah. That's what I used to tell my parents about me and our neighbor, Cole. 
 It's not an angle we can work right now. 
 Keep thinking. 
 Was I right, or was I right? 
 [Irish accent] It all comes back to the diddlin' priests. 
 So, you're happy a boy was sexually abused and then killed himself? 
 No, I'm happy because I'm awesome sauce. 
 Now what? 
 The detective's notes on the murder book. 
 He has Rebecca at Griffin's fraternity a little after midnight, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Door opens] 
 Get the hell out of here! 
 Lila : Griffin? 
 [Voice breaking] I got your text. 
 Lila. 
 You still think he's worth it? 
 You stupid slut! 
 [All shouting] 
 How could you do this?! 
 Get off! 
 I never want to see either of you again! 
 [Crying] 
 Screaming, scratching me. 
 That's why my DNA is under her nails. 
 And that's when I see Rebecca... 
 Smiling. 
 Wes : The police report says people saw Lila leave the frat house around 12:30 A.M. 
 Then some guy from the basketball team saw someone fitting Rebecca's description between 1:00 and 2:00 A.M. 
 An eyewitness? 
 Why didn't we ever hear that? 
 He identified a different girl's photo. 
 So, it wasn't Rebecca. 
 Or he just picked the wrong photo. 
 In his statement, the basketball player said he saw Rebecca on spruce road. 
 That's near Lila's sorority, which means Rebecca didn't go home after the fight like she said in her first statement, she went to the sorority house, which matches what she said in her confession tape. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 No, answer it, so she doesn't get suspicious. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Uh, look, I'm gonna be home late tonight. 
 Bruce got boned by a couple of his bartenders, and he's short, so I just got here to pick up a shift. 
 At the bar? Really? 
 You sure you want to go back there? 
 Yeah. It's one night. I could use the cash. 
 You should come by after work. Free beer. 
 I don't know, um... 
 I think we're gonna be stuck working on this case for a while. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 I love you. 
 Love you too. 
 
 
 
 [Sighs] 
 Father Andrew : I cannot betray my vows. 
 Of course you can. 
 You just get up on that stand, and you testify that you killed a pedophile that drove a boy to kill himself. 
 The D.A. will knock it down to voluntary manslaughter. 
 You might even get to walk. 
 The sacramental seal is inviolable. 
 I will not betray it. 
 You won't betray an institution that created the environment for the abuse to occur? 
 Father Bernard's sin is his alone. 
 Why should it influence my commitment to the lord? 
 You killed someone. 
 What would the lord think about that? 
 I did something terrible, yes, but that doesn't mean that I can continue down that road. 
 Even if it means staying out prison, getting to be with the woman you love? 
 Agnes and I never acted on our feelings! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Sighs] 
 Life is messy, father. 
 We all have to make compromises in order to be happy. 
 That's a terribly cynical way to live. 
 Well, I have my reasons. 
 Really? 
 What are they? 
 [Groans] 
 Come. 
 Cast your burden on the lord, and he will sustain you. 
 I'm your lawyer. Exactly. 
 My job requires the same level of confidentiality as yours. 
 No God should forgive me for all the bad things that I've done. 
 I'm wasting both of our time. 
 Don't worry, I still plan to win your case, even if you refuse to help. 
 Asher : [Ditzy voice] I'm so confused. 
 Does the book go here? 
 Or maybe I should put it... 
 Here. 
 [Normal voice] This is exactly the book I was looking for. 
 My office, Frank. 
 [Sighs] 
 Is your connection at the central jail still good? 
 Maybe. What's up? 
 Do you have the connection or not? 
 Is this about Nate? 
 Something happen to him? 
 Not yet. 
 How many sexual partners have you had in the last year? 
 An estimate's fine. 
 20? 
 So, less than two a month? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay, probably, uh, probably more like 30. 
 40, I... 
 How often do you use a condom? 
 Always. 
 Well, okay, you know, I mean, definitely when I'm on... 
 The bottom bunk, and I'd say... 
 80% on top. 
 You know, some guys ask me not to, and I... 
 I heard it's harder to contract if you're... 
 On the top bunk? 
 Yeah. 
 That's wrong. 
 You can contract HIV giving and receiving. 
 Has your current partner or any former partners ever been diagnosed or treated for an std? 
 [Sighs] 
 Connor : You're right... 
 This is so romantic. 
 It will be in 20 minutes when you get your results and we go home to celebrate. 
 You know, I, um... 
 I actually have to go to class. 
 Esther : Oliver? 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] Wish me luck. 
 Uh, excuse me, could... 
 Could you give me my results over the phone? 
 Yep. 
 I'll call you when I hear. 
 Bonnie : Annalise? 
 What? 
 It's Nate. 
 He was attacked last night in jail. 
 Some guys beat him up pretty bad, but he's going to be okay. 
 Oh... 
 That's what you and Frank... 
 How else were we gonna get him out of jail? 
 Annalise... 
 Judge Redding already denied the request for a new bail hearing. 
 She ordered him to be placed in solitary instead. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where's Mr. Millstone? 
 Um, in class, I think. 
 Call and tell him that we're gonna need his help. 
 I don't like this. 
 We got orders. 
 He's the only one who's anonymous in all of this. 
 We could be compromising his future. 
 Since when do you care so much about doucheface's future? 
 I heard my mad skills were desired. 
 We need help on father Andrew's case. 
 Sweet. 
 Anything that makes me look better to the big boss man upstairs. 
 Uh, or woman. 
 See that woman standing over there? 
 That's judge Redding. 
 I am denying the request for bail. 
 Walk over, say hello. 
 Drop the old Millstone name to break the ice. 
 What's the catch? 
 You want to seize the moment or stand here and talk about it till it's gone? 
 Hurry up. 
 Secret agent man... 
 All mission, no details. That's how I like to roll. 
 B-r-b. 
 Asher : Judge Redding. 
 Asher Millstone, son to judge William Millstone. 
 Oh, my goodness! How's your dad? 
 Oh, he's good. He's wonderful. 
 Yeah? 
 He's just catching up on the old game. 
 What are you up to? 
 I'm going to school, Middleton, studying law. 
 Annalise : So, you don't love him? 
 Like I told you before, not in the way that you're suggesting. 
 Which way, then, like a brother? 
 Annalise : So long as you hide it, there's no way that you can help me defend him. 
 I don't understand. 
 How can I help him? I'm not involved in any of this. 
 But you are. 
 You're a good woman, and you're trying to do the right thing. 
 I know that. 
 But you're not able to be with the man you love, and you're gonna watch him being taken away in handcuffs. 
 And we both know he doesn't deserve that treatment. 
 And neither do you. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 Ms. Willis, did you see father Andrew the night father Bernard was killed? 
 Agnes : I did. 
 And why didn't you tell that to the police before? 
 Because I didn't want to stain his reputation. 
 But I can't stand by now, not when an innocent man is going to jail. 
 I can't lie anymore. 
 Lie about what, Ms. Willis? 
 Uh... 
 I was with father Andrew that night. 
 We were being intimate. 
 [Spectators murmuring] 
 Hawley : Objection! We received no notice of an alibi defense. 
 If those two were having an affair, we'd have discovered it in our investigation. 
 Because the Philadelphia D.A. never misses anything. 
 Judge : Sustained. 
 Let's take a recess while we discuss whether or not this witness should testify any further. 
 How dare you? 
 You want to win, don't you? 
 Connor : Yeah, I'm still here. 
 W... she's not there? 
 Well, um... 
 Can... can you tell me the results? 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, yeah, I'll be sure to pick up when she calls. 
 Thank you. 
 Waiting on some big news? 
 Yeah. Um... 
 Oliver made us get tested for STDs, and the nurse won't leave the results on my voice-mail. 
 So, I'm... Freaking out. 
 Chill out, my gay bro. Sure it's fine. 
 How would you know? 
 You wrap up your dingalingadong, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Most of the time. 
 What, like you and Aiden always used condoms when you started dating? 
 Damn straight. 
 [Cellphone vibrates] 
 Hey! Uh... 
 Did you get your results? 
 Yeah. Didn't you? 
 No, I can't get the freaking nurse on the phone. So? 
 We're supposed to wait till we're together. 
 This isn't Christmas morning, Oliver. Just tell me. 
 Right. 
 I'm negative! 
 Damn it. 
 What? 
 Nothing, it's just, she didn't leave a message 'cause it's bad news, right? 
 That's not what that means. 
 It could be, though. 
 I mean, y... like, she... she doesn't want to ruin her lunch hour or something. 
 That's why she didn't take my call. 
 Connor. 
 I'm sorry. I'm just... I hate this part. 
 Where are you? 
 Annalise is going to notice. 
 Doing the walk from Griffin's fraternity to the Kappa house, and it times out. 
 If Rebecca left the fraternity at 12:30 and was headed to Lila's sorority, then she would've crossed paths with the basketball player on spruce around the time he told the police. 
 So why isn't there any record of her being there on her phone? 
 Because she probably called Lila using her burner cell, then destroyed it later. 
 So, she called Lila on her burner phone because she knew she was on her way to kill her? 
 You think I'm going crazy? 
 A little. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Rebecca : Lila, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. 
 Griffin is not the guy that you think he is, all right? 
 I-I hardly even had to try. That was not his first time, okay? 
 Please... please just call me back. 
 100 bucks she comes home without her underwear again and brags about screwing some lacrosse player with... 
 [Ditzy voice] The prettiest pen1s ever. 
 [Normal voice] Like, what pen1s is ever pretty? 
 [Laughter] 
 Hawley : When did this secret affair begin? 
 About a year ago. 
 Where did the s*x that night happen exactly? 
 In the rectory? At the altar? 
 Objection! Badgering the witness. 
 This is a key alibi witness. I'm entitled to latitude. 
 Answer the question, Ms. Willis. 
 In his room. 
 I came to see him after vespers. 
 And then what? 
 We had some wine... 
 And I began kissing him. 
 Who took off their clothes off first, you or him? 
 [Shakily] Me. 
 That's enough! Sit down. 
 Hawley : Your honor... 
 Get control of your client, counselor. We need a recess. 
 I want to change my plea. 
 Again? This is dizzying, your honor. 
 I plead guilty and confess to the murder of father Bernard. 
 Your honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial. 
 Because you had your client cause one? 
 No, the state happily accepts father Crawford's plea. 
 Your honor, he doesn't know what he's saying. 
 I do, too, your honor. 
 I plead guilty to first-degree murder. 
 I won't change my mind again. 
 I did this. 
 I must suffer the consequences. 
 No. Andrew, ple... don't. Please. 
 I'm sorry. It's done. 
 You can fix this still, right? 
 Agnes, stop. 
 I love you. That is what's... 
 It's done. 
 I love you. 
 And I don't love you. 
 I made my decision, so please just leave. 
 Sorry I couldn't be a better client for you. 
 Let's go. 
 Connor : Esther just called from the clinic. 
 Guess who's HIV negative? 
 Aw, yeah, dawg! 
 C. Walsh getting his ass beat up tonight! 
 Pshew! Truth! 
 [Both chuckle] 
 But, you know, I still have to, uh, go back and get tested again in three months. 
 Dude, I'm... I'm totally down with our rainbow coalition, but I don't need to know all the details of your sexy times. 
 Connor. 
 Laurel : Enough of this, okay? 
 I get it... you want to know if she didn't do this. 
 We all do, but sometimes you just... 
 Have to accept not knowing. 
 I don't believe that. You have no other choice. 
 I do. I can talk to her. 
 No! If you do, she's gonna freak out, and she is gonna... 
 She's not gonna freak out. 
 Michaela : Who would freak out? 
 Rebecca? 
 What do you have to ask her? 
 Nothing. If she killed Lila. 
 What? Excuse me? 
 He doesn't know anything. He's...  
 She lied to me. 
 She said she didn't know the guy who lived in my place before me, but she did, and he saw her come home wet the night Lila was killed. 
 Wet? 
 Yeah, from the water tank. 
 No, we don't know that. 
 Rebecca said she didn't go look for Lila at the sorority house, but there's an eyewitness who says he saw her there around the time Lila was killed. 
 Yeah, but we proved that Sam was on that roof. 
 Maybe he wasn't, though. 
 Rebecca could have been putting those coordinates on his computer that night. 
 Which is just speculation. 
 Where is she? 
 No, we can't just go...  
 No! Where the hell is she?! 
 Frank : Guess who just went bye-bye. 
 Judge Perkins just replaced judge Redding on Nate's case. 
 Nate was released on bail 20 minutes ago. 
 Nate. 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 Just call the damn number. 
 You want to hate me for what you think that I've done to you, go ahead, but believe me, if you don't accept the help, you don't stand a chance of winning your case. 
 Believe you? 
 Why am I gonna do that, after everything you've done to me? 
 I know how it seems. Fired, charged with murder. 
 I could have died in that jail if my lawyer didn't get rid of the judge. 
 I got rid of the judge. 
 All mission, no details. That's how I like to roll. 
 B-r-b. 
 Asher : Judge Redding. 
 Asher Millstone, son to judge William Millstone. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 Asher Millstone has been in the employ of Annalise Keating for the past several months, a woman who blames my client for the murder of her husband. 
 If this isn't a clear conflict of interest, I don't know what is! 
 It was one harmless conversation. I know his father. 
 Which is grounds for a recusal. 
 Either that or I file a complaint with the judicial conduct board. 
 Your lawyer's not bad, but I've seen the evidence against you. 
 You need someone great. 
 Call the number. 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 What is this? 
 We need to talk. 
 Spit it out, psycho. You killed Lila, right? 
 And you played Waitlist here like... like some loser. 
 Played all of us. 
 Why are you letting them do this? 
 No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one. 
 I didn't manipulate anyone! 
 But you lied! 
 You said you didn't know this Rudy guy. 
 I didn't. 
 Then how come he ended up in a mental institution? 
 How should I freaking know? 
 You do, though. 
 You called the police on him the same night Lila died. 
 He was having a nervous breakdown. 
 Or a drug overdose. 
 That was you, right? 
 Drugs don't make people crazy. 
 Yeah, but they can make you an unreliable witness in case your neighbor comes back from campus soaking wet the same night she had a fight with a girl who ended up dead in a water tank. 
 I mean, this... 
 [Breathing heavily] Wes. 
 No, do not look at him! 
 You ruined our lives! 
 Don't you get that? 
 I was supposed to be getting married, and I'm not anymore. 
 Aiden called off the wedding because of you. 
 You dragged us into the horror show that is your life, and now we're all screwed... forever. 
 So, you're gonna tell us the truth, every horrible secret about that night that you haven't told anyone, or I swear to God, I will personally destroy you. 
 Tell us the damn truth, Rebecca. 
 Did you... 
 Or did you not... 
 Kill... Lila?

 I found the campus cop. 
 This car one of yours? 
 She asked you to go into her house and burn a rug for her? 
 His name's Rodger Loftus. 
 He was fired a couple days after Sam disappeared. 
 Some sorority girls filed a report that he was stalking them. 
 I'm guessing that was Annalise and Frank, right? 
 They knew we couldn't have him around, or he might remember what he saw that night. 
 So, they just made him go away. 
 Rebecca...  
 He had to move to Delaware to get a job. 
 He works as a security guard at the mega super mart. 
 Guess that's why he never saw the news. 
 Don't make me call him.
