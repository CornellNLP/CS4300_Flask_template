 Previously on "How to get away with Murder"... 
 A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta House. 
 What's wrong? 
 She was my friend, okay? 
 And ordering Miss Stangard's body be exhumed immediately. 
 A full external and internal second autopsy. 
 I think about you all the time. But I'll get over it. 
 What if I don't  want  you to get over it? 
 We represent Mary Walker. 
 This is a prenup. 
 I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard. And we both know who did. 
 They missed something in the first autopsy. 
 Say it. 
 Lila was six weeks pregnant. 
 What if it's too big... 
 Like, I waited too long, and now my body assumes I'm some sort of nun who'll never have s*x, and then when I finally do it or... try... 
 He won't fit? 
 I've met Griffin. 
 Judging by the chip on his shoulder, I'm guessing it'll fit. 
 [ Snorts ] 
 What happened to your virginity pact? 
 Did Griffin finally realize God doesn't give a crap about his s*x life? 
 [ Snorts ] 
 If I tell you something, swear you won't tell  anyone? 
 I'm hanging out with a sorority girl. 
 I don't want to tell anyone about this more than you. 
 [ Giggles ] 
 I met a new guy. 
 Who? 
 Mr. Darcy. 
 I promised I wouldn't tell anyone who he was. 
 So he's one of Griffin's friends? 
 No. 
 Then why can't you tell me? 
 He has a wife. 
 [ Chortles ] 
 Oh. Oh, my God. 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 Lila was six weeks pregnant. 
 I'll leave. 
 No. Stay. 
 Annie. Really. 
 I need a witness here to make sure you don't lie to me again. 
 You lied when you said you didn't sleep with her. 
 You lied when you said you were at Yale the night she was killed. 
 And I believed you, like some fool. 
 So... 
 Did you know she was pregnant? 
 No. 
 "No" because you didn't or "no" because if you say "yes," you know that's motive to kill? 
 This is... not something that... 
 Do not leave! 
 Are you lying? 
 No. 
 We don't even know if it's mine. 
 Who else's could it be... Her virgin boyfriend? 
 He  claims  to be a virgin. 
 Was Lila? 
 The first time you had her? 
 You would know, wouldn't you? 
 I didn't know she was pregnant. 
 I promise you. 
 You believe him? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Should've worn a condom. 
 Sometimes, we're not responsible for our own actions, because sometimes, we behave not like thinking, thoughtful human beings, but as animals. 
 Such is the case of Gretchen Thomas, a successful real-estate agent, wife, mother. 
 Like many a high-powered professional, stress and anxiety are part of her daily routine, so she takes a prescription sleeping pill before bed. 
 Its side effects have caused her to buy clothes online, cook gourmet meals, and even initiate s*x with her husband all while completely unconscious. 
 And then  this  happened. 
 [ Student murmuring ] 
 This is Ms. Thomas on her home-security system, dragging her nanny's dead, bloody body out of the house. 
 And then what does she do? 
 She begins to clean up the mess. 
 Now, we all know the feeling... 
 We've had a bad dream, we know we're asleep, but try as we might, we just can't seem to wake ourselves up. 
 Gretchen : I'm sorry that I wasn't able to get to your office. 
 It's Mia's 13th birthday this weekend, and planning has been crazy. 
 Who would've thought that it'd be so difficult to find a deejay? 
 We really need your undivided attention. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] Oh! Finally! 
 Ricardo? 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Hi. I am so happy that you called. 
 Now, I know you usually don't do kids' parties, but I'm going to prison any minute, this could take a while. 
 And this could be the last chance want to sneak upstairs? 
 My daughter and I could be together. 
 No, no. I'm sure dj rizzles is very talented. 
 It's just that you have come so highly recommended from my friend Karen's... 
 You're on trial for first-degree murder. 
 Put the phone down so we can prep for your testimony. 
 I've changed my mind. 
 I don't want to take the stand. 
 Honey, this isn't just  your  decision. 
 You have a family who needs you, children who need you. 
 If she wants to go to jail, dad, let her. 
 Your mother is not going to jail, Cody. 
 Gretchen, I understand this is difficult for you, but as your attorney, I need to put you on the stand so I can establish that you had no motive to kill Elke. 
 The jury needs to believe that you two were close. 
 We  were  close. 
 Can you imagine waking up to realize that you killed somebody you loved? 
 That's what I did. 
 And I'm sorry. 
 If the jury thinks that I should go to prison, I agree. 
 I should pay for this sin. 
 Bonnie : Since we can't put Gretchen on the stand, we're having the people who love her... Her family... 
 Testify to her history of sleepwalking. 
 So tomorrow, each of you will act as prosecutors, prepping each of the Thomases for their moment in the sun. 
 Dig in. 
 Anyone else feel like we do all her work  for  her? 
 Just figuring that out now? 
 I was fine with it before exams, but now that everyone else in our class is locked away in their apartments, studying, we're falling behind, working as free labor. 
 You know who doesn't care about exams? 
 This  guy. 'Cause I got... 
 Mention the trophy again, and I'll bash your face in with it. 
 Okay, whatever, shooting star. 
 You guys all go be boring, study. 
 I'll be at the bonfire, partying it up, mackin' on the chickadees! 
 Connor : Hey. 
 You want to study-group this weekend? 
 [ Scoffs ] Since when do  you  need to study? 
 Well, you take notes, I have Adderall. 
 We'll make a great team. 
 Wes. 
 Professor Keating wants to see you. 
 Hey. 
 You want to join waitlist and I in our new study group? 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Pregnant? 
 Six weeks. 
 There was no sign of sexual trauma in the first autopsy, so they didn't inspect the uterus. 
 It'll be a few more days before the police release the final report, but the minute they do, they'll run a DNA test on Griffin to see if he was the father. 
 He's  not,  as we both know. 
 It's good for Rebecca's case. 
 But I would appreciate it if you didn't tell her. 
 Why not? 
 Well, because if she finds out days before her trial, I'm afraid she'll act out in a way that will hurt her case. 
 So, for her benefit, I'm asking you not to tell her. 
 If you didn't want her to know, why tell  me? 
 Because I learned my lesson about keeping secrets from you. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Wes : Lila was pregnant. 
 You didn't know? 
 No. 
 It's Sam's? 
 Yeah, probably. 
 Annalise asked me not to tell you. 
 What? 
 [ Refrigerator door opens ] I know. 
 Said she didn't want to upset you. 
 What... you believe her, with her husband freakin' involved? 
 I'm not sure. 
 But... 
 She knows I could go to the police at any point. 
 So let's. We'll tell them the baby's Sam's. 
 What if it's not? 
 They still have to question him. 
 Well, what if he has an alibi? 
 Or they release him? 
 You're still on trial, but without Annalise. 
 She'd quit your case. 
 So, what? 
 I mean, we... we do nothing? 
 Of course not. 
 I... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I just need to keep an eye on her till we figure out our next step. 
 [ Man shouting in distance, dog barking ] 
 It's not safe to be out here alone. 
 Why should I trust you? 
 I want to get acquitted, but  you... 
 Why do you want to help me? 
 I lost my job because of this case. 
 So, really, this is just me helping myself. 
 So... 
 What do you want to tell me? 
 Lila... was pregnant. 
 That's the evidence we need, right? 
 To tie Sam to her? 
 You still have access to the house? 
 Yeah. 
 Grab a sample of his hair from the bathroom. 
 I'll have someone at the station run a DNA test. 
 If it matches the baby, they're gonna have to start an investigation on him. 
 And your case... will go away. 
 You in? 
 Hey, loser. 
 All right, some coke, some molly. 
 Uh... what? 
 [ Crunching ] 
 We did it. 
 Ah. 
 I'm guessing it didn't hurt, by the look on your face. 
 It's not like how all my friends talk about their first time. 
 You know, he... didn't rush or act weird or make  me  feel weird. 
 He made me feel safe. 
 You think I'm an idiot. 
 You  said it. [ Chuckles ] 
 Well, I will say  this...  His wife must never put out, because once we really started going, it was like he couldn't get enough of me. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Swear you won't tell anyone? 
 Oh, like I care enough about your stupid s*x life to tell anyone. 
 [ Cellphone chimes ] Thanks. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 Wow. Well... Now I know why you thought it'd hurt. 
 Ooh! 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 What's up, Darcy? 
 Annalise isn't here. 
 Court... I know. Wes told me. 
 I think I left my gloves here... 
 Greenish, 10 fingers. 
 Not gonna steal anything. 
 'Course not. 
 Must've fallen out... somewhere. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Not here. 
 I'm a disaster. I lose everything I like. 
 Hmm. 
 Can I use your bathroom? 
 Rebecca. 
 You should go. 
 Dude, I'm not... 
 You're welcome here when Annalise invites you. 
 Otherwise, this is my house. 
 And I'm asking you to leave. 
 Yeah. 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 [ Lock engages ] 
 Cody : It was a bloodbath... 
 A whole trail of it leading outside. 
 And mom just stood there, hosing the blood off elke. 
 So your mom was awake when you found her? 
 No. She was asleep. 
 I started yelling for my dad. 
 Wes : So, let's be clear... 
 You actually saw her take the sleeping pill that night? 
 No, but she  told  me she took it when we got into bed. 
 Then how can you be certain? 
 Because she took it  every  night... 
 Right before we went to sleep. 
 Claire : Like a drug addict. 
 I told her, "You wouldn't need a pill to sleep if you just slowed down. Stop trying to do so much." 
 Sounds like the perfect recipe for your daughter to snap... Maybe even kill. 
 Objection... argumentative. 
 Uh... what are you doing? 
 You didn't ask an actual question. 
 The opposing lawyer would have no choice but to object. 
 [ Forced chuckle ] 
 I watch court TV. 
 Mia : Grandma hated Elke. 
 She felt like mom should be our mom, not some Scandinavian milkmaid. 
 Don't say that part on the stand. 
 We don't want anyone to think your grandmother had anything to do with it. 
 Maybe she  did. 
 [ Chuckling ] I'm kidding. 
 Look in the medicine cabinet in their bathroom. 
 It's a veritable drugstore in there... 
 Antianxiety meds for Mia, hair-growth supplements for Matthew. 
 Does that mean you don't trust your daughter's judgment? 
 Of course I trust her. 
 Then act like it. 
 Show a sliver of doubt or distrust, and the prosecution will pounce. 
 On top of me, initiating s*x. 
 All the while, she's completely asleep. 
 That's how much those pills knock her out. 
 Uh, maybe don't... Use the s*x as an example on the stand. 
 Connor : When did your mom finally come to? 
 Uh, once my dad put her in the shower, ran cold water on her. 
 It was the only way we could wake her up. 
 What was her reaction when she realized what she'd done? 
 She started crying, yelling. 
 It was awful... for all of us. 
 Like, it's one thing for your mom to kill your nanny... 
 It's a whole other thing if she had no idea what she was doing. 
 It sounds fake... I know... 
 Like we're making it up, but we're not. 
 It's the pill's fault. 
 Your witness. 
 Is it possible your parents told you to lie on the stand today, Cody? 
 Your Honor, there's no good-faith basis to this question. 
 Let me rephrase. 
 Do you love your mother? 
 Yes. 
 So you'd do anything to protect her. 
 Lie, even? 
 He's badgering my witness, Your Honor. 
 Lying under oath is illegal, Cody. 
 Mr. Rodriguez, this is bordering on witness intimidation. 
 Are you lying, Cody? 
 Annalise : Your Honor, I ask the court to cite the prosecutor for misconduct and allow my witness to leave the stand. 
 I'm not lying about my mother. 
 She loved elke. We all did. 
 Especially me. 
 [ Spectators murmur ] 
 What did you just say? 
 Your Honor, he's just a young boy. 
 I loved her. 
 That's why I was awake at 3:00 A.M. that night... 
 Because I was going to her room, just like I had been  every  night. 
 We loved each other. 
 Damn it, Aiden! You want me to write a script for you? 
 Uh, how about, "Mother, 
 "you should've told me you were giving Michaela a prenup, 
 "and as her fiancé, I fully support her decision not to sign it." 
 I got to go. 
 Are you good for  anything,  or can you only do your job when you're screwing evidence out of someone? 
 Annalise, he did his best. We were all blindsided by this. 
 No,  you  were blindsided. 
 Because you can't do your one simple job. 
 Tell me what's coming my way! 
 That's all I ask. 
 And in return, I tolerate your pathetic, mousy presence in my house. 
 Michaela : Hey. 
 How's it feel to have your ass handed to you just days before she hands out our final grades? 
 [ Clicks tongue ] 
 I'm not worried, because I got a copy of the exam that she gave last year. 
 And I'm happy to share it with my new study group if they have things to give me in return. 
 I'll trade you all my notes. 
 And I'll give you copies of all of kan's old outlines. 
 I have every criminal-law hornbook ever written. 
 I think three people's enough for this study group. 
 [ Cellphone vibrating ] [ Sighing ] Oh, my God. This is so good. 
 Hello? 
 Frank : You like the photo? 
 I snuck it while you were in the shower this morning. 
 Wes was sitting right next to me. He could've seen it. 
 I know. 
 Makes it more fun. 
 What do you want? 
 What do you  think? 
 [ Ben Khan's "Drive" plays ] 
 [ Both breathing heavily ] 
 Slow down, killer. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 If I'm gone for more than a few minutes, Bonnie will get suspicious. 
 Bonnie was  born  suspicious. 
 I want to take my time. 
 ♪ Just for the thrill ♪ 
 [ Moaning softly ] 
 Hey, that was bull donks, yo. 
 A.K. reaming you out like that... It's not right. 
 I mean, we all know who deserves the credit around here. 
 You're sucking up. Stop it. 
 No, I'm just saying don't let it get to you. 
 She's the one that sucks, not you. 
 Also, I'm having a little jammy-jam at my place tomorrow before the bonfire. 
 Drinks, pretty peeps... the ushe. 
 So I was hoping I could get off a little early tomorrow. 
 You can come, too... Shake your groove thang. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 You can go home early as long as you get all your work done. 
 [ Footsteps approach ] 
 Sam. 
 I can't talk right now. 
 It's about Lila. 
 The night she was killed, I thought you were at Yale. 
 But I... 
 Did you need me? 
 No. 
 [ Footsteps depart ] 
 Rebecca came by the house. Claims she was looking for her gloves. 
 [ Liquid pours ] 
 There's not a chance she knows about the pregnancy? 
 Wes is here all the time. 
 I already told Wes. 
 So he told  her. 
 We don't know that. 
 Annie, you've seen the two of them. 
 You know how he feels about her. 
 Yeah. That's sweet, isn't it? 
 Tell me what you want me to do here... If you want me to go to the police. 
 Just... 
 Don't give up on me here. 
 I'm gonna lose my case. Because all I can think about is you with that girl. 
 How many times was it? Seven? That's all it took for you to knock her up? 
 [ Crying ] This is what I get. 
 This is what happens when you screw somebody else's husband. 
 You become sad, barren. And even a dead girl is more of a woman than you. 
 That's not what this is. 
 It is. 
 No. No, Annie, this... [ Sighs ] This is  me. 
 So... Get pissed off, hit me if that's what it takes. 
 But  I  broke us, not you. And I'll do whatever it takes to make us right again. 
 So... Either I'm already high or school started again, 'cause I swear I just walked by a bunch of girls half-naked downstairs, practicing a miley Cyrus dance routine. 
 What happened? 
 [ Voice breaking ] Darcy wants to end it. 
 I know I shouldn't be surprised. 
 [ Crying ] They never leave their wives. 
 But you hoped he would. 
 Tell me it's better this way. 
 Griffin still hasn't found out. I can just... 
 You said you were breaking up with Griffin. 
 Lila, he's a Jesus-obsessed control freak who forced you into a virginity pact. 
 He was right. 
 [ Breathes shakily ] 
 Bad things happen when you have s*x. 
 Like what? 
 I-I don't know. 
 Just, let's not talk about it. 
 Um, yeah, okay. 
 I'll go. 
 No. Stay. 
 Is it sick if all I want to do is go over to his house and show his wife all the pictures of his junk on my phone? 
 No. That is normal. But don't do that. 
 I know. [ Sighs ] 
 
 
 
 Hey, it's me. 
 You get it?  
 No, he got all suspicious. 
 I think I have a better idea. 
 Sam texted Lila all the time. 
 There's got to be evidence on his phone still, right? 
 Cody : What do you want? 
 Just thought I'd... Come see how you're doing. 
 What... you didn't hear enough on the stand? 
 You know, when I was your age, my sister had this friend Marissa, and she was my first. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I was 14, she was 18. 
 And... I don't know. 
 I-I thought it was probably too good to last, but I hung on 'cause she was hot. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 And after a while... [ inhales sharply ] 
 Marissa just... she stopped coming by. 
 I was pissed. 
 Like, really... really angry. 
 And I'd always think up ways to hurt her if I saw her again. 
 But I mean...  Really  hurt her. You know? 
 Dude, I know you're gay. 
 And I didn't kill Elke. 
 I loved her. 
 She loved  me. 
 Now, if I'm on a jury, I... [ sighs ] 
 I think that story's too good to be true. 
 I mean, no relationship is that perfect. 
 I never said it was perfect. 
 Michaela : How'd the treasure hunt go? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 All I came up with was a flaming pen1s. 
 Is that some sort of gay euphemism? 
 No. 
 Uh, Elke gave Cody an std... 
 Tricha... mania or something. 
 Ohh. Just the  sound  of that hurts my ween. 
 Do you mean trichomoniasis? 
 Yeah. What... you have it? 
 I majored premed in undergrad. 
 I still remember everything... 
 Including that there's a specific antibiotic that treats trichomoniasis. 
 Tinidazole. I knew it. 
 Knew what? 
 That I just won our case for us. 
 Good luck with your little study group. 
 Just tell me... what'd you figure out? 
 Why ruin the suspense? 
 Annalise : Mr. Thomas, what happened if your wife ever drank a glass of wine before taking her sleeping pill? 
 Then she was pretty much impossible to wake. 
 I'd have to just let her sleep it off, which is why Gretchen doesn't usually drink. 
 But she did the night Elke was murdered? 
 It was a... special occasion. 
 Gretchen had just sold another house. 
 We celebrated at dinner. 
 Anything else happen that day? 
 You mean the murder? 
 No, I mean what your son, Cody, told you. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Mr. Thomas, on the day Elke was killed, didn't your son, Cody, tell you that he was experiencing some painful urination? 
 [ Spectators murmur ] 
 Well... yes, but I-I had... 
 And when he told you, did you not think back to when you had experienced the same painful urination? 
 How is this relevant, Your Honor? 
 Medical records show that Mr. Thomas was taking the prescription tinidazole, which is a prescription used specifically to treat trichomoniasis. 
 See what happens when you use your brain instead of your pen1s? 
 That drug was for Cody, not for me. 
 Wrong... you were prescribed that drug three months before Cody came to you. 
 Because the truth is, you needed your own because you, too, were taking part in a sexual affair with Elke. 
 And when your son came to you, he revealed that he was also sleeping with her... 
 A woman you thought solely was yours... 
 And you became jealous.  
 This is ridiculous. 
 At dinner that night, didn't you open a bottle of wine, even encourage your wife to have a glass to celebrate her new sale? 
 It was a really big commission. 
 No, you needed her to stay out of it that night so you can go into Elke's room and stab her to death. 
 That is... no! - Then you got your drugged, type-a wife out of bed, showed her the bloody, terrible mess you made, knowing full well that she would try and clean it up. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [ Sobs ] 
 It's too late for apologies, Mr. Thomas. 
 [ Spectators murmur ] 
 The defense rests. 
 You animal. 
 I hired you to defend me, not destroy my family. 
 That burn you feel right now is not because of what  I  did... 
 It's because of what  he  did. 
 He lied to you, betrayed you, took advantage of your loyalty and trust. 
 And that's unforgivable. 
 You'll thank me one day. 
 Professor Keating, since I helped in the case today, I was thinking... There's nothing barring you from taking the trophy from Asher and awarding it to me. 
 I thought you  had  the trophy. 
 No, but the fact that you're saying that means you think I deserve it, which I  do. 
 I don't care who has the trophy, Ms. Pratt... 
 You, Mr. Millstone. 
 It really doesn't matter. 
 Of course it matters. 
 You built our entire semester on it. 
 Winning it, t-that means you're at the top of the class, that... 
 Michaela. 
 You have a visitor. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Mrs. Walker. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I thought it best to talk in person... 
 Bring the Mountain to Mohammed, as they say. 
 Or do you not have time for your future mother-in-law? 
 [ Marching band plays, people cheering ] 
 Typical middleton behavior? 
 There's a bonfire for the football team tonight. 
 Oh. 
 Sports-driven university. 
 Lovely. 
 I know why you're here. 
 And while I realize a prenup is a delicate subject... 
 Now, there is nothing delicate about this. 
 This is not emotional. This is business. 
 Actually, this is about my marriage to Aiden, so... not business. 
 My husband and I built our company from the ground up. 
 The first store eventually became 10, 
 10 became 50, and now we run a multinational corporation. 
 And while Aiden has decided to pursue a political career... 
 Which makes Robert and me very happy... 
 This legacy will still belong to him. 
 So you understand why we will not allow you to waltz in and reap the benefits. 
 I'm not marrying Aiden for his money. 
 I'm marrying him because I love him. 
 Oh. Well, that's a beautiful sentiment. 
 But it's not one that I'll bet my life's work on. 
 I'm not signing the prenup. 
 And it's not because I want to take anyone's money, but because I plan on staying married to Aiden for the rest of my life. 
 That's how seriously I take this commitment. 
 Either sign... 
 Or I cancel the wedding. 
 Hm? 
 You sign, or I will make sure that you go back to that nasty, backwood, bayou swamp you came from, you stubborn bitch! 
 Oh, you want to play? 
 Let's go. 
 At least I know I was right about you now.

 What are you doing here? 
 Well, the firm gave me a few days off, and... thought I would surprise you. 
 Looks like I did. 
 Who is this?

 And you must be...

 [ People cheering, marching band playing ] 
 What is it? 
 I met Lila the night she was killed. 
 [ Pounding on door ] 
 [ Crying ] I need to see Annalise Keating. 
 Is this about Frank? 
 I don't know who Frank is. [ Inhales deeply ] 
 Is Annalise in there? 
 Do you need a lawyer? 
 You can talk to  me. 
 No. I just need to talk to Annalise. 
 Tell her it's about her husband. 
 She's not here. 
 That's her car, isn't it? 
 Annalise! 
 Listen. 
 I don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but I guarantee you're going to regret this. 
 So just take a deep breath, calm down, and go home. 
 Leave, or I call 911. 
 Fine. 
 But tell her I came to tell her something important. 
 He can't keep it a secret anymore. 
 She was talking about the pregnancy, right? 
 That was the secret? 
 Which means... you knew. 
 Sam. 
 Please. This isn't Annalise asking. 
 This is me. 
 What good would it do to tell her now? 
 I didn't hurt that girl. I swear. 
 But we both know how much this would devastate Annie. 
 Bon... 
 You've always had my back. 
 But I need you now more than ever. 
 Bonnie : [ Voice breaking ] I didn't know who she was... 
 Not until the fliers went up. 
 And I thought Sam was at Yale that night. 
 I thought you two were working through things, so I didn't think... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I just... 
 Didn't know what good it would do to tell you. 
 And I didn't believe that he could do such a thing... 
 That he could hurt her. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Crying ] He knew she was pregnant. 
 He told you that? 
 He kissed me... 
 So I'd lie to you. 
 He thought he was finally giving me what I wanted... 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 But... 
 He's not a good man, Annalise. 
 [ Crying ] 
 [ Whimpering ] 
 You're fired. 
 No. 
 Please. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Annalise. 
 Leave. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Voice breaking ] And don't come back. 
 Nate : Plug it into his computer. 
 It'll download all his phone information, including the coordinates where he was that night. 
 Well, what if he cleared his phone? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 If he backed it up before that, computer's storing what we need. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Tell me now if you want to bail. 
 Nope. 
 I'll call you when I get it. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Rebecca : I-I was just trying to do the right thing, for once. 
 You've done everything for me, risked everything. 
 I-I didn't want to hurt you or mess up your life any more than I already have. 
 When he came to me, I thought... 
 Her boyfriend! 
 I didn't know he was her boyfriend! 
 I would've told you if you just trusted me. 
 I do trust you. 
 Do you? 
 Because this... 
 She's setting us up. 
 You do get that? 
 Annalise doesn't do anything without some sort of plan. 
 So her telling me Lila's pregnant, then sending her boyfriend? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Now she knows I lied to her. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You should've told me. 
 I said I'm sorry. 
 I tell you everything... Things no one knows about me. 
 I know. 
 You just went behind my back like it's nothing. 
 I'm being honest  now. 
 It's hard for me to believe that. 
 [ Knock on door ] Connor: Waitlist! Open up! 
 Dude. 
 You should've told me you live in the ghetto. 
 Could've met at  my  place. 
 Am I... interrupting something? 
 Nope. I was just leaving. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Bitches be crazy. 
 [ Beatboxing ] 
 Hey, girl. You like to dance? 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Hey, yo. 
 Michaela. 
 Hey. 
 You're at... my place right now. 
 Yeah, uh, my brain's too fried to get any studying done tonight. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] [ Chuckles ] 
 So... where is everyone? 
 Not here yet. [ Chuckles ] 
 Well, um... 
 At least get me a drink. 
 Sure. 
 I'm thinking no one's showed yet because people know the bonfire goes all night. 
 People want to be pacing themselves, you know? 
 Of course. 
 This bonfire's been going on for over 100 years, though. 
 It's only been canceled twice... 
 Once for, uh, pearl harbor, and then once for some flu pandemic. 
 But tonight... 
 Tonight is gonna be a heezy, fo' sheezy... 
 [  Rap music plays  ] 
 Rebecca, let me in! 
 Laurel : Hey. 
 Sorry I'm late. [ Sighs ] 
 Are you crying? 
 No, it's just... really cold outside. 
 [ Pounding on door ] Rebecca! 
 Wes, how do you even know she's inside? 
 I mean, maybe she just turned on music to throw you off. 
 She took it. 
 Took what? 
 Did you bring your car? 
 Annalise : It's unorthodox, I know. 
 Who knows what we'll find? 
 But for the family's sake, it's important we get at the truth one way or another. 
 Thank you. 
 Who was that? 
 The DA's office. 
 Since Lila was pregnant, I'm demanding that they collect DNA samples of all the men in her life... 
 Including her teachers.
