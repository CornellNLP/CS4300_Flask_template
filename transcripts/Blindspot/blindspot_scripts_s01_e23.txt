 (shower running) 
 Jane : No, please, you can't die. 
 Weller : Hey. 
 Bill : Where is she? 
 It's me. Wha... What did I do? 
 She's under the fort, Kurt. 
 It was an accident. 
 I didn't mean to... I didn't... 
 She was so small. 
 Weller : Who's under the fort, Dad? 
 Taylor. 
 Her body. 
 Weller : What are you talking about, Dad? 
 Bill : I killed her, son. 
 I killed Taylor Shaw. 
 (shower running) 
 Weller : He said something right before he passed. 
 A confession. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 He seemed... so lucid. 
 But what he was saying... 
 What happens to the mind as it's dying? 
 Is it possible that he... 
 Well, it's possible that your father was delusional, that, as his brain and body were shutting down, his synapses were firing in such a way as to make him see or say things that weren't real. 
 That's certainly very common. 
 Or... 
 He could have been telling you the truth. 
 Honestly, Kurt, if anyone could judge whether or not your father was lucid, it would probably be you. 
 So what does your gut tell you? 
 You guys heard from Jane? 
 No. 
 She's not answering her phone. 
 She doesn't have to, right? She doesn't work here anymore. 
 Is something wrong? 
 I gotta go. 
 Wait, why? Allie's coming in to talk... 
 My father died last night. 
 I gotta... I gotta go. 
 Kurt, it's fine, we got this. 
 Do you want someone to go with you? 
 No, no, I'm good. You stay here. 
 I gotta take care of something. 
 Weller : Jane? 
 (gunshot) 
 Oscar : I can't lose you. 
 We've talked about this. 
 No, you've talked about it! 
 I... 
 Why does it have to be you? 
 You know why. 
 I love you. 
 And I love you, more than anything, but this is bigger than all of us. 
 Please, don't let him inject you with that poison. 
 What if you don't come back? Have you thought about that? 
 That's a risk every solider takes. 
 That's not what I mean, and you know it. 
 What if you... you don't come back, ever? 
 What happens then? 
 I think we need to talk to Shepherd. 
 No, no, that's... 
 Yes. 
 This was a mistake. 
 I don't think you should be my handler. 
 Jane : You're my starting point. 
 Patterson : She was born in Africa. 
 Weller : No, she was born in Pennsylvania. 
 I was there the day they brought her home. 
 The DNA results directly contradict the isotope test. 
 Weller : Is she Taylor Shaw or not? 
 Allie : Really? 
 Mayfair hasn't reached out to any of you? 
 I find that very hard to believe. 
 Mayfair is innocent, and she's smart. 
 Do you really think she would call the FBI if she ran? 
 She hacked her ankle monitor. 
 She's desperate, and she's on the run. 
 Desperate people do stupid things. 
 (sighs) 
 Look, I like you guys. 
 I do. 
 Which is why I'm giving you this one last chance, 'cause if I find out later that you've kept something from me, you are all going down for aiding and abetting. 
 We like you, too, Allie. 
 We'll let you know if she reaches out. 
 Okay. 
 Can you believe her? 
 Sarah : No, it's crazy. 
 That's what he said, Sarah. 
 Well, then who is she? 
 If Jane isn't... 
 I don't know! 
 That's the problem. 
 What about the scar on her neck from when we were kids? 
 What about her DNA? You said her DNA was a match. 
 I know what I said! 
 But what he said was, "She's under the fort." 
 I think he buried her under the old fort in that backyard. 
 His body was shutting down, okay? 
 Who knows what was going on inside of his head? 
 Think about it... it doesn't make sense. 
 Why would he bury her in our backyard? 
 His shoes were muddy that night. 
 If you kill a girl, you don't bury her in your own backyard! 
 If that's what you've done, if that's really the kind of person that you are, there's no telling what else you might do. 
 Okay, wait, the cops searched the whole place. 
 They turned the whole place upside-down. 
 They never looked under the fort, did they? 
 So there's only one way to be sure. 
 I'm driving to Clearfield. 
 I have to see if she's there. 
 Then I'm going with you. 
 Fine. 
 Let's settle this once and for all. 
 ♪♪ 
 (latch rattling) 
 Jane? 
 Hi, Ana. 
 What are you... 
 Is something wrong? 
 Yeah. 
 I need your help. 
 Come in. 
 I have a number someone gave me, in case of emergencies. 
 He's a... a go-between for... 
 For? 
 Look, I want to keep you out of this as much as possible, okay? 
 I have a number. I need you to trace it. 
 That's all you really need to know. 
 I'm happy to do this for you, but this is something Patterson can do in her sleep. 
 Someone I trusted did something horrible. 
 (gunshot) 
 I don't know who I can trust anymore. 
 I don't even know if I can trust myself. 
 I need to bring this guy in. 
 I need your help. 
 Can you help me? 
 Let me get set up. 
 Zapata : Have you heard from Mayfair since she called you yesterday? 
 Me, neither. 
 We gotta go check out that address. 
 She's trying to keep us out of this. 
 Yeah, well, she's not doing a great job, is she? 
 I don't know. 
 If the roles were reversed, you think Mayfair would just stand here and do nothing? 
 You coming or what? 
 Sarah : Dad, Taylor's alive. 
 Patterson : Her DNA is a match. 
 You are Taylor Shaw. 
 Did we used to go fishing? 
 Jane remembers fishing in Anderson Creek. 
 Her DNA matches Taylor's. 
 Dad was on a lot of morphine, so... 
 Maybe his mind was playing tricks on him. 
 Or... 
 Maybe mine was. 
 Kurt, I know you. 
 Okay, you're just gonna keep turning this over in your head for the rest of your life. 
 It's gonna affect your relationship with me, Sawyer, Taylor. 
 We need to see what's under that fort. 
 Okay, now, that number you're using is a burner, too, so you're gonna have to keep him online long enough for me to triangulate his location based on cell phone towers. 
 Got it? 
 Yeah, got it. 
 Okay. 
 Ready when you are. 
 (dialer beeping) 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Joey's Pizza. 
 I need to cancel my order. 
 I'm afraid that's not possible right now. 
 Wait, I... I was told I could call and cancel any time. 
 It's been a busy day for us, a lot of orders. 
 You know who this is, right? 
 And you know who this is! 
 There are rules. 
 (whispering) Okay, got it. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 Jane, who are these people? 
 For your own safety, I can't. 
 I owe you one. 
 You saved my life. 
 I'd say I still owe you a few. 
 Zapata : What was Mayfair looking for here? 
 Reade : You smell that? 
 Zapata : Bleach. 
 Yeah, lots of it. 
 Zapata : Spring cleaning? 
 Reade : I'd say they missed a couple spots. 
 Somebody tried to clean something. 
 And recently. 
 Hey, I think I got something. 
 (grunting) 
 Hey, can you lift this for me? 
 (creaking) 
 (grunts) 
 Thanks. 
 A shell casing. 
 What the hell happened here? 
 We need a CSU. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 And what do we tell them? 
 Fine. 
 Then we need Patterson. 
 (door creaks) 
 (child's echoing laughter) 
 Sarah : Hey. You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 This place looks exactly the same. 
 How long has it been since you've been here? 
 Couple of decades. 
 Let's get this over with. 
 Zapata : So what do you think? 
 (spraying) 
 Hey, Patterson, how we doing? 
 The silent treatment, really? 
 That's how we're playing this? 
 We said we were sorry. 
 I tell you guys everything! 
 We were aiding and abetting a fugitive. 
 We were just trying to keep you out of it. 
 You were aiding and abetting Mayfair. 
 Mayfair! I am happy to aid and abet Mayfair. 
 All right, now we know. 
 Next time, we'll come to you right away, we promise. 
 (sighs) 
 Apology accepted. 
 All right. 
 Hit the lights. 
 Oh, no. 
 Reade : Please tell me that's not... 
 Residual blood. 
 And... lots of it. 
 This is very not good. 
 (creaking, Sarah and Weller grunting) 
 Okay. 
 Actually, it wasn't. 
 In fact, it was a pain in the ass. 
 I had to call around all day. 
 Point is, I found it. 
 50 pounds of lye under "Donato." 
 You got your Donato ID? 
 Good. 
 Give me a call if there's a problem. 
 (Jane coughing) 
 (grunting) 
 (gun clicks) 
 ♪♪ 
 Don't shoot. 
 What the hell you doing here? 
 I told you, I had an emergency. 
 Mayfair. We know, we're taking care of it. 
 No, not Mayfair... Cade. 
 Where's Oscar? 
 I want him to watch you die for what he did to Marcos. 
 (gunshot) 
 Cade is dead. 
 No... he isn't. 
 We never found a body. 
 He was tailing me this morning. 
 I was able to shake him, but if he's onto me, he could be onto Oscar. 
 There's an apartment building at 144th Street and Broadway. 
 Door code, 3-7-1-5. 
 Go to apartment 312. 
 We need to get you secured. 
 And Oscar will meet me there? 
 Oscar is busy. 
 Roman will take you upstate. 
 No, I need Oscar. 
 Cade... 
 Let us worry about Cade. 
 Get to the apartment in Harlem. 
 Roman will take you the rest of the way. 
 Go! 
 (grunts) 
 (shovel scrapes) 
 (clanking) 
 (sighs) 
 It's just a rock. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 50 pounds of lye? 
 Yeah. He said it would be under the name Donato. 
 Can you cross-check recent orders around the city? 
 You know, to, like, see if anything matches that? 
 Jane, that much lye, unless this guy is making a hell of a lot of homemade soap, that's as much as you need to break down a body. 
 Whose body are they trying to get rid of and why? 
 What have you gotten yourself into? 
 Nothing good. 
 Okay, but I'm trying to stop it. 
 Stop what? 
 Ana, please. 
 Just find me the order. 
 Let me make this right. 
 I've already hurt too many people. 
 I want to run the trace blood samples against our DNA database, check to see if it's Mayfair's. 
 I'm going to create a virtual machine here first, because if I run this in the open system, all sorts of alarm bells are gonna go off. 
 All that blood. 
 It can't be hers. 
 It just can't be. 
 When Mayfair was arrested, the U.S. attorney seized all of her weapons. 
 But the shell casing we found, nine millimeter, same caliber as a pistol registered to her ex-husband. 
 Guess they didn't catch that one. 
 I just... I don't understand the why. 
 Who would go after her like this? 
 Someone she put away? 
 I... 
 A while back, Mayfair had me investigating Carter's disappearance. 
 It was a kind of a side thing, off the books. 
 Go on. 
 I grabbed a still from a traffic cam at the DOT. 
 There was somebody driving Carter's car after he was murdered. 
 It was blurry, but we think it might have been the guy who killed him. 
 What? 
 There's more. 
 I was attacked by a masked man who threatened to kill Sarah and Sawyer if I didn't back away. 
 Mayfair waved me off of it, but... it's possible she continued investigating on her own. 
 And you knew about this, too? 
 If it makes you feel any better, he only told me yesterday. 
 You guys are my family! 
 If someone is threatening you, they're threatening me, but if you keep me in the dark, I can't help you, and we're supposed to help each other, right? 
 If something would have happened, and... and if there's something that I could have done and I... 
 (sighs) 
 I can't take that. 
 Understood. 
 Truly. 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 Let's get back to committing numerous felonies. 
 Ana : Found it. 
 Rock Chemical Wholesalers. 
 50 pounds of lye under "Donato." 
 Still waiting for pickup. 
 Great. 
 Pretty sure we're even now. 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. 
 Kurt. 
 Kurt. 
 (panting) 
 She's not here. 
 She's not here. 
 He was just... 
 Dying. 
 (electricity crackling) 
 (cell phone vibrating) 
 (engine starts) 
 (phone alert pings) 
 Weller :  Hey, it's me. My phone's about to die. I was just checking in to see how you're doing. 
 I know yesterday was rough. 
 And, um... 
 Look, uh, I... I gotta tell you. 
 My, uh... 
 My father died last night. 
 I wanted to tell you, because, um... Because... 
 (chuckling) 
 I don't know, uh... 
 No, I do know why. 
 When things happen to me in my life... 
 you're the first person I think about. And you always have been. 
 I guess... 
 (sniffles) 
 I just wanted to hear your voice. 
 (chuckling) 
 Hear you... tell me everything's gonna be okay. 
 I'm really glad you're back in my life, Taylor. 
 I, um... (chuckling) just, um... (clears throat) Just call me back. (chuckling) Bye. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 (truck engine starts) 
 
 
 
 Reade : All right, well, soon as you find out, just let me know, all right? 
 I got the tests back. 
 And... 
 It's Mayfair's blood. 
 Weller's phone keeps going straight to voicemail. 
 Okay... just because she was shot doesn't mean she's dead. 
 That was a lot of blood. 
 The human body holds a lot. 
 We have a lot to lose. 
 And there was no body. 
 They used the bleach to hide what they did. 
 If there was a body, they would have hidden that, too. 
 Okay, even... even if she was investigating this off the books, she must have kept some sort of record somewhere. 
 Somewhere not here. 
 Her house. 
 It's a crime scene. It's sealed. 
 I have a couple of extra seals in my car. 
 Let me just say this out loud. 
 Every step we take from here brings us further and further across the line. 
 I'm not just talking about our jobs. 
 If we get caught breaking the seal to that house, they're gonna put us away. 
 If they catch us. 
 Patterson : So... who's driving? 
 (sighs) 
 (grunting) 
 Whoa, easy, we're on the same team. 
 Not for long. 
 After the memory wipe, you're gonna have to win my trust back, and that's not gonna be easy. 
 Chances are, when we meet again, I will come at you. 
 You don't think I can win you back? 
 I don't want your feelings clouding your judgment, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Who's clouded? 
 (grunting) 
 (door creaks) 
 (zap, stun gun crackling) 
 Does Mayfair have a home office? 
 Uh, upstairs, I think. 
 Wait! 
 I've been here before, a bunch of times, and this painting was different. 
 Zapata : Are you sure? 
 I'm positive. 
 So she decided to do some quick redecorating before going on the run? 
 Or decides to leave us a sign. 
 (sighs) 
 Now, that's what I call a lead. 
 Patterson : It's a Biro. 
 Why did it have to be a Biro? 
 Is that bad? 
 No, not bad. 
 It's the worst. 
 Biros are perfectly designed. 
 If I had my tools, I could maybe bust this open in a day or two. 
 We don't have that kind of time. 
 No. 
 She changed the painting because she wanted you to see it. 
 She wants us to get into this thing. 
 If I were Mayfair, I'd make the code something we could guess. 
 Okay, who wants to go first? 
 Seeing him with Sawyer these last few... reminded me of what he was like... before Taylor. 
 He's so good with him. 
 Was... so good with him. 
 I'm glad I saw it. 
 He really loved you. 
 He loved you, too. 
 Mm-mmm. 
 Yeah. Another family trait. 
 Drinking the well dry. 
 Ten bucks says there's a backup six in the garage. 
 Better to have it and not need it than need it... 
 And not have it. 
 ...and not have it. 
 Ten bucks? 
 I'll take that action. 
 I knew you would. 
 All right. 
 (chuckling) 
 I'll be back in a bit. 
 What happened? 
 Kurt! 
 Kurt! 
 Patterson : Could be badge numbers? 
 (keypad beeping) 
 (beep) 
 Uh... 
 Could be... security PIN. 
 You know her security PIN? 
 System administrator, I know all your PINs. 
 Reade : Hey, guys. 
 Come take a look at this. 
 Do these mean anything to either of you? 
 A snake, a dog, a pig, and a... mouse. 
 No, it's a rat. 
 A mouse, a rat. What is the difference? 
 They're Chinese Zodiac signs. 
 Oh, you're totally right! 
 Weller's the snake, I'm the dog, Reade's the rat. 
 And Zapata, you're the pig. 
 Shut up. 
 I didn't say it. 
 The Zodiac did. You do like ribs. 
 Our birth years are the code. 
 (keypad beeping) 
 (click, beep) 
 (squeaking) 
 Reade : A USB key. 
 We went camping, this spot had all these little plots. 
 They had cheesy western names like... 
 Monument Valley, Little Big Horn. 
 (children squealing) 
 This is my favorite place in the whole world. 
 (faint clatter) 
 Feels like the end. 
 I love you. 
 You know where I come from, how I grew up. 
 I never thought any of this would be possible for me. 
 Shepherd kept telling me that it would happen one day, but I didn't believe it. 
 This isn't the end. 
 We'll find each other again... on the other side of all of this. 
 I promise. 
 (door creaking) 
 We're ready. 
 I'm sorry I failed you. 
 I don't blame you for hating me. 
 All I can do is promise that... 
 I won't make the same mistakes next time. 
 Next time? 
 What are you talking about? 
 The mission can't continue like this. 
 Our relationship is too compromised. 
 So... 
 (sighs) I've decided to start from scratch. 
 Oscar... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I have to wipe your memory again. 
 (computer beeping) 
 "To expose the clues, just use the key. One query completes the puzzle. Guess for whom the bell tolls." 
 What? 
 She encrypted the file. 
 She knows how to do that? 
 Yeah, I mean, this is over-the-counter stuff. 
 You buy the USB, you write whatever you want in the password prompt... it's not that hard. 
 It says use the key. 
 The key is right there, so... 
 Worth a shot. 
 computer voice :  Incorrect. 
 Oh, come on! 
 You have one more attempt before the drive will self-delete. 
 Self-delete? Is that over-the-counter, too? 
 Unfortunately, yes. 
 We're sure Mayfair wrote this? 
 I mean... yes? Right? 
 And if we guess one more time and we're wrong, this thing self-destructs? 
 Yep. 
 So we better be really, really, really sure. 
 (thunder rumbling) 
 boy : Don't worry, I'll keep you safe. 
 I'll always keep you safe. 
 I promise. 
 (thunder crashes) 
 (grunting) 
 Please don't do this. 
 I'm... I'm just starting to feel like I know who I am again. 
 You have no idea who you are. 
 I know that I'm Taylor Shaw. 
 And I know that this was all my idea. 
 And I know that... we were in love. 
 (thunder rumbling) 
 Yeah. 
 (sighs) Yeah, we were in love. 
 And, yes, this was your idea. 
 But... this is Shepherd's mission. 
 Always will be. 
 (grunting) 
 And, no... 
 You were never Taylor Shaw. 
 (thunder crashes) 
 (screaming) 
 But my DNA. 
 Broke into the evidence locker in Clearfield over a year ago. 
 We placed Taylor's DNA samples with yours. 
 But you called me Taylor. 
 That was your idea. 
 You figured by the time I revealed myself, you'd be so deeply convinced you were Taylor... 
 Why shift your narrative more than we had to? 
 But... why? 
 Why me? 
 Why Taylor? 
 Weller. 
 What? 
 Phase One: We wanted Mayfair out and didn't want her replaced by someone worse. 
 The tattoos would take down our enemies and... give Kurt so many wins, he'd be the clear successor. 
 And with Taylor Shaw in place right next to him, he'd... he'd be someone we could control. 
 You were never supposed to have those flashbacks, though. 
 Marcos was obviously a little too conservative with the dose. 
 I won't make that mistake again, either. 
 Marcos : Everything that you have been will cease to exist. 
 Marcos was the bearded man. 
 Where's Oscar? 
 I want him to watch you die for what he did to Marcos. 
 Cade didn't kill Marcos that night, you did. 
 (gunshots) 
 And that's why Cade came after you. 
 Marcos was handling Chao, and Chao was supposed to die. 
 When he didn't, Marcos had to take care of it. 
 We're trained not to leave a trace. 
 Find me that doctor. 
 Oscar : Shepherd made the call: Marcos had to go. 
 And, instead of facing it like a man, he just panicked and tried to turn you against us. 
 Can't trust nobody. 
 (gunshots, breaking glass) 
 Marcos was like a brother to Cade. 
 That's why he wanted you dead. 
 He wanted me to feel like he felt. 
 Who is Shepherd? 
 And what's Orion? 
 Shepherd is our leader. 
 Brought you back from the dead. 
 Shepherd... 
 Shepherd is the reason we're here. 
 You're scared of him. 
 (scoffs) 
 What? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 In a couple hours, you won't remember any of this. 
 If removing Mayfair was Phase One, then what's Phase Two? 
 This country is on the brink of collapse. 
 Has been for decades. 
 This government doesn't care about the people. 
 It's too broken, too corrupt. 
 Phase Two is about burning it to the ground so we can start again. 
 Only from the ashes can we rise. 
 You promised you'd love me no matter what. 
 I'm really sorry this is what it's gonna take. 
 You left a trace, too. 
 What? 
 Mayfair. 
 She found you. 
 You left a trace, too. 
 So what's Shepherd gonna say about that, huh? 
 Or does he even know? 
 I love you. 
 I'll see you in a little while. 
 On the other side of all this. 
 Uhh! 
 (chair splintering and clattering) 
 I'm bringing you in. 
 No more secrets and no more lies! 
 You're under arrest. 
 You're not FBI. You hate the FBI! 
 This entire government betrayed you. 
 I... am bringing you in. 
 I don't wanna hurt you. 
 Put it down. 
 Doesn't have to be this way. 
 Yes, it does. 
 It's over, Oscar. 
 Uhh! 
 (groaning) 
 Uhh! 
 Enough! 
 Uhh! 
 (sighs) 
 (loud creaking) 
 (glass shattering) 
 (coughing) 
 (fire crackling) 
 (metallic clatter) 
 I want him to watch you die for what he did to Marcos. 
 (shaking can) 
 (spraying) 
 "To expose the clues, just use the key. One query completes the puzzle. Guess for whom the bell tolls." 
 Guess for whom the bell tolls. 
 Does that wording sound weird to anyone else? 
 Oh, man. 
 Oh, man, okay. 
 Zapata : What? 
 All right, it's a pangram. 
 The reason it sounds weird is because she uses every letter of the alphabet except four in the instructions: 
 "A," "D," "I," and "V." 
 "David." 
 She made this for me. 
 So the password is David? 
 No. 
 There's not enough letters. 
 David is the key to unlocking it. 
 It's a Vigenère cipher. 
 Well, what if she used a Vigenère cipher? 
 Right, just like the first puzzle we decoded off Jane's body... it's worth a shot. 
 Yes, yes. Okay. 
 A Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on the letters of a keyword. 
 Okay, so "David" is the keyword. 
 And L-M-N-W-U-U-Y is... 
 "I'm sorry." 
 "Orion." 
 I don't remember. 
 What? 
 Orion. 
 Orion is all that he said? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 (computer beeping) 
 Whoa. 
 What the hell did Mayfair get caught up in? 
 I don't know. 
 But now we're in it, too. 
 Jane : Kurt, it's me. 
 Please call me back. 
 It's really important. 
 Weller : My phone died. 
 Kurt? 
 Jane. 
 I helped myself. 
 Hope you don't mind. 
 I've been trying to call you. 
 Are you... 
 What happened? 
 My father died. 
 I know, I got your message. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Are you? 
 Of course I am. 
 Kurt, s-something happened today and... 
 It's funny that we still call you Jane. 
 Isn't it? I get it. 
 You don't really feel connected to Taylor. 
 It... was such a long time ago, wasn't it? 
 What is that? 
 It was Taylor's. 
 It was her favorite doll. 
 She took it everywhere. 
 She couldn't sleep without it. 
 So he buried her with it. 
 What? 
 He buried her with it... Jane. 
 My father... killed Taylor Shaw, 25 years ago. 
 He told me, right before he died. 
 So... if Taylor Shaw is dead... 
 (gun cocks) 
 Then who the hell are you? 
 I don't know. 
 Who are you?! 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 But, Kurt, please... 
 Turn around, get on your knees, and put your hands on your head. 
 I can explain. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Kurt... 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 No, don't do this. 
 You have the right to an attorney. 
 You need to listen to me. 
 You said you remembered! 
 You remembered what?! 
 Fishing? 
 Camping with us? 
 How?! 
 You lied to me. 
 I let my father back into my life... into my home. 
 I let him be around Sawyer! 
 He killed her. 
 And I let him back in... because of you. 
 So turn around... get on your knees... and put your hands on your head. 
 I'm not gonna say it again. 
 Do it. 
 Put your hands on your head. 
 (handcuffs snapping) 
 Kurt, please. 
 It's over. 
 Whatever this is, whatever it was about... it's finished. 
 But... 
 Jane Doe... you're under arrest.
