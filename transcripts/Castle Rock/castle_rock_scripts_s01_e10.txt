 HENRY: How much doubt is reasonable? 
  Well, folks if I had to choose whether or not to take someone s life and that is the choice before you today, make no mistake I don t think any amount would seem reasonable. 
  Now, me, I had to kill someone, I d need it etched in gold and signed by God Himself. 
  So I ask how much doubt are you folks comfortable with? 
  MATTHEW: He tells me a story He says he s my son, Henry. 
  Adopted. 
  - [SCREAMS] 
  - MOLLY: Did you start the fire in the hospital? 
  MATTHEW: And then he starts in: "I heard it, Dad. 
  " We have to go. 
  To the woods. 
  WILLIE: The schisma has been getting louder again, Henry. 
  It hasn t risen to these levels - in decades. 
  - [HIGH-PITCHED HUM] 
  Do you hear it? 
  We have to go We have to go to the woods. 
  Who are you? 
  LACY: The reason, the stain, the curse on our town, dragging evil behind you everywhere you went. 
  THE KID: I was trying to get back. 
  I couldn t. 
  Then Lacy found me. 
  - [MUFFLED SHOUTING] 
  - Took me to Shawshank. 
  LACY: But after all these years I still don t know what you really are. 
  THE KID: You believe me, don t you? 
  [CLANKS]

  You see, I figured out the problem, Henry. 
  She s the problem. 
  She s forced you to deceive me - No, sir - the way that she s deceived me for the last year with the Sheriff. 
  She lies with another man, and that s a sin in the eyes of the Lord. 
  But soon your mother will be called home, and when she s gone, we will live pure, just the two of us, in the cathedral of His voice. 
  Gone where?

  To go out to the woods with him. 
  MOLLY: Yes. 
  He thinks that the door is the The door or whatever it is he thinks it s open right now and he doesn t know how long it will stay open for. 
  We need to turn him in, Molly. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Where am I supposed to meet him? 
  You re not gonna help him. 
  My dad took me out to the woods chasing after a sound, and he ended up dead. 
  Now, let s say I do believe this. 
  Now you re saying that you went out there and you ended up dead too, so either way, someone always ends up dead.

  It s OK. 
  You know this man, don t you? 
  He s dead. 
  Eyewitness says that you and Mr. 
  Branch had an argument a few nights ago. 
  So here we are again. 
  [BANGING ON DOOR] 
  Where is he? 
  Who? 
  You let him stay here after we released him. 
  Oh. 
  Um but he s not here. 
  Warden Lacy was right. 
  He s the f*cking devil. 
  Hey. 
  Are you OK? 
  Do you need to come inside and sit down or something? 
  Oh! 
  REESE: Your fingerprints were found in the RV, and your DNA, you were in the woods late at night, you fled the scene of a crime. 
  Friend of your father. 
  The bed & breakfast, breaking and entering. 
  Wherever you go, there s bloodshed. 
  [SIGHS] 
  People have always had questions about you. 
  Questions that never got answered.

  GUARD: Jesus. 
  [PHONE BUZZING] 
  MOLLY: Hello? 
  You think he left it for Porter? 
  It s exactly like the one he left in my office. 
  I don t know what to believe about him anymore. 
  Molly, I need a favor. 
  A big one. 
  I need you to take Wendell to Boston. 
  - To his mother. 
  - OK. 
  And from there, just keep drivin . 
  Start over.

  COP: Hands up! 
  Your dad didn t do anything. 
  You know that, right? 
  I guess. 
  MOLLY: This town is f*cked up. 
  Always has been. 
  Does it have something to do with the sound whatever s in the woods?

  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  You sent them. 
  I understand. 
  It s what I would have done. 
  She told you everything? 
  I don t know how much time we have left. 
  If the sound stops I think I could be stuck here. 
  As long as I m here, things will get worse. 
  People will die. 
  I can t stop it. 
  I m not supposed to be here. 
  HENRY: And you didn t want any of this? 
  Who are you? 
  Same as you a victim. 
  Mm-mm. 
  No. 
  I don t believe you. 
  What about the dream? 
  You re in a basement or locked in a cage. 
  It makes sense that you don t remember. 
  Think about what you went through in that cage. 
  When they found me, even after I got out, it didn t all fit together. 
  But then I got to your house my house. 
  Your memories will come back, too. 
  Maybe in pieces one at a time. 
  They will. 
  If my mom had stayed in Castle Rock with my dad in your world, I mean what would have happened? 
  It would have killed her. 
  He knew all about Alan and Mom. 
  She told me after we left. 
  Romans 6:23.

  Most of us are trapped here for a reason. 
  [CAR STARTS] 
  Everyone in this town has some sin or regret some cage of his own making. 
  And a story, a sad one, about how we got this way. 
  "It wasn t me, it was this place. 
  " That s what we say. 
  But that s a story, too. 
  It doesn t change a thing. 
  Maybe something turned you into a monster. 
  Or maybe you were one all along. 
  Doesn t matter. 
  You re here now this is who you are. 
  This is where you live. 
  This is where you re from.
