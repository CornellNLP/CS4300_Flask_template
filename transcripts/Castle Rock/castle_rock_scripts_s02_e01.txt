  A slap in the face. 
  Somalis took what they needed when they needed it, and now that they're dug in, guess what, we don't even get a "thank you". 
  We sure as hell don't get a return on our investment. 
  If they put a prayer room in that new mall, folks, guess what [ENGINE RUMBLING] 
  They're smart, these folks, and we've been stupid. 
  And now they're taking it all. 
  Not just our business either.

  ABDI: It's just business, right? 
  That's what Pop taught me. 
  ACE: You know why you got this land? 
  'Cause no one else f*cking wants it. 
  HASSAN: Haunted, right? 
  Ghosts of the white people who used to live here? 
  ABDI: Who were those?

  Mom? 
  You give that landlord two lanes. 
  You understand? 
  JOY: Why? 
  He seems okay. 
  ANNIE: He's not. 
  After the accident, he didn't even charge us to tow the car. 
  Exactly. 
  Nothing's for free with a man like that, believe you me. 
  - Mom. 
  - Joy. 
  If you can't see how that dirty bird's been looking at us [SIGHS] 
  I haven't taught you anything. 
  JOY: Are you okay? 
  You seem a little you know. 
  This isn't about me. 
  You know, if if you're not feeling like yourself, you can tell me. 
  I just mean, you haven't had your medicine in a week, right? 
  I'm getting more pills at the hospital today. 
  Don't you worry one little bit. 
  [LOCK CLICKS, HANDLE RATTLES] 
  After I finish school stuff, can I go to the store? 
  To get more drawing paper. 
  I got you some two towns ago. 
  We're not millionaires, Joy. 
  I don't know, I'm just I'm feeling a little cabin-fevery. 
  I haven't been out of the house in a week. 
  Little love [TENSE MUSIC] 
  This town is not a good place. 
  Not just that dirty bird. 
  He's the roach you can see. 
  The rest are in the walls. 
  I've heard things. 
  Massacres. 
  Kids vanishing into thin air. 
  Okay, Mom. 
  ANNIE: Just a couple more days. 
  We'll get the car fixed good as new. 
  We'll be back on the road in no time. 
  JOY: To where? 
  The Laughing Place, of course. 
  Where? 
  Montreal, still? 
  ANNIE: Why not? 
  I need to get ready for my interview. 
  When I'm gone, you don't open up that door for anyone, understand? 
  [BIRD CAWING] 
  JAMAL: How many shifts are you after? 
  How's April looking for you? 
  ANNIE: Oh, I'm just passing through. 
  Your ad said you needed temp RNs. 
  Okay, you on any medications? 
  - No. 
  - JAMAL: State screening. 
  Now even temp RNs have to list. 
  ANNIE: Oh, well, vitamin D. 
  JAMAL: Docs love to push the vitamin D, right? 
  Okay, then, just need two forms of ID, Ms. 
  Ingalls. 
  Birth certificate. 
  It's a copy. 
  I hope that's okay.

  All NARCAN all the time. 
  [MARKER SQUEAKING]

  Only docs and nurse practitioners have the passcode. 
  Seems like a lot of extra work.

  That's a f*cking mystery. 
  Who'd want to leave you? 
  ACE: You could've put an end to this sh1t. 
  POP: Could I have? 
  That f*cking land Abdi got for a song and a handjob? 
  That was imminent domain. 
  One call to the f*cking state board, no new mall. 
  You could have stuck your dick in and ended this whole thing. 
  That what you want? 
  Me sticking my dick in? 
  f*ck, thought you wanted to be in charge. 
  You just served me up to him and the rakes. 
  Jesus Christ, Pop, you gotta tell Abdi, "Cut this sh1t out. 
  " - We're gonna lose everything! 
  - "We"? 
  No, the mall, your house, everything you f*cking have, I gave you.

  There used to be a bunch of them that lived around here like a million years ago. 
  Right.

  Probably witches buried right under our feet.

  Not this awful, false thing that passes as life, that people in places like this say is life. 
  It isn't. 
  Now, people in places like this will tell you the trash on the highway shoulder is all there is and you should chase after that trash as it blows in the filthy wind, and they will try to make you one of them. 
  They'll say, "Oh, there's no such thing as standards anymore. 
  " And they will call that freedom, but it's their freedom to make you trash their trash so they can use you and own you and throw you away JOY: Mom - But I won't let them! 
  It'll be blood on Christmas before I let them, Joy! 
  I'll throw my blamed body between you and anybody! 
  Mom!

  Is it poaching if he's just giving them a better deal?

  Hi, Doc. 
  Just grabbing a Zofran for six. 
  - NADIA: Anne? 
  - ANNIE: Mm-hmm? 
  NADIA: There's nobody in six. 
  I know that. 
  I what I meant was I was grabbing one for Anne, stop. 
  Okay. 
  I lost the chart. 
  - I forgot the rules - What are you stealing? 
  - Oxycontin? 
  Fentanyl? 
  - No! 
  - You're an addict. 
  - No, no, no, I swear. 
  - NADIA: So you're selling the drugs. 
  - ANNE: No! 
  I'm gonna call the cops if you don't tell me what you're doing here right now. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  I'm not right. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  I've got these things in my mind. 
  People running around [STAMMERS] 
  and memories. 
  I stumped 'em, though. 
  The headshrinkers, they couldn't diagnose me. 
  They could not make me right, but I found the recipe. 
  What recipe? 
  Risperdal, Haldol, Lithium. 
  Antipsychotics. 
  You're stealing antipsychotics. 
  Why? 
  ANNIE: Because I can't those go on my chart, the state association sees that, I can't work in a hospital. 
  I need my pills. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Because Joy, she needs the real me. 
  - [BABY CRYING] 
  - The right me. 
  And the good Lord knows, there's more to all of us, and not all of it's good but I am trying for Joy. 
  Joy is your daughter? 
  ANNIE: I lost my own mom when I was about her age, so I know I know how hard it would be for her if I couldn't [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  NADIA: What are the doses? 
  - What? 
  - Risperdal, Haldol, Lithium. 
  How much? 
  40, 20, 10. 
  NADIA: Risper I'll have to make a couple of small adjustments. 
  We'll use samples and off-labels, but you'll get what you need. 
  [PAPER RUSTLES] 
  The rules. 
  NADIA: As long as you're working at this hospital, I can cover you. 
  ANNIE: But why are you If more people took Lithium and not Oxy, this would be a much better world. 
  But if you feel an episode coming on, call me. 
  Thank you. 
  Where'd you find it? 
  I thought I left my key at home. 
  Behind your desk. 
  It fell. 
  [SOFT MUSIC] 
  CHRIS: Okay, and this and, uh, your keys. 
  So you got Old Bessie back? 
  ANNIE: I did. 
  And some medicine? 
  Yes. 
  So we're leaving? 
  We're searchers, you and me. 
  My dad, your grandpa that good old guy, they don't make men like that, little love not anymore. 
  Now they just make dirty birds and paper fakes. 
  No heroes, no real men, sorry to say. 
  But my dad was one of them, and he would say to me, "Annie, there are two kinds of people that made America: searchers and settlers. 
  " He was a searcher, Dad, your grandpa. 
  He settled for nothing, that one. 
  And my mom, she was a settler. 
  You set her down anywhere and she would make a home. 
  She would make it perfect, and she would keep making it perfect until [NOSTALGIC MUSIC] 
  Till it said uncle, you know? 
  And me, well I'm kind of a funny old oogy mess of both. 
  All mixed up sometimes, but good things besides and always, always your best interests at heart, Joy. 
  See, I'm a searcher who just wants to settle. 
  Wants it bad. 
  I just can't seem to find a place to alight. 
  Can't seem to find that Laughing Place that'll live up to you my perfection. 
  I'm not saying this is it, but I am saying you deserve a chance to see to settle a little, make a place in the world. 
  Maybe anywhere could be the Laughing Place if we're there together. 
  Even here. 
  Maybe. 
  Mm. 
  What's this for? 
  You've been cooped up long enough. 
  Why don't you go get yourself some drawing paper? 
  [STAMMERS] 
  By myself? 
  How else are you gonna draw us up a better world? 
  ABDI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
  Ace did some KKK sh1t. 
  Trying to burn us both alive. 
  - Ace? 
  - Thank God you weren't here. 
  NADIA: This has to stop, Abdi. 
  ABDI: It will. 
  Put that away! 
  Do not make things worse.

  What are you doing in my house? 
  [ICE CREAM PLOPS SLOWLY] 
  You're dripping. 
  She gets out at night, that kid. 
  Gets out gets into sh1t. 
  Other people's sh1t. 
  ANNIE: Get out. 
  You've heard of "landlord may enter"? 
  That's state law. 
  I'm the landlord. 
  I may enter. 
  Landlord's gotta do his own background checks. 
  You're not the first lammer showed up here paying cash, driving around with fictitious plates. 
  I'll call the police. 
  See, Anne Ingalls from Pepin, Wisconsin just might do that. 
  But Annie Wilkes from Bakersfield, California sure as sh1t would not. 
  I'm happy to provide free internet access to all our guests as long as I get to ride along. 
  So here's the deal, Annie Wilkes Your daughter saw some sh1t she shouldn't have, so you're gonna shut her up, so I don't have - [YELPS]
