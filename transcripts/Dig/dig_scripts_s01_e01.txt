 Yussef Khalid, the Palestinian American who fled the U.S. after the alleged murder of an antiques dealer in Chicago, is now believed to have entered Israel, just as a new wave of unrest is flaring in Jerusalem over the current peace talks. 
 At the heart of the unrest is rival Israeli-Palestinian claims to the Temple Mount, Jerusalem's central holy site that has been the world's most hotly contested piece of real estate for the last 2,000 years.

 Ah. 
 Gotta go arrest a bad guy. See you later. 
 Is he there? 
 It's confirmed. 
 [honks car horn rhythmically] 
 Are you sure this is legal? 
 I mean, don't we need a warrant or something? 
 That's the beautiful thing about extraordinary rendition. 
 The man he killed back in Chicago was just lucky enough to be the son of an important senator. 
 That's all the legality we need. 
 So what, we just gonna Eichmann his ass out of the country? 
 Hold that thought. 
 Hey! Hey, what the hell you doing here? 
 Police business, my job. 
 You tried to go around my back. 
 Now I'm gonna go around yours. 
 No, no, no. 
 You guys are meant to be giving us a pass on this. 
 Hold on a second. Ah! 
 You want to lose your hand, do that again. 
 You can stay out here and direct traffic.

 He's still convinced he's hearing other children at night. 
 He's lonely. 
 And maybe if he had someone else to talk to... 
 Isn't that what you're here for? 
 [door opens and closes] 
 Hello, Josh. 
 I need to tell you something very important, and I want you to listen to every word carefully, you understand? 
 I know you have been told all these years that your parents are coming for you someday, but the truth is, they're not. 
 They're dead, Josh. They're not coming for you. 
 You're not gonna cry now. You hear me? 
 Right now, you have to focus. 
 You've been studying all these years for a very important reason. 
 That time is upon us, you understand? 
 That time is now. 
 Jesus, Peter, chasing him through a goddamn market, pulling a weapon? 
 But it's over my head now. It's with the State Department. 
 This detective has a personal grudge against me. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, a personal grudge? 
 Yeah. 
 Y-you understand the problem with that statement? 
 The operative word being "personal"? 
 This is their jurisdiction, Peter, not ours. 
 I can't have you fighting with the locals. 
 You sanctioned this operation, remember? 
 Ambassador. 
 [sighs] Ambassador. 
 I'm seated next to the prime minister tonight at a banquet, so imagine how thrilled I am to discover that you've now added a jurisdictional battle to the list of sh1t I have on my plate. 
 We are talking to our contact at the INP about handing over Yussef Khalid. 
 Please tell me he wasn't doing anything more than hiding out here. 
 Well, they want to question him about a robbery. 
 A robbery in Israel? 
 Details are a little sketchy. 
 I made a personal promise to Senator Sinclair that I would have Khalid on the next plane back to Chicago, do you understand? 
 Good. 
 Nice work. 
 What robbery? 
 He never mentioned anything about a robbery. 
 I would have stood down. 
 Look, let me go talk to the INP. 
 No, forget the INP. I can handle them. 
 You should go home and take a shower.

 Uh, I had better. 
 What about worse? 
 Had my fair share of them as well.

 No one can complain about their day once they had our famous Kibbe soup. 
 Yeah?

 You're the one I saw earlier with a gun, chasing that guy. 
 Yeah, well, sort of. 
 Did you get him? 
 Sort of. 
 Good.

 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Where you headed? 
 Mm, just walking. 
 You want to join me, or... 
 Sure. 
 Did you know? 
 Yes. 
 Josh, we all love you. 
 We'd do anything for you. 
 We'd die for you if we had to. 
 You are that important. 
 Why does it have to be me? 
 It's what you're being raised for. 
 It's your destiny. 
 Oh. 
 I heard him again. 
 That same dream you had before? 
 It wasn't a dream. I heard him talking. 
 Okay. Josh... 
 I can assure you, there are no other children here. 
 Can you take me to that spot again? 
 I was never supposed to take you there in the first place, okay? It's dangerous. 
 Please? 
 We could both get in a lot of trouble, okay? 
 They all in a prayer meeting anyway, so it's safe.

 This has got to be the most magical patch of real estate on the planet, right? 
 [bell ringing] 
 Every corner of it, every little stone means something, you know? 
 Where I'm from, back in Illinois, we don't have any place that means that much to anyone. 
 That thing's sacred, you know? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 You're married. 
 Yeah. Well, no... I mean, yes, I'm married, but we're not... Not anymore. 
 I'm sorry, it's too personal. 
 It's fine. 
 We haven't even met properly yet. 
 I'm Emma Wilson. 
 Hey, Emma Wilson. 
 I'm here on a fellowship with the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Archeology. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm working on a dig, right here in this neighborhood, actually. 
 Here? 
 In the tunnels beneath us. 
 Really? 
 See, I read this book when I was a kid by an archaeologist from Cambridge named Ian Margrove. 
 It was all about the Temple treasures buried under Jerusalem. 
 I just dreamed about coming here ever since. 
 Then not only did I get my wish, but guess who's leading the dig? 
 Ian Margrove, by any chance? 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah. 
 Your enthusiasm is... endearing. 
 Hmm. Is that another word for naive? 
 Maybe. 
 Close your eyes. 
 What? 
 Humor me. Go on, close your eyes. 
 [sighs] Okay. 
 If you concentrate, you can feel it all around you, vibrating. 
 [laughs] 
 Sorry, I'm-I'm-I... I'm not big on vibrations. 
 To me, it's... it's... you know, it's just a place I work. 
 Maybe that's why we met tonight. 
 Come on. I'll show you what I mean. 
 This is where you live? 
 For, like, 12 hours a day, yeah. 
 [flips heavy switch] 
 Huh. No security? 
 It's a back entrance. Not many people know about it. 
 Hargrove would totally fire me if he knew we were sneaking in like this. 
 Maybe we shouldn't be sneaking in. 
 Maybe we should just make sure we don't get caught. 
 Welcome to my office. 
 Seriously, the Ark? As in the Ark of the Covenant? 
 Yup, and if it's here, it'd be the most important find in human history. 
 Wow. As in Indiana Jones. 
 I knew you'd make fun of me. 
 No, no, I just... I thought that stuff was a myth. 
 Maybe, but it hasn't stopped people from looking for the last 2,000 years, and a lot have died trying. 
 Seems a little futile to me. 
 I don't know, bury something in the ground that means that much to that many people, someone's gonna want to find it. 
 Well, if they've been searching that long, how come no one has found it? 
 Because they've all been looking in the wrong place. 
 It's all about the water. 
 Follow the ancient water to its source, and you'll find the treasures. 
 Cool, huh? 
 What is this place? 
 It's called Mikveh. 
 Place where people would purify themselves, wash away their sins, heal, before going up to the Temple Mount. 
 This is pretty much as holy as water gets, if you believe in that sort of thing. 
 Are you coming in, or not? 
 Um... 
 Guess not. 
 Why did you follow me tonight? 
 You... you remind me of someone. 
 Someone you loved? 
 Someone I lost. 
 [distant voices] 
 Someone's here. 
 It's almost 4:00 in the morning, no one's supposed to be down here, and they're in the wrong place. 
 What do you mean? 
 This is tunnel seven. 
 No one's allowed to dig here anymore. 
 We got too close to the Temple Mount. 
 Are you sure this is the right tunnel? 
 Those initials there, those are mine. 
 I carved them there.

 I can stay here all night. No wife to go home to. 
 But you do... and a four-year-old son. 
 Family man. 
 No criminal record, no arrests. 
 You're an impressive guy... 
 On paper. 
 Associate professor in structural engineering. 
 A deacon in your church. 
 So I'm asking myself, "Why would someone like you kill an antique dealer, then escape your own country?" 
 Maybe it has something to do with this. 
 It disappeared a month ago from the vault in the basement of the Rockefeller Museum here in Jerusalem. 
 A lot of people have been looking for it. 
 What are you up to? 
 We are small men. 
 In the end, we mean nothing. 
 [panting] 
 What are you doing? 
 Calling the police. 
 No, no, no, don't. 
 You said no one was supposed to be down there. 
 I don't want to lose my job, please. 
 Where we're digging, it's so holy to so many people. 
 I'm sure it was just that... 
 People spending some time in a place that means so much to them, you know? 
 Maybe this is something that happens all the time. 
 Are you sure? 
 Okay. 
 [laughs] 
 I should walk you home. 
 No, I'm fine. 
 But thank you. 
 Wait, will I see you again? 
 If I don't see you first. 
 What did you say? 
 Hmm? 
 Nothing. 
 Oh. [chuckles] 
 I don't even know your name. 
 Peter... Connelly. Peter Connelly. 
 Vicki's voice : Hi, daddy. It looks like I'm coming home this weekend. Some friends from the dorm are gonna go to this concert on Saturday night. I'll text you the details. Tell mom, okay? 
 So, I guess you'll be seeing me in a couple of days. 
 [chuckles] If I don't see you first. 
 I love you.

 Hey! 
 [cow moos] 
 Fish for dinner. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Be careful. 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 Nice of you to join us. 
 What's going on? 
 They found a body. 
 American? 
 Golan : The body was found in the Kidron Valley this morning by two Arab teenagers walking their sheep. 
 Don't even think about smoking. 
 Our offices are canvassing the neighborhood, asking neighbors if they saw anything, but don't expect much cooperation from the locals. 
 [clicks tongue] You know how it is. 
 [sighs] Notify the family. 
 Organize the transfer of the body and coordinate it with Tel Aviv. 
 Sure, I'll get onto it. 
 Do we have any suspects yet? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 The security camera caught her with this man a few hours before her death. They seem friendly. 
 The image is for sh1t, so don't high-five ourselves yet. 
 I don't know, I have no... I don't even know what I'm looking at there. Guess I can't stop you, huh? 
 Do you have an ashtray? 
 Give me the file. 
 Lynn : Peter? 
 Peter! 
 Huh? 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me. 
 [beeping] 
 [buzzer] 
 [grunts] 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I gotta talk to you about that photo. 
 I know. 
 I saw it, too. 
 Bright red hair, and... 
 Sweet, young face. 
 I'm not stupid, I know that's why you ran out of here. 
 I'm really sorry, Peter, I know how hard this is for you. 
 No, Lynn... 
 I think it's best if the locals take care of the case. 
 What? 
 I've already talked to Detective Cohen and asked him to leave you out of it. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, why? 
 Report his findings directly to me. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 Well, for one, you two can't stand each other, but two... I'm just not sure you're in any condition to be able to handle it. 
 I can do my job, Lynn. 
 You don't have to worry about me. 
 I do worry about you. 
 Grief is complicated. 
 It can come out in ways you don't intend. 
 I'm trying to be helpful... 
 Just because we sleep together every now and again, you... you have some great insight into my mental state? 
 Do you feel better? 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 You've already screwed up one case this week. 
 I'm not gonna let you jeopardize another. 
 That's it. 
 Okay. 
 Detective Cohen, where you going? 
 Going to the victim's department, why? 
 I'm coming with you. 
 Your boss said that... 
 She changed her mind, and you're stuck with me. 
 But I don't like you, and you don't like me. 
 Is that gonna be a problem... Partner? 
 Golan : Did she have any boyfriends? Roommates? 
 Landlord : She paid me the rent in cash every month. 
 That's all I know. 
 Excuse me, sir? 
 Yes? 
 No frequent visitors at all? 
 You never saw anyone more than once? 
 They don't pay me to spy on them. 
 All right. 
 Golan : Ian Margrove. 
 I know that name. 
 Ah, from her work permit. 
 He was her sponsor. 
 No. 
 [mumbling] 
 [Golan mumbling] 
 [Golan mumbling] 
 Golan : Hmm, says here Margrove is overseeing a dig near the southern wall. 
 Let's pay him a visit. 
 Wait here. 
 It's very sad, but what has this got to do with me? 
 You sponsored her work permit. 
 Along with four dozen other interns who come here every summer. 
 I'll try and get her application form. 
 [buzzes] 
 Refresh my memory. 
 She seemed excited to be working with you. 
 Oh? 
 There's a copy of your book at her apartment. 
 You signed it for her, personally. 
 Did I? 
 As tragic as this young woman's death is, I have bigger problems to deal with. 
 I'm finally on the brink of making a discovery which might change the course of history, and a handful of cowardly politicians might stop me from getting there. 
 Excuse me if I don't remember autographing an intern's book. 
 You called? 
 Get me a copy of her application form and a list of the people that she worked with. 
 Thank you. 
 This is a map of this place? 
 More of a blueprint, really. 
 So that would be us there? 
 We're here. 
 Mm-hmm. So what's that? 
 What are you digging there? 
 Tunnel seven? No, we're not. 
 It's too close to the Dome of the Rock, the Temple Mount. 
 The Wakf... The Muslim authority won't allow us to dig there. 
 Like I told you, politicians only care about their jobs, not about history. 
 If that's all you need from me, gentlemen, thank you very much. 
 [phone ringing] 
 So, what are you not telling me? 
 What do you mean? 
 What do you mean, what do I mean? 
 All those questions you asked him. 
 I just wanted to make him feel uncomfortable. 
 I don't buy that he didn't know her. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 I don't like him. Let's arrest him. 
 sh1t. 
 My sunglasses, I left them on his desk. 
 You go ahead. 
 No, I'll wait. 
 No, no, you go smoke yourself stupid and honk your little horn. 
 I'd rather walk back. Catch you tomorrow. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 We're expecting the last shipment in tomorrow. 
 After 20 years of planning, it is indeed all gonna work. 
 You think I dyed my hair too dark in that photo? 
 No, sir. 
 I think you look very handsome. 
 [phone ringing] 
 Rabbi Lev, how good to hear from you. 
 The cow will be picked up tomorrow. 
 Right on time. No signs of breach, no leaks? 
 The farm is 60 miles from the arctic circle. 
 I think we're safe. 
 Billingham : [laughs] Not many Essenes up there, I suppose. 
 We can't be too careful, so we have a young man watching her, but tomorrow, he will be relieved of his duties. 
 We will erase any trail of him, just to be safe. 
 And our Bar Mitzvah boy? 
 Ready and on board. 
 Pastor Billingham. 
 Rabbi, I'm gonna need to call you back. 
 What happened? 
 We have reason to believe she might have let him out to smell the... 
 Outside? 
 [door opens] 
 Pastor Billingham, I... 
 [sobs] 
 [grunts] 
 [sighs] 
 Well, he can't have gotten far. 
 He's just a kid. He's never been out there. 
 He wouldn't know what to do. 
 I want everyone to fan out, take the cars, and find him. 
 Everyone. 
 Except you. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks. 
 Your lady friend is waiting for you. 
 Right. 
 Could I get an envelope, please? 
 Yes. 
 Thanks. 
 Here you go. 
 You keep that safe for me. 
 Yes, no problem. 
 You lied to me. 
 You told Detective Cohen I assigned you to the Emma Wilson case. 
 So, technically, I lied to him. 
 You want to come up? 
 As your boss or your occasional s*x buddy, we don't have to be close. I get it, those things are easy. 
 They don't require anything, but the fact is, I am your friend, and that requires a little bit more. 
 Especially since I'm the only one you've got. 
 I know. 
 Solving this case is not gonna bring your daughter back. 
 Don't you think I know that? 
 You called me. 
 You asked me to bring you over here. 
 You said you wanted to get away from anything that reminded you of her. 
 I'm trying to help you out. 
 Then let me do my job, Lynn. 
 It's the only thing... that makes sense... to me. 
 It's the only thing that keeps me sane. 
 Please? 
 The Israelis have approved the expedition of Yussef Khalid. 
 They're releasing him at 10:00 p.m. tonight. 
 I want you to escort him to the airport and make sure the hand-off goes smoothly. 
 Be discreet. No convoy. 
 And as for the girl's case, I will... think about it. 
 [speaking Hebrew] 
 Mmm, so, how long did you think you were gonna get away with it? 
 Taking a case that wasn't yours? 
 Your boss called me. 
 Figured I'd ride the wave till it broke. 
 Finally found one thing about you I like. 
 [engine starting] 
 Anat : Golan! 
 Peter : What's going on down there? 
 driver : Someone broke down. 
 All right, let's go around. 
 [laughs] Ah. 
 [speaking Hebrew] 
 [both laughing] 
 Oh. 
 Ah. 
 [laughs] 
 Where are you? 
 Peter : Just on our way out of Jerusalem. 
 Had to take a small detour. What's going on? 
 The breastplate. It's supposed to be worn by some high priest. He uses it as some kind of a device to communicate. 
 With? 
 With God. 
 Peter's voice : What? 
 I know how it sounds. Listen, you should bring him back so I can question him about... 
 No, I'm not bringing him back for questioning. It's too late. 
 Behold, he who watches over Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
 The Lord will protect you. The Lord is your shelter at your right hand. 
 The sun shall not burn you by day, nor the moon by night. 
 Peter : Stop!

 Josh, where have you been? 
 Everyone's looking for you. 
 Looking for me? Who? 
 Everyone. 
 How did you get in here? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Joshua. I live here. 
 It's very nice to meet you. 
 [cars approaching] 
 Mr. Billingham is very upset. 
 I'm sorry. I'll come back. 
 I'll be good from now on, I swear. 
 It's too late for that, Josh.

 They knew the route, the timing, everything. 
 I think the driver's dead. Send some people to pick him up. 
 He's at the... 
 I'll call you back.

 Hands up. Hands up. 
 Empty your pockets. 
 Now the other pocket. 
 Good. 
 Now turn around. 
 You don't have to do this.

 Hey.

 I'm sorry about the other night. 
 You sounded drunk and I reacted badly, so I just thought I'd call and... 
 No, it's fine. 
 woman : No, it's not. Nothing's fine. 
 Whenever you call, whenever I hear your voice... 
 I know. 
 I know, I-I'm sorry. 
 woman : I don't think I can do this anymore. 
 What are we gonna do, Peter? 
 [police siren blaring] 
 [groans] I gotta go. 
 I'll call you back. 
 [knocking at the door] 
 It's open.
