 announcer : Previously on  Dig... 
 Emma Wilson's journal. I took it from her apartment. 
 "It's all about 19." 
 Chapter 19... "Tell the Israelites to bring a red heifer." 
 Heifer? 
 Peter : It's a cow. 
 These guys are dangerous. 
 Billingham : But his sojourn into the desert made him impure. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Billingham : So we had to move to an alternate plan. 
 Are you still with us? 
 I need to get out of here. 
 Charlie : Please don't call here anymore. 
 Charlie! 
 Thank you for calling me, Deputy Barry. 
 Billingham : Joshua, you ready to go home? 
 I told you she would fail. 
 Yussef : Only one more stone left to find. 
 The most difficult one. Now get the hell out of here. 
 You said that Holly was in the building. 
 Evacuating. 
 Madame Ambassador? 
 Yussef Khalid did not enter this building. 
 You said you wanted to get away from anything that reminded you of her. 
 Solving this case is not gonna bring your daughter back.

 I copied those articles and this is everything I have on Rabbi Lev, the Jerusalem Heritage Center. 
 All right.

 This better be important. 
 This whole thing's a lot bigger than the murder of one girl. 
 Bigger how? 
 Look. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Give me the short version. 
 All right, says here, in 1991, Rabbi Lev and a bunch of his radical followers were caught trying to blow up the Temple Mount. 
 Shin Bet uncovered the plot. 
 They arrested the six co-conspirators unloading explosives. But Rabbi Lev? 
 Taken in and questioned, never charged. 
 Well, those guys always keep their hands clean. 
 You talked to someone about the breastplate... who was it? 
 My uncle, Shimon. Why? 
 We need to speak to him. 
 No, no, no. It's 5:00 in the morning. 
 These guys are planning on rebuilding the Temple. 
 That's insane. 
 Anything happens to the Temple Mount, the Arab world will erupt. 
 They'd be starting World War III. 
 Exactly.

 Stepped out of the Talmud, did you, huh? 
 I am but humbled servant tasked with transporting you and your precious... unnamed cargo.

 Lynn. 
 Ambassador. 
 Let's sit over there. It's much more comfortable. 
 Ambassador, I know that there have been some problems in my office the last few weeks. 
 I assure you that I am going to take care of them. 
 Your problems have a name. 
 You have a blind spot. 
 I get it... he was your boss back in the States. 
 Peter... 
 Agent Connelly taught me everything I know about law enforcement. 
 His behavior here has been erratic. 
 You have a deputy legal attache pulling his gun in public, which makes Israeli officials unhappy, which makes Washington unhappy, which makes me unhappy. 
 I understand. 
 It's obvious to me that he's not working out. 
 I'm wondering why it's not obvious to you. 
 Are you asking me to fire him? 
 Women have to prove that they're tough enough for this job, Lynn. 
 They also have to be above reproach, personally. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning... you're not screwing him, are you? 
 Do yourself a favor. Do us all a favor. 
 Get him under control. 
 Or what? 
 Thank you for stopping in. 
 Ridell on phone : I just spoke to his immediate superior. 
 If she doesn't take care of the problem, I'll do it myself. 
 Now, where are you with the stone? 
 In process. 
 Time frame? 
 We'll have it by the end of the day.

 What? 
 Please. 
 Thank you. 
 It's not going to happen. 
 The Jews have been talking about rebuilding the Temple since the Romans destroyed it. 
 Well, we believe the Jerusalem Heritage Center is collecting the stones for the breastplate. 
 So what? Even if they find all the stones, for this prophecy to come true, they'd need... 
 A red heifer without blemish, a high priest born of the lineage of the First High Priest, raised in isolation from birth without his feet touching the ground till his 13th year, yes. 
 I see you have done your homework. 
 Look, I know Lev. 
 He's crazy, but he's not insane. 
 And even if he was, no sane Israeli wants war over the Temple Mount. 
 And that's why the Israelis are safeguarding the Dome of the Rock from these extremist minorities. 
 I'm sure you are, but I'm also sure that Rabbi Lev is collecting the stones, so where might he be looking? 
 Please. It's homemade... homemade. 
 The stones? 
 Mm. 
 The stones were scattered to all four corners of the earth, hidden away for safekeeping. 
 Some say there is a passage in the War Tablet that describes the location of one of them. 
 War Tablet? 
 Doesn't ring a bell? 
 No, it doesn't ring a bell. 
 Written by the Essenes, an ancient religious sect who lived in the desert near the Dead Sea. 
 They called themselves the "Sons of Light." 
 Protecting the breastplate meant keeping the stones from ever being found. 
 They would die for this. 
 So where would we find this War Tablet?

 You were in seminary. Why did you drop out?

 Hey. 
 When can you be at the office? 
 Peter on phone : Not for a little while. I gotta go to the Israel Museum. 
 The museum, why? 
 Is that your girlfriend? 
 What? 
 Peter : Uh, to look at the War scroll. 
 It might tell us the whereabouts of the stones from the high priest breastplate. 
 The stones? Peter... what does any of this have to do with Emma Wilson's murder? 
 I'll fill you in later. 
 Listen to me... the Ambassador has taken a personal interest in you and I can guarantee you it's not because she thinks you're cute. 
 That's funny. 
 Could have sworn I detected a little vibe going on. 
 Just a twinkle. 
 I need to show that you are under control. 
 You've got to dial it down, do you hear me? 
 Got you loud and clear. Dial it down.

 Excuse me, have you seen this woman around lately? 
 Sorry, never seen her. 
 I'm not sure if she looks exactly like this anymore. 
 It's been three years.

 Hell, yeah. She beat a woman senseless in our bathroom yesterday. 
 What? Who?
