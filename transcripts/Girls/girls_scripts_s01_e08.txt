 At best party ever. 
 All of Brooklyn and two-thirds of Manhattan will be here. 
 Oh! 
 Marnie, this is... this is Audrey. 
 This happened in two weeks? 
 That is Adam and I am not gonna talk to him. 
 You seem great. 
 Thank you. 
 I just smoked crack. What's gonna happen? 
 You're gonna be fine.

 Tako:  Is that how you know Adam? 
 Hannah:  How? 
 Through A.A. 
 He's in A.A.? 
 Jeff:  I can't believe I texted you to hang out. 
 Oh, my God. I'm that guy. 
 I don't think you're cool. 
 Let's let cooler heads prevail... Oh, my God! 
 I can't do this kind of thing anymore. 
 You're a tease. 
 Please stop the bike, Adam! 
 ( Brakes squeak ) 
 Look, kid, I don't know what you want from me. 
 Do you want me to be your boyfriend? 
 ( Music playing ) 
 ( Hannah laughs ) 
 Oh, my God. That is the cutest thing I've ever seen in my whole life. I was an amazing child. Could you fly? Could I what? Could you fly? Could  you  fly? No, I couldn't fly, but then again, I didn't have ears that big. Now you're gonna get it. ( Laughing ) I was joking. I was joking. Too bad, 'cause this is gonna hurt you more than it does me. You were a beautiful baby. ♪ Oh, run, run, run ♪ 
♪ Yeah, it's a long way down... ♪ ( Bag rustling ) ♪ But I am closer to the clouds... ♪ ( Crunching ) ♪ up here ♪ 
♪ You can take everything I have ♪ Hannah:  Oh, my God. Adam:  Would you have f*cked a four-year-old me? Hannah:  I was only two. Adam:  How fat were you? Be honest. ( Bedsprings squeaking ) ( Hannah moaning ) Oh, my God. Adam:  That's what I thought. You were probably a really late walker... Oh, my God. ...And you were probably toilet trained really late. Hannah:  Oh, God. Oh, my God. ( Slams ) ♪ Like a skyscraper... ♪ Hannah:  Oh. Adam:  Go, go, go, go, go. Hannah:  Oh, I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come. One more time. ( Moaning ) Adam:  That was fast. Hannah:  Thank you. Adam:  Thank  you. ♪ Like a skyscraper. ♪ Girls - 1x08 - "Weirdos Need Girlfriends Too" Original air date: 03.06.2012. You'll feel it soon. I won't. ( Panting ) I told you, okay, endorphins don't work on me, And anyone who's ever promised me a runner's high is full of bullshit. Okay... no, no, no, no. This is embarrassing. No, no, no, no, no. You go on without me. You just gotta reach your threshold and run past it. Come on, high-five me. Your hands are, like, 10 feet from me. So catch the f*ck up! High-five me! Come on! I don't like this, Adam. Yes, yes. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. f*ck, yes. I f*cking love it. Hannah, you're doing awesome. I hate this! Whoo! That's great. This'll change your life, I swear it. Whoo! Into what? Whoa, pace yourself, kid. Pace yourself. Wow, no. Wow! What the f*ck?! Get up. You're, like, three blocks from your house! You could hop home. No, get up! Come on! Charlie's in the bushes! Charlie's in the bushes! Come on! ( Laughing ) Oh, my God. Fucker. What? Look. The ice-cream truck is parked directly in front of my house. It's like life is a dream. Oh, sh1t. What? I don't do ice cream. It's like sweet mucus. Are you serious? Yeah. ( Laughing ) Yes. I mean, you can have some, though. Do you have any cash? Look at me... I'm not even wearing any underwear. Where would I put cash? I'm not wearing any underwear either. Hey. Man:  Hey. She'll show you her tits if you give her some ice cream. I'm not gonna do that. Yes, you will. I'm not gonna do that. Just kidding. I have $5. Mm-mm. If you don't like ice cream, what do you like? I like you. I'm done with these. ( Shorts thud softly ) ( Emphatically ) Hello. Hannah: Marn, you okay? Of course I am. What, I can't just, like, catch up on some stuff from the comfort of my own bed on a weekend morning? Okay, well, is it Charlie stuff? He and Audrey went to Rome. They went to f*cking Rome. She had a work trip to Milan and then they took a couple of days in Rome. And he was making all those wishes at those, like, overrated fountains And they took a bajillion pictures of it. This is your ex-boyfriend? Yes. And you still wanna tap that? Well, we were seriously involved for four years and I am now dealing with the deeply painful fact that I'm probably not gonna end up with him. Okay, you never wanted to  end up  with him. Hannah, don't minimize. That sh1t's really hard. Sorry. Adam:  I'm sorry to hear you're going through that. Thank you. When I broke up with my girlfriend from college... so sad. I lost 30 pounds. I couldn't move or talk  or get my dick hard, but it also made me go, "Hey, who am I and what do I want?" Then I was like, boom, I know who I am. I wanted to switch majors and buy a circular saw, and I promised myself that I'd follow my gut no matter what. And I'd do what makes me  feel  good. What makes you feel good? I like... reading. ( Chortles ) ( Cell phone ringing ) Hannah: Oh, here. Okay, we gotta jet out. We gotta go to tech. Okay. Yo, skank. Where you at? Gettin' that pussy pounded? It's my sister. Oh. No one's ever taken me to their tech rehearsal before. ( Laughs ) You just say "tech." Sorry that I don't know all the terms. I'm just a little bit nervous to see it, you know? Like, are you nervous to have me see it? No. I'm really excited for you to see it Because I'm really good at acting and writing. Plus, the play  could  be really good. Ew. Gay. What? ( Knocks at door ) Hello? Who is it? It's Jessa. Let me in. My thighs are on fire. ( Knocking at door ) Hi. Oh, my God. Ugh! My thighs are really rubbing together like nobody's business. It's like they're red and raw and burning hot. Feels like I had an epic fuckfest with a ghost. I just wish I had a wheelchair for June and July. Hannah isn't here. She left with Adam. But we had a plan. She knew that I lost my job and she was gonna console me today. Yeah, well, get used to it. I mean, she hasn't really been very good about keeping many plans these days, or really any days. Actually, she's always been flaky about keeping plans. And then, like, apologizing for it like you're gonna shoot her. Have you ever noticed when she gets dressed up, She'll, like, put on a good dress and nice shoes and then, like, do her lipstick and then will, like, leave her forehead shiny? Yes. Yeah. Right? It's like you've come this far. Both: Wash your forehead. I know. It would be very easy. Maybe now that she has this boyfriend, she'll start taking better care of herself. What's the deal with that guy? Is he, like, a great thinker or just a total f*cking idiot? I don't know... he's not, like, un-nice or anything. He's just f*cking weird. Like, I walked into the bathroom the other day... I kid you not, he was sitting there, taking a sh1t and drinking milk at the same time, and just stared at me. That kind of a person would just totally m*st*rb*t* in front of anyone any day. Ew. I'm sure you're right. I don't know... I just feel bad for her. She's never had a normal boyfriend that's not gay, you know? I don't know... maybe she just doesn't realize how bizarre he is. You look really gorgeous. I love you all stripped down. I've never been this miserable in my life. It's totally working. No, okay. It's my first day of the sixth grade. Mm, I don't know where to sit. I just moved to town last week and I've spent every day since either reading in my hammock or jerking off, which I just learned to do. And I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who knows how to perform this awesome trick. You just pull your wiener till it's hard and suddenly, it's a cock. And I know everyone in bio class is looking at me because who else is 6'3" when they're 12 years old? I smell like sweat. I smell like a gerbil as I sit down and try hard to make eye contact with Shelby Carruthers. Hey! I like your pen. Did you get it at the mall? It's not a regular pen, right? She got up and moved five chairs down and didn't talk to me again for five years until junior year when I f*cked her on the strip of lawn between the liquor store and the dog salon. And the whole time, I was seeing that pen... Its pink, fuzzy end moving through the air. "That'll teach you. That'll teach you. That'll teach you." I haven't figured the rest of that bit out, Gavin, So we can skip to the canoe part. I haven't been on this river in a long time. ( Beatboxes ) ♪ Yo, yo, yo, I love boy scout camp ♪ 
♪ Who says we be gettin' too old for this sh1t? ♪ ( Beatboxing ) ♪ I love s'mo-o-ores... ♪ What the f*ck are you doing? What? That's not what we talked about. Well, I changed it a little. It's an easy joke... the wigger joke. Everyone laughs at the white guy doing the black voice. I'm just trying to bring some comedy to it, man. All the stuff you've been doing is like rejection and date rape. Real sh1t. Gavin, there was a lot of complex stuff being expressed in what you wrote, a lot of pathos. Give people a chance to process that. Don't be afraid that if they're not laughing, they're not feeling. Look, you owe it to yourself to try stripping that thing down a little. Maybe just one "Yo." And throw some of the lines away a little and lose that hat. You're a hero, man. You keep me honest. Seriously, thank you. No problem. We'll work on it tomorrow. No, I don't think so. What? I just don't think this is my thing. Are you for real? We open in two weeks. Yeah, I'm for real. Good luck with it, man. You're... you're serious? Yeah, I'm f*cking serious. You can't do this to me, Adam. I invested 2,000 bucks. I can't get that back. You didn't invest anything. Yeah, I did... my time. And I can't get my time back, so I guess we're even. It's just, like, f*cking people. sh1t, I met him. He tells me he's down to do one kind of thing And it's another kind of f*cking thing. If I knew he was gonna bust out that "Yo, yo, yo" sh1t, I would've stayed home. I really liked your monologue. Like, maybe you could use it for something else. Anyway, it's for the best. I need to focus on building my boat. You know, people don't always get it right on the first try. Like, you have to teach them how to please you or you have to compromise. Not in your art. That shouldn't be a compromise. 
 
 ( Tires screech ) ( Horn honks ) Would you f*cking watch it?! I'm walking with a f*cking woman! Can you see that? Huh? You wanna hit a f*cking woman with your f*cking car, You f*cking cunt-satchel? f*ck you! Oh, my God. Adam! She's got nothing on you. Mm. Really, and it makes me question his taste because you are a striking and classic beauty in the vein of Brooke Shields. Jessa, you don't have to do this. Do what? This. Like, pretending we're friends. I really can't handle being mocked right now. Are you serious, Marnie? We've known each other for six years; You've known my name for three. I care for you. I do. I really do. And if you don't see that, then that's a failing on my part because I really admire your work ethic, your commitment to hygiene. I think you are smart and kind and... Uptight. A bit, yes. That isn't fun for me. Do you realize that? Being the uptight girl? I hate it. Charlie had to find someone else to go to Rome with. No one ever asks me to get, like, friendship tattoos or whatever. Sometimes being inside my own head is so exhausting that it makes me wanna cry. So then get out of there for a little while. Fucker! Let's not go outside again today, okay? Mm-hmm, yeah. It seems better when we don't go outside. So... What do you wanna do now? Um, take a shower. ( Screams ) Sorry, you really scared me, Adam. No, thank you. I'm good, thanks. It's for your split ends. Thank you. ( Snickering ) ( Urinating ) What? Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you're peeing on me! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, stop it! ( Adam laughing ) You're still doing it! Stop it! Chill, kid. It's just pee. It's gross. It's not funny, so stop laughing. It's gross! Urine is sterile. A lot of people urinate on wounds to heal them. Really? A lot of people do that? It doesn't make sense to get out now. There's pee on you. ( Screams ) Jessa:  So you were how old? I was 14. Oh, my God. To who, your cousin? Mm-mm. To my boyfriend Jared. We had been dating for a year. And you were 14? Yeah. I don't know, I just felt ready. Planned the whole thing, obviously. We were at his lake house. There were candles everywhere. I put a towel down on the bed. And I guess once I had done it, I just felt like I didn't need to try it again for, like, a very long time. Why? How old were you? I was 17. You were 17? You were older than me? Yeah. I didn't grow breasts for a very long time, and s*x without breasts is creepy. That's what I keep trying to tell Hannah. ( Laughs ) That's true. Her breasts are teensy. They're teensy. Yeah. But I love them. Did you order those? I didn't, no. Bartender:  They're from him. Gray suit. Oh, fabulous. Hi. Oh, never mind. Oh, come on, he's so cute. This is exciting, being hit on. Jessa:  Ugh. Marnie:  He looks like he's a boss. Adam:  You look good in the suit. You mean like a giant baby? No. Pretty. It's comfy, right? There's like this weird slit down the whole crotch. Yeah, so you can pee out of it. I really f*cking thought you'd laugh. Well, I didn't. Well, I'm sorry you don't get what's so hysterical about me peeing on you. Okay, you are not a good apologizer. Just F.Y.I. All right, I won't bug you if you're trying to read. Have you thought any more about the play? What is there to think about? Just that you were so excited about it this morning. And then we got there... It sucked, yeah. sh1t happens like that sometimes. So then maybe you need to spend another week workshopping it. I can't explain basic truths to him. It's too draining. Okay, but I get why you won't let him do it with a different actor. Because my name's on it. But that's good. That's a writing credit. I would rather do nothing for the rest of my life than have my name attached to something mediocre. Your integrity's all that matters. It's a stupid play. Not a stupid play. It's really good. When I was watching it, I was so excited because it was so, so good. What about all that fake sh1t Gavin was doing? I don't know. I wasn't watching Gavin. I was watching you. Do you know how unusual it is  to see someone doing something like that? Like, what you were doing, okay, that's so open and honest  and weird and you're not making fun of them in your mind... It made me want to go and meet you when you were 15 and kiss you. I think I'll let Gavin do the play. Really? Yeah. I'll change my name. I'll use a pseudonym. What's your pseudonym? f*ckin' Ben Franklin. I'll change my name, but he has to take out some of my favorite lines. That's a good compromise, right? Yeah, I just feel like I travel so much now, I'm, like... I'm lag-proof. You know, I'm like... Wow. Like, I'm resistant to jet lag. That's inspiring. I took the most amazing Middle Eastern studies class... Love the Middle East, yeah. ...When I was in college,  and I almost became an international relations major. Oh. Almost. ( Laughs ) This has been great, hasn't it? Mm. What an unexpected pleasure, just sharing a beverage with Jenna  ... and Marnie. Marnie:  Yes. Great names. Thank you. Well, thanks for handling the check. Mm, you got it. Hey, I have a suggestion. I live, like, a block away and I just moved into Brooklyn last week. I don't know anybody and I have been saving the most beautiful bottle of red wine for a rainy day. Or a rainy night. Or rainy night. The weather's fine. Um, well, we should welcome you  to our borough, first of all. Thank you. And I don't know about you, but I would love to do something "uncool." I'd rather do a cool thing. She's a firecracker, this one. Marnie:  I know. But, yeah, we'd love to go. Great. Done. I'm just gonna run to the little boys' room, and then we'll mosey? We'll mosey. Okay. He's cute. Is he, though? His face is sort of very cereal-boxy. It's a perfect square. No, I think he's hot. And what he does is so interesting. What is a venture capitalist? It sounds like some sort of explorer, but that can't be the case. I like him. And I like this drink. And I like you, Jessa. ( Music playing ) ♪ Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare ♪ 
♪ in a staring under heat... ♪ ( Children laughing ) Man:  I've just been doing it, like, three or four months. Started with an episode of "Entourage." Isn't it cool? I call this one "Field nice," Like field mice, but, you know, happy. Thomas-John didn't want you to get self-conscious while you were taking a piss, so he started spinning. I know how self-conscious you gals get when you're taking a tinkle. Took care of it. He's working on a mash-ups album. Mash-up! He's mixed "Steal My Sunshine" by Len... Right. ...And field recordings of children playing. They're children playing in a field. Sounds, uh, awesome. I mean, it's a hobby. I'm not claiming, like, I'm the best, but I f*cking enjoy myself, you know? Can I have some more, please? Yeah. ( British accent ) "Please, sir, can I have some more?" ( Snickers, laughing ) That was hilarious. Have you seen it? I did "Oliver Twist." You ever heard of that? It's english. Oh, this is my... New one. ( Music playing ) ( Monkey gibbering ) You know, this is actually just two tunes playing simultaneously in different iTune windows, so I don't have to be here, I can join you. Here I am. Has anyone ever told you you look like a young Brooke Shields? Actually, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. And you... Julie Christie. Uh, yeah, good reference. Eh? It's good. Yeah, totally, totally. Oh, f*ck, it's so rare to find just two such different, But at the same time equal beauties... Okay, that's our cue to go. Thank you so much... No, no, we don't have to go. You don't have to go. ( Stammers ) We've outstayed our welcome. No. It's... thank you so much. You've been so... ♪ Slave to love... ♪ ( Monkey gibbering ) ♪ Slave to love... ♪ Yikes.

Are you f*cking serious?! This is... this is a $10,000 rug. This is a very f*cking expensive rug. If you're gonna spill on it, you gotta look more sorry than that! I'm really sorry. She's sorry. You know what, if you're really sorry, you'd better be planning to make this a very special night for all of us,  not just you and f*cking missy Malool. All of us. And not me just watching you girls go at it for a little bit and getting a little bit turned on. I wanna be balls-deep in something! And I don't even f*cking care what it is. No more excluding me, Mary Poppins! It's not fair. I wanna be part of the group. Oh, that... will never happen. Jessa. This isn't right, is it? This can't be the way that this goes. I'm... I'm not gay. She's so not gay. I was just trying to be free. Do you even know what it's like to work hard? No. Tell us. I've been under a lot of pressure my whole life to succeed. Daddy didn't buy me this rug or this apartment or this nose. That's not your nose. There's no way that's your f*ckin' nose. There is no cartilage in the world that exquisite! So it kind of ticks me off when I come to Williamsburg after working hard all f*cking day in the "real world," And I see all these stupid little daddy's girls with their f*ckin' bowler hats... What are you doing wearing a f*cking bowler hat, stupid? And then you come over and you flirt and flirt and flirt and flirt and kiss and kiss and listen to my amazing tunes, drink my beautiful wine, and then spill it all over my gorgeous rug... And laugh about it. Yeah, well, we're not laughing at your  rug,  trust me. We're not laughing. You... don't hurt us. Come here. Jessa: We're laughing at your mash-ins. It's mash-ups! Oh, and just so you know, I'm gonna go eat her c**t on the sidewalk right now. ( Door closes ) It's mash-ups. ( Door opens, closes ) Adam:  Hey. Hey! Come with me, kid. A... Adam. ( Distant siren blaring ) This is like when my parents woke me up during a tornado. Adam:  Just a little farther. Adam, I'm tired and I don't know where we're going. Adam:  Sorry I yelled at that car. What? I wish I could apologize, but I don't know the driver, So I guess I'm just gonna have to feel bad about it forever unless he drives by again. ( Hannah laughing ) Jesus. I'm gonna do that f*cking play. You are? Yeah. I'm gonna do it so you can watch it. Oh, my God. All right, would you help me with this? How do I help you? Um, here. Spread 'em. What are you doing? Hannah: Oh, my God. ( Grunts ) Adam: All right, help me grab these. Okay, got it. Hannah: Oh, my God, okay. Adam: All right, wet it down. Got it. Wait. Get a little closer. Okay. There's bird sh1t on my head. Paper. ( Laughs ) Okay. Hannah: This is a ridiculous project. f*ck. Harder. You're a ridiculous person. You're a ridiculous person. Scrape it harder. All right, let's go f*ck.
