 Tally:  You're always really sweatin' it  and I really admire that effort to do something that is not maybe the most natural to you. 
 I've been putting together a weekly reading. 
 It's tomorrow night. I think you should come read something. 
 Ray:  Your cousin told me to stay with you  because she didn't want you to be left alone because you smoked crack. 
 You know, you could be a little more supportive. 
 Do you have any idea how much money you owe me at this point? 
 Katherine:  I bet you get into these dramas all the time. 
 You're doing it to distract yourself from becoming the person you're meant to be. 
 I want to be part of the group. 
 That will never happen. 
 Jessa. 
 I wrote something new on the subway on the way here. 
 I shouldn't have done the reading. 
 No, what you should have done was read that historical piece you sent me. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 Hey. Hannah. 
 I have an S.T.D. and I'm pretty sure you gave it to me. 
 I do not want to live here anymore. 
 I don't want to live with you anymore either. 
 Hannah:  f*ck, I'm crushed! 
 Marnie:  No, you're not. 
 Adam: Go, go, go! Down! 
 I'm telling you-- 
 We're four feet away. 
 We're so close, Hannah. 
 It's crushing me. It's-- 
 Here, move. 
 I got it. I got it. 
 You don't got it. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 You don't need to be a hero about this. 
 You know what? I trust him. 
 If he says he's got it, he's got it. 
 You got it? 
 I got it. I so got it. Just leave, leave. 
 I trust-- the move of trust. 
 Look, there's an ice-cream truck outside. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Go, go. 
 Ow. Are you sure? 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 I'll help you. I'll hold this-- 
 No, no, no. 
 Just walk away. 
 ( Music playing ) 
 Gotta get going. I have to pick up the keys from Shoshanna before she goes to class. 
 Yeah, but you don't have a plan. 
 I think maybe that's a good thing for me. 
 Okay. 
 I will see you. 
 On purpose? 
 Don't push. 
 ( Door opens, closes ) 
 ( Engine starts ) Hannah: That was really intense. Yeah. There wasn't even that much sh1t to move. No, I mean, like, with Marnie. Like, she's not even angry, I don't think. She's just, like, really hurt. Well, how do you feel? Guilty. Don't waste time on guilt, Hannah. Holding onto toxic relationships is what keeps us from growing. You're forming every time you shed a layer, getting closer to yourself. I mean, look at this place. It's half empty now, full of potential. Anything could happen. ( Laughing ) ( Growling ) Now Marnie's weird fake grown-up stuff is gone. Maybe I'll move in. Really? I hate today. I hate today so much that I might not even go to class. Why? It is so gorgeous outside. Yeah, I know. It, like, really gives me this uneasy feeling. It's like this certain kind of spring itch. You know what I mean? I saw three people touching tongues outside of my final yesterday. Like, three couples? No, three people. Ugh. I'm sorry you saw that. Where's Jessa? Are you sure it's okay that I'm sleeping in her bed? Um, yeah. I don't know. I haven't heard from her for, like, a full 24/7. And I'd totally be worried, except she's been texting all the time and all her junk is still here. Well, thank you for letting me stay here. I'm actually gonna start looking for a new place tomorrow. Oh, my God. Totally, don't. Don't. Really, don't. Like, stay as long as you want. Stay forever. Let's actually-- you know what? Let's just, like, find a place to put this, like, forever. Okay. Um, right here. ( Music playing over stereo ) ( Phone chimes ) This book is f*cking incredible. Anything by a British woman is just-- f*ck. Hey, Ray, I'm really sorry about this, but I'm really not feeling well  and I think that I may have to leave early. Why? What's wrong? My throat just feels very kind of like allergic and scratchy. It's like-- it's just hotness. I think it's from this expired mylanta that I drank. Mm. Expired mylanta-- you don't wanna drink that. ( Clucking ) Like you know you're gonna get sick? Expired mylanta. Your illness couldn't possibly be related to this text message I received from Jessa about 20 minutes ago, could it? "Please come to the most important party of my life.  7:00 P.M. sharp. Dress real nice and come." Use your head, okay? We're in the same friendship circle. Also, do you really think you've worked here long enough to deserve a reading break? Well, you know what? No one's here, so I just thought-- Don't just think, okay? That's an extremely unattractive feature of your generation. Empty those two pitchers and run home and change. What in God's name is this party for? I don't know, but she told me if I didn't come, she'd gut me like a fish. ( Chattering ) f*ck. Oh, my God. It's your one true love. Where's his new girlfriend? I'm fine. I'm in a really good place in my life. Totally. Everything you own is in trash bags in my kitchen. Hey. I'll see you in there. Marnie:  Uh-huh. Hey, it's you. Shoshanna:  Hi. He looked at me weird. See? Today is totally weird. Party. It's a mystery party. My shoes match my dress... kind of. ( Music playing, people chattering ) This is gonna be an "Eyes Wide Shut" party. Getting that vibe. Woman:  Whose party are you here with? Adam:  I don't know. It's a secret party. Oh, wait. He's with me. She's being very elitist and cruel. Hannah: Just get up here. I can see up your dress. My name was on that paper. Adam Sackler was on that paper. You look very beautiful. Thank you. You look very dapper. Not one, but two plaids. ( Clicks tongue ) Heh-hey, how's it going? Uh, hello. Hello, everyone. Is this thing on? ( Laughing ) ( Crowd quiets, music stops ) I'm just kidding. I don't-- I have no thing. I'm sure you're all wondering what you're doing here  or who you're going to be doing it with. Boys and girls, this is a mystery party. And I think we can all agree that the greatest mystery in  this  life is love. ( Crowd murmuring ) So... that was when the music was supposed to start. Cue the music. ( Music playing ) There we go. ♪ Just a look was all it took ♪ 
♪ suddenly I'm on the hook ♪ 
♪ it's ma-a-a-gic ♪ 
♪ follow you and follow me... ♪ Hey. ♪ Everybody else can see... ♪ Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's Thomas-John. That's the guy that tried to have a three-way with me and Jessa. What's happening? ♪ It's not that I'm sticking with you ♪ 
♪ nobody makes me feel better... ♪ ( Crowd gasping ) ♪ Let the whole world pass me by ♪ 
♪ take me to the countryside... ♪ Dude, if I didn't know any better... Oh, my God. I think she's getting married. She's  not  getting married. As some of you may have already guessed, we're getting married. We are. ( Crowd cheering ) Shh, shh, shh, shh. Can you please hold the-- Thank you. ( Slaps ) Ow. ( Laughs ) Hi. Jessa, the first night we met, truthfully, I thought that we were gonna have a threesome with your friend Marnie. What's up, Marnie? But we didn't do that. When you left my house that night, I felt more energized than I had for years. I thought to myself that if I ever saw that crazy bitch again, I would make her my f*ckin' wife. ( Crowd cheering ) Man:  All right! Woman:  Whoo! Ow! Woman #2:  Yeah, man! Woman #3:  All right! I wore white. What? I wore white to her wedding. I wore white because how could I have known? Because nobody told me. Well, yeah, it's a surprise wedding. Thomas-John, when you came to my house with flowers, I was prepared to call the special victims unit. ( Laughter ) Woman:  Yeah! Not only did I find you very creepy, but I found you also really boring. You are. You're boring. ( Laughter ) But for some reason, I agreed to have dinner with you. And you asked to move tables twice and I was even more revolted. ( Laughs ) Then you started talking about what you did, about travel and finance, and I thought, "This man's brilliant  in a way that I have never known." Thank you. I appreciate your adventurous spirit, your desire to learn, and everything you don't know about. ( Laughter ) Yeah? It's a positive. sh1t. I know. I love you. Are you okay? I'm very moved. You are? Yeah. People finding each other, taking shelter. Both:  I love you! I'm very moved. But they just met, like, two weeks ago. Time is a rubber band. Thadd:  And now with the power vested in me  by a website that I found on the Internet... ( Laughter ) ...I now pronounce you man and wife. Ahh! You may kiss the bride. Free the bird. Women: Aw. ( Crowd cheering ) Is it garter time? No. No. Oh, come on, please! Oh, f*ck it. Oh, boy. Your dreams are not what you thought they'd be. Woman:  Whoo-hoo! All right, everybody, let's f*ckin' cork it out! Aah! Whoo! ♪ I can't even lie ♪ 
♪ I f*ck better when I'm drinkin' ♪ Ohhh, sh1t! ♪ Ride dick like a pro ♪ 
♪ throw the pussy like I'm famous ♪

♪ this pussy be yankin', I know this pussy be yankin' ♪ 
♪ this pussy be yankin', I know this puss... ♪ ( Crowd cheering ) Jessa:  I love you. You're so f*cking gross, lying there on the bathroom floor. I can't believe you're married. I mean, I never expected that. Not that I know what to expect from you, but I did not expect that. You don't think I'm crazy. I don't think you're crazy. I mean, I think it's fast. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I am, but, f*ck, Hannah, I have never been this happy. I feel like I'm sleeping in a rosebud. I'm so gone on this man. But, like, how can you be so sure about something like that? Like, Adam wants to move in with me and I can't even tell if that's good or bad. Like, you feel like a real adult now? Mm... Yeah. ( Laughs ) Kind of. Thank you. Elijah. Hi, JLo at the Grammys. ( Sighs ) You know, I'd really like to put our past behind us and I hope you find what you're looking for. ( Huffs ) All right, everyone, for the grooviest portion of the evening, please join us outside for their first dance as man and wife-- Jessa and Thomas-John. ( Crowd cheering ) Do they need us for that? Yeah. They need you for that. They need me. I can do it. I can do it. No. Okay. All right, that's fine. I love you. Yeah. I love you. Thadd:  This is gonna be your life from now on. ( Laughing ) Come into my arms, Rapunzel. 
 
 ( Music playing ) Thomas-John: This is amazing. I feel so alive. You're wearing a halo. You're wearing a halo right now. ( Slurps ) Enjoying yourself? ( Chuckles ) Yeah, actually. Not too much. Don't worry. Where is Audrey? She's in Sante Fe. She's blogging from a tortilla soup contest. It's not a joke. I had not laughed about it yet. No, actually, I've read her blog. She's a really good writer. And I like all of her ironic t-shirts. Of course, I like them unironically. So, what do-- What do people even do at weddings? ( Sniffs ) We should just, like, go f*ck in the bathroom. Yeah, totally. I'll just sit on the sink and you can f*ck me really quickly. Hard, and I'll just cover your mouth so you don't make any noise. Yeah, and then I'll, like, turn on the faucet by accident with my ass. And then we'll come out here and we'll eat some dessert, and then we'll just, like, wink at each other from across the room. We should just forget about all of our troubles and go f*ck somewhere. Okay, great. ( Laughs ) Wait. You're-- you're joking, right? Yeah, totally. Okay. Totally. You really had me there. That was-- that was weird. Oh, no. No, no, no. Yeah, I was joking. 'Cause you were joking, right? Yeah. Yes, I was. Yeah. Enjoying yourself? I don't wanna do this. No, me neither. It's a big pet peeve, actually. People touching as they sway-- it's very annoying. No, I love dancing, but I'm really upset. What's wrong? It's personal. I can't explain it. Give it a whirl. Okay. Everyone's a dumb whore. I can hardly stop thinking about you since the night we met. You are the strangest person. ( Music playing ) You're just-- you're so-- you're so raw and open. You vibrate on a very strange frequency. Are you punking me? It's very confusing for me, too. I wanna go home with you. Tonight. Fine. Fine. Just stay out of my emotional way. Fine. See? I'm even f*cking better at slow dancing than I am at fast dancing. I have an amazing move that I do to this song. You wanna see? Yeah. ♪ I ain't never gonna shut you out ♪ 
♪ everywhere I'm looking now ♪ 
♪ I'm surrounded by your embrace... ♪ This is how Beyonce does it in the video. And then she's like... And then she's like... Jesus Christ, kid. Save your strength. We're in it for the long haul. ♪ It's written all over your face ♪ 
♪ baby, I can feel your halo ♪ 
♪ pray it won't fade away ♪ 
♪ I can feel your halo, halo, halo ♪ 
♪ I can see your halo, halo, halo ♪ 
♪ I can feel your halo, halo ♪ 
♪ halo. ♪ ( Music playing ) Hannah. Hi. Hey. Hi. Hi. You look great. ( Muffled ) Oh, thank you. Um, look, I just wanted to say that I-- I did give you H.P.V. Um, after we talked, I kind of waded through my sexual history  and Rachel Dusetik absolutely has it. Oh, my God. Okay, I knew it was her, 'cause that girl wears floral capris like her hymen's still intact, but she was such a slut in such a big way. In a huge way. She used to do this thing where she would rip the condom off. Like... f*ckin' redheads. I know, right? Redheads. Seriously. Crazy. ( Sighs ) Please forgive me. Oh, come on. You know, everyone has it. Right? Let's just consider it water under... my v*g1n*. ( Laughs ) Honey. Hi. Have you seen these petit fours? I would f*ck these petit fours. Oh, Hannah, this is George. George, this is-- this is Hannah. Hi. Nice to meet you. Oh, Hannah! Yes. Ha-- Hannah? Yes. The straw that broke the camel's back? Yeah. She does not look like Camryn Manheim. Honey. So are you two, like, living together now? Oh, no. No, no, no. I wish, but we have to wait till Templeton's graduated. Yes, Templeton is George's son, and he's extremely homophobic. Wow. Very hard. So I've been living in an S.R.O. since I left Bo, which is an apartment where you share a bathroom with-- Everyone on your floor. It's like murderers and, like, junkies and girls who huff. Like-- That is awful. It's not great. Well, you know, you're in luck because I actually need a roommate. Oh! I mean, that would be great. Can we do this? Oy, sounds like kismet. And you know what? We would have so much fun. We both have H.P.V. already. I know, right? We don't have to worry. That awkward thing's off the table. Yeah, right? Yeah. You both have what? H.P.V. What is that? Human papillomavirus. Elijah:  It's-- you know, it's like that thing. A sexually transmitted disease. Yeah, but for girls. That he gave me. You've got it, too, now. Look, we can discuss this in a-- He seems great. I know, right? And rich as f*ck. ( Music playing ) ♪ When you left my house in the morning... ♪ Why are you even trying? You hate sweet stuff. ( Laughing ) Hi. So you don't have to worry. About what? About moving in, because I found someone. You found someone. It's gonna sound crazy, but it's Elijah. And he's moving in next week, so if you felt obligated, don't. Also, he just told me he's getting certified in Alexander technique, which is literally the gayest thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you didn't like the idea, why didn't you say so? No, it's-- you know, I thought you were trying to help and I appreciate it-- Help? I don't wanna help. No one does anything 'cause they wanna help. I was doing it because I love you. Oh. Why do you look so surprised? No, it's just like-- you know, I just didn't think you were into that. Into what? Love? No, I just-- you know, I just associate that with, like, Marnie and Charlie and people starting to talk a lot about their relationship, you know? It's like, "My relationship is doing really well right now," or "I need to work on some aspects of my relationship." And it's just like, your relationship is not a thing. Your relationship is not an achievement. I've got actual things I would like to achieve before I focus on, like, that. And you can't achieve those things with me? No, it's-- it's not that. It's just-- don't you feel like sometimes you and I distract each other from the other stuff that we have going on-- Okay, I don't wanna flip out on you right now at a surprise wedding. If you wanna f*ck me from behind, at least pull my hair back. Adam. Thadd:  Excuse me! Coming through. All right. Lady with a baby. Look out. Ladles and gentlebeans, attention. What's that, tiny Jessa? ( Laughter ) It's cakey time? Ha ha ha! Cakey time. Is it just me, or is he adorable? Are you okay? I don't know. Thadd:  She gave birth to those cakes. ( Laughing ) Aah! ( Crowd cheering ) Hey. What's up, man? Hey, dickhead. f*ck you. Well, what do we do? Oh, we gotta cut it. Of course. Oh, my God, it's perfect. Yeah, it f*cking cost enough. ( Laughing ) You ready, baby? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm ready. Is this what makes it official? ( Laughs ) Wait! ( Laughter ) Thomas-John:  Thadd, you prick. Thadd:  I'm kidding! Thomas-John:  f*ck you! ( Laughter ) Uh! Crowd: Bye! Jessa: Thank you. Yo! Why are you so mad at me? I brought you cake, so even if you don't like sweet stuff, it's amazing-- You love yourself so much. So why is it so crazy that someone else would, too? I don't love myself. You're the f*cking worst, you know that? Because you think you're not pretty and you're not a good writer and you're not a good friend. Well, you are pretty and you are a good writer and you are a good friend. Um, thank you. Is this the game? You chase me like I'm the f*cking Beatles for six months, and then I finally get comfortable and you shrug? What the f*ck is wrong with you?! I'm scared, okay? I'm really scared all the time. I'm, like, very scared all the time. Join the f*cking club. No, because I'm more scared than most people are when they say that they're scared. I'm like the most scared person who's alive. Well, you don't have the right to be! I told you once I commit to something, I really f*cking commit! You asked for this! And now you're being a f*cking bitch. Adam, come on, okay? You're scared. I'm looking at you. I know you're scared. You're acting like you're not, but you are. I know you now. We've been doing this for a while. I know you now. Stop, stop. You don't know me. You don't know sh1t about me. ( Horn blares ) Get out of the street! You don't know me and you don't know yourself. You think because you're, what, 11 pounds overweight, you know struggle? I am 13 pounds overweight and it has been awful for me my whole life! Holy f*ckin' sh1t! Here's the world's smallest, tiny violin playing "My Heart Bleeds For You." f*ck you! You don't know struggle. I'm a beautiful f*cking mystery to you. ( Screams ) No! f*ck! Hey there. Nice work. Yeah, well, she kind of threw it at me, but thank you. Yeah. I mean, a girl like you doesn't exactly need a bouquet. Why don't you pick on someone your own size? ( Snickers ) That was dumb. Oh, God. Is this party really over? I know. I was just getting started. Seriously. The night is young. But, I mean, you probably have someplace to be. You'd be surprised. I can't stop. Oh, you're just going for it, huh? Mm-hmm. I think I just fell in love. ( Mumbles ) Really? A little bit. You look beautiful. I think some cake just went in my cleavage. I'm not gonna look, because that would not be gentlemanly. Would it be-- although, helping would be-- I'd like you to help. That looks awesome. I'd like to go there... Someday. Man, I am not good at this. I didn't mean to be so forward. ( Music playing ) Shoshanna:  It doesn't hurt. Well, good, because I haven't done anything yet. ( Softly ) Right. My-- my aunt says that it kind of feels like scratching a sunburn. Okay. I know you hate virgins. You totally hate virgins. You totally lied to me. You hate me so much. No-- You totally lied about liking me. You don't like me at all. Shh. It's not that at all, okay? It's not that. It's just-- ( Sighs ) It just occurred to me, you know, that-- you know, you've never done it before, and, thusly, I am teaching you how it's done. And, you know, that's a lot of power, which I don't know if I deserve. Okay. But I probably do. Hannah:  I think he has a concussion. I wish I had a f*cking concussion. No, no. Family only, right? Family only? E.M.T.:  Yeah. Oh, sorry, family only. You're not my f*cking family. Adam, I'm coming with you. Adam! Adam! Don't let her in here. She's a monster. Adam! ( Siren wailing ) ( P.A. chatter ) ( Women chattering ) Excuse me? Woman:  Whose attitude? Where am I? ( Women laugh ) No, she didn't. Are you serious? Are you serious right now? You're in heaven. ( Women laugh ) You're in La La Land. You're in f*ckin' heaven. ( Vocalizing ) Welcome to heaven. Has she got a green belt on or am I tweakin'?
