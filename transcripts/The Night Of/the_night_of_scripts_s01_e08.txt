 Man : So the writer tells me the main character of the show is a cop who gets his legs blown off in Afghanistan, comes back, gets fitted for those carbon-compound kangaroo feet... 
 Like that Olympics guy who shot his girlfriend in the can... 
 And gets back on the job. 
 So, like what? Goes bouncing around after the bad guys? 
 Apparently that's the whole point. 
 RoboDouche. 
 Man : I told him, "Hey, you want to do something original? 
 How about a series with a cop who doesn't give a sh1t?" 
 Punches out, comes home, has dinner with his family, bangs the wife, and sleeps like a log. 
 You write a show like that, and the job will throw you a parade. 
 Am I right, Dennis?

 (chatting indistinctly) This is nice. 
 Yeah, it's okay. 
 Chandra :  The night of October 24th, did you encounter the defendant and Andrea on West 87th Street? 
 I don't think I want to answer that question. 
 You kind of have to, Mr. Williams. 
 Not true, not true. It's called the Fifth Amendment. 
 You're concerned about self-incrimination? 
 What for? I ain't do nothing. 
 Then do us all a favor and answer the question. 
 I don't think you right on that. 
 But... I mean, no disrespect... 
 But, yes. 
 Tell her. 
 Yeah, I saw them. 
 Were you alone? 
 No. 
 Why did you tell the detective you were? 
 I misremembered. 
 You misremembered, that's why? 
 Not because you were afraid of this person you were with? 
 Is the Fifth okay here? 
 No. That train's left the station, Mr. Williams. 
 No. I'm not afraid of him. 
 Him? 
 Duane, dude's name is. 
 Duane Reade. 
 Yeah. And is that a curse or what? 
 Bacon come to snatch your ass up, talking 'bout "What's your name, nigga?" 
 You like, "Duane Reade." 
 And they like, "Oh, you trying to be funny, m*therf*cker?" 
 Blam, blam, blam! "Once again, what's your f*cking name?" 
 Right? 
 Thank you, Mr. Williams. 
 You got it. 
 Judge : Mrs. Weiss? 
 No questions, Your Honor. 
 Mr. Duane Reade. Where do you presently reside? 
 The Cave. 
 Do you mean Cavendish State Penitentiary? 
 That's what I said. 
 How is it you find yourself there? 
 They say a burglary. I say trespassing. 
 I didn't leave with nothing. 
 Isn't that because the police apprehended you before you could get out the door with the Fujitsu TV you were carrying? 
 That's what they say. 
 Was this your first arrest for burglary? 
 I don't think so. 
 I don't either. 
 Because it was your 14th. 
 And you assaulted seven of these 14 homeowners with a knife. 
 One Mr. Cuatro... Do you remember him? 
 That was self-defense. 
 Dude come running up on me. I had to fight for my life. 
 Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old and on an oxygen tank. 
 Did you bring the knife with you? 
 No. Got it from his kitchen. 
 A five-inch steak knife, according to the police report. 
 And you were arrested in the same manner on September 20th, 2012, in possession of another steak knife. 
 Did you bring that one with you? 
 Again, that was trespassing. 
 It was aggravated sexual assault. 
 But my question is where the knife came from. 
 The lady's sink, I think. 
 Like with Mr. Cuatro and the others here, you used a knife that was there. 
 That's your MO? 
 A shrug won't do, Mr. Reade. We need to hear an answer. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Trevor Williams, you know him? 
 Yeah, I know him. 
 He testified you didn't say anything when you encountered the defendant and Ms. Cornish  outside her residence with him. 
 He said you just stood there... Trevor : I'm going to Sharanda's, man. Chandra :  ...silent, watching them go inside. Trevor : I know they got some weed over there, too. What were you thinking about, I wonder? Judge : Any questions, Mrs. Weiss? No questions, Your Honor. Chandra :  Why isn't she questioning these guys? To say to the jury she's not concerned about them. But she is. You're leaving me alone with the undertaker? You'll be fine. Psst! Chandra : What's going on here, Mr. Day? She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at. I put it out. Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on someone's car window? I know guys put it out in their mouth. Just before you put it out, you knocked on the window, like people do to say "Roll it down." And we saw that she didn't roll it down. Do you think she might have been afraid of you? Oh, no one's afraid of me. I am. After what you said to me at the mortuary, remember? Am I right, that's inadmissible? That's "heresy," right? Something like that. Disregard Ms. Kapoor's last statement. This is an order of protection issued against you by your wife, Michelle. Yeah, that's before we got back together. Oh, that's good. I'm happy for you both, you managed to resolve that somehow. What about this 911 call she made saying you were threatening her with a knife? The police come out, by then she'd calmed down, that was that. This is one forgiving woman. I never did nothing to her. To who? Who we talking about, my wife. So, you're done filling your hearse at this point, but you're not leaving. You're just... I don't know what you're doing. Just waiting? Resting. Now you're finally leaving just as they do. Are you following them, Mr. Day? No. Where are you going, then? My whereabouts are my business. Judge : Oh, be a sport and answer the lady. Home. To Michelle? To my other residence. An SRO hotel for men on 135th Street. Is there something wrong with that? No. It's just, if you'd gone home to Michelle or a hotel with working security cameras, unlike this rooming house, we'd be able to verify where you went that night. But we can't. She doesn't listen to me, you know? I know. (continues indistinctly) Taylor : You look amazing, amazing. (woman giggles) (horn honks) One. We're calling you as a witness. So while you're up there, you can explain how you didn't kill your stepdaughter. Two. I don't work out enough, so the next time you threaten my family, it'll be one of my clients who pays you a visit. He's from New Jersey. Guard : Arms out. All right, go on. (beeping) Arms out. (security wand squealing) Bailiff :  Please raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Yeah. My condolences, Mr. Taylor, and my apologies, but there are certain things only you can clarify for us. How would you describe your relationship with your stepdaughter? Not great, to be honest. Honesty is why we're here. How come it wasn't great, if you know? The drugs mainly. Her drug use made our relationship difficult. Hers with her mother. Frankly, mine with her mother. An addict's net casts wide. Her mother, your wife, Evelyn, died last year, I was sorry to learn. How long were you married? Two years. And how did Andrea feel about it? (sighs) Like a lot of kids feel about second marriages. Seeing her mother happy... I assume she was happy... Didn't make her daughter happy? No. Was the age difference an issue? What is it, about 20 years? It didn't help. Andrea, I mean. It didn't matter at all to Evelyn, or me. Was there anything else about the marriage Andrea didn't like before, during, or after it? Yeah. Evelyn's will. It entitled you to something when Evelyn died even though you'd been married just two years. Yeah. And Andrea was unhappy with that? "Outraged" is the word. Outraged you were to get half her mother's estate, which included the home on 87th Street, which has a current market value of about 10 million dollars. That's right. So outraged she filed an appeal in a probate court in hopes it would agree with her you deserved nothing. That's right. Did that outrage you? No. I understood why she felt like that. You understood it but filed a countersuit against her. Did that help diffuse her outrage? No. It didn't. How did two people like this live under one roof? They don't. She asked me to leave and I did. You moved out of her mother's 10 million-dollar house, to...? A fifth-floor walk-up in Queens. But you know what? Compared to being yelled at by a 22-year-old drug addict day in and day out, it's paradise. Well, now all that drama is over, you can move back or sell it. That's my intention. What do you do for a living, Mr. Taylor? Personal trainer, at Atlantis Fitness. Is that where you met Evelyn? No. I met her at prior health club I was working at, Equinox. Why'd you leave Equinox for Atlantis? Better pay? No. Was it because of the members at Equinox, women members, complained to the management about unwanted attention from you? It wasn't true. But, yeah, a couple members said that. What do you make now at Atlantis? Look, it's obvious what you're saying, so why don't I just save you all the cat and mouse, and these people, some of their valuable time. I make about $35,000 a year there. Plus whatever I can pick up with private lessons. I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. I filed for bankruptcy twice before. And no, I didn't kill my stepdaughter. Ever been arrested? Yeah. Twice, right? Both times for domestic battery? Once against your ex-wife Jean, once against Andrea's mother. Restraining orders in both cases. Yeah. Another of your entitlements now is Andrea's trust fund, which you filed for in Surrogate's Court. When did you file this claim? The date? I don't know. Well, here it is, so let's have a look. October 27th. That's two days after her murder, that Monday. Of course, it's closed on Saturday and Sunday. Is the time of filing on there? 8:00 a.m. You know what time Surrogate's Court opens? 8:00 a.m. Uh-huh. And when was Andrea's funeral? That Wednesday. So, two days before you buried her, you applied for her trust fund. Okay. I think I've got the time line straight. Just one more question. When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that? I don't, because I haven't been back there. She didn't. Judge : Mrs. Weiss? No questions. (keyboard clacks) Before this. Box : I need the credit card receipts from that night. Can't do it. Customer's private information. Unless you brought a subpoena with you. I'm not talking about the cash purchases you have no intention of reporting, just the credit cards. Not without a subpoena. Sorry. This is my subpoena, only pretend it has a "C" on it. Stone : You should feel okay. Do you? I do. Then you're a worse liar than the stepfather. Any case, there's nothing else to do. We're out of witnesses. We're done. I want to call Naz. No, you don't. They need to hear from him. No, they don't. They've got all the reasonable doubt they need. I disagree. You disagree? You don't know enough to disagree. Who are you again? What's your experience? Remind me. Who are you? Look... when he walked into this courtroom on day one, he was wearing the cloak of presumed innocence. He's still wearing it, and will continue to unless he testifies, then he takes it off. He forfeits it the minute he goes up there. No, he doesn't. To the jury he does. He gets in that box, they'll expect him to prove his innocence. Any everything else we've presented goes out the window. You mean everything I've presented. You're killing me, and that's fine, but don't kill him. Go home and write and your closing argument. Chandra :  You think you can handle it? Do you? I do. And I think it's important. Like, we'll lose if I don't? I'm afraid we might. If I do it, I'm gonna need some help. I'll walk you through the whole thing. But once I sit down and she stands up, there's not much I can do. That's not the kind of help I mean. ♪ ♪ (door opens) (sighs) Hey, John. Hey. Sorry I didn't make it to your party. You mean my wake? What you should do is come work with me in cardholder security.

Where's the rest of it? (whispers) I got you. (whispers) Okay? Officer. ♪ ♪ Chandra : In the short time you and Andrea were together, did you develop any feelings towards her? I did. I liked her a lot. She was fun just to be with, um... in a way a lot of my friends can't be that were raised conservatively. As Muslims, you mean? Yes. Later that night when you found her, can you describe that for us? I woke up in the kitchen, and walked up the stairs, down the hall to the bedroom to get dressed and say goodbye. She didn't say anything. So, I touched her to wake her. I felt in my hand something wet. I turned on the lamp next to the bed and saw her. The blood, the wounds, and, uh... She was dead. Yeah. And you? I panicked and I ran. I wish I hadn't done that. I'm ashamed that I did that. But I did. I was scared. Did you kill her? (softly) No. No. I couldn't have. Even if I was out of my mind, I could never do that. I know it in my heart. Thank you. Judge : Mrs. Weiss? You ever lie, Mr. Khan? I try not to. Is taking things without permission, like taxi cabs, a kind of lie? Yes. What about getting doctors to prescribe amphetamines and then selling them at a whopping profit to your friends? Ever tell your conservative parents about that? No. When Andrea got in your cab, did you ask her to get out like those other two guys? Uh, no. 'Cause she was pretty? I guess. Okay. So now she's in your cab, you're driving her around, buying her beer. You have any notions where it might lead? Notions? Notions, thoughts. Like, with any luck it might lead to s*x. I don't really do that type of thing. Which? Have s*x with somebody I just met. Isn't that exactly what you did three hours later? Yeah. What kind of s*x did you guys have? If you're worried about your parents hearing this, I'll give them a chance to leave. Just regular s*x. I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that. Chandra : Objection. No, we don't. Judge : Overruled. I don't remember the details. Is that because you have s*x so often, it kind of just all blurs together? No. How many times have you had s*x, with women or men? Once before, with a girl. Only once before? And you don't remember anything about this second time? There were a lot of drugs. Oh, we've heard. A lot of foreplay, too? No. She didn't want a lot of that. She didn't. Okay. How about you? Is that how you like it? How would you like it? Excuse me? Having to sit up here in front of all these people, answering this type of question? That's what you meant. Well, I wouldn't. But if I was on trial for murder and freely chose to testify, I'd have to answer the questions I'm asked. You know what, let's go to just after not-much-foreplay s*x. What you did between then and when you say you woke up in the kitchen downstairs. I don't remember. This is a crucial period of time, Mr. Khan. You might want to try harder to remember, for your sake. I know, but I can't. Nothing? Not doing anything? Not hearing anything? Not even going down there? Nothing. So, you woke up. You walk back upstairs. You found her dead. And you ran in a blind panic? Yes. But then you ran back and broke back into the same place you just ran from in a blind panic. Remind me why? My car keys were in my jacket, which was inside. Right. So you grabbed your jacket and ran out again. Yes. Grab anything else? No. The vial of ketamine was already in your jacket pocket? No, you're right. I picked that up off the coffee table. This... This drug your... your attorney says was Andrea's? It was hers. So why would you take it? I don't know. Take anything else? No. Think. No. So the murder weapon was already in your pocket? Chandra : Objection. Fine. So the knife was already in your pocket? No. I took that with me, too. Why? Because I knew how it looked. You were drunk, drugged, scared, and in a blind panic. But you still knew how it looked? Yeah. How did it look? Like I killed her. All right. So you left the house again with the ketamine and the knife, got in your father's cab... We've heard what happened after that from law enforcement officers... And now... you're in a patrol car, being taken to the precinct by Officer Bell, who thinks you're a witness, and you ask him what? Is she dead? Why did you ask him that? Because I hoped it wasn't true. Please read back the testimony from "I turned on the lamp." Mr. Khan : "I turned on the lamp next to the bed and saw her. The blood, the wounds, and..." Ms. Kapoor, "She was dead." Mr. Khan, "Yeah." So, when you saw her just before you ran in a blind panic, she was dead. And two hours later in the patrol car, you weren't sure? She looked like she was dead. But conceivably she wasn't? I don't know. You didn't check her pulse? No. You didn't call 911? No. Why not, if it was possible she was still alive? I don't know. I wasn't thinking. You see why I'm having some trouble here? You had the presence of mind to run from a crime scene, to remove evidence implicating you in the crime, to operate a motor vehicle without crashing into anything, but you didn't have the presence of mind to dial three numbers on your phone? The prophet Muhammad has this to say about that. "Hurry with all the strength of your legs to the one who needs help." Is that what you did for Andrea? (sighs) Here's the deal, Mr. Khan, and you know it. Whether you stabbed her or not, you could have saved her. This young woman who you barely knew, but who you say you liked... Did you kill her? I don't know. I'm done. ♪ ♪

Or are you gonna tell me it was just a lover's quarrel? She was a client, not a girlfriend. I'm not sure which is worse for you, but I beg to differ. So you went there later, after this. Woke her up, tried to talk to her again. Told her you'd get her money back... Of course, you couldn't. She told you to get the f*ck out, maybe reached for the phone to call the cops, you went downstairs, opened the drawer, took a knife out... The killer's on trial. You guys arrested him.

Weiss :  Ladies and gentlemen...  when you file a request for a document from the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, this is what you get. It's called a redacted document, edited to render unreadable any content the FBI deems a threat to national security, or, more often, to the security of the workings of the FBI itself. Redaction equals self-preservation. Like this, there is a redaction in the middle of what the defendant has told you about the night of Andrea's murder, a black rectangle of nothing between the time he had s*x with her, and when he, as he says, found her bleeding out. He says he can't remember anything. He fell asleep. He passed out. He has redacted a crucial period of time. Why? For the same reason this is blacked out. Self-preservation. His defense team has tried to say there are other people with motive, opportunity, and histories more consistent than Mr. Khan's with such a horrendous crime as this. I'd ask why, but you know why. It's desperation. Because they know a redacted story doesn't sit well with an intelligent jury. Is there any evidence any other person was in the house that night? No. Nasir Khan was the only person in the house the night Andrea was murdered, in the bedroom she was murdered, in the bed she was murdered. He's the only person whose blood is there, whose prints are there, whose semen is there. The only person who had a knife in his pocket with her blood on it. He was that night, and to this day, the only suspect the police considered. Because... (door opens, closes) Because he was and is the only killer of this beautiful, young woman. This is not a penknife or a grapefruit knife. This knife is designed to cut through meat, and that's what Mr. Khan used it for, cutting through tendons, muscle, bone, and a heart, 22 times.

He'd just been arrested. I walked past him, out of the station and then stopped. I turned around and went back. Why? Because I didn't see what I see in my other clients. And I still don't after all this time. What I see is what happens when you put a kid in Rikers and say, "Okay, now survive that "while we try you for something you didn't do." And that's how you survive Rikers. Oh, there were crimes committed that night, no doubt. Crime one, stood up by a friend with a car, a young man takes his father's cab without permission to go to a party in Manhattan. Crime two, a young woman buys some powerful illegal drugs. Crime three, on the banks of the Hudson River, under the George Washington Bridge, she gives him one of those illegal drugs, MDMA. Crime four, later at her house, she gives him another illegal drug, ketamine, which, with the Ecstasy, and enough tequila to topple a saguaro cactus, knocks him out like the horses vets give ketamine to. Crime five, upon discovering the body, instead of reporting it, he runs. Crime six, he makes an illegal left turn. Crime seven, he resists arrest. Those are the crimes committed by these two young people that night, and the only ones we have proof of. What we don't have proof of is who committed the crime he's been charged with. The prosecution has presented what it says is proof, but at the end of the day, it's circumstance and speculation. The rush to judgment against Nasir Khan began at the 21st Precinct at 4:45 a.m. the night of, and ended 10 seconds later when he was tackled to the floor. The police investigated no one else, not the stepfather who had a tempestuous relationship with the victim, even though the percentage of killers who know their victims is five times greater than that of strangers, and even though among the fraction of strangers who do commit murder. There were two individuals the couple had confrontations with that night. One with a history of battery, the other with multiple convictions for aggravated assault, every time using a knife from the victim's own home. The night Naz was arrested, he lost a lot. He lost his freedom to return home to his family, to his school, to his night job that helps pay for that school. But what he didn't lose, and what none of us can lose, were his Constitutional rights to an attorney, to a fair and impartial trial by you, his peers, and to the presumption of his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. (scoffs) We hear that term a lot. But what does it really mean, huh? What's its definition? It doesn't have one. It's what we think, and as much as what we think, what we feel. And what we feel and what you feel will determine what happens to the rest of this young man's life. Thank you. (whispers) Thank you. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chattering) ♪ ♪ (door opens) Nothing.
