 (electricity crackling, buzzing) 
 Anchorwoman :  The mayor and police commissioner met with religious and community leaders at the Al-Khoei Islamic Center. The Islamic Center was one of five places firebombed Sunday night. So far, the police are questioning a 40-year-old Jamaica, Queens man. He was taken into custody as he walked to a car with Virginia license plates. The police say he fit the description... 
 Stone :  Yeah. You know, and, uh, when you go to trial, right, it's like, uh... it's kind of like quantum physics. You know what I mean? You're controlling time and space. 
 Something that happened out of sequence... 
 You're trying to make it happen in real time, give it a certain kind of analysis. 
 (Saran Wrap crackles) 
 So you put criminals in jail? 
 No. 
 In fact, I, uh, kind of do the opposite. 
 I try to keep them out of jail. 
 Let's say your brother or your cousin gets arrested because he looks like someone who robbed a store, but it wasn't him. 
 Well, what if it was him? 
 He's still entitled to the best defense he can get. 
 And that's you? 
 (laughter) 
 My dad actually puts them away. He's a deputy inspector. 
 So was mine. 
 You can imagine how disappointed he was in me. 
 Would you defend Hitler? 
 In theory, it'd be my duty as an officer of the court. 
 He killed my great-grandparents. 
 You want to jump in here anytime soon? 
 No. This is great. 
 Great. 
 Yeah, Hitler. Uh... 
 It was just disrespectful. 
 You came in on a workday. You could've been making money. 
 It's no big deal. They're just kids. 
 They're assholes. 
 Well... 
 You could've worn shoes, though. 
 I'm afraid those days are gone. 
 (school bell rings) 
 (door buzzes) 
 (loud chattering) 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 (horns honking) 
 (Stone humming) 
 Hi. 
 (keys jingling, door opens) 
 Here. Come on. 
 She's withdrawn from the case. 
 She's assigned it to me and doesn't want anybody from the firm spending time on it, so I'm looking outside it for some help. 
 Fifty grand. 
 I'm authorized to spend no more than 20. 
 Then it's not gonna work. It goes to trial, it's, uh, two, three months of my life. It's not enough. 
 Last year, you billed for 60 grand, basically in $250 increments, 45 percent of which is uncollected. 
 That was for the year. This is for a month or two. 
 It's more than fair. 
 Two or three months, I said, not one or two. 
 And where's the money coming from? 
 I'm sure his parents don't have it. 
 They'll have to get it. 
 Beg, borrow, steal, whatever. 
 From who? 
 The risk we take. 
 No. The risk you take, because the only way I'll do this is if you pay me directly and in full. 
 What you get from them or don't get from them is your problem. 
 I'm paid. Are you authorized to do that? 
 If I am, you'll do it for 20? 
 Thirty-five. 
 Twenty-five. 
 Thirty. 
 Okay. 
 In writing. 
 Okay. 
 Weiss : Prints, blood, semen, witnesses. 
 So we have everything and they have nothing. 
 What do you do when you have nothing? 
 Plea. 
 They had their chance and didn't. 
 Go for insanity. 
 I wouldn't, neither will they. 
 Woman : Blame someone else. 
 Someone else had that knife in their pocket? 
 Man : Some violation of his rights. 
 There were none. 
 If it were me, I'd focus on one thing, the drugs. 
 She drugged him. He's not responsible. 
 That's no defense. They don't know who gave who what. 
 They'll try to find out. 
 What's ketamine? 
 Why? 
 It's what was in the vial he had in his pocket. 
 It's an anesthetic vets use on horses when they do surgery. 
 Why would anybody take that? 
 Why would Michael Jackson take propofol? Same reason. 
 He took it to sleep, didn't he? 
 Well, it worked for that. 
 You take ketamine because... before it knocks you out, you, you get a feeling, like... like, uh... like you just want to f*ck... I... 
 (chuckles) I don't... I don't know how to say this to you, Chandra. 
 An aphrodisiac? 
 There you go. That's the polite word for it. 
 Then it, what, knocks you out? 
 Yeah, like the horse, unless you mix it with coke, meth, whatever, take the edge off, so to speak. 
 We need to show it was hers, she gave it to him, and where she got it. 
 (Stone sighs) 
 How do you know all this drug stuff? 
 I'm a lawyer. 
 I heard you're putting in your papers. 
 Thirty-three years. Enough is enough. 
 What are you gonna do with yourself? 
 Easier to say what I'm not gonna do. 
 I'm not gonna spend more time with the family or open a bar or move to Florida and get a commercial fishing license. 
 So, what's left? Golf. 
 Can we talk about something else? 
 Lock in the kid's night for me, from point A to point B, from when he left his house to when he was picked up. 
 Fine. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (door chimes) 
 How are you? 
 Fine. 
 Coffee? 
 No. 
 We really need our cab back. 
 I know. Then you'll do it? 
 Do what? 
 File charges like the man said. 
 What? No. 
 Then what do we do? 
 Salim, he is facing life in prison. 
 What's a couple more years? I'd do it for you. 
 No, you wouldn't. 
 We are asking you out of respect. 
 You're respectfully asking me to charge my son with grand theft. 
 He took the cab. He didn't have your permission. 
 He didn't have our permission, and if they ask us at his trial, we will say he didn't because it's true. 
 My son is innocent. Innocent, guilty... 
 We don't have it, and we aren't getting it back. 
 Is that our fault? Did our son do something wrong? 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (door unlocks) 
 Tito : Get up. 
 Come with me. 
 (panting) 
 What the f*ck, Osama? This man burned your ass. 
 It's your turn. Get your shots in. 
 (grunts, groans) 
 Yeah, that's right. Walk with your bitch ass. 
 You're lucky. I was going for your face, you f*cking faggot. 
 Yeah. 
 (grunting) 
 (screams) 
 (Nasir grunting) 
 Okay, okay, don't kill him too. 
 Come on, man. 
 (grunting) Come on. Come on! 
 (whimpers, pants) 
 (coughing) 
 (dogs barking) 
 Well, you just made it. He's scheduled for 8 a.m. 
 It's a stay, not a pardon. 
 He may be back. 
 (meows) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Box (on video) :  You picked her up in the cab. Where? 
 Nasir : I don't know. Downtown somewhere. 
 I was lost. I don't know. ♪ ♪ Box :  Where'd she say she wanted to go? The beach. The what? The beach. Box :  The beach? ♪ ♪ (horn blares) (door opens, closes) (softly) Okay. Oh. Okay. There you go. (woman singing ballad in foreign language) (purring) (purring continues) (cat lapping) Better than the gas chamber. I'm going out! ♪ ♪ (metal clanging) Freddy : Look at you. A man is in ICU, and you here sleeping like a baby. You got some secrets in you, don't you? And some rage. I like it. This is where the guy stares at the ceiling and says, "That's never happened to me before," and the girl touches his arm and says, "It's okay. It happens." It's the medication I'm on. It's messing me up. I don't know what to do. (cat meows) You want a cat? No. Doctor : Like with all steroids, you pay a price. You gain weight, and your libido goes to hell. So it's raw, cracking skin or a stiff dick. That's your choice. What a world, as my grandmother used to say. Weiss :  What were you doing there? Walking down the street. What... What is with you people? Excuse me? I can't walk on the street below 110th? I'm asking where you were going. Why? Because they'll ask, and I'd like to know the answer before they ask. Well, I'm not answering that. Look, am I on trial? No. Did I kill that girl? No. I tried to protect her from that Arab. He's not Arab. Whatever. Okay? If they ask me why I was walking down a public street, minding my own business, I'm just gonna say, "What the f*ck are you asking me that for? That's where I was going." Thank you, Trevor. You've been enormously helpful. Why don't you go and take a cookie with you? Have a nice day. And the milk. (sighs) (clippers buzzing) (buzzing stops) Announcer (on TV) :  And for last couple of years, as we mentioned, he's developing a fan following to go along... Thanks, baby. Sinbad or Aladdin? Announcer :  And he paid a huge price for it, moving, bouncing, and making... Which one's which? Not them. Your tag. It's gonna be one or the other, right? (laughs) Sinbad. My preference, too. Announcer :  He hasn't been involved in one of those in a long time. Hey, yo, dude was my sparring partner, man. Couldn't go past four rounds. "El Tornado." (laughs) His sister was his cut man. You believe that? I mean, she was all right, though. Had a ass like a birthday cake. (laughter) Hmm... (Muzak playing over PA) So, it's come to this, huh? Hey, Millie, it's Saul. You guys have any Viagra? Viagra! Wow. Really? Okay. Thank you. John! They're out of it, everyone. Yeah. All right. Okay. Forget it. Must be the season of the witch. Hey, don't make any social plans until Wednesday! Wednesday! John, you forgot your prescription! (phone rings) Pharmacy. This is Saul. No, we don't. Okay. Thank you. Policeman (on video) :  All right, gents, subway time. Man :  What? Policeman: Either subway time or overtime. I could use the money. Is that 2nd Avenue? Yeah. Yeah. We're on 10th. Man 2 :  What? Where are we going? Nasir :  Thank you. Man 1 :  f*ck you. (car door closes) ♪ ♪ (rock music playing) What can I get you? I think I'll have some Special K. We don't have cereal. I'm not talking about cereal. This is an application for a search warrant. I could have it signed in 30 minutes. I'm supposed to believe you're a cop? No. But he is. Let's talk. About? Why she called you that night. Who? What night? Andrea. This isn't your number? Sit down, Cutty. What did she score? Score? Who do you think I am, Pablo Escobar? You see where I work. Mm-hmm. You know what? You want to toss my apartment, go ahead. What do I care? It's clean. I doubt that. It is. Nah. He'll find something. No, he won't. Yes, he will, even if he doesn't. You have trouble understanding that concept? What did she buy? (clears throat) "E." That's it? Yeah. Not "K"? Yeah, okay, that, too. Who gives a f*ck? She owe you money? I don't allow for that. How about you? You owe anybody money? Yeah. To my landlord. No one else? Your supplier? You can't be serious. And if you are, you can haul my ass out of here right now. I'm not gonna give you any f*cking names. You mistake my point. You owed somebody, that would make what she owed you important, wouldn't it? What are you saying? You saying I did it? One way or the other, you're gonna testify about the drugs, the money, and, while we're at it, where you were later that night. I want a lawyer. That's a good idea. Rolling Rock. Sure. How's it going? Don't touch anything. Not my first murder. (camera shutter clicking) ♪ ♪ You all right? Yeah. (camera shutter clicking) Where's the cat? I've got it. You want it? No. You've got her cat? You want it? I don't want it. Why'd you take it? Why? Is it evidence? ♪ ♪ (camera shutter clicks) ♪ ♪ 
 
 Chandra : Is he charging by the hour? Don't worry. We made a deal. You should take the cat. I don't want a cat. Too much responsibility? I don't know. Is it? It's killing me. I'm allergic. Got something. Could be squirrel blood, though. He's charging a flat fee, okay? Weiss : You're kidding me? Here it is. What do you think? I'd rather he saw her and swerved three lanes to pull over. No. This is better. He doesn't want two guys in the cab. He wants one girl. He kicks them out, not her. This is him making the decision. She's it. This is lying in wait. This is premeditation. (inhales sharply, exhales) (door opens) Hi, Helen. Oh, hi, Harry. When you have a minute? Now's good. What's up? The neighbor in the 87th Street thing said he heard glass break, looked out, saw a figure, who he can't describe, go in, then come out a minute later wearing a jacket and run to the taxi. Right, like he forgot it and had to go back inside. Yeah. So I'm thinking, okay, he broke the door pane, reached in to unlock the door. And is that... Is that how he got this cut on his hand or...? Set it down there. Do you see what I'm saying? I don't think I do. You're stabbing somebody with a knife. Sometimes it goes so deep, it hits bone, which causes your hand to slip onto the blade. But it only slips once, even though you stabbed her 22 times. How common would that be? How common would you like it to be? I'm asking, Harry, not telling. The question is, can it be determined if this wound resulted from cutting himself on a piece of broken glass or on the blade of a knife? Look at it really carefully. Hard to say. Well, what if you had to say? Will I have to say? Yeah. This cut was the result of his hand slipping from the handle of the knife onto the blade of the knife in the act of stabbing her. This cut was the result of his hand slipping from the handle of the knife onto the blade of the knife in the act of stabbing her. You convinced me. Thanks, Harry. You're gonna have s*x with a man and then call his wife and say, "Come and get him out of my bed"? That's messed up. That's messed up. First of all, you had no business in her bed... Yo, f*ck out the way. A nigga can't see. What'd you say? I ain't gonna say it again. Judge (on TV) :  ...letting him in your bed when you knew he had a wife at home. So now you call his wife up and say, "Come and get him out of my bed." And does she come? I didn't hear it because I'm at the mall. Man : What the f*ck? (TV continues indistinctly) Hold it. What? Nothing wrong with Ellen. f*ck you talking about? It's Freddy. Ellen :  And then you hear the alarm, and there's always that split second where you think, "Did I steal something?" sh1t. Think I do want to watch Ellen shake that ass today. Mind moving over a little bit, homey, please, rest of us could see? You could wheel out a full display case... Man :  Thank you. ...and no one would bat an eye. Nobody. But it's embarrassing 'cause you walk out of the store, the alarm goes off, and then you have to put that show on to make sure. You pat your pockets. (soft music plays) (door opens) These won't kill me, will they? Well, if you get an erection lasting more than five hours, call "The Guinness Book of Records." (door opens, closes) (loud chattering) Tito : He wants to see you. What's up, man? Come in. Have a seat. So how's the new job going? It's good. Thank you. That's what's up, man. Anytime. (man chuckles) Oh, this here is Petey. Petey's, um, he's been having some difficulties in here, so he spoke to his mom, and she reached out to me. I told her I would do what I could for him. She said she would do what she could for me. Well, "anything" was the word she actually used. So the next time she comes to visit him, she's gonna have a couple of eight-balls up her snatch. She gonna pass it off to Petey here. Petey gonna pass it to you, and you... Well, you know. I can't do that. Sure you can. I can't. What, a religious thing? No. I mean, I know I'm not gonna be able to keep it down. So... what am I supposed to do? I know you don't expect me to ask Petey, do you? Naz, come on. That's way too psychological. (man laughs) It'll be fine, man. You just need some practice. Hmm? Here. Take them. Yeah. (Muzak playing over PA) Hmm. (toy squeaks) (bells jangle) (cash register beeping) ♪ ♪ (bell jangling) (toy squeaks) (humming) Here goes nothing. (sighs) All right. Go get 'em, slugger. (cat toys jangling) I'm going out. I got a life, you know. You look good, baby. You are so much trouble, and I love trouble. Hey. Buy you a drink? Excuse us. What are you doing here? Buying you a drink. Joseph, champagne. Joseph : Coming up. Would you excuse us, please? Please? Huh? Come on. Excuse us, all right? Just... Come on. Beat it, huh? Get the f*ck out of here, all right? Johnny, I am working, obviously. I know. I know. I know it's weird. We don't do this, but this is a very special occasion. (chuckling) It's... It's special, okay? I am ready for you... thank you ...big time. It's not gonna be like the other night, okay? There's not gonna be a repeat of that. Hello, stranger. I've got to have... Excuse me. Oh, well, look who's back in town. He is, indeed. Excuse us. And you look good, baby. Oh. You look gorgeous. Baby, a sight for sore eyes. What you got here? Champagne? Now, here's to us. You think of everything. Here's to the good life. Just the two of us. Woman : You are so much trouble, and I love trouble. You're a lot of trouble... (mutters) God. God, help me. The dreaded tox reports. Alcohol, ketamine, MDMA in both, and amphetamine in him, not her. You're kidding. Nope. This has to be a mistake. Why? Because you don't like being lied to? I don't. Is there some way to determine what kind of amphetamine it is? What difference does it make? Speed is speed in court. Lies are lies. Why would he do that? Because we don't know him. (metal clanking) (sniffs) (coughing) f*ck. I wish you hadn't done that. What? Stone : Your skull. What do you think I'm talking about? The tox screens came in. So, what did she give me? Stone : What do you think? Ecstasy, coke. It was "K" in the vial, not coke. You know what that is, ketamine? Anything else you want to tell us? What do you mean? What you took that night. I didn't take anything. Dexedrine, Benzedrine, Adderall, meth, some, or all of the above. What was it? Nasir : I didn't take any of that. The screen is wrong, that's what you're saying? What does it say? I just told you, speed in you, not her. Well, what about my inhaler? That's steroids, not amphetamines, not anymore. That stopped before you were born. Nasir : Isn't there amphetamine in Ecstasy? What, are you a chemist now? How would you know that? I don't. I'm asking. You're lying. My guess is Adderall. What college kid doesn't take it? Am I right? You think that makes it okay? It's not. Let me explain to you why. One, without a prescription, it's illegal. Two, you weren't up studying. You were going to a party. Three, it counteracts the sedative effects of the "K," making your "I passed out" story less believable. It's not a story. Four, you take enough, it makes you psychotic. Five, you lied to me. So I'm gonna ask you because your life depends upon it: What else have you lied about? Nothing. Everything you say happened, happened? Yes. Stone : She got in the cab. You drove uptown. You stopped and bought beer because she asked you to. You went to the river where she gave you the "E," not the other way around. You drove to her place, had words with that guy on the street. You went inside... "Guys." You said "guy." There was two of them, him and another guy. They were together. Now, I don't know why you'd lie about that. But are you lying about that? Why would the guy lie about it? I don't know. Ask him. What did this other guy say or do? Nothing. He just stood there. (gags) I got to get back. Tito! Naz. Naz, I understand you have to do it, but if you're caught for this... the case is over, and you're never getting out of here. (Nasir breathing heavily, grunting) Ah! Ah! Yeah. You get it? C'est fini, m*therf*cker. Yo, there's four. I wish. No, there's f... I swallowed four. Petey? Four. So get it out of me, man. You get it out of you, m*therf*cker. (laughs) Naz, relax. It's cool. It'll come. Nasir : What the f*ck you looking at? What was the question, again? What time it was when you saw them, as you put it, "rubbing up against each other." I want to say 10, 11, something like that. You were alone? Yeah. (rewinding) I want to say 10, 11, something like that. You were alone? Yeah. He's lying. How's it going? John Stone. Hey, I recognize you. You're the guy from the subway ads. "No fee till you're free," right? That's me. Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. Hey, is that true? Not exactly, but my rates are reasonable. Yeah, well, that's a good one, man. That's a good slogan. Thank you. Here. You never know. Actually, you could, uh, use one now... a lawyer. (scoffs) What the f*ck I need a lawyer for? Keep you out of jail for perjury. What you talking about, man? That couple you saw on the street, you exchanged words with, something about "Mustafa, bombs," so on. All right, that's free speech. But you said you were alone, that's not all right. That's a legal problem there. I'd look into this problem for you, but I can't since I'm representing Mustafa. Trevor. Trevor. It is Trevor, am I right? I'm trying to help you here. Oh, you're trying to help me, with your f*cking rags and your gloves on, right? Seriously, who are you supposed to be, Michael Jackson or Mickey Mouse with those gloves? Don't worry about it. That's my problem. We need to talk about your problem. Hey, it's out of service. Who is he? Trevor, I know you were with someone. Hey, would you lower your voice, man? Okay? I don't know him. I don't know the dude. You don't know him, but you were walking down the street talking to him? I'm standing here talking to you, and I don't know you. You know my name because I told you. He didn't tell you his? Come on. Nope. Nope, nope. I don't believe you. What the f*ck do I care? I just told you why. Your false statement was used to get the indictment. That's five years and $10,000 in New York, no sh1t. Look, man, seriously, what is wrong with you to come down here and ask me to bang on a brother in front of all these people? They can't hear us. Yeah, but they can see us. Hey, if there's one thing I don't look like, it's a cop. Am I right? Yeah. You look like a f*cking homeless dude. There you go! Duane. Duane what? Don't know. You're gonna lie to me now? Lie to you? I don't even want to be f*cking near you, whatever the f*ck you got. It's not contagious. All right, so I'm all focused on him right now, this Duane... whatever the f*ck his last name is. But I could just as easily focus on you, where you went after you had this altercation outside a house two hours later is covered in blood. I went home. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. Trevor, after 9/11, two things happened. You started calling guys "Abdul Fazul," and Homeland Security started putting up cameras everywhere. You didn't go home. You afraid of him? Is that what's going on here? Why are you afraid of him? He's a violent guy, this Duane? Reade. Reade? Duane Reade? All right. I'll see you on the stand. What? Because you're a witness in the murder case or you're a suspect in the murder case. We'll see which it is. What? I mean, that's his name. What do you want from me? I didn't name him. It's a wild coincidence the pharmacy's there? I didn't put it there. Duane Reade, you're sticking with that? You're sure? Man, that's the truth. Fine. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Like what? I don't know. Blow my mind. Next month, my great grandmother will be 102. Wow. (thunder rumbles) Guess what. His name really is Duane Reade. There's a warrant out on him right now, and he's got a record: breaking and entering, burglary, agg assault, and always with a... guess. Chandra :  A knife? A knife. Chandra :  Where are you? Why? Chandra :  So I know you're not out there somewhere thinking about confronting him. Are you kidding me? I'm not crazy. I got to go. Hey, Que pasa? What's happening? Hello. (speaks Spanish) Where's my money? (speaking Spanish) Duane said that he would leave me the money. He didn't? I'm his lawyer. Look. See? Duane? Duane. Abogado? Yeah. Abogado. That's me. (speaking Spanish) Uh... (speaking Spanish) Duane Reade. (speaking Spanish) No, not the pharmacy, the guy. Where is he? (speaking Spanish) Yeah. Eh, that's my problem. Don't worry about it. Duane. Where is he? He's in the back. (speaking Spanish) Okay. (speaking Spanish) Keep the card. (speaking Spanish) You never know. You never know. There you go. (mutters in Spanish) (Spanish music plays) Hey, guys. How's it going? Hey, Duane. I was wondering if I could talk to you about your boy Trevor. Who are you? I'm his lawyer. Thanks.
