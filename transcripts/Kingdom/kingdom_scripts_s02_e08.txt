 Hit me, m*therf*cker! 
 Stop, stop, stop! 
 We're done, we're done. 
 It's okay. We're done. 
 That's it. Fight's over. 
 I saw everything! 
 I know about all your little boyfriends, all the texts. 
 And the random hookups. You're a f*cking homo. 
 You can't tell anyone. 
 I'll be home late. 
 You doing a double? 
 As usual. 
 What do you need? 
 A couple grams. 
 I have cash. 
 Your money's no good here. 
 You living in your car? 
 I'm just in between places right now. 
 It ain't safe. 
 We got a couple of beds here. I'll give you a key. 
 It doesn't take long to spot a talent. 
 So you got a boyfriend? 
 No. 
 I've had some sponsors asking about her. 
 They wanna see her fight. 
 We could do something here. 
 She gets the pressure of a fight. The sponsors see how she is. 
 You do look good in that dress. 
 So now you're talking to me. 
 I'm sorry about this D.U.I. thing. 
 He's not necessary, you know. You'll always be taken care of. 
 I'll see you in the morning, okay? 
 I won't be here. 
 Hi, you've reached Sean Chapas at Rancho Vista Group. 
 Leave a detailed message and I'll call you back. 
 You got $30,000 of my money, m*therf*cker. 
 You better call me back. 
 Alvey : Half of me's a criminal, and the other half... Just hasn't gotten caught. 
 I'm tired. I'm out of blood. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm gonna f*ck this up. 
 That's who I am. 
 I could stop drinking, yeah... 
 Confront myself, my demons. 
 But at some point, me and everybody else has to realize I can't get a f*cking brain transplant. 
 Maybe it's my fault. 
 Maybe I led some people to believe that I was gonna change. 
 I'm not. 
 I can't. 
 I won't. 
 Dr. Kramer : How are things with you and Lisa? 
 She's had enough. 
 Moved out a couple weeks ago. 
 Is this a permanent move? 
 I don't know. 
 We barely talked about it. 
 I'm okay with being alone. 
 Truth of the matter is no matter how many people you surround yourself with... Your friends, your family, your children... 
 In the end, they all pull the f*cking cord. 
 You die alone. 
 Not my creation, doc. 
 I just live by the rules that were laid out for me. 
 Who laid out these rules? 
 God. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Zeus. 
 My parents... I don't know. 
 Neanderthals... who the f*ck knows where it started? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 The f*cking elderly. 
 That's... That's another thing. 
 I made a f*cking investment with a friend of mine. 
 Now he's disappeared with my money. 
 Guys like me don't get rich. 
 We get by with bloody f*cking knuckles. 
 I should have f*cking known better. 
 I should have known better. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hi, this is Lisa Prince. 
 I'm a patient of Dr. Bennett's. 
 I was wondering if I could come in today. 
 I'm having some cramps. 
 No, just cramps. 
 Yeah, that would be perfect. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, see you then. 
 [Distant, indistinct conversation] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Permission to enter, ma'am. 
 Mm? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Good morning. 
 Thank you. 
 Cheers. 
 Fight day. 
 How you feeling? 
 f*cking nervous. 
 Yeah. 
 Back's all jacked. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, I tweaked it yesterday. 
 It's just been locking up on me the whole time. 
 Maybe you should go see Mac, no? 
 Look, I don't take painkillers. 
 Well, maybe that's why you're in f*cking pain. 
 Mm? 
 Put this down. 
 Head there. 
 Right here. 
 [Groans] 
 Now, where is this bad boy? 
 [Groans] Through the top of my back. 
 Top of the back. 
 Left, right? 
 Right of the spine. 
 You got it. 
 Let me see. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, right there. 
 Who's this girl you're fighting? 
 Some chick from Black House. 
 Brandy Harris. 
 Kickboxer... Supposed to be good. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Just breathe, mamacita, just breathe. 
 You got to get relaxed. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Your back is fine. I think it's just tension. 
 [Groans] 
 When was your last fight? 
 Like seven months ago. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I was destroying this chick. 
 Mm. 
 And she caught me in a triangle. 
 She put my ass to sleep. 
 That's very embarrassing. 
 I'm just kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. 
 Does this feel a little bit better? 
 Are we sparring? 
 Or are you guys in the middle of something? 
 [Sighs] 
 Mm. [Chuckles] 
 All right, I'm gonna see you in the cage, man. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, boy! 
 Ugh! 
 Now eat the sh1t out of that. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't get like that. 
 Get like what? I didn't say anything. 
 I'm gonna go change. 
 Come on. 
 Can I come? 
 Come on. I'm fighting tonight. 
 It's just an exhibition fight. 
 Yeah, well, not for me. 
 You can wait till afterwards. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Bring your left back. 
 Man : Morning, coach. 
 Come up five feet. 
 Nice. 
 My man. 
 [Knocks] 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Mail's piling up at the house. 
 [Sighs] Thank you. 
 We all set for tonight? 
 Yeah, I talked to Kenny over at Black House. 
 All the insurance is signed, which is amazing. 
 They're gonna be here at 6:00. 
 We're gonna start at 7:00. 
 Alicia's up last. 
 I want it to be all about her tonight. 
 How's she doing? 
 She's nervous. 
 A lot of sponsors are coming, so it's a big deal for her. 
 Well, I'll get her ready. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, I went to see my guy again this morning. 
 Oh, yeah? How'd that go? 
 Good. Yeah, really good. 
 Maybe we could start doing it together. 
 I think you should focus on yourself right now. 
 You need anything else at the house, just let me know. 
 Thank you. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Nate? 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Nate. 
 Nate : What? 
 Can I come in? 
 Come in. 
 It's 11:15. 
 You gonna sleep all day? 
 I might. 
 What time did you get home? 
 I don't know... A couple hours ago. 
 Maybe you should stay in tonight. 
 Why? 
 'Cause you've been out every night this week. 
 So have you. 
 I've been working. 
 What have  you been doing? 
 I've been out. 
 I don't have anything coming up. 
 I'm not training. 
 Why does it matter if I sleep in all day? 
 Nate. 
 Maybe this is a chance for you to find something else you're interested in. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Alvey : Side to side, side to side. 
 Good. Good, Jay, good. 
 Get inside the pocket. Throw your hands. 
 There you go. 
 Double that jab. Double the jab. 
 Now you're reaching, man. 
 Jab, jab, jab, jab, jab. 
 Come on, set it up, set it up. 
 Set it up with the jab. 
 f*ck. You all right? 
 Ryan : Yeah, yeah. 
 Ah, ah, ah! Come here, come here. 
 One second... no, I'm good. 
 f*ck! 
 No, come here. 
 No, it's a good one, bro. 
 Alvey : Where'd you get it? Rib? 
 No, no. Knocked the wind out of me a little bit. 
 Come here, come here, come here, come here. 
 Ryan : It's fine, coach. 
 Breathe deep. 
 Huh? 
 Breathe. 
 [Inhales] 
 Hold up your arms. 
 Breathe. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what? That's it. That's good, that's good. 
 Coach, I'm good. 
 No, it's good, it's good. 
 You guys worked hard. 
 It's good. Call it a day. 
 Just put some ice on there. 
 Yep. 
 Jay. 
 Sorry. 
 Jay, come over here. 
 It was a mistake. 
 It was good. 
 No, it was good work. It was good. 
 How's your brother doing? 
 You know, he's a little f*cking embarrassed that you stopped the fight. 
 He was getting the sh1t beat out of him. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You gonna come tonight? 
 Come tonight, all right? There's gonna be sponsors there. 
 It'll be good for you to meet these people. 
 Just behave yourself. Don't f*ck up. 
 I don't want to get sued. 
 That sounds like a... Hell of an invitation, Alvey. 
 Alvey : Try to get your brother to come. 
 Please. 
 And then you'll go on around 9:00. 
 Alvey will corner you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Is that sponsor gonna be there? 
 Drew? Absolutely. 
 He's really excited about you. 
 Yeah, till I sh1t the bed. f*ck. 
 Tonight can only help you. 
 This is a non-sanctioned fight, so even if you lose, which you won't, it's not gonna go on your record. 
 [Chuckles] 
 A loss is a loss. 
 Then don't f*cking lose. 
 What if I do? 
 Then we take you out back and we put a bullet in your head. 
 sh1t's not funny. 
 Look, I really like being here. 
 I really do, and I don't want you guys to lose interest in me. 
 That's not how we work here. 
 What if I'm not as good as you thought I was? 
 Then it's on us to work harder and get you where you need to be. 
 Now go find Alvey. He's around here somewhere. 
 He'll take you through your day. 
 He's good at it. 
 Whole f*cking night, man. 
 Whole f*cking night to showcase Alicia. 
 Meanwhile, I got a real f*cking fight going on. 
 You... we both do. 
 But... 
 Here we are in a f*cking sauna 'cause Alvey's out there f*cking coaching her. 
 I wouldn't worry about it. 
 She hasn't put a f*cking nickel anybody's pocket. 
 I have. 
 Yeah, you've also taken a few. 
 Talent management, bro. 
 Alvey's never figured that sh1t out. 
 f*cking prioritize. 
 So, what do you... What do you want him to do? 
 You want him to be sitting outside here watching us take the sauna? 
 Mm? You needy little bitch. 
 Okay, first of all, that's a stupid thing to say. 
 Makes no f*cking sense. 
 Second of all, yes, I am a needy f*cking bitch, and as such, I should be handled accordingly. 
 You know... I could use a day off. 
 f*ck yeah, dude, I need a f*cking vacation. 
 I want to go to Cuba, you know? 
 Mm. 
 Before they start building a bunch of hotels and sh1t everywhere. 
 Why don't you want the Cubans to have hotels, Wheeler? 
 It's commercial, man, you know, no charm. 
 Plastic. 
 Where you gonna stay if they don't have hotels? 
 I don't know. Find a family, dude. 
 Locals, you know, they take you in. 
 It's the authentica experience. 
 Well, I have a pool that looks an awful lot like f*cking Cuba. 
 We could go there. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 We could call Mac. 
 Oh, boy. 
 He would be tickled to f*cking here from us. 
 Blow it out one last time before Garo starts to test. 
 Before? See? 
 You're f*cking learning, dude. 
 Thank you. 
 Very clever. 
 Thanks. 
 I feel better already. 
 We're gonna have a nice little f*cking Saturday. 
 Indeed we are. 
 A nice little Saturday. 
 Double jab, right hand. 
 Again... Double jab, right hand. 
 Good. Move. Moving, moving. 
 Moving, moving. 
 One, two, spinning elbow. 
 [Grunting] 
 Again. 
 Nice. 
 Ah, f*ck! 
 What? What? Back? 
 Ugh! 
 Did you tweak your back? 
 Yeah, it's like a spasm or something. 
 Shake it out. 
 Shake it out. Shake it out. 
 Shake it out, shake it out, breathe. 
 f*ck. 
 Show's at 10:00. 
 Are you injured? 
 I don't know, I just... 
 You want to stop? 
 No, come on. 
 Where are you two ladies going? 
 Jay : Punching out for the day, coach. 
 We'll be back tonight. 
 Big show. 
 You all right? 
 I'm good. 
 Okay, you got to relax your shoulders. 
 Move, move. We're moving. 
 We're breathing. Relax. Keep your shoulders relaxed, right? 
 Keep your shoulder... you're holding all your tension in your shoulders. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Whimpering] 
 Wake up, sleepy head. 
 We're having a party. 
 What, right now? 
 Right f*cking now. 
 I mean, I imagine guests are arriving as I speak. 
 Indeed. 
 Why don't you power up, pal? 
 Get some fluids in there. 
 Ah! 
 Upsy-Daisy. 
 That's my f*cking brother, dude. 
 Toss on these shorts. 
 And then, later, when we're cooked to f*cking perfection, we can go see the Black House fights, to which your presence has been personally requested. 
 [Smacks lips] 
 I know you're pissed. 
 He shouldn't have stopped that f*cking fight, Jay. 
 I wasn't there, so I can't really f*cking say what was right or not, right? 
 You weren't there. 
 I was there, and I can tell you that he stopped it 'cause he never wanted me in it in the first place. 
 Yeah, but, you know, you were in bad shape. 
 f*ck that. You weren't there. 
 I know, but you came home... 
 No, f*ck that, Jay. 
 You weren't f*cking there. 
 You don't know 'cause you weren't there. 
 Okay? I wasn't done. 
 He stopped the f*cking fight 'cause he had to be right... 
 'Cause he always has to be f*cking right. 
 f*cking now I got like two losses, you know? 
 What the f*ck am I gonna do, Jay? 
 I don't know. 
 f*cking that. 
 f*cking that is what you're gonna do. 
 You're gonna f*cking take a nice pull from that bottle, and then we're gonna go outside, and we're gonna get your mind right off the f*cking thing. 
 If that's possible, you know, which I know is a f*cking big ask from the young philosopher king himself. 
 But we can make attempts. 
 What do you say? Tick-tock. 
 [Indistinct conversations, laughter] 
 Mac : What a beautiful day. 
 No, no, no. Jesus, what are you doing? 
 That is way too big. 
 Mac. 
 Come on. 
 This is America, damn it. 
 Last time I f*cking checked, huh? 
 No, no, no. 
 You cut lines like a Frenchman, Mac. 
 That is a gentleman's cut. 
 Yeah? 
 Which you are not. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Hey, Keith! 
 You m*therf*cker, look how beautiful you look, huh? 
 Welcome to Havana. 
 You look so cool. 
 Let me take a f*cking look at you, dude. 
 Look at this guy. You look tremendous. 
 Look at you. 
 I'm gonna do a little touch up in a minute. 
 Loving the f*cking look, huh? 
 Thanks. 
 You're welcome. 
 The ice and the beer... 
 Hey, come right in this tub over here. 
 I'm on f*cking diet all this week. 
 I will not be partaking, but you guys get f*cking nuts, huh? 
 You look like an action figure. 
 Thank you, Keith. I appreciate it. 
 Damn right he does. 
 Hey, pal. 
 Welcome. 
 Who the f*ck are these guys behind you? 
 Not a goddamn clue. 
 I think they're friends of Rina apparently. 
 Huh. 
 Yeah. 
 Who's Rina? 
 Uh, I think the one right over there next to Mac. 
 Step into my office. No pens, no papers. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the man of the hour! 
 The champion of the world... Ryan Wheeler! 
 [Applause] Make a hole, make room. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Mac, Mr. Mac. 
 What are we having? 
 Mr. Wheeler, cocaine from the cocaine plant. 
 Beautiful. I'd love to try that. 
 I'll take two. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 From the finest stash. 
 I'll have a couple. Thanks. 
 There we go. 
 This service is excellent. 
 That's how we do it. [Sniffs] 
 He's like a f*cking vacuum cleaner. 
 Hey, oh. 
 Hey, hey. Love it. 
 There are other people.

 She's resting up. 
 I'm gonna work with her in about an hour. 
 Joe said something's f*cked up with her back. 
 What's going on? 
 It's in her f*cking head. 
 Is this an appointment you made already? 
 No, I was, um, having cramps, so I just... They're gonna fit me in. 
 Are you worried? 
 I don't know. 
 They didn't seem concerned, so I'm... 
 This is f*cking stupid. Let me just take you, okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Lisa, I'll wait in the f*cking car. 
 Just let me take you to the doctor.

 Ryan : Nice enough. 
 Hey, Ryan, thanks for bringing me. 
 I'm serious. 
 You could have just left me at home, but... 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 You know, 'cause I've been such a drag lately. 
 Hey, Keith, you are not a drag, my man. 
 Well... 
 Well, I just... I'm just glad I'm here. 
 [latin music playing] 
 Yeah, man! 
 f*ck yeah, man. Come here. 
 Come here, big man. 
 How we doing, huh? 
 Where you been? Where you been? 
 Chilling. 
 Killer Keith. 
 Hey, Nate. 
 I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for your loss... 
 That you lost. 
 Hey, pour him a drink, man. 
 Sorry. 
 Well, that didn't take long, Jay. 
 s*x, weights, and protein shakes, young man. 
 Whoo! 
 Ryan : Shot, boom. 
 What about you, man? What's up? 
 You, uh, taking some time off? 
 Yeah, had to see what's good. 
 You know, I'm not really sure what my options are right now. 
 That's good. Hey. 
 Take it easy, man. 
 Look at me. 
 Give the body a rest, okay? 
 That's right. 
 Sláinte. 
 Hey, uh, Nate. 
 I believe your guests have arrived. 
 Your guests, sir. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Um, Jay called me. 
 I'm supposed to cheer you up. 
 Guess you haven't told anyone yet. 
 Casey... 
 Listen, can we just go talk? 
 Yes, please. Let's head this way. 
 I don't know what you want me to say. 
 I want you to be f*cking honest with me. 
 Casey : Tell me you're gay. 
 Nate, look at me and say it. 
 I'm not doing this. 
 You're gay. You like men. You are gay. Just say the f*cking words. 
 Why are you being such a f*cking bitch right now? 
 Look, I'm gonna make this really simple for you. 
 If you're f*cking guys, you're f*cking gay. 
 How many guys have you been with? 
 Does it matter? 
 Yes. 
 I don't know... Three maybe. 
 Well, were they random guys or people you knew, or what? 
 I don't even remember their f*cking names. 
 So, it just turns you on and gets you off or whatever. 
 Sometimes, yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Clears throat] 
 I told a friend. 
 What? Who? 
 No one... she doesn't even know who the f*ck you are. 
 I just... I had to talk to someone about it. 
 She live in Anaheim. 
 In f*cking Anaheim? 
 Wh-what the f*ck does that matter? 
 Casey, do you understand if someone thinks I'm a f*cking fag, then I'm done? 
 Okay, no promoter's gonna touch me, no f*cking gym's gonna let me train. 
 Your dad owns a f*cking gym. Who the f*ck cares? 
 My dad owns a f*cking gym. 
 You think he's gonna kick you out? 
 Come on. 
 You really don't know what I'm going through. 
 At all. 
 Please. 
 I'm not gonna say anything. 
 You should. 
 Did you get any rest, or are you just staring at the f*cking wall? 
 I... I was just... 
 What's up? 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Where are we going? 
 To get some fresh air... We'll go for a walk. 
 I'll see you outside. 
 All right. 
 I'll put my shoes on. 
 
 
 
 I lived out of my car for a while... about a year. 
 East New York, Brooklyn. 
 Middle of the winter... I froze my nuts off. 
 It's half the reason I drove out here. 
 It looks like it worked out. 
 Yeah. 
 What about you? 
 Where do you see yourself in the next five years? 
 Five years? Who the f*ck knows? 
 Yeah, you're right. That's a bullshit question. 
 I think my accountant asked me that question. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Why do you it then? Why do you fight? 
 Money, I guess. 
 No. 
 Come on, there's easier ways. 
 Look, I don't have a philosophical reason behind it. 
 I just... I don't like asking for sh1t, and I do not like to rely on people. 
 I like to be on my own. 
 Is that good enough? 
 Why do you do it? 
 'Cause I like to hurt people... Punish them. 
 I want to break the guy in front of me. 
 I want to f*cking steal his soul. 
 Make him question every day of his life. 
 Now, why I do that? 
 That's a much longer walk. 
 Ryan, stop. 
 What? 
 Ryan, stop. 
 Ryan, stop! 
 What the f*ck are you doing, man? 
 What are you doing? 
 Those guys. 
 What? 
 Ryan, those guys are recording you on their phone. 
 Hey, get that f*cking phone! 
 [latin music playing] 
 Who the f*ck are you guys? 
 We're friends of Rina. 
 Who the f*ck is Rina? 
 Her on the raft. 
 Who the f*ck are you pointing at? 
 These gentlemen were just shooting some video me, Mac. 
 Huh? 
 We didn't record anything. 
 Let me see the phone. 
 Ryan, we're just fans. 
 What's that? 
 We're just fans, bro. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Yeah. 
 Can I just see the phone? 
 Let me just see it. 
 Wow. 
 A lot of f*cking photos here. 
 Really commemorating the festivities this afternoon. 
 Look at that. 
 Here's what's gonna happen. 
 I'm going to delete all these. 
 And then you gentlemen can leave. 
 Excellent. Here you go. 
 [Splash] 
 Have a nice day. 
 f*ck. 
 Get the f*ck out. 
 Will you please f*ck off? 
 There you go. 
 And, Rina, babe, I think this would probably be the best time for you to depart, as well. 
 Good f*cking eyes, boy. 
 Thanks for looking out, Keith. Thank you, brother. 
 Dr. Bennett : You can sit up. 
 What did you see? 
 You may have a partial placental abruption... 
 A very small area where the placenta has detached. 
 It's not uncommon, and it's probably why you've had the cramping. 
 But I'm a bit more concerned that the baby's measuring large. 
 Well, what does that mean? 
 Probably nothing, but I want you to see a specialist so we can rule out any chromosomal disorders. 
 Her name is Dr. Simon. She's a perinatologist. 
 Depending on what she sees, she may talk to you about doing an amnio. 
 [Monitor beeps] 
 Okay, so, um... 
 When do I do this or what do I do? 
 I'll give her a call, and she can hopefully see you today. 
 I can't today. 
 It's no good. I have to get back to the gym. 
 Lisa. 
 You want to do this sooner rather than later. 
 f*ck. 
 This is my gift to you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Mac : Jay! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Everyone's getting hungry, man. 
 You mean... you mean, you're getting hungry, man? 
 Uh, dude, do you think your mom will hook us up with Patty Palace? 
 I'll go. 
 Go for it. 
 Okay. 
 Look, uh, I think I'm too drunk to go, and I don't feel comfortable asking your mom for free food. 
 How about you go? 
 Hmm. 
 Get out of here. 
 [Clears throat] 
 It's my day off. 
 I'm gonna have a cheeseburger. 
 Write down your orders, Mac. 
 Yes, yes! We're getting burgers! 
 [Shuddering] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Register running] 
 Welcome to Patty Palace. 
 Thank you. 
 Jamal. 
 You are, um... you are a lot cooler than... 
 You... your hair is f*cking tremendous. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm looking for Christina. 
 Who? 
 Christina is my mom. 
 Uh, she don't work here. 
 Yeah, um, pretty white lady, nice brown hair. 
 I know who you're talking about, but she quit. 
 She quit? 
 Lost her sh1t and left. 
 Hey, let her know we need that uniform back. 
 [Indistinct conversations, laughter] 
 Hey, where's the food? 
 Uh, party's over. Yeah. 
 Get everyone to get their stuff and get out. 
 It's over. 
 What's up, man? 
 Dude, I can't. I can't. 
 I just need everybody out of the house. 
 Can you help me out? 
 All right, everybody get the f*ck out. 
 Pick up your sh1t, and let's go. Everybody out. 
 Yeah, Nate. 
 Can you not be here tonight? 
 Why? 
 Because I'm gonna take care of mom. 
 So why don't you go to that fight or wh... 
 Whatever it is that you do at night, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I love you, dude. 
 You too. 
 Christina : Hello. 
 Anybody home? 
 Jay : I'm back here. 
 Jay. 
 Can you come sit down, please? 
 What are you doing? 
 Can you just come sit, please. 
 I spoke to Jamal today. 
 He'd like that uniform back. 
 I was gonna tell you. I just wanted to wait until... 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. 
 I know you love me. 
 I believe that. 
 I just think we don't understand each other right now. 
 But... 
 But that's gonna change tonight. 
 I-I'm going to be able to feel what you feel. 
 And, mom, you can feel what I feel. 
 Okay? 
 Now. 
 I've... 
 I've put a, uh... A needle in my arm before, but never heroin. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I'm a little scared. 
 [Groans] 
 Please, just sit. Mom, this is good. 
 This is good. This is good. Just sit. 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Groans] 
 [Sniffles] 
 We're both gonna see some things tonight. 
 Watch me, and just remember what you see. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Crying] 
 You guys, quiet down real quick, real quick. 
 I want to thank coach Kenny Johnson, Black House MMA for coming tonight. 
 [Applause] 
 A few things before we get started. 
 There is no prize money obviously, and this will not go on your records. 
 You all signed a waiver, so any damage that you inflict or is done to you is on your own. 
 As agreed, Joe Daddy is gonna be officiating. 
 [Applause] 
 Yeah. 
 Three five-minute rounds. 
 Amateurs must wear headgear. 
 Pros, you do whatever the hell you want to do. 
 There are no decisions, so you must finish. 
 Coach Kenny, you want to say anything? 
 Let's fight hard, be safe, and have a good time. 
 Yeah, have fun. 
 Welcome to Navy St. 
 [Applause] 
 Alvey. 
 Yeah? 
 Drew Parker from Slaughter Water. 
 Ah, Drew, man, thanks for coming down. 
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely. 
 Excited to see Alicia tonight. 
 Yeah, she looks good. 
 Is she around? 
 She's... she's in the back getting ready. 
 Just hang tough until she's finished. 
 Of course, no worries. 
 Good. 
 Oh, actually, somebody I do want you to meet also. 
 You know this guy. 
 Legend. 
 Ryan. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Say hello to Drew Parker from Slaughter Water. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Lisa said you guys had a meeting. 
 She said you did a great piece about your father. 
 I can't wait to see it. 
 Yeah. 
 He's coming to my fight. You want to take pictures? 
 I can get him to smile for you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I don't think that'll be necessary. 
 Let me know. It'll be nice. 
 Okay, um, where is Lisa? 
 Oh, actually she, uh... 
 Where's Lisa? 
 She had an appointment. 
 She's pregnant, but she'll be here in a little bit. 
 That's fine. I'll be here. 
 Good seeing you, huh? 
 Thank you so much, Drew. 
 Take care. 
 Are you f*cking drunk? 
 It's my day off. I had a couple. 
 This guy is money, okay? Don't f*ck it up. 
 This is really f*cking impressive. 
 This is all for Alicia? 
 I'm sorry, did you want to spar? 
 [Chuckles] 
 No, I didn't think so. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Just an observation. 
 Right. 
 Let's rock and roll. 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Sniffles] 
 I'm not feeling it. 
 What does that mean? 
 I don't want to do this. 
 What did you say? You don't want to do this? 
 What? 
 I can't find it. 
 Well, you better f*cking find it. 
 You're not wasting my time. 
 Ryan and Jay... Those are fighters. 
 I took time away from them to train you. 
 Lisa is doing this for you. 
 This ain't even a real fight, sweetheart. 
 You can't f*cking find it? 
 I'm trying. 
 Bullshit. 
 Bullshit. 
 Not good enough, not here. 
 Look at me. 
 You're talented. 
 We believe in you, okay? There are sponsors here. 
 You tell me you f*cking fight for money. 
 Go... Go f*cking get it! 
 You want a lifestyle other than living in your car? 
 Go f*cking knock the sh1t out of this girl. 
 Show me! 
 Have your little f*cking meltdown later. 
 You understand? 
 Do your job. 
 Or find another gym.

 [Chanting "Navy St."] 
 [Jay retching] 
 [Labored breathing] 
 Take one of my cards. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And we will be in touch. 
 Okay? 
 Mm. 
 Beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm. 
 Guy's a f*cking scumbag. 
 Really? He seems nice. 
 He's a douchebag. 
 Are you waiting for me or something? 
 Yeah, great fight. 
 You smoked that girl. 
 Thank you. 
 So, what do you want to do? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, you want to stay here or go to my place? 
 What? 
 Nothing, I just, uh... 
 I think we should take it... 
 Easy for a little while. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 I just... It's kind of awkward, man. 
 And I don't want to piss off Alvey and Lisa. 
 We can do whatever the f*ck we want. 
 Look, honestly, I don't want drama. 
 Well, okay, that's kind of f*cked up, since you were the one that came to me. 
 Really, dude? 
 Look, I like hanging out with you. 
 [Laughs] 
 Okay, let's just keep it chill. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Whatever you want. 
 All right, I'll see you. 
 I got you.
