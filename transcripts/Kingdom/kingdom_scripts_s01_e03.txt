 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 Christina : I loved college. [Chuckles] 
 I went for a year in Northridge. 
 I was gonna major in graphic art, but then I found out that you only end up designing pharmaceutical pamphlets, so then I switched to art history. 
 I'm actually a pretty good artist. 
 I mean, not good enough to really, like, do it, but I still sketch. 
 Like, even ugly things can be pretty in ways. 
 Then I had a kid, so I dropped out. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Man : What's the password?! 
 Open the door, asshole. Come on. 
 What's up, fellas? 
 Man : Not bad. 
 Hey. 
 Wow, you guys are really cute. 
 Skinner : Dude, how old is she? 
 This is who he had. It'll be fine. 
 She's not even dressed up or anything. 
 I got an outfit. 
 Are you Skinner? 
 Yeah, but... 
 We got you for all of us. 
 Okay. 
 Let me just get changed, and we'll have some fun.

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Vacuum running] 
 Carl : Point is, rats can be f*cking anywhere. 
 [Thud] 
 Downtown, Boyle Heights, f*cking Palisades... they don't give a sh1t. 
 [Coughs] 
 [Chuckles] And that's great for me. 
 'Cause I'm building a goddamn empire on rats. 
 See what I'm saying? 
 You got to find a spot and fit in. 
 Do the sh1t nobody wants to do. 
 You see, I saw a need and I filled it. 
 That's being an entrepreneur, being a boss. 
 Goddamn, boy. You hearing me? 
 I'm trying to give you a motherfucking road map. 
 Oh, you're an inspiration, Carl. 
 You're giving me goose bumps. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Door closes] 
 Ah. 
 Okay. 
 You just keep on staring at that ass that you ain't never gonna get. 
 sh1t, boy, you may be white, but you still a felon. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, Shelby. 
 Morning. 
 Alvey's in his office. He screwed up his knee. 
 What'd he do? 
 I think he was doing dead lifts or something. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Dead lifts? At your age? 
 I'm fine. I just tweaked it. 
 Have you thought about, I don't know, water aerobics? 
 Maybe a brisk walk. 
 [Chuckles] So funny. 
 Give me it. 
 By the way, there was blood all over my canvas this morning. 
 Yeah, Josephina called in sick today. 
 Well, then Josephina's got to find somebody to cover for her. 
 Or get Taylor or one of these other jerk-offs who owes fees to do it. 
 You got to get somebody to do this. 
 You can't leave me with blood on this canvas. 
 [Chuckles] I'll get into it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Is Ryan working out today? 
 No, he texted me. 
 He's stuck at some bullshit job. 
 I got to figure out how to handle him, too. 
 I got to... I got to protect him. 
 Okay, well, it's your thing. 
 What do you want to do? 
 I think I want to close down the gym while he's training. 
 No, Alvey. 
 A couple of hours. 
 You're killing me. 
 A couple of hours. 
 Yeah, that's a couple of hours that we're not making money. 
 I know, babe, but I got to manage this. 
 Okay? He hasn't been in a cage in five years. 
 He's hesitant. 
 He's got a lot of f*cking eyes on him. You know? 
 He's scared. 
 I need him to open up, shake off the ring rust. 
 Not to mention the P.R. of it all. 
 I mean, I can't have anybody, you know, saying Ryan Wheeler's washed up, he's no good, he sucks, he's finished. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 I, uh, got to take this. 
 All right, two hours. 
 Bye. 
 No more. 
 Yep. 
 Thank you. 
 Two hours, I'm serious. 
 Nice jeans. 
 Jay : I am bushed. 
 There was a tranny in there who would not shut up. 
 Oh. 
 I mean, what a chatterbox. 
 Good stories, but Jesus. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Are you a f*cking maniac? 
 Attacking a cop? 
 I mean, really, you're gonna fight a detective? 
 What is wrong with you? 
 I didn't attack or fight anybody, okay? 
 You've got to knock this sh1t off, Jay. 
 Don't make me feel bad, Lisa. Come on. 
 [Scoffs] 
 All right? 
 I haven't slept for a f*cking night, I'm tired, I got to take a colossal sh1t. 
 I'm not in the mood. 
 I'm not making you feel any way, Jay. 
 You do this sh1t to yourself. 
 You've seen the scar on my brother's head. 
 I'm just asking you to calm the f*ck down a little bit. 
 You're right. 
 You're right. You're right. 
 Don't f*cking placate me, m*therf*cker. 
 No, I'm... I'm... Lisa, I'm not. 
 I'm saying, seriously, you're f*cking right. 
 Sometimes I can't help myself, Lisa. 
 I'm an emotional man. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Did you tell my dad about this? 
 f*ck no. 
 I actually like having you around the gym. 
 Thanks for picking me up. 
 Where to? 
 Home. I got to shower. 
 Also, I'm working the door at Tanya's this week, so you can come by for some free drinks. 
 I might just take you up on that. 
 Yeah. 
 Seat belt. 
 f*cking asshole. 
 Tatiana : So, other than the knee, we're looking at a separated shoulder, a cracked clavicle, and neck and back strain, right? 
 That's it. 
 How much pain are you in? 
 Pick a face. 
 Really? 
 Um... The light green one. 
 Number two. 
 Mild is a goal. It's not a starting point. 
 You should be at least a purple. 
 No, he looks like he's about to die. 
 I... I don't feel that bad. 
 Maybe you've just gotten used to a certain level of pain. 
 [Clears throat] Maybe. 
 You can feel so much better than this. 
 You just have to learn to listen to your body. 
 How long until I can start fighting? 
 Look at you, already missing the point. 
 No, I... [Sighs] 
 I'm ju... you know, t-there's just, like, a lot of beads and Buddhas and sh1t in here, and I-I'm not looking to meditate. 
 What's wrong with meditation? 
 Nothing. It's great. 
 I'm not judging. 
 Yeah, you are. You'll see. 
 Okay, so, before we get started, are there any other injuries that I should know about? 
 Yeah, um, three cracked ribs on this side, two on my right, uh, cracked orbital, um, broken collarbone, a couple concussions, ripped my left a.C.L. 
 Uh, it's fine now, though. It's been a while. 
 And, uh, I keep spraining my ankle, but it's just 'cause of how I run. 
 Oh, man. You're f*cked. 
 Alvey : Then what? Where do they go? 
 Like, to a mass grave? 
 Well, I think they burn 'em. 
 There's, like, a way they got to do it. 
 Do you do that? You burn rats? 
 No, I don't do it. 
 What a gig. 
 Yeah, it's f*cking miserable. 
 But, you know, I got to have a job. 
 So I have no choice. 
 You got a job, dude. You're a fighter. 
 This isn't your job. 
 My parole officer put me in this, and I'm there all day, so... 
 What's your parole officer's name? 
 Dantzler. 
 Dantzler. 
 All right, I'm gonna talk to Dantzler. 
 I'll get you squared away. 
 Okay. 
 In the meantime, do you need anything else? 
 You okay in here? 
 Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 This is f*cking temporary. [Chuckles] 
 You know that, right? 
 We'll get you back in the cage. 
 This is a f*cking blip. 
 Eyes up. Eyes up. 
 Always. 
 Good. 
 [Breathes deeply]

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Hey, man, I'm... 
 I'm looking for someone? 
 I got a black chick. 
 No. 
 You f*cking racist? 
 [Chuckles] Uh, no. 
 I'm looking for someone specific. 
 Um, her name's Christina. 
 She's a little older, dark hair, pretty. 
 Yeah, she's good. 
 But she's expensive. 
 Worth it, though. 
 She'll make you blow a load through the f*cking ceiling, man. 
 How much? 
 $300. 
 She's upstairs, second floor. 
 Room 8. 
 What's your name? 
 Terry. 
 Terry. I'll remember that. 
 Thanks, Terry. 
 [Muffled rap music playing] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 [Knocks on door] 
 [Gasps] 
 No! Jay, no! Stop. 
 No, Jay, what are you doing?! 
 Shh! It's okay. 
 Terry has a gun! 
 I know, ma. I paid him for the hour. 
 I paid Terry, okay, for an hour. 
 All right? 
 Ma? Mom? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffles, crying] 
 Mom. 
 Hey. 
 What are you... how am I supposed to work after this? 
 Oh, I'm crying. Nobody wants a crying girl. 
 They're gonna bitch at Terry, and then he's gonna bitch me out... 
 D-don't tell me that. 
 What do you think I'm doing down here in this sh1t hole? 
 Whoa, what do you think I'm doing down here? 
 I'm trying to talk to you, mom. 
 You don't want to talk to me. 
 You want to give me a little money and give me a hot meal because mom's a whore, and it's so f*cking sad. 
 Hey! S-stop, mom. Stop. Okay? 
 Hear me. 
 I'm your son, and I love you. 
 I don't care what you're doing right now or what you've done. 
 I love you. 
 I got this phone for you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I'm programmed in it, under number one. 
 So you call me any time you want. 
 Okay? My phone number is programmed. 
 You just press one and call. 
 I got you. 
 Jay... 
 Your jacket. 
 No, you can have it. 
 [Sniffling] 
 Keith : Don't stare at the bear. 
 Sorry, bro. 
 Do you bring him everywhere? 
 He's a gift from my mother. 
 The only time I didn't have him was when I was locked up. 
 Your mother come to visit you much here? 
 No, she's dead. 
 Oh, sh1t, man. I'm sorry. 
 When did she pass? 
 A couple weeks after she gave me the bear. 
 I was almost 10. 
 She was the best. 
 She was the smartest person I've ever met. 
 And she was only 32, so she was still very pretty. 
 I don't mean pretty because she's my mom, but pretty like if you saw her, you'd think, "that's a pretty lady." 
 Yeah. 
 Pretty young, man. Was she ill? 
 No, she was fine. 
 [Spits] 
 My dad killed her with a hammer when she was asleep, then shot himself in the backyard. 
 [Spits] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I'm gonna go to the kitchen and get some yogurt. 
 If I find some, do you want some? 
 Uh, no. I'm great, thanks. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Hey. Mark Dantzler. 
 How you doing? 
 How you doing? 
 Alvey Kulina. 
 [Chuckling] How you doing? 
 They restocked the nutter butters today, and I... I got to sweep in there like a hawk and clean the whole machine out. 
 I think you got all of them. 
 Yeah, it's greedy as sh1t, isn't it? 
 Of course you got that vascular look. 
 You probably don't touch these things. 
 Nah, not really. 
 They're good, though. I like 'em. 
 Yeah, they're good. 
 So, uh... You're here for... 
 Ryan Wheeler. 
 Yeah. 
 How can I help you? 
 Well, he's an old friend. 
 Uh, I mean, he's more like family, actually. 
 And we're just really proud of the progress that the kid's been making. 
 Well, his piss is clean, and he's got a good attitude. 
 Yeah, so I'm thinking it's time for him to take the next step. 
 To what? 
 I want to give him a job. 
 Well, he's already got a job. 
 He's killing rats. 
 I think I can do something better for him. 
 What kind of business you in? 
 I own a gym, MMA. 
 I train professionals like Ryan. 
 [Sighs] 
 Doesn't sound like the best environment for a violent offender. 
 Well, it's, uh... 
 It's a little different than you're thinking. 
 He's an athlete in the... in the prime of his career. 
 You know, why you want to take that from him? 
 Well... 
 I'll take him, just, you know... 
 I-I-I-I'll pay him to be a coach so he meets his employment obligations, but more importantly, I'm gonna give him structure and discipline. 
 And the way we run our gym, it's... it's a family. 
 This kid will be surrounded by love. 
 I get it. 
 Yeah. 
 You're selling. You're selling. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I see the veins popping in your neck. 
 [Chuckling] Yeah. 
 Appreciate the, uh...The passion. 
 Uh-huh. 
 But, um... 
 Wasn't he... 
 In a gym, surrounded by a family, when, uh, he brutally assaulted his father? 
 That's a good question. 
 I mean, but, you know, that was a long time ago. 
 This... he was lost. 
 This... this kid was lost back then. 
 And he wasn't with me. 
 [Sighs] 
 I like him at Rat Reapers. 
 He's gonna stay there. 
 It humbles him. 
 Some of these guys, you got to cut their balls off. 
 Huh. 
 Man :  In the sweeping wilderness of yellowstone, the grizzly once ruled alone. 
 [ Bears roaring ] 
 [Water gurgling] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Whoa! 
 [Coughing] 
 [Laughter] 
 [Gagging, spitting] 
 Unmatched in size and strength, no creature could challenge the mighty bears. 
 It's hard to find people for this job, man. 
 Can't do it. 
 It's backbreaking work, you know? 
 I mean, probably find some Mexicans to do it, but then you got documentation issues. 
 So, what, Dantzler just funnels you ex-cons? 
 [Chuckles] It ain't like they got choices. 
 What's in it for Dantzler? 
 You know, me and Dantzler really got nothing to do with me and you. 
 So, why don't you tell me what you need, and maybe we can work something out. 
 Dantzler don't need to know. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 What I need is for you to pick up Ryan every morning like he's doing his shift, you bring him to my gym, right? 
 End of the day, you pick him up, take him home. 
 It's a carpool. It's f*cking nothing. 
 Well, it's not nothing. I'll be down a guy. 
 How much you want? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 5 grand. 
 Oh, come on, playboy. 
 You got to give me a better number than that. 
 Well, I mean, there ain't a better number. 
 It's $5k. 
 Jesus. 
 It's $5k, or we're done. 
 Hey. 
 Lisa : Hey. 
 How we doing? 
 We're are f*cking flush. 
 For real? 
 Yeah. You know what? 
 You can just take this whole pile and go get us a boat and some jet skis. 
 Wise ass. 
 I'm thinking maybe we need a new canvas for the cage. 
 We don't need a new canvas for the cage. 
 I'm thinking we need a new canvas for the cage. 
 We can't afford a new canvas for the cage. 
 Honey, no. 
 Wanda, I need the money. 
 How much do you need? 
 What do you think you can get? 
 I can do $4,000. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 You're big in Japan. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm f*cking tiny here. 
 Well, this was a legendary tournament. 
 I know a Japanese collector, he's gonna buy it sight unseen. 
 Good. 
 Let me get your cash. Thank you. 
 Big in Japan. 
 [Knocks on door, door opens] 
 Terry : Jesus, get dressed, Chrissy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Where we going tonight? 
 The Marriott hotel, West Covina. 
 That rodeo... all the guys is down there. 
 Should be a good night. 
 Mnh. 
 Bring some extra rubbers. Cowboys love to f*ck. 
 All right. [Smooches] 
 I'll be waiting in the car. 
 Okay. 
 [Camera dings] 
 What happened to your leg? 
 I hurt it training. 
 [Groans] 
 And don't say anything smart. 
 How about you? How's the rehab going? 
 It's good. 
 Yeah? You like your P.T.? 
 Yeah, she seems all right. 
 Mnh. 
 She? 
 What's... what's her name? 
 Tatiana. 
 Come on. That's her real name? 
 Is Tatiana a hooker? 
 [Chuckles] 
 How'd you get hooker from that na... I... 
 You can get a hooker from anything, son. 
 Doesn't matter, as long as she's taking care of you. 
 I need you healthy and training as soon as possible. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 How's the camera? 
 The camera's a piece of sh1t. 
 I can get a better image on my phone. 
 We should just use that. 
 We're not using your phone, because your phone is a pubic hair away from the Internet, and I can't have that video leaking. 
 Use the camera. 
 Camera it is. 
 Carl : Wheeler. Get out. 
 
 
 
 [Hip-hop music playing] 
 Rat Reapers. 
 What are we doing? 
 I got a locker set up for you. 
 Go get changed. 
 No, no, no. 
 Dantzler's gonna write me up, man. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Dantzler is taken care of, my friend. 
 Now go get changed, and let's get ready to crank some nuts. 
 Where you going? 
 Lisa : You said you wanted the gym closed. 
 Not you. 
 No, Alvey. I'm not mad. 
 I just... I don't need to be around for this. 
 Am I gonna see you later? 
 Eventually. 
 I'm gonna see you later. 
 [Metal clanging] 
 [Belt clinking] 
 [Tape ripping] 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 [Exhaling sharply] 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 [Grunts] 
 Wake up. 
 Come on, move your head. 
 Come on, move your head. Move your head. 
 Watch my foot. Yep. 
 Come on. Come... come on. 
 It's not there. 
 [Both grunting] 
 Ryan, make me post down. 
 Where's your head? Where's your head? 
 Where's your f*cking... heads up! 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 Breathe. Relax. 
 Relax. Relax. What's there? 
 Ryan : Man. 
 What's there? 
 [Air horn blows] 
 Good. Good. Good. Good. 
 Good. Good. 
 f*ck! 
 Shut it off. 
 Ryan : I'm f*cking exhausted, man! 
 I got no flexibility, I got no flow at all, man. 
 You got f*cking training wheels on me, and I still can't even keep up. 
 Oh, come on, man. 
 You've been away from the game for four years. 
 Bullshit! Bullshit, Alvey. 
 You're f*cking worried, too. 
 You think I don't notice why the gym is empty? 
 [Sighs] 
 You don't even want Nate to film me, I f*cking suck so much. 
 Trust the process. 
 It's a waste of time. 
 Trust the process. 
 It's a waste of time! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Laughs] 
 Dude, I don't f*cking have it anymore, man. 
 This is all you got. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Snorts] 
 This is all you got. 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 We got a long way to go. Come on! Come on! 
 [Grunts] 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on. 
 f*ck! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 f*ck. 
 Jay : You know what? You should make a drink that's an ice cube of nitrous oxide underneath a fried egg. 
 Mmhmm. 
 You just gently lay the egg ever so... hey. 
 [Howls] 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, now it's happy hour. 
 Look at that! Why are you here so early? 
 Oh, we closed the gym so that your dad could train with Ryan. 
 And I thought I'd throw some booze down my throat. 
 [Moaning] 
 Get off me, you weirdo. 
 Boy, look at you. You got that look, Lisa. 
 What look? 
 You know that look. 
 I don't have a look. 
 The "fun time, party time" Lisa. 
 Sit down! 
 We're drinking! 
 Yes, we are. 
 [Upper-class accent] Barwoman, get this lady a drink, please. 
 [Normal voice] Drinks are on me. 
 Put 'em on the tab. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Hear, hear. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Mm. 
 How about you make up one of those drinks I was telling you about? 
 How about you stand by the f*cking door? You're working. 
 Yeah, that's where I'm going. 
 Pfft! I'm doing it. I'm out of here. Look. 
 You keep drinking. 
 I'll do that. 
 And I'll be back... 
 M'kay. 
 At my leisure, mama bear. 
 Thank you, mama. 
 Tanya : Of course, sweetie. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Rock music plays] 
 Red bull. Vodka. Ice. Tab. 
 Smile. 
 Excuse me? 
 You should smile. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Smile. Yeah, you're right. 
 [Sighs] I had a sh1t day today. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And like an idiot, I come to the bar and start drinking. 
 But, really, all I should've done was smile. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, my God, you're right. 
 Right? 
 [Chuckles] Smiling is the best. 
 You know, you should write a book and call it "smiling: A guide to making bitches happy." 
 Well, you're definitely a bitch. 
 Can I give you some advice? 
 You are a pretty girl. 
 You should talk less. 
 Ow! sh1t! Son of a bitch! 
 [Grunts] 
 Are you f*cking kidding me right now? 
 Oh, whoa. Get the f*ck out, boy. 
 [Groaning] 
 Are you f*cking kidding me right now? 
 Aah! 
 Get the f*ck out of here. Get the f*ck out of here. 
 We'll hit it again tomorrow, all right? 
 You're exactly where you're supposed to be. 
 I'll be better tomorrow. 
 Maybe. Maybe you'll be worse. 
 Let go of perfection. Trust the process. 
 Trust your coach, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 I, me, Lisa, will get you a fight. 
 No, you, Lisa, cannot. 
 Yes, I can, you fucker. 
 Do you know what a tragedy it is that you're not fighting? 
 I mean, you're a bouncer? 
 In this sh1t box... no offense, Tanya. 
 Tanya : Uh-huh. 
 That's like Picasso painting f*cking murals on the side of a kindergarten. 
 Jay, you're really good. 
 You're as good as anybody in the gym. 
 You're just kind of an idiot. 
 Yeah. 
 That is a f*cking very valid point. 
 So stop doing idiot things. 
 Alvey's not wrong, Lisa. 
 Nobody wants to put me on a f*cking card. 
 I've pissed off a ton of promoters. 
 Do you want to fight? 
 f*ck. Yes. I do. 
 Fine. 
 Then, if I get you a fight and put my ass out on the line, you're not gonna leave me or not show up? 
 I swear. On my mother. 
 I'm not just gonna show up, but I will murder any m*therf*cker you put in front of me. 
 Deal. 
 You f*cking little hustler. 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's very sexy. 
 Thank you. 
 Very attractive. 
 I see why my father makes love to you every night after supper. 
 Is he not gonna be wondering where you are? 
 Yes. 
 Are you just f*cking with him because of Ryan? 
 I wouldn't let Ryan anywhere f*cking near you. 
 I think it's bat-shit crazy he's at the gym. 
 But this is just, you know, me, a man, saying this right f*cking now... you don't let the wolf through the front door. 
 I mean, sh1t, Lisa. 
 He pretends like he doesn't want to fight. 
 Then why is he back at the f*cking gym? 
 [Muffled conversation] 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Lisa : Alvey, I don't have the keys. I'm so sorry. 
 Jay : Ding, dong. 
 It's really terrible. 
 Got a delivery, a nubile young woman for a virile, much older man? 
 [Chuckling] He's not nice. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 He's very virile. 
 Come on. How much has she had to drink? 
 She's had exactly, whoa, that much to drink. 
 Why didn't you f*cking call me? 
 Hey, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry I didn't call you. 
 You're driving her to drink, man. 
 You should put a bucket by your bed. 
 Thanks for taking her home. Be careful. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sleep tight. 
 All right. Come on. 
 Hi. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, look. 
 Look, you want some water? 
 No, f*ck water. 
 No, f*ck water. 
 f*ck water. 
 Let's go to bed. 
 No. 
 Come on. 
 He's right. 
 What? 
 You're driving me to drink. 
 I know, baby. I'm a shithead, okay? 
 No. 
 I am. I'm a shithead. 
 See, you can't just run over what I'm saying. 
 Um, like, you got to listen to me. 
 Okay, but can we talk in the morning? 
 No. 
 If you really were listening to me, then Ryan wouldn't f*cking be here. 
 Ow! [Chuckles] Hey, girl. 
 [Laughs] 
 He wouldn't be here, and you would hear me. 
 All right, let's not. Let's... tomorrow, I promise you we'll talk about Ryan tomorrow, okay? 
 Come on, baby. You're drunk. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 I want to have s*x. 
 What? 
 I want to have s*x. 
 [Chuckling] No, you don't want to have s*x. 
 No, you don't want to have s*x. 
 Yeah, no, it'll be real nice. 
 On the couch? 
 [Chuckling] Yeah, on the couch. 
 Come here. Come here. 
 You come here. 
 No, Alvey, no, no. Please, I'm gonna throw up. 
 You need... you need some sleep. 
 Sleep. 
 This is not good. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 No. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Keith, get up. 
 It's breakfast time. Sound good? 
 No, I'm not hungry today. 
 Bullshit, man. I'm hungry. 
 If I'm hungry, you're f*cking ravenous. 
 Not today. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 You're scared of Michael. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I just don't want to deal with him today. 
 Here's the deal, man. 
 If you don't stand up to these guys, they're never gonna leave you alone. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 It's actually pretty simple. 
 Next time they mess with you, even a just a little bit, you got to hit 'em. 
 Right on the jaw. 
 [Air hisses] 
 But then they'll hit back, so... 
 Not if you hit 'em hard enough. 
 Look, you got... you got... look at these... fists like a honey-baked ham, man. 
 Honey-baked ham fists. 
 You got to let 'em feel your power, then they'll back off. 
 You ever punched anybody before? 
 Like, in the face? 
 Yeah, like punch somebody. 
 No, not... no, not in the face I've punched. 
 [Sighs] Okay, get up, I'll show you. 
 Come on, get up. 
 Come on. 
 I'm gonna show you how to stand up for yourself. 
 All right. 
 Now, curl your fingers like this, all right, into a fist. 
 Yeah, like that. 
 All right. 
 Now, you want to hit him with these two knuckles, all right? 
 These two hurt them, the bottom two hurt you. 
 You don't want that. 
 These two hurt them, these two hurt me. 
 Exactly. Now get your hands up. 
 Just like that. Nice. 
 Bend your knees a little bit. 
 Yeah, no, like an athlete. 
 Like an athlete, come on, sturdy. 
 Yeah. Up. Nice. 
 Okay, now, if you want to hit me in the face, you got to imagine that the target is like a foot behind me and you got to punch through my face to hit that target. You understand? 
 Yeah, got... okay, I got it. 
 Okay, go ahead and hit me. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 No, I don't want to, though. 
 Keith, Keith, come on, look. 
 I get punched in the face for a living. 
 This is not gonna hurt me. 
 Right through it. Come on. 
 No, but it's not Michael. It's you. 
 Okay, you got to get past this, Keith. 
 You got to be willing to throw. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hit me. Hit me. 
 No. It might hurt. 
 Hit me, you fat f*cking pussy. 
 Come on, you deserved that shit-water bath. 
 W-what? 
 [Mockingly] What? What? 
 What, you bring it on yourself, Keith. 
 You're a f*cking weird dude. 
 I'm not a weird fu... 
 [Mumbles mockingly] 
 That's not how I talk! 
 [Mumbling continues] 
 Dude, I will lock you in this room and shut the lights off. 
 Oh, you'd probably like that. 
 Then you can play with your gay little f*cking Teddy bear, right? 
 Whacking your little f*cking piss pump... ohh. [Breathing heavily] 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's... that's a great start! 
 That's great! 
 But next time, use your fist. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay? Not this, okay? 
 Look at that. What do we do next time? 
 To... oh, make the ham fist, then just... 
 Boom! But, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Save it. That's a good start. 
 Let's get some breakfast. 
 I'm sorry that I went there with the bear, but I was just trying to prove a point. 
 It's cool. He doesn't give a f*ck. 
 I thought so. 
 [Blender whirring] 
 [Whirring stops] 
 It's f*cking blended. 
 What time did you get home? 
 I don't know, dude. 
 Lisa and I, we got after it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm sure dad appreciated that. 
 Yeah. 
 You want the rest? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Here. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Come here. 
 What? 
 Come over here, Nate. 
 [Sniffing] Wait a second. 
 Oh, boy. 
 You smell exquisite. What is this? 
 I'm, like, walking through a woods right now. 
 I'm getting, like, a... a Christmas cone. 
 Sort of smell like a, uh... 
 [Sniffs deeply] 
 Like a yummy little vanilla. 
 Yeah, it's soap. I took a shower. 
 Soap? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Where you going? 
 I got physical therapy. 
 [Groans] 
 You got a little crush? 
 [Sniffing] 
 All right, I'm out of here. 
 Hey, stop. Let me just... stop. 
 No need to fight. Let me just get one more whiff. 
 Don't fight. 
 [Groans] Oh, Jesus. 
 [Groaning] 
 You're an idiot. 
 Ugh. 
 See you later. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Feel better. 
 Have a great day, Nate. 
 [Groans] 
 [People grunting] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm sorry about last night. 
 You were wasted. 
 [Sighs] 
 Haven't seen you like that in a long time. 
 I think it's just gonna take me a minute to get used to having Ryan here. 
 Me, too. 
 I'm a f*cking bully. I'm a bulldozer. 
 But I hear you. 
 Okay? I do. 
 Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 I love you. 
 I don't exist without you. 
 You know that. 
 This place, it's me and you. 
 Alvey, I can't clean this up. 
 I mean, I feel like you're creating this emotional and professional cluster f*ck that I can't untangle. 
 Ryan f*cks up one time, he's out, he's gone. 
 We move on. Case closed. 
 I promise you that. 
 Okay. 
 You were f*cking Janis Joplin last night, okay? 
 [Laughs] Ow! Never. 
 You're a little bit filthy when you're drunk. 
 I was. 
 [Chuckles] It's not funny. 
 Come here. 
 I notice that you're always gentle. 
 Come here, you little lush. 
 [Chuckles] Don't make me laugh. 
 Oh, yeah. There it is. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, where'd your pride trophy go? 
 Oh, the... the, uh... 
 The guy on top broke, so I'm having it fixed. 
 [Bell dings] 
 [Chuckles] 
 You ever seen that? 
 Jay : Yeah, I have. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The only magic trick I know. 
 I'm glad you called me, ma. 
 I wanted to apologize for the other night. 
 I felt cornered, a-and you're my baby. 
 I didn't want you to see me like that. 
 I-I-I-I'm not always like that. 
 There are whole parts of my day that have nothing to do with any of that. 
 I don't see you then, mom. 
 I know. 
 [Sighs] 
 H-how's Nate doing? 
 You know, he's doing good. 
 He's getting better. 
 That's good. That's good. 
 He's so sweet. 
 [Chuckles] 
 He never even really cried when he was a baby. 
 Your dad thought he was autistic. 
 But you, on the other hand, would scream bloody murder for, like, insane amounts of time. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
 You just wanted to be picked up. 
 I'd hold you and walk around, and you'd be fine. 
 Mnh, I used to walk with you on the promenade, and people would stop and ask if you were a gerber baby. 
 [Chuckling] Total strangers. 
 [Terry laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, guys. What are we doing? 
 Christina : We're just talking, Terry. 
 She's not on the clock, so... 
 Why don't you leave her alone? 
 She's always on the clock. 
 See, my girls wear this big f*cking neon sign that says "open all the time." 
 Hmm? 
 I mean, um, I mean, they'll f*ck you at your convenience, but you do have to pay. 
 Jay! 
 Take your f*cking hands off of her. 
 Jay! 
 You have no idea what I can do to you. 
 [Sighs] 
 And you have no idea what I can do to her. 
 Jay, please, let him go. It's okay. 
 There are people here. Please. 
 Jay. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Is this your kid or something? 
 Hmm? 
 Ohh. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Snaps fingers] 
 Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of her. 
 I mean, your mom is a f*cking thoroughbred, man.
