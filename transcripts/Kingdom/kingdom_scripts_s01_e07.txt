 ♪ Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ Seems like this guy, Michael, is a real dickhead. I knew a guy like him in ROTC. He'd find the runt in the group and then just hassle the sh1t out of him till he broke. Hmm. Well, obviously he can't stay at this facility any longer. Thank you. [Sighs] You don't see any way of making this work, Ryan? No, sir. I... I don't. I've been checking in with Carl. He says you're doing good. He loves you. You got momentum. I hate to rock the boat here. Well, the problem, Mr. Dantzler, is that Michael had a lot of friends at the house. At some point, they're gonna come after me, and I just don't want to be put in a position where I have to defend myself, 'cause I will. [Sighs] So the idea, then, is he moves in with you? Well, I think it's better than moving him to another facility. And, uh, he's proven himself, so maybe it's time for that next step, you know. [Sighs] I gonna have a hard time finding a bed on short notice, and who knows how he's even gonna mesh with a new group. [Sighs] If I do this, you understand you're bound by the same rules. Urine test, mandatory employment at Rat Reapers, and all that. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. All right, we'll give it a go. Hang tight. We got some paperwork and sh1t we need to fill out. [Drill grinds] Oh, sh1t. What happened? Hey, is it stripped? Yeah. Let me see. What does that mean? They're stuck? [Drill whirs] Why don't we just leave them up? Thought the world was full of nihilists. I don't know where you got that idea, but these are ugly and I want them gone. No, we'll take care of it, mom. We'll get them down. Not if the screws are stripped. Jay : No, we'll figure it out. No, it has to happen today, Jay. You promised. Fine. Hey, mom, we're taking them off. Damn it, you can't get them off, Jay. I don't know how you're gonna do it. We're gonna figure it out, mom. Hey. You can't! You can't do it! [Indistinct conversations] Keep your hands up. Garo. There's the queen bee. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. I didn't know you were coming back. [Smooches] Where is everyone? Alvey and Ryan are on a training run. Around here? No, Topanga. Or maybe Solstice Canyon. Or maybe none of your f*cking business. Listen, can I talk to you just for a second, please? Please, please? Of course. Give me something. Just give me something. How's Ryan doing? Ryan's fine. Everything's under control. Says you. I have a card I have to promote, okay. I'm doing a press event in a couple of days. I want Alvey and him to be there. You know, I get it. I completely understand. [Sighs] Man, I tell you, it's like spinning plates all the time. Nothing ever works out, you know. I do. First, they change my venue. f*cking nightmare. Then I get a call last night. One of my fighters... he cut his hands doing the dishes. The dishes... so he says. Severed a nerve. He's out. Which is another thing I have to talk to Alvey about. I need a 155'er. You have anybody who's ready to go? Like, how's Nate doing? Nate's out still. Yeah, of course, of course. But Jay's available. Alvey never mentioned that. You know how they are. I'm handling him. Can I talk to him? Yeah, I'll set it up. Thank you. Mm-hmm. See you soon. [Knocks on door] Alvey: You all set? Yeah, I think so. That's it? One box? Yeah, plus those. "Keith." You're taking his sh1t, too? Yeah. I don't know what else to do with it. f*cking leave it here. No. They'll throw it away. Let his family claim it. He doesn't have any family. He doesn't have any family? He doesn't have any family. All right, let's load it up. [Sighs] Hey. [Sighs] Nate must think I'm nuts. No. He's worried about you. So am I. Don't be. [Sniffles] Mom. I'm an emotional person, as you may have noticed. And now that I'm clean, my moods are dialed up to, like, 11. There's gonna be some crying. Yeah, maybe the crying is good for you. It is. I know what you did for me. Mom. No one's ever cared enough about me to do that. You could have easily have left me, like everyone else. But I didn't. And you're here now. I am. And I want those bars off the window. Them I'm-a rip those bars off with my f*cking teeth, okay? [Laughs] They're coming off. [Sniffles] Let's do something. Yeah. Like what? I don't know. Um... Oh! Let's go shopping. Shopping? Let's buy some clothes. I want to burn all this sh1t. Okay. Get some stuff for this house so it won't be so bleak. Mom, this house is not bleak. It's bleak. It's a very inspiring home. We need some pretty. Mom, I don't have a lot of money. You have a little, and I have a little. We'll find stuff. Come on... you, me, and Nate. You guys can take off jumping jacks for one day for your mother. Oh, jumping jacks? Yes, mom. Mama wants a brand-new bag, mama's getting a shopping spree, okay? [Claps] Come on. Hey! Get your asses off the couch. I told you sweaty bastards. You're sleeping on the man's b... look what you did. Animals. We'll clean it up. We'll put some sheets down. It'll be just like it was. Ryan : Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hey. Oh, here's sheets and blankets and a pillow. Look at this. Hi. Hi. [Smooches] Um, if you need anything, just let us know. No, this is... no, this looks great. Yeah, I mean, we'll make this your home until we can figure out what the hell to do with you. [Chuckles] All right? This is more than enough. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, well, what do you want to do? You want to train? I mean, where's your head? Yeah. Yeah? You sure? Yeah, let's hit it. Yeah. Let's bang it out. Let's go put your gear on. How's he seem? [Whistles] Strange. I don't know. He's carrying around Keith the Ripper's boxes. They were friends. I understand. Alvey. [Sighs] Garo stopped by. What'd he want? He wants to promote his fight. He wants you to call him. [Muffled] Okay. f*cking life. All right, I will. Have you talked to her yet? No. I doubt I will. She's probably gonna float away. Watch. I know this woman. You should. You've been married to her for 26 years. That's a great pillow. Nate, I'm rethinking everything, the whole wardrobe. No more t-shirts... ever. I'm suits from now on. I don't care if it's 100 f*cking degrees out. And I listen to vinyl. Look at this, huh? Hmm? Taking a peek? The only blemish. Perfect condition. That's a terrible suit. You're gonna get used to it. What are you doing, huh? You're looking at plates? Stop. There's a whole store here, Nate. Christina : What do you think? Wow. It's great. I love it. Not too shabby, huh? Yeah, it's really nice. I'll take what I can get. I love this suit. Oh. Aww. Thanks. Did you find something? Nah, I'm good. No, you have to. You got to buy something. I don't... I don't like wearing other people's clothes. We're gonna wash them. Go. You have to find something. We're not leaving here till you do. Maybe some plates. There's some plates right over there. You come here. I want to show you more. [Rock music playing] Alvey : Come on, move, move. Angle out. Angle out and hit. Angle out and hit. You're squared up. Come on. Lead punch. Snap your jab. Snap your jab. Back to your chin. What are you doing with that right hand? Good, good. Come on, come on. Hands up. Hands up! What'd I tell you? On the cheekbone. Good! Body. Don't leave those punches out there. Good, good, good. Nice! Break his body. Hands up, hands up. Hands up. Get your hands up. What are you doing? Angle out. Get off the cage. Get your arms up. Get off the cage. Cover up. Come on. Work the body, Joe. Work the body. 10 seconds left. What are you doing? Turn the music off. That's great. [Music stops] Come on, that's it, Joe. Come over here. Come here. Come over here. What the f*ck was that? Ryan : What? Come on, what was that? What are you doing? Joe's a f*cking good fighter. That's what it is. Oh, he's a f*cking great fighter. I'm talking about you. What are you doing? He's a good fighter. I know he's a good fighter. What are you doing? Get out. I'm still working. Mnh-mnh. I'm still working, man. Let him go. Get out. No, I'm not done training! You're done. Take a break. No, I'm not. I said, "take a break." I'm training right now. I don't want a f*cking break. I want another round. I said, "take a break"! Put another round up! You're f*cking done for the day. Get out of my cage. Get out. I don't know what the f*ck you're doing, man. Come on. Waste a f*cking day. Jacob : Oh, please, you've got to be kidding me. [Scoffs] Hello, Nate? Hey. It's Jacob. Oh, my God, blast from the past. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. How are you? I'm good, thanks. I'm good, too. Thanks for asking. [Scoffs] Jay : Hey, Nate. We're on the move. Let's go. It was good seeing you anyways. Who was that guy? Nate : Just some dude from high school. Hipsters, huh? Stealing clothes from the poor. [Tires screech, horn honking] [Gasps] Aah! Damn it. You almost hit her. Get in the f*cking car! I'm trying! Get in the f*cking car. Hey, hey, Nate. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's an accident. Nobody got hurt, right? You okay? Why don't you get in? There you go. You're all right. You don't need to honk the horn that long, you know. It's grating. You just [Smooches] tap it. A little bit goes a long way, right? You okay? Everybody's all right. Everybody's okay. Come on, mom. Let's go. We're going home. Come on. All right. So, you push in the code, and it's disarmed. You push in the code again and then hit "stay." It's armed. Got it? Got it. Okay. What was the... what's the code? Uh, 0-5-2-9. May 29th. Oh. What was May 29th? Okay, so, um, Alvey had this pet ocelot named Kima back in his 20s. Before we were born. Right. [Chuckles] Yeah, so, you know, uh, that's the day she was born. Or maybe that's the day that she was put down because she ate a $2,000 parrot. Oh. sh1t. Yeah. That'll do it. Mm. Yet he's never forgotten her. Huh. Alvey : Forgotten who? Kima. I was just giving him the code. Oh, my girl, Kima. f*cking ocelots, man. Never have a pet ocelot. Pain in the ass. I wasn't planning on it. [Chuckles] So, you gonna be okay here? Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah? You sure? Yeah, lock me up, wake me up when it's time to train. Okay. I'm not locking you in. I'll give you a key. Yeah. Here. Yeah. You ready? Yeah. All right. Go at it. All right. See you. Don't lose that key. No. 
 
 Christina : Dinner is served. Um, so, should we say grace before... we eat? I don't know. Nah. God is within us. Let's eat. What does that mean, "God is within us"? Nothing. I'm sorry. Do you want to pray? Are we not Catholic? I've never been Catholic. Dad is. Um... Okay, I got a message from Lisa. Good news. Looks like I got another fight. Lisa... your dad's Lisa? Yeah. [Coughs] She's, um... like, managing me. I mean, we haven't quite figured it out, but... I mean, I'm getting back in the cage, and that's... that's what's important, right, Nate? Well, what's she like, anyway? [Inhales deeply] Don't be weird about it. I'm not being weird. I... I've been out of circulation. There are things I need to know, things I need to get used to. I didn't even know Nate was such a Catholic. I'm not. I'm kidding! Okay, come on. Relax, you guys. Here, let's have a toast. To family dinners. We should do this twice a week. Yes, indeed.

I told him Ryan would be ready for press in a week or so. Will he? I'll tell you in a week or so. I think I'm gonna get Jay on the card. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Garo mentioned that. What? No, that's... that's good. That's good. Yeah. I mean, I hope it works out for you. You coming to bed? [Sniffs] No. No, I'm on a loop. Maybe in a bit. A bit. [Door buzzes] Keith : [Sighs] Sorry. They gave me some stuff, and now it's just, like... cobwebs. What's the stuff for pancakes? What? [Door buzzes] The stuff for pancakes that makes... makes the pancakes brown. Syrup? Yes. Molasses. It feels like I'm covered in molasses. [Laughing] And it got on my brain. What did they give you? Can't... can't remember. But I was freaking out when they brought me in here, so they had to. Hey, look who I got. [Sniffs] I can't have him yet. I'm not stable. I'll, uh... I'll hold on to him for you. Just talk to him sometimes. Of course. Yeah. You'll get out of here, man. You'll be able to talk to him. You know, just... just don't say anything to anyone except your lawyer, right? Keith? Huh? You have a lawyer? Mm-hmm. Do you have a lawyer? Do... I talked to some guy who's... who's a lawyer. Good. Well, you just say, uh... all you got to do is say, uh, Michael came after you, and you were defending yourself, right? Michael came after you, and you were defending both of us. Got it? Hey, did you have your fight yet? No. No, man. Not for another few weeks. I'll be there. [Door buzzes] [Door opens] Bernard? Can people... can people spend the night here? I don't think so, buddy. [Sighs] Hey, there. Hi. What are you doing? Well, I found this in front of your neighbor's yard, and it's a really nice piece. It just needs some new paint. Do you want to help? Oh, yeah, I do. But I got to... I got to go meet a promoter. You have to do that now? Yeah, but it's not gonna take too long, so I'll be able to come back real soon and help you. And leave me with all the dirty work, huh? Nate's gonna be back pretty soon. It's okay, Jay. Go. There's some paint around the back if you want to go look. We have whole bunch of cans. Perfect. Yeah, lots of different colors. Mom, hey. Give me a hug. I got this stuff all over me. [Smooches] Okay. Alvey : I stopped taking everything a few days ago. You know, Doc, I always tell my fighters every day [clears throat] "Don't be afraid of greatness. Bet on yourself." Sometimes that makes people uncomfortable, you know, 'cause when you bet on yourself, they think you're a little crazy. Makes them... makes them uncomfortable. Makes them... afraid. I'm always reading about great men who had a mother or a father or a wife or a f*cking doctor telling them "take the medication so we don't have to f*cking worry about you. We don't want to worry." You got to shut that out. Great men don't take pills. They take chances. But for many of them, things did not end well. I understand that. I... I don't take it lightly. And I know... and I know the highs are a little higher and the lows are a little lower, but I can... I can cope with that. I have a handle on that. But to coast right in the middle? No, man. That's the death of me. No bueno. Does Lisa know you've made this decision? No. Personal. This is personal. [Sighs] Garo : You sticking any needles in your arms? Nope. Any felonies coming down the pipe? Boy, Garo, I can't believe this line of questioning. I have never been tried, charged, convicted, or suspected of committing a crime. [Chuckles] f*ck you. I've seen you commit at least 10 myself. I know. But, you know, no bullshit, man. I got different priorities now. You got a kid coming? No. But, you know, you can't f*ck off forever. At some point, you really got to do something serious, and I know where you're at right now. I mean, I'm on thin ice with f*cking everybody. But I'm giving you my word, this is it, I'm in. It's the only thing I'm focused on. That's very pleasing for me to hear. You need to be fighting. That's why I'm here. Okay, then. I'm gonna give you the same deal I gave the last guy. Good for me. You sure you don't want Lisa to take a look at this before you sign? Nah. I trust you. How is Ryan coming along? Is he the same guy? [Sighs] Garo, I don't know what to tell you. He's exactly what you want him to be. How about that? What the f*ck does that mean? [Indistinct shouting] Can I help you? There is a crazy woman by the front desk. Get rid of her. Or just get one of the guys to do it. Thing is, she's really pretty, and she says she's Alvey's wife. [Indistinct shouting] Woman : Hey, Lisa, can I just... Uh, just a second. I'll be right back. Christina? I'm Lisa. Oh, f*ck. You're gorgeous. Jay and Nate have told me a lot about you, but I didn't know you were so young. Getting older every day. Is Alvey around? No. He's actually gone. He'll be back soon. Is there anything I can do for you? No. I need to talk to him. Well, he should be back soon. You're welcome to wait. I don't want to get in the way. Oh, wow. This place is huge. You know what? I'm gonna call Alvey and see where he's at. Dr. Diaz : ... go to to begin with. I haven't had one single drink, and immediately some dude spills a drink on my boyfriend, Josh. So then Josh grabs my water, and he throws it in the guy's face. Ugh. Jesus. So, of course we get kicked out. An hour in line. We were in the club for a minute. And then we're out the door. And that was my Saturday night. And that's why I don't go out. You're a machine. You're way ahead of schedule. All right. Same time next week? No, next week's no good. Okay. When's good? You know, actually, I think I'm gonna start training with my dad again in the gym. Nate, I said you were ahead of schedule. I didn't say you could get off the schedule. I feel good. And I'm happy for you, but you and I have a lot of work together before you can train. When I say I'm done, I'm done. Do you have a problem with me, Nate? No. I won't take it personally. I'll get you another therapist. Look, you're a great guy, all right? But I'm done stretching and doing f*cking pilates. I need to focus my training back on fighting. You're putting yourself at risk. Yeah, no sh1t. I... I fight in a cage for money. [Indistinct conversations in distance] Hey. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. Lisa : Mm-hmm. All right. Um, yeah. I'll see you. Wednesday night is fine. Bye. You really did it, huh? This place is amazing. Well, don't let the crowd fool you. Most of these guys can't pay. But still. It's a big deal. It's what you always talked about. You remember those plans I sketched out for you. Yeah. Yeah, it was close. Lisa's nice. Seems like she, uh, really is on top of things. Don't look at me like I'm crazy, Alvey. It makes me crazy. I don't know how to look at you. I don't know how to talk to you. I don't know what you're doing. You show up at Jay and Nate's, then you show up at my gym. Okay, stop, stop. Don't do your rant. My rant? [Sighs] What do you want, Christina? Well, first of all, I'm sorry about the other night. Oh. Jay didn't even tell me he invited you until right before. [Chuckles] It's funny, but you didn't seem very sorry. You seemed like you were really enjoying yourself. Well, it's always fun to jump out of the shadows. I kind of liked the look on your face. I want to work something out. You have a life with another woman. I have a life. [Inhales deeply] I think we should resolve things and move on. Move on? What? Don't you want to? I mean, Lisa must be breathing down your neck. Eh, Lisa's fine. It can be painless. Um, no lawyers, no drama. I don't want half. I just want to be free. Just free? Well, you think it over. I will do it any way you want. I'm at the boys' for a while, so let me know. You should be proud of this place, Alvey. It's a big deal. [Door closes] Lisa : I don't care what she said. You need a lawyer... and not a guy who red-lines fight contracts. I'm gonna call someone. When? When I know what the hell's going on. I know what the hell's going on. Do you want me to call someone? No. I'm gonna f*cking take care of it. Mm. Will you give me a f*cking second to breathe? I shut her down now, she's gonna know I got something that's f*cking worth something. She knows that you have something that's worth something, okay? She's just trying to find out how much. It's an asset. She's not stupid. She gets half. I know what she gets. There's a reason you haven't divorced her. Oh, here we go. What's... what's that? What's that supposed to mean? It means that I know you and that every feeling you've ever had is unresolved. Mm, and you read that from a f*cking book and you don't believe a word of that. She's the mother of your children, she doesn't... Yeah, she's the mother of my children. Yeah, no, no. She's the mother of my... what was I supposed to do? Huh? W... where was I supposed to f*cking find the woman? What was I supposed to do? I didn't know where she was. What am I gonna do? Go to some f*cking whorehouse and pull her out and take the f*cking needle out of her hand and give her a f*cking pen and say, "here. f*cking sign the divorce papers, crackhead." Is that not fair? No, it's not fair. It's not fair. "Is that not fair?" [Sighs] She's in a place now where I can talk to her maybe. I'm going to f*cking handle this, but I'm gonna do it my way.
