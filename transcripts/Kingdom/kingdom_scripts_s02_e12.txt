 I beat her, I knocked her out. 
 I'm really proud of you. 
 Your two top fighters... One of them is your son.

 Damn.

 [Car door closes] 
 [Cellphone ringing, buzzing] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Ringing, buzzing stop] 
 It's Alicia. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. 
 [Cellphone clicks] 
 f*ck. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone rings, buzzing] 
 Hey, uh... uh [Chuckles] I was just, uh, calling you. 
 Alicia : Hey, yeah, I missed it. 
 [Chuckling] Uh, what's up? 
 Where are you? 
 Well, I'm... 
 I'm in L.A. 
 When did you get here? 
 I drove in this morning. 
 From where? 
 [Sighs] 
 Miami. [Chuckles] 
 Can I... Can I see you? 
 [Theme music plays] 
 [Air brakes hiss in distance, vehicle beeping] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Clears throat] [Groans] 
 What time is it? 
 [Grunts] 7:15. 
 Oh, f*ck me. 
 That got a little bit intense last night. 
 You're a rough one. 
 [Cellphone clicks] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Groans] Stop. 
 [Coughing continues] 
 Reggie : I had everything. 
 Boys and me running wild. 
 [Chuckles] Hot dogs hanging out our asses. 
 We had all the toys... 
 Boats, big-ass F-250s. 
 It's a high-desert prison town, so us correction officers we ran the show. 
 And the women? 
 Mmm. [Chuckles] 
 You can't believe it. 
 [Slurps] 
 What can't we believe about the women? 
 I'm just saying, there were a lot. 
 Oh. 
 Did you screw them all, Reggie, or what? 
 Tell us. 
 How many were there? 
 Plenty. 
 Ah. Give me a number. 
 Jason, can you shut her up? 
 Okay. Um, uh, Christina, Reggie has the floor. 
 Let's... Let's let him finish. 
 Yeah, I'm just wondering, where is he going with all this? 
 I mean, he's just talking about his boats and, I think, his dick. 
 Is that what "hot dog hanging out your ass" means, your little dick dangling? 
 Mm. 
 You talk down to everyone, Reggie. 
 We're all sick of it. 
 I'm telling you where I come from. 
 We know where you come from. You tell us every group. 
 Why don't you talk about being so high, you left your daughter in the car or when you pointed a gun at your wife? 
 We're all here. 
 So u-use the time to help each other out. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 What? 
 You're beautiful.

 Don't look at me.

 [Exhales slowly] 
 That was good. 
 [Music continues] 
 [Sighs] 
 Was he here this morning? 
 No. 
 Or yesterday. 
 He's gonna drop out. 
 You don't know that. 
 Alvey will talk him out of it. 
 Depends on how bad the knee is, Jay. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Don't worry about that. You worry about you. 
 That's it. 
 You're right. 
 You're right, coach. 
 I'm gonna be positive for a change. 
 How about that? 
 Phew. 
 I'm going to see Mom. 
 Jay : Join me? 
 I have to train Bob. 
 f*ck Bob. You need to fight. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna talk to Dad about that when he gets back. 
 All right. We got to get you back in this. 
 If Ryan comes, you let me know? 
 Yeah.

 Whoa! [Grunts] 
 Alvey : Jesus! f*ck me in the ass! 
 Are you okay? 
 You broke my collarbone, asshole. 
 I didn't f*cking break anything, man. 
 You f*cking wrecked your bike. 
 You weren't even f*cking looking! 
 I was getting out of my f*cking truck! What do you want me to do?! 
 You f*cking going so fast, moron! 
 Just call an ambulance. 
 Jesus f*cking fruitcakes on bikes! 
 f*ck! 
 Alvey, what happened here? 
 Lance Armstrong crashed his f*cking bike. 
 It was your fault. 
 Just f*cking sit still. 
 [Dialing] 
 [Sighs] God. 
 Yeah, I need an ambulance. 
 This looks bad, Alvey. 
 Shh! 
 3092 Buckingham Road. Guy on a bike. 
 Yeah, he's f*cking breathing. 
 You okay? 
 Collarbone. Your collarbone? 
 Collarbone. Clavicle. 
 Clavicle. All right. 
 f*ck. Is Ryan up? 
 Yes, but he hasn't brushed his teeth yet, so just give him a minute. 
 Just f*cking stay with him until the ambulance comes. 
 God damn it! 
 I'll wait right here. 
 Sir, would you like to lay on the grass? 
 I don't want to lay on the f*cking grass. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, with an accident like that, it's gonna be a long day, sir. 
 [Grunts] 
 Juan and I were in the cage, just grappling, and, um... just tweaked it. 
 I wasn't even going hard. 
 Tweaked it? Yeah. 
 Juan didn't say anything. Nobody called me. 
 Well, Juan didn't know. I didn't... I didn't say anything to Juan. 
 I mean, I didn't think it was serious. 
 Ah. 
 Yeah, I just... I just went home, went to bed, and then it blew up on me. 
 Put any weight on it? 
 I mean, a little bit. It hurts. 
 Let me s... 
 What are you doing? 
 Just let me see it. 
 All right. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 I didn't even touch it. 
 I know. 
 Here? 
 Yeah. 
 Right there? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Just f*cking tweaked it, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, put the ice back on. 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna call Dr. Ember, see if we can get you in there today. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, so Alicia looked good the other night. 
 Yeah. I talked to her. 
 Mm. Man, you f*cking missed it. 
 Should've seen her. 
 I talked to her. 
 What? 
 She's legit. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Aw, f*ck. I got to get out there. 
 An asshole on a bike almost killed me. 
 What? 
 All right, I'm gonna take care of this. 
 I'm gonna call Ember. I'm gonna come back. 
 I'm gonna take you to him, all right? Leave that on there. 
 Thanks, coach. 
 Jason : I'm a complete bag of sh1t. 
 [Sighs] 
 We can't keep doing this. 
 I... I can't even think. 
 You're not that bad. 
 It's ethics, Christina. 
 It... It... It's really basic stuff. 
 You don't sleep with patients. 
 They tell you that the very first day. 
 People f*ck. 
 It's not the end of the world. 
 I'm not gonna sue you. 
 I'm married. 
 I-I'm... I'm a newlywed. 
 Her... Her father paid for me to go back to school. 
 I can't get a divorce. 
 I can keep my mouth shut. 
 It's not about getting away with it. 
 As a therapist and a husband, I don't see how I can... 
 Jason... you say this every time. 
 If you can't handle it, we can stop. 
 I'm not gonna freak out. 
 We can stop. 
 Good. Good. 
 Because we have to. 
 Oh, um, my son's taking me out for Mexican today. 
 I might be a little late getting back. That's okay, right? 
 Sure. 
 Just, um... don't tell the others I gave you permission. 
 Shh. 
 [Smooches] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Rock music playing] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Can I help you? 
 Uh, I'm looking for Alicia Flores. 
 Sorry. We don't have a Flores here. 
 I just talked to her. She told me to come here. 
 Alicia Mendez trains here. 
 Mendez. That's... that's her. 
 I can take you to her. 
 Thank you.

 Alicia. 
 You have a visitor. 
 Holy f*ck, you're skinny. 
 sh1t. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Blender whirring] 
 You look so strong. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, this is pretty much all that I do. 
 I don't really get f*cked up anymore besides drinking. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is that where you sleep? 
 [Liquid pouring] Yeah. 
 I mean, look, there's a sauna, showers, I can pretty much work out whenever. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's not too bad. 
 So, what are you doing in L.A.? 
 Just wanted to come out. I haven't seen you in forever. 
 Do you not want me here? 
 [Sighs] Ava, what the f*ck? 
 I didn't even almost say that. 
 You have a vibe. 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 I haven't even heard from you in a year. 
 I know. I-I-I-I'm sorry. 
 I was... I was in Europe, and I just got back from Italy. 
 I was just doing this job. 
 At least you're working. 
 Was it a runway thing? 
 Right. f*cking horrible designer. 
 The photographer sucked. I looked like sh1t. 
 Whatever. I don't want to talk about it. Um, I'm old now. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughing] Shut up. 
 When did you start using Mom's last name? 
 Couple years ago. 
 [Jay sighs] 
 [Refrigerator opens] 
 Hello. 
 [Refrigerator closes] 
 You must be the sister. 
 She's the sister. I'm Ava. 
 Hmm. 
 I am Jay Kulina. 
 I assumed that Alicia was the pretty one, but... clearly it's a goddamn dead heat. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, we got something for everyone. 
 Guess who's older. 
 I would never. 
 Oh, come on. Guess. 
 Oh, Ava, come on. 
 Guess. 
 [Sniffs] 
 You wanna play? 
 [Both laugh] 
 Alicia's younger. 
 Aw, that's... 
 Ah, I love you so much. 
 Mm? 
 Wow. 
 I'm a year older. 
 That was a guess, truly. 
 You're both stunning. 
 Ava... 
 'twas a pleasure. 
 We love your kid sister, and I think we take tremendous care of her. 
 In the words of your people, adios. 
 You better. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, let's go out tonight. Want to? Come on. 
 Yeah. 
 Yes! Let's do it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Mm. 
 Dr. Ember : You got lucky. The MCL's intact. 
 You have a grade-one tear... No surgery. 
 Should heal up on its own. 
 Can he fight? 
 How far out? 
 10 days. 
 That's a hard one. 
 Hard to know. 
 You'll have to let pain be your guide. 
 If you can handle it, go. If it hurts, back off. 
 Great. Thanks. 
 You got it. 
 How's Nate? 
 He's better. 
 He still owes me a follow-up. 
 I will make sure that happens. 
 You better. 
 Thanks for getting this guy in. 
 Any time. 
 All right, I'll talk to you soon. Be well. 
 What do you want to do? 
 What do you mean? I'm not gonna pull out of the fight. 
 Is that what you're talking about? 
 Yeah. All right. Good. 
 Well, stay off it today. We'll see how it feels tomorrow, and then we'll take it from there. 
 And I don't want anyone to f*cking know how bad this is. 
 How f*cking bad is it? Ryan, Ryan, how bad is it, dude? 
 Can you fight or not? 
 Yes, I can fight. 
 I'm just saying, as... As Jay's dad, I hope you can respect your position as my coach, too. 
 "As Jay's dad"? Really? 
 What the f*ck does that supposed to mean? 
 You think I'm gonna tell the guy you're fighting about your f*cking injury? 
 I f*cking hope not. 
 Oh, really? 
 No disrespect. I'm just making sure. 
 A lot of disrespect. Lots. 
 I'm just making sure. 
 Come on. Walk. I think you got hit in the head.

 I don't have much information, but... he's gone. 
 Lisa okay? 
 I think so. 
 I don't know, but I think so. 
 Do we know what happened? 
 I don't know. 
 I-I, uh, got a call from her father, told me about the baby, and... and said Lisa didn't want to talk to me. 
 So I don't have any information yet. 
 Let's just keep this between us, though, okay, because I-I don't want anybody else knowing.

 Ryan's my friend. 
 I don't like fighting my friends. 
 I don't. 
 Yeah, but I thought you wanted this. 
 I do and I don't. 
 I mean, I do and I don't. 
 And... it sucks. 
 He's the next step, and I need to take that next step. 
 I know that feeling. 
 I'm just ready to fight. 
 Well, guess what? 
 I'm gonna be there. 
 How is that? I thought you had a curfew. 
 Well, I get special privileges. 
 Why? 
 I'm a model resident. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I'm gonna try, all right? 
 They may not let me, they might not say yes, but I'm at least going to ask. 
 Come on. Two more, two more, two more. 
 Push. One. 
 Good, good, good, good. Pop it. Pop it. Come on. 
 Come on, come on, come on. Nice. 
 Good job. 
 How do you feel? 
 Good. 
 Doc Ember wants to see you for a follow-up. 
 I'll give him a call. 
 If he clears me, I want to fight. 
 See what he says. 
 If he clears you, we'll get you a fight. 
 If that's what you want. 
 I'm not gonna stand in your way. 
 When did you talk to Ember? 
 This morning. 
 What'd he say about Ryan's knee? 
 It's fine. 
 Is he gonna fight? 
 Yes, he's gonna fight. Stop asking me questions. 
 What happened to Ryan's knee, anyway? 
 Whatever he said happened. 
 "Whatever he said." Of course. 
 Let's go. Give me 10. 
 [Grunts] 
 Ready? 
 You're not wearing a dress? 
 I don't like any of mine. 
 Well, I got a couple in the car. 
 [Chuckles] Like I'm gonna fit in your sh1t. 
 You might. 
 No, I like this. I'm comfortable. 
 I like the way it looks. 
 You look good. I was just offering. 
 Hey, we should, um, invite Jay. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I think he's funny. 
 I like him. No? 
 Yeah. 
 I just... I wanted to talk to you. 
 He can meet us later, then. 
 7, 8, 9... One more... and 10. 
 All right, good work. 
 [Panting] 
 Good work. Let's get you stretched out. 
 Go ahead and lay down. 
 Bob. 
 You're unbelievable. 
 What? 
 Been holding my tongue this entire session. 
 You're not gonna apologize to me? 
 For what? 
 I called you eight times to train the other night. 
 Eight times I called you. You didn't pick up once. 
 Not once. 
 Bob, it was midnight. 
 So what? I paid you 10 grand, didn't I? Huh? 
 I was f*cking clear on what I expected from you. 
 Be available to me. I need you whenever I call you. 
 Okay? Any time... day or night. 
 I told that. Did I not say that? 
 I apologize. I didn't know that's what you meant. 
 Okay, do me a favor. Just get the f*ck out of here, okay? Please? 
 You know, I'm trying to help you out, and... and... And you're gonna sh1t on me? 
 I don't need it. I don't need it. 
 I wasn't sh1tting on you, Bob. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Just pack up your stuff and leave, okay? 
 You're a nice kid, Nate. 
 I'm just paying you to leave now. 
 That's what I'm paying you for. Please. Go. 
 Make my smoothie before you go, will ya? 
 Sure. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 [Spits]

 [Knock on door] 
 Hey. 
 How'd it go with your son? 
 It was nice. 
 It's always nice. 
 What are you doing? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 So, I was... 
 They're wet. 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Is something wrong? I was gonna go to bed. 
 Um, I've been thinking about our conversation. 
 Um, I've been thinking about you, which I find myself doing more and more. 
 I don't want to stop this with you. 
 I think you are an unbelievable woman. 
 Oh, I'm really not. 
 You are. 
 Look where you met me, Jason. 
 I don't care. 
 I don't care how you got here. 
 I care about you, and I want you. 
 That's really sweet, and I'm flattered, but I'm way older than you, and you're married. 
 You have a good life. 
 Don't mess it up. 
 Sweetie, let's not do this. 
 No. [Stammers] Get the f*ck off of me! 
 [Sighs] 
 Here you go. 
 This one is freezing. 
 Thanks. 
 Phew. 
 Hey, Ryan? 
 Yeah? 
 You're gonna beat this, okay? 
 It's fine, man. It's just a strain. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 Keith : I don't like seeing you hurt. 
 You want to watch a movie? 
 Yeah, man, whatever you want. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Women moaning] 
 Ryan : Keith, what the f*ck, man? We're not watching this. 
 Why not? 
 We're not watching p0rn together, dude. You don't do that. 
 This is your film, Ryan. I thought you would like it. 
 Okay. 
 You watch it. Don't worry about it. I'm... I'm... I'm going to bed. 
 I'm turning it off. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 You, uh... You go ahead and watch, man. 
 Don't worry about it. I, uh... I'll leave. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Moaning intensifies] 
 Night. 
 [Grunts] Your boss. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Hey. Yo. 
 Any news on Ryan? 
 Uh, Dad took him to Ember, so whatever it is, he's gonna fight. 
 [Urinating] 
 So, how badly is he hurt? 
 He's not gonna tell me that. 
 [Toilet flushes] 
 But he's gonna fight, right? 
 Nate : That's what he said. 
 Psh! 
 Then I got nothing to worry about. 
 All right, I'm gonna be heading out for the evening. 
 Hold my calls. 
 [Video game chatter] 
 How do I look? Hmm? Hmm? 
 So good. 
 You're not even looking at me. 
 I like the... floral shirt. 
 Mm. Mm-hmm. 
 Bro, you need to turn off these f*cking video games and go outside and play. [Chuckles] You understand me? 
 I'm serious, though. You know, your brain is made out of neuroplasticity. 
 You f*cking watch this sh1t long enough, it's gonna... 
 It's g-gonna re-carve the pathways, man. 
 That's science. 
 Go outside. [Sniffs] 
 Nature... God's video game. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Cellphone rings, buzzes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, Bob. What's going on? 
 But I'm done with f*cking Miami. 
 Honestly, it's straight up p0rn and Eurotrash at this point, or at least that's how I was getting approached. 
 It was f*cking annoying. 
 Weren't you in Italy? 
 Yeah, I was, but it was... It was gross, too, and I ended up firing my agency, and... 
 I'm gonna be out here. I'm gonna take some meetings. 
 I'm kind of... Kind of done. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 I'll probably do some print stuff maybe. 
 I don't know. I just... I saved a lot of money, so I got a cushion. 
 But you're a f*cking fighter. I can't believe that. 
 [Laughing] Why not? 
 Because, I mean, this is insane. 
 No, it's not. Look, I train a lot, treat it like a job. 
 It is what it is. 
 Are you making any money? 
 Not really. No, I'm not. 
 But if I keep getting better and I keep winning fights, then it gets better. 
 Just f*cking say it. 
 I'm not saying anything. 
 Good. 
 Don't. 
 I mean, is there anything else you need to tell me? 
 Like what? 
 Like, are you eating pussy now? 
 You f*cking kidding me? 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 No. f*ck you, man. 
 Okay, I was just checking. You never know. 
 I'm not eating f*cking pussy. 
 [Laughs] 
 You're f*cking ridiculous. 
 Are you eating pussy? 
 No. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 [Both laugh] 
 That's great. 
 The lovely Mendez sisters. 
 May I? 
 Yes. 
 Narrator : German jet-propelled aircraft in combat, the Me 262, the turbojet plane whose operation resembles a rocket. 
 It uses the turbine only to operate the air compressor to supply oxygen to the engine. 
 Propulsion is provided by expansion of gases in the combustion chamber as in a rocket jet. 
 The Me 262 is a single-seat fighter bomber. 
 I don't think you understand... [Laughs] how big a star your sister is going to be. 
 Oh, whatever, man. 
 Whatever? 
 [Chuckling] Yeah, whatever. 
 Look at her. Look at that. 
 Take a good, long, hard look at that face. 
 She's beautiful, and she can fight. 
 I'm not saying she can fight, like, for a hot chick. 
 Yeah. 
 She can dominate a bitch. Was she always like this? 
 She was always mean, but she wasn't always hot. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Allie was a late bloomer. 
 You know what, guys? Can we just not talk about this? 
 What? I mean, you're f*cking hot now. Who cares? 
 I care. Are you kidding me? That sh1t was bullshit. 
 Everybody always loved Ava 'cause she was the tiny, little pretty one. 
 She was the bodyguard. 
 A bodyguard? 
 That makes it better? 
 There's a little fire between the two of you. 
 I like it. 
 Okay, well, then, f*cking sit down and have a drink with us. 
 No, ma'am. 
 I have a fight to prepare for against my best friend and her boyfriend. 
 Wait. Boyfriend? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 He's not my boyfriend. 
 But... you make love, no? 
 We f*ck, yeah, occasionally. 
 And you argue. 
 Therefore... 
 Mm-hmm... you're in a relationship. 
 I agree. 
 Mm-hmm. She agrees. 
 No. 
 He's your boyfriend. 
 Mnh-mnh. I'm good. 
 I think that's f*cked up that you're fighting your friend. 
 Well, as you'll come to learn, it's a pretty f*cked up business. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I am gonna go use the restroom, and then I'm gonna head home. 
 Stay out of trouble. I will see you at work tomorrow, Alicia, and, Ava, don't leave town without saying goodbye. 
 We'll see. 
 Hey, Nate. How are ya? 
 Hey. Come on in. 
 Good to see you. [Chuckling] Hey. 
 Uh, I thought you wanted to train tonight. 
 Well, I did, but, you know, lost the urge. 
 Got it. Well, uh, I can just come back in the morning. 
 No, no, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. 
 Nate, first of all, I wanted to apologize for my tone this morning, okay? 
 Right or wrong, I was out of line. 
 Uh, it's all good. It's all good. 
 Just give me a call, and we'll do a session. 
 No, no, no, no. Stay. Look, I got a nice group of friends here... 
 Very nice friends, old friends of mine... And you're here. 
 Have a drink. What do you say? 
 Am I dressed okay? 
 Yeah, you're a trainer. You look great. 
 Hey, everybody. Say hello to Nate Kulina. 
 He's my personal trainer. He's also a professional MMA fighter, if you can believe that. [Chuckles] 
 What are you drinking? What are you having? 
 Uh, vodka or something? 
 How about a White Russian? 
 Sure. 
 Okay, good. 
 Say hello to my friends, and I'll bring it to you.

 Here are some of the reasons.

 Our fighters continue to overrun the Luftwaffe. 
 Gun sight aiming point cameras parade this destruction of Nazi planes and equipment wherever and whenever they appear.

 Hi. 
 Hello.

 You should come to my fight.

 Hmm. 
 Hey, coach. 
 Hey. I wake you up? 
 No, no. I'm just, um... I'm just laying in bed. What's up? 
 I got some bad news, Ryan. 
 Uh... 
 Uh, I wasn't even sure if I was gonna tell you or not, but I don't think it f*cking matters at this point. 
 What? 
 There's a problem with the baby. 
 We lost it. 
 It's gone. 
 Li... Lisa's okay, though, you know, physically. 
 That's about all I know. 
 Alvey, I'm so sorry. 
 I don't even know what to say. 
 I know, and I appreciate it. 
 [Clears throat] Anyway, I kn... I know how important she is to you, so I-I figured you should know, too. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 All right, we'll get after it tomorrow, okay? 
 Cool. 
 Hey, uh, Alvey. 
 Yeah? 
 You think it'd be all right if I called her? 
 Why don't you give it a few days, Ryan, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 [Inhales deeply] f*ck. 
 [Sighs shakily] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Grunts] 
 Ohh. 
 Good morning. 
 I'm Will. I'm Bob's assistant. 
 Take your time. Get dressed. 
 I'll meet you in the kitchen. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Clothing thuds] 
 [Blow lands] [Sniffles] 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 What the f*ck happened to me last night? 
 I don't know. 
 Bullshit. 
 Wasn't here, Nate. I don't know. 
 You look like you do. 
 I'm sorry. I don't. 
 That piece of sh1t put something in my drink. 
 You f*cking listening to me right now? 
 Yes. 
 Where the f*ck is he? 
 He's on a plane. 
 He'll be back in a month. 
 Where the f*ck is he?! 
 He's on a plane to London. He'll be back in a month. 
 He wanted me to give you this. 
 It's another $10,000 to keep you on retainer. 
 I don't want this. 
 Think I want the f*cking money? 
 It's for the month. You won't even see him. Just... take the money. 
 I don't want the f*cking money. 
 I don't want to know where the f*ck he is, why he isn't here, 'cause if he was, I would beat the f*ck out of him right now. 
 What's your f*cking name? 
 What's your name? 
 Will. 
 Tell him, Will. 
 Tell him I'm gonna f*ck him up.
