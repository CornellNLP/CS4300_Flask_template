 Hey, yo. Come on. 
 Deep breaths, baby. Deep breaths.

 Beat this m*therf*cker down, Mac! 
 This fat m*therf*cker! 
 [Horn blares] 
 All right, hey! 
 Nice first round! 
 Looking good... Light and fresh. 
 How you feeling? 
 Terrible. f*cking terrible. 
 Well, I'll tell you this much... You look great. 
 Water him down, Nate. 
 Hey, you got to listen to something. 
 I need you to hear me now. I need you to look at me. 
 I need you to understand one thing. 
 Look at me, Mac, right in the f*cking eyes right now. 
 Pussy hates a loser. 
 What? 
 Pussy hates a loser. 
 Pussy hates a loser. 
 Okay. 
 What does pussy hate? 
 Pussy hates a loser. 
 Okay. 
 We're fighting in the junkyard for a reason, 'cause you a junkyard dog! 
 Come on, Mac! 
 You're a bull master m*therf*cker! 
 f*ck this boy! 
 [Growls] 
 _ 
 [Horn blares] 
 Come on. 
 He don't like it! He loves it! 
 Mac, come on! Come on, Mac! 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Nate : Oh-ho-ho! 
 Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! 
 [Cheering] 
 Yeah! 
 Whoo! 
 Get off me! 
 That's my boy! 
 That's my boy! 
 Nate : I'm sorry you had to see this. 
 Whoo! Ahh! 
 Mac, you m*therf*cker! 
 Jay, stop f*cking him. 
 Jay, get the f*ck off me! 
 Why are you doing this? 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Indistinct public address] 
 Blue, red, blue, triangle, orange. 
 [Gunshots] 
 All right, bud. Anything you want. 
 Yeah? Anything I want? 
 Yeah. 
 [Machine gun firing] 
 Aah! 
 Ohh! 
 Yeah! 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 Nice! 
 Is it wrong that I want to f*ck this gun? 
 It would be wrong if you didn't. 
 Short barrel, primary weapon system rifle with trigger work. 
 Modified stock, triad flash suppressor, eotech sights, and a viking sling. 
 I don't know what the f*ck you said, but I will take it. 
 It looks good on you, bud. 
 Yeah, man. 
 I want the sig. 
 All right. 
 And, uh... 
 [Gun clicks] 
 Give me this gen 3. 
 17-round mags, yeah? 
 Yeah, goddamn right. 
 f*ck you, California. 
 My man. 
 Do all three for $5,500. 
 $5,200. I like that. 
 $5,500, buddy. 
 You're all about the money. 
 Big fight tonight, huh? 
 Ryan's first title defense. 
 Yeah. Big for Jay, too. 
 How they looking? 
 Ryan looks great. 
 Jay's got a stupid f*cking haircut, but he looks good. 
 It'll be a good matchup, so we'll see how it goes. 
 Yeah. 
 Want a ticket? 
 Yeah, man. 
 Any way I can bring my wife? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll leave a couple tickets at will call. 
 Cool. Thanks. 
 Good to go. 
 $5,500! 
 You should be taking that to my truck. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Vomiting] 
 [Toilet flushes] 
 [Ringtone playing] 
 Hello? 
 I'm lovely, Garo. Why are you calling me so early? 
 What? No. 
 I'm not listening to this. 
 No, 'cause you know it's bullshit. 
 You know what? f*ck you. I'll see you tonight. 
 [Music playing] 
 [Horn blaring] 
 [Knocking on door] 
 [Door opens] 
 Jay : Yo! 
 What the f*ck?! 
 I got to come collect you at the door?! 
 [Door closes] 
 You dirty little debutante, you. 
 Hmm? 
 You make a puppy work? 
 What the hell happened here? 
 The chicken after the weigh-in, bro. 
 Huh? 
 The chicken after the weigh-in. 
 I heard you. 
 I puked, man. 
 I puked, and I stopped that, but I can't stop sh1tting now. 
 I got no sleep. I don't think I can go tonight. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 The champ does not pull out of a fight over a few juicy poops. 
 Dude, I'm dead, Jay. 
 Come on, dude. You're not f*cking dead. 
 You're alive. You've got vitals. I'm getting you to the gym. 
 Mac's gonna nurse you back to health, boy. 
 How did Mac's fight go? 
 Beautiful, dude. He won. 
 I mean, it was a walrus fight, but it was primo. 
 I was legitimately f*cking aroused. Hard as a f*cking ox. 
 Come on. 
 Up, up, up, up, boom! 
 Let's cruise. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, I got to tell you something, man. I hate this f*cking house. 
 Free is free, dude. 
 Where did it happen? 
 Keith's mom? 
 Yeah. 
 Back bedroom. 
 With a f*cking hammer. 
 With a f*cking hammer while she was sleeping. 
 Have you ever been back there? 
 No. Hell, no. 
 Come on, let's go before I have to sh1t again. 
 [Music playing] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Ah! 
 Where's Ryan? 
 Huh? 
 Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. 
 Uh, Jay's picking him up. 
 All right, Joe, I want you to clear this place out when they get here, okay? 
 Fight night, guys. Big night. Big night. 
 Hi, Casey. 
 [Scoffs] Joe, one more? 
 Wait, and you said you were done. 
 Hey, it's... it's three minutes. One more. 
 Hey, you. 
 Good morning. 
 Hi, Shelby. 
 What's going on? 
 Mm, not much. 
 You got a bunch of messages and some ticket requests for tonight. 
 Who called? 
 A bunch of people. 
 I wrote it down. 
 [Chuckles]You know, writing a message down is different than delivering the message. 
 It doesn't do me any good simply knowing it exists... Shelby. 
 I think Confucius said that. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Um, the hot water's out again, too, and the alarm's being weird. 
 Right, isn't that Lisa's department? 
 Right, I just thought because of the baby... 
 Hmm. 
 Man : About 15 pounds overweight. 
 Well, she's... She's pregnant, Shelby. She's not paralyzed. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys! 
 What's going on? 
 He ate a filthy bird. 
 Lisa needs to talk to you right away. 
 About what? 
 She's in her office. 
 Go see her. 
 I got to take a piss. 
 Okay. 
 Are you sick? 
 Yeah, if food poisoning is sick. Coming from both ends. 
 What time did this start? 
 About 1:30 last night. 
 Did you get any sleep? 
 No, not a wink. 
 Keep anything down? 
 I don't know, I haven't puked in a couple hours. I don't know. 
 Mac! Mac! 
 Mac : Hey, what's up, Coach? 
 I.V. in the lounge right now. 
 Oh! 
 He needs it, all right? 
 Not looking good. Yes. 
 Get some rest. I'll be right in. I'll be right in. 
 [Sighs] 
 Good morning, Mrs. Prince. 
 [Knocks] 
 Hi. 
 How are you two feeling? 
 I hate everything. Can you shut the door? 
 Sure, no problem. Look, I don't want to... 
 I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but... 
 If you need somebody to... Massage your perineum... 
 You're the guy? 
 I'm that guy. Dr. Jay. 
 Oh, my God, Jay. You are so sweet. Thank you so much for stepping up. 
 You're welcome. So, what's up? 
 Hassan pulled out of the fight. 
 He says he strained his MCL. 
 Doing what? I mean, getting out of f*cking bed? 
 I know. 
 It's the day of the fight, Lisa! 
 His manager called Garo this morning. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 I know that you're disappointed. 
 [Slams phone] 
 f*ck disappointment! 
 Are you kidding me? This is the second time in four months, Lisa! 
 What the f*ck?! 
 This is a business decision for these guys. 
 You're a great fighter with an average record. 
 There's no upside to fighting you. 
 What do you want me to do with this information?! 
 I f*ck up, I don't get a fight. 
 I do great, I still don't get a fight. 
 I'm a little confused. 
 I know. Jay, it sucks. 
 It sucks? 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. What the f*ck are you doing about it? 
 I'm working on it. 
 How? 
 I don't know. I... But I'll figure it out, okay? 
 You'll figure it f*cking out? You want to manage me? 
 You want to be my manager? 
 Yes. 
 Then manage to get me a f*cking fight. 
 Jesus f*ck! f*ck! 
 Mac : Hit him right in the throat. 
 [Chuckles] 
 He dropped like somebody unplugged him. It was awesome. 
 And then, uh... And then Jay humped me. 
 I got video on my phone if you want to see it. 
 Oh, man. 
 Check this out. 
 Alvey : How's my guy? 
 Uh, good. I just, uh... 
 He just started the second bag of fluids. 
 You're good to go tonight, right? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 You think so, or you know so? 
 'Cause Morant's a tough son of a bitch, man. 
 He could hurt you. 
 No, there's sponsors coming tonight. I'm not gonna pull out of the fight. 
 You sure? 
 I'm good. 
 I'm just gonna sleep. 
 You need some food, too. 
 A little solid food, try to keep it down. 
 Mac. 
 Mac : Yeah? 
 Alvey. 
 Did you know about my fight falling apart? 
 I just found out. I just found out, and I'm sorry. 
 What happened to Hassan? 
 Hassan... f*cking Hassan, all of a sudden, has an MLC. 
 Ah, ah, easy. 
 What, they can't... There's nobody else? 
 Nobody. I take all. Nobody takes me. 
 All right, Lisa's gonna handle the situation, okay? 
 [Spits] 
 Just relax. 
 Don't get yourself crazy. 
 It's sucks. 
 [Humming] 
 I'm not even f*cking worried about it 'cause tonight is about you. 
 Yes, sir. Yes, champ. Tonight is about you. 
 I'm gonna go home. Mackles, you're coming with me. 
 I'm gonna have a burrito. I'm gonna have a few Martinis. 
 I'm gonna put on my finery. 
 And I am going to cheer for you like a Peruvian girl at a Michael Jackson concert, 'cause you know I love you. 
 I'll see you tonight... Champ. 
 All right. 
 I might even love you. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Mac, when you've concluded your nursing services, I expect to see you back at the chalet. 
 Kick some ass tonight, bro. 
 Sorry, bud. 
 [Grunting] 
 f*ck! 
 I f*cked up the toast. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I need you to work a double next week. 
 No. What? No. 
 I don't want to work a double. I worked two last week. 
 Tim's got mono. 
 What about Chauncey? 
 He's out of town. 
 Well, what about Madison? 
 She ain't gonna do it. 
 She never has to do anything. 
 Seriously, has she ever cleaned the grill? No. 
 Has she ever emptied the grease trap? No. 
 She's in school. She works 15 hours a week. 
 But I'm trying to help you out. 
 Oh, lucky me. A double. Thank you. 
 You always give me the worst schedule. 
 Why you always got a problem? 
 You keep saying you want hours. I'm giving you more hours. 
 What the hell you want? 
 [Sighs] 
 Nothing. 
 I'll do it. 
 [Gun clicking] 
 How badass is that thing? 
 Nate : Yeah, this is very practical. 
 You definitely needed to buy this. 
 [Chuckles] 
 When the sh1t goes down, Sonny boy, you're gonna be running to big Papa's house. 
 Big Papa's house. 
 [Chuckles] Here. Help me out. 
 I'm trying to get more tape on Barnes. 
 I've seen enough. 
 Well, it can't hurt to see more. 
 You're right. 
 Lisa's gonna set up some press for you the week before the fight. 
 I know you hate it, but first fight back... 
 No, I'll do it. It's fine. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 What? 
 You're very relaxed. It's disturbing. 
 I'm not taking this guy lightly or anything. 
 I'm just f*cking ready to fight. 
 I know you are. You busted your ass. 
 I'm proud as hell of you. 
 Thank you. 
 You're not in your head. I like that. 
 You're off that sh1t, too, right? 
 The HGH that you think I didn't know about? 
 I know you had an injury and it was necessary, but you get popped, and that follows you your whole career. 
 So we are done with that, yeah? 
 We're done. I'm off it. I'm clean. I swear. 
 Handsome kid. 
 Go see if, uh, Ryan needs anything, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You good? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Nothing's loaded. 
 Don't forget we're going to see Garo to look at that Brazilian. 
 Where are you going? 
 To go and see another fighter. 
 Anyone I know? 
 Alicia Mendez? 
 She's young. 
 Mm, young's good. 
 You gonna bring those home? 
 I'm not gonna leave them in a gym full of maniacs. 
 See you there. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 [Ringtone playing] 
 Ah, f*ck. 
 [Ringtone stops] 
 [Music playing] 
 m*therf*cker! 
 [Horn honks] 
 f*ck! 
 So, where are you training now? 
 At Team Elite in North Hollywood. 
 Just trying to get out of there. 
 It's a good gym. You're not happy? 
 [Sighs] It's all right. 
 You know, it's just... It's not the right fit. 
 Why, did Marco try to f*ck you? 
 [Chuckles] 
 He kept asking me out to dinner. 
 And then you keep saying no and then he'll cancel your privates and no one wants to roll with you and then you're the lonely girl in the corner hitting a bag. 
 That's pretty much exactly how it happened. 
 Or it could be that he's lost interest 'cause you've lost your last three fights in a row. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 It's not. 
 It's the not f*cking him, but your record isn't helping. 
 I'm sorry. Why did you even call me here? 
 I want to sign you. 
 I think you're a really talented fighter who's gotten some really bad advice, or maybe none at all, and I want to change all that. 
 What do you mean? I mean, what can you get me? 
 Right now? Probably nothing. 
 Look. You're 1-3, and you're not getting any better. 
 You're taking bad fights with girls with way too much experience. 
 Well, Marco says I need to take what I can get. 
 Yeah, no, and if you keep doing that, uh, you'll end up fighting in Palm Springs until you're mercy-killed by the commissioner. 
 Well, how else am I supposed to get experience if I don't take a fight? 
 My job is to build your career. 
 I'm gonna find you the right fights at the right time. 
 The sponsors and all that sh1t will come later. 
 You're a beautiful girl, but that's not gonna happen without a plan. 
 If I go with you, will I be able to train with Alvey? 
 I can't promise that, but he'll evaluate you. 
 I told him about you, and, uh, he's hoping you'll come by the gym. 
 [Snorts] 
 Mac : Ohh! 
 Yeah, I miss your old house, man. 
 f*ck my old house, dude. I like this place. 
 I get my own space here, Mac. 
 Ohh! [Inhales sharply] 
 Ohh! 
 I got... I got my own theories about this whole f*cking thing. 
 [Snorts] 
 What thing? 
 You know, about the whole business industrial complex of the sport. 
 Sport, you know? See? 
 It's f*cking... It's like I'm a fighter, dude. 
 I'm a f*cking fighter. 
 [British accent] I'm not a sportsman, sir. 
 [Normal voice] Jesus. 
 Have you ever read Sigmund Freud? 
 I know who he is. 
 He's f*cking amazing, man. 
 For instance, do you ever get depressed? 
 Huh? [Sniffs] 
 When I think about my grandpa, all right? 
 Like, uh, he was more like a father. 
 No, Mac, I'm saying, like, for no f*cking reason, like you're sitting in your house and you can't manage to do another f*cking thing. 
 You can't motivate. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what that is. 
 That's f*cking Freud, dude. 
 That is anxiety, and you're having it because you are suppressing your impulses. 
 [Snorts] 
 All the sh1t that is built into you... 
 f*cking, fighting, surviving... All the animal sh1t. 
 Um, but, however, the... We have to have that, otherwise, you cannot have a functioning society 'cause you're gonna get M*therf*ckers like me who go around stealing everyone's f*cking property and women. 
 You have to suppress. Yeah. 
 [Snorts] 
 Uh, uh, it just makes... Makes me really sad. 
 You know, f*ck, man. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Hey, no. No, no, no. 
 What are we talking about, Jay? 
 Wh... 
 What? 
 What... what... what... What I'm talking... 
 What we're talking about, Mac, is that... 
 What? 
 Look, I'm... 
 I'm... I'm... 
 Everybody's too f*cking careful. 
 F-Fighters fight, dude. 
 f*ck! That's all they do. 
 Huh? 
 True statement? 
 Hmm? "T" or "F," f*cking Mac? 
 Yeah, I get... I agree. 
 Ga-Ga-Ga, you sound, um, uh, dubious. 
 It's... it's an oversimplification. 
 See? That's the infection right there, dude. 
 Hassan is... f*cking Hassan's trying to curate his record, and, yeah. 
 No, that's bullshit, dude. 
 Hassan's f*cking stealing from me, Mac, by bitching out. 
 And that... 
 [Sighs] 
 It gives me anxiety, man. 
 It gives me f*cking anxiety. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Should we clean this all up before your Mom comes home? 
 Go... hey, hey... 
 Dude, my Mom's working a f*cking doble today. 
 Line it up, Mac, with your f*cking forearms, dude. 
 I want to march to f*cking Bolivia and back, m*therf*cker. 
 Get that sh1t going. 
 We have a really long night, Jay. 
 All right, dude. We got to set a pace. 
 We got to make it all the way to the end. 
 This is my f*cking pace, Mac. 
 You will not f*cking suppress me. 
 I'm Martin Luther King, dude. Watch out, bro. 
 That... You cannot say that. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Christina : I get the worst hours of anybody there. 
 "If nobody wants to work that shift, give it to Christina." 
 In the meantime, this Madison girl, who has gigantic boobs, has Jamal wrapped around her finger. 
 I wouldn't be surprised if  she' making the schedule. 
 Why don't you just tell this guy what hours you want to work? 
 It doesn't work that way, honey. Haven't you ever had a job? 
 That's actually not good. 
 I get paid to fight. 
 Yeah, but you need to know what it feels like to have a boss. 
 Why do I need to know that? 
 Well, pardon me, Your Highness. 
 You're getting a little cocky. 
 It's actually very attractive, Nate. Women like it. 
 That's good to know, Mom. Thank you. 
 How's Casey? 
 She's good. 
 Hmm? You two doing okay? 
 All good. 
 She's not going crazy with you training? 
 No drinking, no good food, no s*x? 
 Are you almost done with that? 
 Almost. 
 Is your brother ready for his fight tonight? 
 The guy pulled out. 
 Oh. That's too bad. 
 Yeah, it sucks. 
 So... so, is he gonna be home tonight? 
 We're gonna watch Ryan. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, I guess I'll just have the house to myself... Again. 
 No, I'm not fishing for an invitation. 
 I'll just sit at home and do my nails like some old retired lady whose friends have all died. 
 You're not retired. You work at the Patty Palace. 
 You're a little jerk. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, I'll leave some tickets for you at will call... 
 And then just text me when you're there, and I'll bring you back to meet everyone. 
 Hey, are you married? 
 No, but, uh, we're together. 
 It's Alvey's. 
 [Chuckles] Any other questions for me? 
 Look, I'm gonna be straight up with you. 
 I really like you, and I think this could be great. 
 I just...Wonder what's gonna happen when the baby's born. 
 What do you mean? 
 When you're busy being mom, I mean, who's gonna be making phone calls for me? 
 Me. 
 Nothing's going to change. All I need is a phone. 
 
 
 
 Oh, sh1t, you parked in the red. 
 [Scoffs] 
 There's nowhere to park. 
 Thanks for lunch. 
 [Car door opens, closes] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Music playing] 
 [Inhaling deeply] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Screaming continues] 
 Alvey : There he is. 
 Do you got everything? 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 All right, come on. Let's go. 
 Eddie : This is the way he put it... 
 He says, like, a shark bit off half his asshole. 
 Lisa : Eddie. 
 Hey! 
 Where's Garo? 
 Lisa. Hey, you look good. 
 Uh, Garo had a bit of a health scare. You got me tonight. 
 I'm running things. Hey. 
 What happened? 
 He has what's called an a**l fistula. 
 How did he des... Kind of like a... like a... 
 It's okay. 
 ...Like an abscess... 
 No, no, no, you don't have to... 
 ...In the asshole... Region? 
 Honestly, please, please, please. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 That's disgusting. What are we gonna do about Jay? 
 Ohh, I am so sorry about Jay. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What are you gonna do? It happens. 
 No, it doesn't happen. 
 You guys got to lock down these fighters. 
 Locked. 
 It's getting ridiculous. 
 I hear you. 
 And also, just a little FYI... 
 What's that? 
 Jay's on the rampage. 
 Whoa. 
 Why are you pointing at me? 
 Hassan f*cked him over. It's not us, all right? 
 We're hurting, too. 
 Fix it. 
 Alvey : Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on? 
 Hey! There he is! 
 What are you doing here? Where's Garo? 
 Uh, his fistula went ape-shit this morning. 
 [Imitates explosion] 
 Stop, stop, stop. 
 Stopping. 
 Where are these Brazilians I'm supposed to see? 
 Follow me, my friend. Follow me. 
 Garo thinks you're gonna love this guy. 
 23 years old. Tough, mean son of a bitch. 
 Raised like a dog straight out of the favelas, right? 
 And get this... this guy, he can't even f*cking read. 
 I don't care if he can read. I just want to see him. 
 Ah! Fabricio! 
 [Speaks Spanish] 
 [Chuckles] [Imitates punching] 
 Ah, just kidding, man. Just kidding, right? 
 Hey, how you doing? Alvey Kulina. Nice to see you. 
 Right? 
 How are you? 
 This guy's a f*cking beast, huh? Beast. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 [Speaks Spanish] 
 Guy speak English? 
 What? No, man. No, not a word. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah, I'm positive. 
 I'm positive. 
 I know this guy, man. 
 He's been knocking around for a couple years. 
 No, no, no. You're thinking of somebody else. 
 No. 
 Somebody else. He's new. 
 [Speaks Spanish] 
 Yeah. 
 Look at him. He's like a piece of jerky. 
 He's 23 like I'm 23. 
 He's too old. I got no time to train him, okay? 
 Maybe he's 25, 26. 
 Tell Garo not to waste my f*cking time. 
 And, idiot, he speaks Portuguese, not Spanish, okay? 
 Okay, first of all, same thing. 
 Second of all, Garo specifically inst... Al... 
 All right. f*ck! 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Next time. 
 Tiempo. Next f*cking time. 
 f*ck me. 
 Woman :  Looks like I got that new job. 
 Man :  We're slashing prices on all... 
 [TV shuts off] 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 It's a nice house, yeah. No, it's cool. 
 What's that? How's the fistula? 
 [Chuckles] What's that? 
 No, it's good. It's good. 
 Yeah, it's a good house. It's full. 
 I mean... 
 What's that? No. I talked to Lisa. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. Hey, pal. 
 Hold on a second. 
 Hey, okay. 
 What? 
 Do you know where Garo is, by any chance? 
 Yeah, I'm on the phone right now. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, he's helping. 
 Hey, Garo, it's Jay. 
 Yeah, let me call you back. 
 How you doing? 
 Garo, let me call you back. 
 I feel like this is his fight promotion. 
 How's it going, Jay? 
  Yeah, it is. 
 No, I'm doing all right. 
 He's home sick. 
 He had a bit of a... 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 ...Fistula thing. 
 It doesn't matter. Good to see you. 
 Hey, sorry about the fight, all right? I talked to Lisa. 
 We're gonna take care of you, okay? 
 Great, yeah. 
 How do... how do... how do you figure you're gonna do that? 
 I don't know. We're gonna get you on a big card, all right? 
  Big card. 
 Big card. Big card. 
 But maybe... maybe I don't want to be on your big card. 
 Maybe a fighter such as myself deserves better than your ghetto-ass f*cking promotion. 
 Step back a little bit, Jay. 
 These are the thoughts that start going through my mind when you deny me my f*cking right to work. 
 You know what? f*ck you, Jay. 
 Oh, "f*ck you"? 
 You just crossed the line, all right? 
 I will take a little sh1t from you. 
 I will f*cking... 
 I will eat a little bit of sh1t... a bite... 
 But that's it, all right? 
 Okay, we're good. 
 Back the f*ck up right now. 
 Jay, we're good. Jay, we're good. 
 I got to go. Good luck. 
 We're good. 
 I need you to control your boy. 
 What the f*ck you just say? 
 Oh, okay. All right. [Chuckles] 
 Those guys, huh? Hey, Mac Sullivan, heavyweight. 
 How you doing, Mac? 
 All right, I think eyou run a top-notch promotion. 
 Appreciate that, thank you. 
 I'd love to be a part of it, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Mac Sullivan, all right? 
 I'll keep that in mind. 
 S-U-L-L-I-V-A-N. 
 S-U-L-L-I-V-A-N. 
 I know how to spell Sullivan. 
 Hey, you know? 
 Okay. All right. 
 [Grunts] 
 Pull it. Pull it. Nice! 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. Wake up. 
 Go. 
 Hey. Champ is here. 
 Yes, sir! 
 Yo, Morant is not ready for you, son. 
 You better handle that business. You know what I'm saying? 
 [Laughs] 
 All right, good. Come on. 
 Whoa. Hey. 
 Come on. We're working. We're working. 
 Who is this?  Quién es esta, señora? 
 Uh, Jay, this is Alicia Mendez. 
 Yes, ma'am! 
 Alicia, this is Jay Kulina. 
 She's gonna be training with us. 
 You are a very beautiful young woman, Ms. Mendez. 
 She is. 
 I don't mean that to be sexually disrespectful. 
 Okay. 
 It's just that's the only thing that I know about you right now. 
 Gotcha. 
 Thank you. I like your suit. 
 Thank you very much. You have tremendous taste. 
 Tonight! 
 What a f*cking night, y'all?! [Laughs] 
 Come on, shoot that. Just like that. 
 You got it, Ryan. Ha-do-ken! 
 Yes, sir! 
 Come on. Get a drink or something. 
 I don't need a drink. I'm good. 
 I'm gonna be there to walk you out, Ryan. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Gonna be laying petals. 
 Mac. 
 Come on. Let's go, Mac. 
 Ryan, I'm gonna be there for your walkout. 
 Ms. Mendez, you look fine. Yes, ma'am, you do. 
 Give me time. 
 All right, come on. 
 [Music playing] 
 I don't buy condoms. I don't use condoms, Mac. 
 Just not my thing. 
 I think that's a terrible decision. 
 [Chuckles] Look at that, huh? 
 Hassan's boys have arrived. 
 Boy, the balls on these... 
 Come on. 
 We welcome them to our home. 
 It's the only right thing to do. 
 Am I wrong? Boys, how you doing? 
 How's everything going over here? 
 How is Hassan's knee? 
 That's really the topic of conversation. 
 Godspeed to his recovery. Godspeed to all. 
 We've been very sanguine about the entire affair. 
 You know, that poor knee. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. 
 Mac, let these gentlemen know the cocktails are on me for the rest of the evening in honor of Hassan's weak knees and our big f*cking hearts. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 [Grunts] 
 Right here. 
 [Soft piano plays] 
 No, I am out there, and I am killing it because I am the only guy in my region who even understands the product that we're selling. 
 My head would explode. 
 Yeah, right? I... 
 [Sighs] 
 But these... These underwriters, these nutless worms, they live to kill a deal. 
 Mm. 
 I mean, I-I'm out there hunting, and they're cutting me off at the knees because, of course, they are incentivized to do so. 
 I mean, I'm really... I'm just... 
 [Sighs] I'm frustrated. Man. 
 But still, you must do pretty well. 
 This is a nice place. 
 Yeah. 
 So, how do we do this? I mean, I've got about 700 bucks. 
 I could... 
 Shh. 
 Don't. Not here. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. I-I-I don't do this, so I... 
 It's okay. 
 Do you have a room? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Give me the key, you settle up here, and meet me upstairs. 
 It's, uh, 713. 
 Dave. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm really, really wet right now, so don't keep me waiting. 
 Could I get my check, please?

 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, guys, listen. 
 I just... listen, please. Okay. 
 Please, let me just... I just want to apologize, okay? 
 Uh, it... Uh, it wasn't my best fight. 
 Man : Oh, really? 
 Uh, you guys don't know this. 
 Coming into this, I had a 102-degree fever, and that's not a f*cking excuse. It's not an excuse, okay? 
 It's just... it wasn't up to my standard, okay? 
 Uh, but next time, I promise I'll f*cking be here. 
 Sorry. I'll be healthy. 
 I'll put on a show for you guys, all right? Thanks. 
 Hey, Ryan, you're a pussy! 
 Hey, f*ck you, man. 
 You suck. 
 Jay! 
 Take him out! Take him out! 
 There he is. 
 What happened? 
 Jay's a f*cking idiot. That's what happened. 
 Let me see. 
 Oh. It's nothing. You're still pretty. 
 Thanks. 
 Garo's gonna be f*cking pissed. 
 About what? 
 I put on a shitty fight. 
 f*ck Garo. He's home with a torn asshole. 
 You fought sick. 
 He's lucky you didn't pull out and kill his whole card. 
 He should be down here sucking your dick. 
 And f*ck those savages that want to see blood. 
 That is not your job, all right? 
 There were sponsors here tonight, though. 
 Yeah, and they raised your hand. You take the win. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Look at me. 
 Take the win. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Good job. 
 Thanks, Coach. 
 Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 [Scoffs] 
 What happened to your faces? 
 Yeah, Jay. Good question. What happened to our faces? 
 I was provoked. 
 Nate, can you make daddy a cocktail, please? 
 Please, please. 
 Well, I guess you got your fight. 
 [Inhales sharply] Yeah. 
 [Grunts] 
 How was your night? 
 It was nice. I meditated. 
 I'll make you a drink. 
 You would do that for me? 
 What do you want? 
 I would like some rum... Please. 
 Coming right up. 
 Ahh. 
 You're a wonderful mother. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 Alvey : f*ck. 
 I keep getting this unknown caller. They won't leave a message. 
 Answer it. 
 No. 
 I don't f*cking talk to strangers. 
 Come here. 
 Alvey, no. 
 Come here. 
 Come here. 
 Come to daddy. Come here. 
 I can't. I can't. 
 What? 
 It's the scotch. You smell like scotch. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Don't be sensitive. It's not you. 
 It's... Everything makes me sick. 
 Yeah. Oh, thanks. Makes me feel better. 
 I'm not gonna take it personally. 
 You can take it a little personally. 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I want you to take a look at this girl Alicia. 
 I think she's special. 
 Okay, after Nate's fight. 
 No, I know. I just... I want you to take her seriously. 
 I will. I'll give her a look-see. 
 Thank you. 
 Come over here. 
 Come here. 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, my God, no. 
 Ohh. 
 What? 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's that bad? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 Good night. 
 Congrats on the win. 
 Yay. 
 [Groans] 
 [Music playing] 
 [Door closes] 
 Alvey in his office? 
 Yes. 
 Fantastic. Thank you. Don't change anything. 
 You're perfect. 
 Hey. How's the asshole? 
 f*cking miserable. The worst pain of my life. 
 Take care of your ass while you still can, my friend. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh, boy. 
 [Sighs] 
 What's that in your hand? 
 [Sighs] 
 I got the pre-fight test back this morning. 
 Ryan popped. 
 For what? 
 Cocaine. 
 Okay. I can't get a break. 
 [Sighs] Who else knows? 
 Just me for now. 
 f*ck you, "for now." What are you gonna do? 
 Are you gonna leverage me? 
 I'm gonna help you. Forget his career. This could put him back in prison. 
 [Sighs] 
 Son of a bitch. What do you want? 
 I want Ryan to sign with King Beast Promotions for the next six fights. 
 Six fights? 
 Six fights. 
 How much? 
 The same as he made for his last fight. 
 Get out of here. 
 Come on. Best I can do. 
 I can't lock this kid up for no money. 
 It's the best I can do, Alvey. 
 Three fights. 
 Three fights? 
 Three fights. Do three fights. 
 Alvey. 
 Do three fights. 
 I have to bury that test. Cocaine. 
 I have to hide it from the commission and possibly the police. 
 How long we known each other? 
 How much business we do together? 
 You're gonna leak this? You're gonna f*ck me? 
 Alvey. Alvey. 
 All these years, you're gonna f*ck me? 
 I'm not gonna f*ck you. I'm gonna help you. 
 I have to bury this test, okay? 
 And I can't do that alone, which means I can't do it for free. 
 It has to be six fights. 
 There's nothing I can do. My hands are tied. 
 Listen, Alvey, sometimes you have to be on the receiving end. 
 All in all, it's not a bad deal. 
 For you, it's a good deal. 
 For me and for him so he doesn't have to go back to prison and for you because you hold on to your golden boy and you get to work with me. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Alvey, I'm not the bad guy. 
 I'm not your problem. Ryan is your problem, right? 
 Okay. 
 [Straining] I have to go... Back to the doctor's. 
 Nobody sees this. 
 Trust me. I'm gonna make it go away. 
 Six fights. 
 You're with me now. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Music plays] 
 f*ck!
