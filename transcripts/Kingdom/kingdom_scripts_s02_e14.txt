 This is the night we've all been waiting for Ryan Wheller vs. Jay Kulina Don't leave without me tonight. 
 I won't. 
 The guy I'm training, put me on retainer for the month. 
 That's 10 gran. I need you to be available to me. 
 Have a drink. What do you say? 
 What the f*ck happened last night? That piece of sh1t put something in my drink. 
 He wanted me to give you this. Another 10 thousand to keep you on the retainer. 
 I don't want this. What's your f*cking name? 
 Will. 
 Tell him to f*ck him up. 
 Why are you being so cold? 
 Jason, you're my therapist. 
 You have got to leave me alone. 
 Get off of me. 
 I didn't rape you. 
 You're f*cking sueing me. 
 ♪ 
 Now he's sueing me for half million bucks. Do you have a lawyer? 
 Yeah! I'll make a call for you. 
 Here we go. The f*cking top!

 The light weight champion of the world... Jay Kulina.

(LAUGHING) Sí. Oh, man. Okay. Buenos días. Thank you. You too. Oh, hold on a second. (MUFFLED) Hold on. Um, here you go. Oh, gracias. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ♪♪♪♪ (SIGHS) Believe it or not, I've never been sued before. Why wouldn't I believe that? Just saying. Do you think you come off as a guy that gets sued a lot? I'm a business owner. It makes me a target, right? So what do you think? Is it bullshit? No. He's got a case. I was just getting out of my car. I didn't even touch this guy. Eh, he could say you caused the crash. You really don't have insurance? It lapsed. This guy, he's trying to kill me. I don't have a half-million dollars. Don't worry about that. That's just a jumping off point. He'll settle for less. I can't settle for less... can't settle for anything. Well, you're gonna have to. He's got a case. If you choose to engage me as your attorney, um... Engaged. First you sh... You should know that I charge $650 an hour. A f*cking hour? A f*cking hour. Holy Jesus. Yeah. Well, how many hours is this gonna be? Oh, I don't know. I'll tell you when I'm finished. And I'm kind of like sushi... you get what you pay for. Okay. Sushi. All right, I'll find the money. Great. I'll reach out to his attorney, see what they're really after. And in the meantime, you can, uh, feel free to call me if you have any questions. Great. "Foxy Roxy." Excuse me? Oh, no, I... I didn't... that's not... I didn't make that up. That's what, uh... That's what Garo called you. Ah, Garo. Yeah. He's a charming man. Yeah. He keeps me very busy. (CHUCKLES) It was nice meeting you. Yeah. I... I'll be in touch. Okay. Hey. You got a, uh... you got a guy? You got a... You seeing somebody? What? You said to ask if I had any questions and... About the case. So, you're single? I'm at work. I'm... I'm working here right now as a professional attorney. (LAUGHING) Okay, so you just tell me that you have someone and I'll... I'll leave. I... I don't go out with fighters. Why not? Because they do sh1t like let their insurance lapse. Ah, come on. Come on. Let me buy you a drink. (GROANS) I'm almost offended. Tell me to f*ck off. Go ahead, tell me to f*ck off. I work late. I stay up late. What time? 9:00. Somewhere east of Las Cienegas. Yikes. Okay. Goodbye. No. I'm gonna travel. Wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna travel for you. Just, it's not exactly my part of town, you know? Well, um, how about I pick a place and I text you? Okay. You won't forget? I won't forget. All right. Have a good one. I'll talk to you soon. Okay. Ryan : Where're you going? To the gym. Why? So I can train. Hey. Take the day off. Come back to bed. (SIGHS) I can't. You can take a day off. Why? 'Cause my sh1t doesn't matter? Whoa. Hey. That's not what I'm saying. I was just... it's one day. (SIGHS) Look, I got a training session with Alvey so I can't miss it. Do you want me to get you ice for your knee? No, Keith will get it. All right, I'll text you later. All right. Adiós. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (HORN HONKS) (BRAKES SQUEAL) (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (INHALES DEEPLY) You okay? Mm-hmm. Let's get you home. Where's Jay? His phone's dead. He's probably at the gym. (GRUNTS) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (BOTH PANTING, MOANING) Excuse me? Ma'am. There's no smoking in here. Take me out back and shoot me in the f*cking head. (SNOOTY) I couldn't agree more. (LAUGHS) (SLURPS) Ahh. Let me tell you, I enjoy this lifestyle. It doesn't suck. (LAUGHS) Doesn't suck. What time do we have to check out of this chalet? Like noon. Oh. That's just so sad. Here. Have this. (SNIFFS) (SNIFFS) Hi. Yes, um... I'd like to extend my stay for another night. (SNIFFS) Same room. Yeah, same rate's fine. Thank you. (SNIFFS) No, that's it for now. Yeah. (SNIFFS) Bye. Happy now? (SNIFFS) How do you afford this place? Hmm? That is such a rude question. Mm? Mm? Mm? Fucker, I told you I was a model and I saved my money. I just guess I'm gonna have to earn my keep. How are you gonna do that? I'm going to relentlessly please the f*ck out of you. And I'm gonna do my chores. (ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES) Kevin : Hey. Alicia Mendez, right? Who are you? Kevin Bostic. I own a company called O.C. Atomic. We make athletic apparel. Extreme sports... lot of flavor, lot of attitude. You ever heard of us? No. Sorry. (CHUCKLES) No worries. We're a new company. We're just getting into MMA and we're looking for talent. I was at your fight... f*cking mind-blowing. You mowed that chick down. It was so f*cking rad. My boys and I were going nuts. So, anyway, I thought I'd track you down, see if maybe you'd be interested in doing a little modeling for us. It's just for the website. Obviously, we'd pay you. How much? Two grand. It'd be like an hour. Let me run it by my manager. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yo, Rob, grab those samples. Here's some samples. They're all my designs. It's all made in Orange County, so it's none of that Chinese bullshit. Try them on. See if you like them. Okay. I'm shooting some pro skaters tonight. You want to come by, my cell's there, give me a shout. All right, I will. Hey. Awesome to meet you. All right, we're big fans. You are f*cking great. All right. Hit me up. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Wow. Look at you. What? "What"? It's "Enter the Dragon." (LAUGHS) Do they suck? Nnnnn... yes. They're... They're horrible. Who makes those things? These guys. They're called O.C. Atomic. They want me to model for them. Hm. It's like two grand for an hour photo shoot. I never heard of these guys. So, what, you don't think I should do it? You like those pants? I mean, I like two grand. You talk to Lisa about it? I left her a message. What do they want these photos for? Their website. Really? I don't think you should do it, hon. These guys aren't real. Look, they seem pretty cool. They're not "pretty cool." These guys eat on the edge. They're not players. Tell them, "Thanks, but no thanks." 'Cause you're training for a fight, which you are, because I'm gonna get you a fight. Garo's interested so... Really? Yes. Really. Now go take those f*cking pants off 'cause they're giving me a headache. Hurry up! (CLAPPING) Come on, hurry up! Sparring day! Sparring day! (TEAPOT WHISTLES) Dude, where are you? Listen, uh, Mom's home. Okay. Something happened at rehab. She's fine, but, um, she's here now. Call me back, all right? Or come home. Please. Bye. You heard from your brother? No, not yet. Here. Thank you. How do you feel? I'm okay. So, what do you think's gonna happen to this guy? They arrested him. He's gonna lose his license. I'm pretty sure his wife's gonna leave him. His life's sh1t. I... I told them I don't want to press charges. (SIGHS) You went through a similar situation and you didn't want to press charges, either. (SIGHS) You know what it's like. I don't want to make a big deal about this. Especially to Jay. Yeah. Whatever you want. Um, I should probably get to the gym. I'm covering Lisa's work while she's gone. How is she? She, uh... She lost the baby. Oh, sh1t. Yeah. Oh, my God. (SIGHING) Have you... Have you spoken to her? No. Nobody has. We've all reached out, but no. How's your father? (SIGHS) He's dealing with it, I think. But... I don't know. So awful. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I should probably go. Okay. If you need me, just call. Um... You good here? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm gonna take a nap. Okay. See you later. (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) (DOOR SLAMS OPEN) (PANTING) That was quick. (SIGHS) Thanks. I've been getting much faster. No, I mean... No, I mean that you should run longer, Keith. You got to... You got to keep the heart rate going. Got to keep it up. It's definitely up there. Ryan, don't worry. (BREATHING HEAVILY) What are you doing? Mm. Okay. So, you going back to the gym anytime soon? I don't know, man. I'm just... I'm resting. You're depressed. No, I'm not. (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) Yeah, I've been there, man. I know it. (VIBRATING CONTINUES) Who's that? Don't worry about it. No, Keith. Keith, don't! Keith, what the f*ck, man?! Hello. Ryan Wheeler's phone. This is Keith speaking. Hey, Keith. Hello, Mario. (WHISPERING) Keith. No, don't... Yes. Let me see if he's available. Keith, no! I'm not f*cking here. I'm not here. It's a reporter. His name is Mario Goldsmith. I know who it is. He's called 10 times. Do you want to talk to him? Obviously I don't. Ryan! What?! (SIGHS) You should talk to him. He's a fan. He's not a f*cking fan. He's a reporter. Hold for Ryan, please. No! What the f... You're being a dick, Keith. That's foul language. How're you doing, Mario? Um... Feeling pretty good, man. You know. Well, that's nice of you to say. (SNIFFS) Uh... Yeah, I have some time. Okay. I'll, uh, I'll... I'll text you the address. All right. Later. Keith. Huh? This f*cking far away from getting fired. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Little bit of power. Don't show them the power. There you go. There you go. Joe : Get in front of him. Nice. (COACHING INDISTINCTLY) Ooh. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Off the fence, off the fence. Work your feet. Work your feet. Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot! Don't stop! Don't stop! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Nice, nice! On your side. On your side! Come on, come on. Up, up, up, up. Whoo! I think she's learning something, fellas. (LAUGHS) Yeah? Come on! Come on, sugar bitch. Come on. He's waiting. Nate. What the f*ck are you doing here? I've got something for you. This way. Is that your car? It is. Good. Get inside, get the f*ck out of here, okay? I don't want to see you again. This is for you. What the f*ck's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I have a sh1t job, working for an even shittier man. That's what's wrong with me. And you're not the only one. Think I like doing this? Please take the money. He's not even gonna contact you. I'm sorry. All right? I know it's disgusting. Then why do you do it? Because the last three guys that had my job are now partners at the agency, that's why. It's the Hollywood way. Nate, you might as well get something out of it. Seriously, though, I don't want to hear from this guy again, okay? You won't. (DOOR OPENS) Hey. What, are you whacking off? What? N-Nothing. Yeah? You look a little jumpy. What's going on? I'm very busy right now. Did you... (LAUGHS) ... come to talk about something or... "Very busy." Yes, I came to find out if you spoke to Dr. Ember... if you got clearance. (DRAWER OPENS, CLOSES) (GRUNTS) ♪♪♪ 
 
 "Fully healed." Excellent. I got a call for you today. Local card, really good promoter. You interested? Yeah. Who's the guy? Don't know yet. I wanted to talk to you first. Anybody. I don't care. Well, I care, sonny boy. Let me see if it's a good matchup. If it is I'll lock it in, okay? Thank you. You're welcome. All right. See you later. (DOOR CLOSES) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Alicia, have you seen Jay? Alicia : He's probably still with Ava. Where's she? (STRAINING) Probably still in the hotel. Kick your leg down. (SIGHS) Against all odds and any rational thought, I... I woke up feeling pretty good today. Dr. Kramer : How's the drinking been? Strong. So you've been drinking heavily? (CHUCKLES) "Heavily," huh? I don't know. It's person to person, yeah? I... I know guys who take a shot of tequila, and they're pissing on a cop car. And then guys like my father... my old man... fifth of vodka every day, his hand was steady as a surgeon. Vicious man. Never sloppy. Yeah. Up at the crack of dawn every day. Perfect Windsor knot in his tie. I thought he had trouble holding down a job? Oh, he never had a f*cking job, but he loved that tie. (LAUGHS) Yeah. He's an arrogant man. Liked to put on airs. But you could never tell when he was drunk. See what I'm saying? Why are we having this conversation? I was asking about your drinking. Oh. My drinking. Alcohol's not my problem, Doc. Well, it's a depressant. You know what's a depressant? A dead baby is a depressant. A lawsuit is a depressant. Alcohol? It's a kind of relief. Jesus Christ. I told you I was having a good day, Doc. (SIGHS DEEPLY) I asked a woman out. On a date? No, for drinks... God forbid. Roxy... she's my lawyer. Tough, good-looking girl. She's got a great ass. (CHUCKLES) Closer to my own age. Do you feel ready for this? For what? For getting involved with another woman. What do you mean? 'Cause of Lisa? Among other things. You've got a lot on your plate. I... I... I... I don't d... I don't... deserve to be f*cking happy? I'm not even f*cking happy. I'm just interested in this woman. I mean, I should feel bad about that? Of course not. No, you feel how you feel. I was just... pointing out a pattern. What pattern? When you feel pain, you reach out fotr exoping mechanisms... alcohol, women, fighting. Isn't that how f*cking people live? What do you want me to do? You want me to crawl up in a... in a hole, Doc? (SIGHS) I got people depending on me. You know what I mean? I'm doing the best I f*cking can. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Jay : No, thank you, please. Jay, it's me. Come on. What?! (LOCK CLICKS) Nathaniel, "Do not disturb" per the sign. Hm? Your phone's dead. (LAUGHS) What are you on right now? Um... I am on vacation. Can I come in? (LAUGHING) Yeah, dude, get in here. Come on. Get in here. Jesus, it reeks in here. Well, that is the smell of sexual intercourse. I have been making it nonstop. What's up? Mom's home. She's got another week. What's she doing home? It's not her fault, okay? Um, the... the counselor. Yeah. The... the therapist... whatever. Um, he... he tried to rape her or something. Uh... It didn't happen, you know. She fought him off. So she's home now, though. Okay? And I've been trying to f*cking call you. (CLATTERING) Okay. Well, I guess we're gonna go home, then. Mario : All right, I'm here with Ryan Wheeler. Ryan, thanks for sitting down. You mind talking? It's all audio. Yeah, sorry. Sorry, man. First off, I just want to say sorry about your father who passed away recently. Thank you. Must have weighed heavily on your mind. Was it difficult to train and prepare for your fight with Jay? Uh, no, actually kind of the opposite. We, you know... The gym is like a sanctuary and... and I can go there and just put stuff aside and focus on my training. I hear that a lot with fighters. It's a cliché. When I watched your fight with Jay, you just didn't look like yourself. Talk to me about the camp. Did you do anything different? Did you make any changes? No, I had a good camp. Felt... Felt strong and, uh, I was ready. You seemed to be favoring the left leg. You didn't have that same explosion we're used to seeing from you. Jay cracked me with some hard kicks and... and that... made it so I couldn't push off. It kind of neutralized my... my ability to take him down. Made me one-dimensional. Were you injured before the fight? No. Rumor has it you were fighting on a torn... or partially torn... MCL. No, Jay... Jay had a great game plan. He won the fight. Were you injured coming into the fight? Yes or no. Jay won the fight, and that's all I'm gonna say about that. Were you 100%? Mario, you see, you're... you're trying to stir sh1t up. Were you 100%? No! But it... but it... but... Here's what you got to understand. We fight hurt all the time. It's... It's... It's not an excuse. It's... Jay was the better man. That's all there is to it. Have you spoken to Jay since the fight? No, but that doesn't mean anything. There's no problem between us. Do you feel like he took advantage of your injury? I feel like... Jay put on a hell of a show and he put my ass to sleep and that's all I'm gonna say about it. Fair enough. Any talk of a re-match? No, not yet. I mean, got to see what Garo wants to do... and what Alvey thinks. But you want another shot at Jay, right? Yeah. f*ck yeah, I do. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Come in. I'm fine. I'm fine. Who is he? Mnh-mnh, Jay. What's his name? No way. Don't even think about it. I just want to talk to him. Jay. No. You will make this way harder on me if you do something stupid and get yourself into trouble. I am gonna move past this, and you have to respect that. Please. Thank you. I'm sorry. I... I thought it was a good place. No, no, no, no, no, shh. Listen to me. Listen. I'm doing really well. I'm not gonna backslide. I'm finished. I can handle this. You don't have to worry about me. You look all worn out. (INHALES DEEPLY) Why don't you go get yourself something to eat. (SMOOCHES) Hm? (SNIFFLES) I'm gonna rest, and we'll talk later. Okay? All right. (SIGHS) (INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) Hey. It's Alicia Mendez. Is this Kevin? (LAUGHS) Yeah. Um, no, nothing. I talked to my people, and if you guys still want to do that photo shoot, I'm down. $2,000, right? (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) Hey, man. Hey. You in the middle of something? No, no, I'm good. What's up? Just checking in. Okay. How's your knee? I'm icing it, trying to... trying to keep the swelling down. Okay, good. Well, just keep doing that. Something else you want to say, Ryan? Well... I might have f*cked up just a little bit today. How? Uh... I had an interview with Mario Goldsmith. Why the f*ck would you do that? I don't know. He just kept calling. Oh, well, that's a great reason. So, he asked me about my knee. Somehow he knew that it was f*cked up before the fight. And I was clear that it was not an excuse. Uh-huh. I mean, he seemed like he had an agenda, so... You think? Well, I don't know how he's going to write it. But, I mean, I'm worried that it might piss off Jay. Well, I'd say there's about 150% chance Jay's gonna be pissed off. I'm sorry about that, Coach. All right, we'll deal with it. You're not pissed... right? Nah. Do me a favor, don't... Don't talk to any of these c**ts, all right? Especially that c**t. Okay. Sorry, Coach. All right. Just keep the ice on the knee, all right? I'll talk to you tomorrow. Yes, sir. And don't f*cking talk to anybody. All right. Idiot. (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS) What up, lady? Hey. I thought you guys were shooting some skateboarders? Yeah, we finished early. It's all about you, baby. Got it. (LAUGHS) You want a drink? No, I'm good. You sure? Yeah. Uh, what do you guys... Hmm. What do you guys want me to do? Oh. We'll shoot against that fence. Lot of attitude, all right? You're a hard-ass street chick, but super hot. (LAUGHS) All right. Where can I change? Uh, there's a room right around the corner. Rob will show you. You know, I'm cool. I'm good. Thanks. ♪♪♪ (SNORTING) Nate, I need you to take me back to the hotel. Whew! You're not gonna stay here tonight? Mom's going to sleep. I'll be back tomorrow morning. I... want to go back to the hotel. (SNIFFS) If you do any more cocaine, your f*cking heart's gonna explode. I have been living like a f*cking... Mormon for the past three months. My heart is strong, okay? I know how to decompress without it being a f*cking emergency or you staring at me with those big, brown, beautiful, Bambi, doe eyes. Huh? (SNIFFS) Hmm? Fine. (SNIFFS) Excellent. Now look, I can either go to Ava's, or I can find the guy who f*cked with Mom and I can murder him. (SNIFFS) Now, I am trying really f*cking hard (SNIFFS) to make the right choice, but I need your help. (SNIFFS) I'll take you back to the hotel. (SNIFFS) Excellent. Also, I need to stop at the wine and condom store... so two stops. (SNIFFS) (BOTTLES RATTLE, CLINK) Yeah. Excellent. So, mostly you do lawsuits and civil cases? Things like that? Mm-hmm. Things like that. No murderers, no serial killers, no... no El Chapo? What's the matter? My practice isn't sexy enough for you? Well, I mean, it could be a little sexier. Hmm. Mm. Excuse me, this should be with a twist, not an olive. Thank you. Mind sharing that? I guess not. Mmm. I used to be a prosecutor in Chicago. Murderers and rapists and gangs, and all that fun stuff that you see on TV. Yeah, now we're talking. Mm-hmm. Why would you ever leave that? Because it's a grind and really depressing. Haven't you ever been on a jury? Oh, sh1t. What? You're a felon. What? Of course you are. What'd you do? (LAUGHS) I may have... beat someone up in mall when I was 19. How bad? Kind of bad. He got a ride in an ambulance. Wow. Yeah. What did he do? Key your Camaro? (LAUGHS) What makes you think I'm the kind of guy that drove a Camaro? Guys like you are the reason that Camaros exist. Guys like me? Yeah. I'm insulted. (CHUCKLES) IROC, Z28. Royal blue. I f*cking knew it. T-top. This car was beautiful. Okay. You need to stop it now 'cause you're turning me on. (BOTH LAUGH) Thank you. Anyway, a long, long time ago. I'm not very proud of it. Yeah, well, at least you found your calling. I did. Cheers. (DOOR OPENS) Jay : Lady, I'm home. (DOOR CLOSES) (SNIFFS) Ta-da. You do all of this? Hmm? No. Hmm? The maids did. But I asked them to. (SNIFFS) I'm on empty. I'm gonna call Mac and get a fill up. No. Yeah. Mnh-mnh. Mm-hmm. We need sleep. (SNIFFS) Take these. Valium. Ahh. Sit. (SNIFFS) (UTENSILS CLATTER) Are you hungry? Me neither. (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Look at me. Chin up. Chin up. Look sexy, like you want to f*ck. You want to f*ck. Good. Arch your back. Turn your ass towards me. Look at the camera. Look at the camera. Yeah, yeah. Better. Better. Now turn around and pop that ass out. (MUSIC STOPS) I mean, these are good, but I think we can just go further. Okay. Um... what do you want to do? I think we take that top off. I mean, don't worry, you can put your hands over your tits and then I'll shoot you in profile so we just get a glimpse of your ass. Just a tease. Are you f*cking serious? What? I mean, if I'm naked, how am I modeling your clothes? I'm gonna shoot the logo, too. Is there a problem? Yeah. I'm uncomfortable. I mean, what are these guys even doing there? They're just watching me. Don't worry about them. They work for me. Look, I'll be honest, these photos suck. You're not what I was thinking. Now, you can either do what I say and try to salvage this shoot or I'm not gonna f*cking pay you. Okay. Um... let me just... Let me just fix my makeup up, and... and I'll be out in a second. Take your time. (LOCK CLICKS) f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck. (SIGHS) Roxanne : Tell me the truth... Were you offended when I said I didn't date fighters? No. I mean, if you were the type of woman who dated fighters, I wouldn't be interested in you. I know those girls. They all have broken glass in their heads. Well, you're a fighter. No. No, no, no, I'm a coach. Small-business owner. I'm... I'm a white-collar guy. (LAUGHS) Besides, it's a small world, and I don't do seconds. Oh, I see, you got to be the first one in. Yes. You see, now you're thinking like a fighter. (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) Speaking of which. Need to get that? Yeah, I do. This one's kind of fragile. Hey, what's up? I'm at dinner. Hey, I'm... I'm at a photo shoot, and I'm freaking the f*ck out. These guys are just really weird, all right? It's a bad vibe. I told you not to do it. I know. I just... There's like five guys out there, and they want me to get naked. I have no idea what the f*ck to do. All right, stay there. All right? I'm gonna come get you. Don't... don't leave and... and text me the address. Thank you. I'll send it to you now. Apologies. Got to go? I do. She got herself in a little bit of trouble. Can we do this again? I think we were having fun. Yeah. Yeah? Mm-hmm. All right, great. Let me just, uh... Let me take care of this. I got a job. You sure? Yeah, we're good. (LAUGHS) You got a job? Mm-hmm. All right, well, uh... I'll call you. Okay. (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR OPENS) Where is she? Room around the corner, man. c**t. Open up, it's me. (LOCK CLICKS) You all right? Where's your sh1t? Right over there. Next time, you listen to me, all right? Kevin : Hey, I'm not paying her. f*ck you and f*ck your money, asshole. Bitch. That was stupid.
