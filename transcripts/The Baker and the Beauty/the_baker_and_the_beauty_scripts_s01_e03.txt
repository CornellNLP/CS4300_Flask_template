 [upbeat music] 
     My name is Daniel Garcia. 
   My life used to be pretty normal. 
   I worked at my family's bakery in Little Havana  with my mom, my dad,  my crazy brother, and my little sister. 
   I had a girlfriend. 
  Life was good. 
   Until she decided to propose. 
     Will you marry me? 
     And I decided to say... 
   No. 
   That's when everything changed. 
   [people gasp] 
   I met Noa Hamilton,  as in international superstar, fashion icon,  one of the most famous women in the world    that Noa Hamilton! 
   The next few days were crazy, fun, sexy, romantic. 
   She rocked my world. 
   You're fearless. 
   And my family's too. 
   What happened? 
    Your girlfriend happened. 
   She's changed our lives. 
     Noa Hamilton is playing my song at her party. 
     [gasps] 
    [speaking Spanish] 
     But then her manager said  she picked up people like me all the time. 
     Normal guys. 
   She does this after every heartbreak. 
     Noa Hamilton, the model,  and Colin Davis, the actor, have broken up. 
     I just flew halfway across the planet  to tell you that I love you. 
     So you can imagine how surprised I was  by her invitation. 
     I'm going to Puerto Rico next week. 
   I'd like you to come. 
     I don't get it. 
  I don't get it. 
   How can you just act like all you're doing is packing? 
     Because that is all I'm doing. 
    Aw. 
   Daniel, I don't think you understand  the universe bending nature of what is happening. 
   You're in denial, Daniel! 
     Taking Baker Boy on this trip is a big mistake. 
   Oh! 
  And it sends the wrong message. 
     Like what? 
     Like that you and her are gonna do the deed. 
   The idea that my brother and the most famous woman in the world      Might possibly hop into bed together. 
   He's gonna be clingy and awkward,  not to mention a public relations nightmare. 
   Help me out here, Pipes. 
    I think it'll be fun. 
   Lewis, relax. 
    It's one day and one night. 
     It's an overnight. 
  An out of town getaway. 
     It's a charity benefit for a school she's helping build. 
     You think he cares about that, Miss Skinny dip? 
     It was not like that. 
   I mean, it was a great night,  but being with her, it just feels natural. 
     He's sweet. 
    She's smart. 
     He's kind. 
    She's funny. 
     Yeah, okay. 
  I'm gonna throw up. 
     I'm gonna throw up. 
     Hi, mi amor. 
    Mom. 
   I'm going to Puerto Rico, not the moon. 
     I don't care. 
  Mira. 
   This is your grandfather's rosary. 
   I want you to say three Hail Marys  before the plane takes off. 
     Ma. 
    Okay? 
   What? 
    Do you hear yourself? 
     Let me ask you something, Miss Sabelotodo. 
   If I'm wrong, it costs him nothing. 
   But if I'm right     Hmm.

   Just don't make me laugh. 
    Can't make any promises. 
     I have to focus. 
   I'm learning tonight's speech, and I'm dyslexic,  so it takes me a little longer. 
     That's why you do this stuff with schools. 
     After the storm, I was seeing images  of children playing in the street  because they didn't have schools to go to. 
   So I decided to do something about it. 
     That's really cool     Okay. 
   I've got updates for you,  and ground rules for you.

    Yes. 
     Lewis! 
     This is your chance to finally meet her  and show her how fabulous you are. 
   As for you, I need your signature. 
   It's an NDA   non disclosure agreement    basically saying that you won't talk about your time with Noa. 
     He doesn't have to sign that. 
    No, no. 
   If it makes Gucci happy, then okay. 
     Yeah. 
  It makes Gucci happy. 
   All right, next. 
   In case you both lose your minds,  no touching, no kissing, no whispering sweet nothings,  no anything that the press can interpret as romance, okay? 
     Okay, NDA's good, PDA's bad. 
  I got it. 
     You know, I know it's all the rage for most celebrities  to live every twist and turn of their personal lives  on social media, but Noa's not most celebrities, okay? 
   Her brand connotes more than good taste,  it connotes class. 
   Think Kennedy, not Kardashian. 
   Do you know who the Kennedys were? 
     Okay, I think he gets it, Lewis. 
     Does he? 
   Because honey, we were able to dodge  full blown tabloid coverage of your breakup with Colin  only because the two of you didn't feed the fire. 
     Gucci, it makes sense. 
  I won't make any more jokes.

  Minor inconvenience. 
   Mr. 
  Weiss, fantasy can be dangerous. 
   Too many real estate agents don't know this. 
   They'd walk their clients through this house  and ask them to imagine what it could be. 
   Me? 
   I'd sell it based on what it already is. 
   I'm not interested in appealing  to dreamers who never buy anything.

     Melanie, I'm such a huge fan. 
    Thank you so much, Noa. 
   And thank you for meeting me on such short notice. 
     No problem. 
  My pleasure. 
   Can I have a water, please? 
     Look, I think it's great  what you're doing in Puerto Rico and around the world. 
   I'm sorry I can't be at your event tonight,  but I have this for your foundation. 
     This is very generous of you. 
     I just hope it doesn't feel like a bribe. 
     How so? 
     I have a film starting production next week,  and I have an actress who just checked herself into rehab. 
   It's a small role, but I've been banging my head  trying to come up with the right fit for the part,  and I thought of you. 
     [exhales] 
  Wow. 
   Well, I would be very happy to read for that role. 
     You don't have to audition. 
   The part is yours if you want it. 
   It's three weeks work,  and we would need you there in Toronto tomorrow, ideally. 
     Wait a second. 
  Toronto. 
   Is this the film you're doing with Colin Davis? 
     Yes, he said you'd be perfect for it  and that the personal history wouldn't be an issue. 
     So is she great, or is she great? 
   [tense music] 
     I told you you would love Piñones. 
   [laughs] 
 
 
 
  So what else, mi amor? 
   What else? 
  What else? 
   What is it like to travel with a celebrity? 
     I mean, it's different than I imagined. 
   I thought it'd be all parties and stuff,  but she spent hours talking to the press  about helping the island  and just how much she could help it. 
   I mean, I don't know. 
  She's just a great person. 
     Well, depending on how tonight goes,  maybe you'll invite her over for dinner. 
     [whispers indistinctly] 
    [laughs] 
   I'm keeping her away from our dinners for as long as possible. 
     What is that supposed to mean? 
     Okay, I gotta go, Ma. 
  Bye. 
     [scoffs] 
  Now we're not good enough for our son. 
   [both speaking Spanish] 
     I know it's a leap, and maybe a scary one. 
   I wouldn't be here if I didn't think  you and I would make a great team. 
     It means so much to hear you say that. 
     Just let me know tomorrow, either way. 
     Absolutely. 
     Hey, Colin. 
    Thanks, Melanie. 
     How dare you use acting  to worm your way back into my life. 
     Wow. 
  Slow down, Noa. 
     So this has nothing to do with us? 
     Yeah, sure it does    I mean, in the fact that I thought  we were still friends, at least. 
     [laughs] 
  Oh. 
   And if I say yes,  then I have to be in Toronto by tomorrow. 
     Honey, how are you feeling about it? 
     Confused. 
    For what it's worth,  it's about working with Melanie Caan, not Colin. 
   It's about chasing your dream. 
  I think you should do it. 
     I hate to admit it, but I think he's right. 
   Colin is a side note. 
   This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
     Piper, what happened? 
     Did you fall in the pool? 
     A water main underneath the hotel burst, and... 
   It's a geyser in there. 
     Well, are they fixing it? 
    Oh, no. 
   You don't understand. 
  It's all ruined. 
   The food, the decorations    we have hundreds of people who paid to come to a gala. 
   There is no gala. 
     [stammers] 
  I'm so sorry, Noa. 
   You know what, I will wait outside,  and I'll explain to everybody      No, no, no. 
  We're not giving up. 
     Well, what about another hotel? 
     Well, it's not about the space, Lewis. 
   It's about all the stuff that we put in. 
   The food, the decorations   it's all destroyed. 
     But still, Noa is right. 
  We do not give up. 
   We have two hours to recreate a meticulously planned gala  that celebrates children and education. 
   And we're in a predominantly Catholic country,  so we are due for a miracle. 
     I got it! 
     Baker Boy, no offense,  but when I said miracle, I didn't mean pastelitos. 
     How about a whole island of cuisine?

     Everybody wants the fantasy   the dream, the sports car,  even if they can only afford the rusty pickup. 
   So you sell them the rusty pickup,  and make them believe they're getting the sports car. 
     Yup. 
   Wait, am I the rusty pickup in this scenario?
