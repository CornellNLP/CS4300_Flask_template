 Hey, Garcia.   
 Previously on "The Baker and the Beauty"...   
 Deering has a zero tolerance policy towards violence.   
 And, Amy, I am forbidding you from seeing her any more.   
 It's time for us to expand. 
This is our chance, Papi.   
 Asbestos?   
 It has to be removed.   
 I have prostate cancer.   
 - So you're gonna tell Noa? 
- When I'm ready.    
 I will be making my acting debut in Melanie Caan's next feature.    
 We all know that you have a new man in your life.    
 I want to talk about the interview that his ex-girlfriend released this morning.    
 Would you like to respond?    
 That publicity is gonna be bad.    
 That doesn't sound like a woman who is fit to run a company, now does it?    
 They're putting together an emergency board meeting.    
 They're gonna vote to remove you as president.    
 My father's trying to take my company from me.    
 Go to the press. Tell them the truth!    
 I did!    
 Everything I said is exactly what happened.    
 Which one's better in bed?

 Regulators in Singapore have frozen construction of my new high-rise.     
 I'm having a hard time finding banks who are willing to fund me on a short-term cash basis.     
 I'm facing losses. You know my motto.     
 "Never a loss in any quarter."     
 I'll name Mark Logan as CEO, and in return, he's agreed to let me use the Noa Corp balance sheet to guarantee my debt.     
 Why make a deal with him?     
 Make a deal with me.
