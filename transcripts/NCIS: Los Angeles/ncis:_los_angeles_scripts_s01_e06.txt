 (party guests chattering) 
 Lemon drop? 
 Not really my thing, but, uh, keep 'em coming for everybody else. 
 You know, if you ever get tired of these downtown party ho's, I'm around. 
 Whoa! I didn't think the Marines made that much. 
 You're not from here, are you? 
 Seattle. 
 How'd you know? 
 L. A. girls never ask where the money comes from. 
 Gonna take a lap. 
 Catch ya, Amy. 
 Hi! 
 Hey! 
 Yo, B. 
 What's up, Alex? 
 Top of the world, dawg. 
 What's up? 
 (cell phone rings) 
 (ringing continues) 
 Brandon Valdivia. 
 No way. 
 It's not true. 
 WOMAN: Where's Brandon? 
 Is this an argument? 
 No, it's a difference of opinion. 
 I happen to be right, you happen to be wrong. 
 Which makes it an argument. 
 And for the record-- 
 I'm right, you're wrong. 
 Operators are made, they're not born, G. 
 Skills can be taught. 
 Mm-hmm. Hey, what was, what was that guy's name? 
 Uh, Swishman? 
 Fishman? 
 Swisher. 
 Swisher. 
 Chuck Swisher. 
 Chuck Swisher. 
 Used to sit and study the ops manual in the UC van. 
 Yeah. 
 He knew regulation book backwards and forwards. 
 Terrible operator. 
 Yeah. 
 Who used to overcompensate for his lack of undercover skill by knowing everything about surveillance. 
 But that doesn't make him a bad agent. 
 Teachers learn to be teachers. 
 Cops learn to be cops. Mm-hmm, and somebody taught LeBron how to dunk from the free throw line. SEALs learn to be SEALs, G. Oh, that's right, you couldn't swim when you enlisted, could you? How long did they let you wear the floaties? Look, I will take a lazy natural operator over an all-night studier any day of the week. It's too late. I already did it. Hmm. Nature versus nurture-- quite the conundrum. You cannot use the word "conundrum" before 9:30, Hetty. 9:31, which means, Mr. Callen, you're late. So are you, Mr. Hanna. Late for what? Corporal Brandon Valdivia-- 25, single-- went off the roof of the downtown Apex last night. Valdivia was stationed at a supply unit at Camp Pendleton. He just returned from a deployment in Iraq three months ago. Diagnosed PTSD, possible suicidal ideation, anxiety disorder. DOMINIC: And because of his mental health history, LAPD has already ruled it a suicide. And we're investigating because...? DOMINIC: Valdivia's family is tight with their congressman. The congressman calls SecNav. SecNav calls the commandant of the Marine Corps, who calls Director Vance. It's the proverbial "Pentagon Shuffle." Downtown Apex is a high-end party spot. They mix a meaningful mojito. HETTY: They have the most marvelous pool on the roof. It stays open all night, and it's kept at a balmy 92 degrees. Have you people never heard of a "staycation"? Did Valdivia have any kind of record-- in the service or out? No, not even a parking ticket. Did he have a room at the Apex? ERIC: No, but I got a hit on some turn-on service notices for gas and electric. The social security number matches Valdivia's. Looks like he had an off-base apartment. Culver City. What's he doing with an apartment 90 miles from Pendleton? Certainly not taking a staycation. So you think Hetty was born or made? Hatched. How long we been working together, G? Two years. Three, next month. And the longest you ever had the same partner was...? Your point? My point is we complement each other because I'm a natural... I'm natural and you're made-- I get it. No, no, I'm the natural operator. Right. Well, if you're natural, then I'm supernatural. That doesn't even make sense. Let's see if Valdivia left anything for us. Clear. Clear. Hmm. ESPN. Military Channel. (TV clicks on) Ooh-rah. I win. Beer and mustard. You sure you don't live here? Meaningless s*x with an endless stream of beautiful women-- hmm! How empty. This guy look depressed to you? No suicide note. It's like a post office in here. What do you think this guy was sending? Guitar Hero? What? Receipts for the last two weeks for 20, 40, 60, 80... 160 copies of Guitar Hero. All paid for in cash. A bunch of mom-and-pop shops. Two and three at a time. Why buy multiple copies of a video game? 'Cause it kicks major ass. I'll tell you one thing, this guy, Valdivia, was overpaying big time. So, basically, we've got a dead Marine with no skill at volume buying. Oh, ye of little faith. We've got receipts. CALLEN: Ever play Guitar Hero? Mm-mm. I prefer the real thing. Django Reinhardt, Gabor Szabo-- a little Hendrix thrown in for good measure. Dominic Vail, I am liking you more and more every day. Speaking of video games... Brandon Valdivia went off the roof here  and landed here, 227 feet down. Now, normally, determining cause of death in a high fall is all about launch speed. This one is more about angle and placement. Valdivia landed on his back, relatively close to the building. Arms spread, in what's known as the "upturned crucifix" position. That's a long way down. His body could've flipped over during the fall. Unlikely. But not impossible. Also, he had a broken jaw. From the fall? Not if he landed on his back. And there was no bruising on the face, which indicates that the break was fresh. He was punched. Brandon Valdivia was unconscious before he even went over the rail. All right, so someone knocked him out with a shot to the jaw and they threw him backwards off the roof. Our suicide just became a murder. It'd take someone pretty strong to throw a 200-pound Marine off the side. (dialing phone) Eric, I got one camera up on the roof. I'm on it. It's even better at night. Most things are. I'm the events coordinator for the hotel. Callen. Special Agent Kensi Blye. Did you know Brandon Valdivia? Everybody knew Brandon. It's so sad. Was he a guest at a lot of these parties? Guest? He was the host. For the last three Saturday nights, Brandon paid for everything. How much are we talking? Open bar, hors d'oeuvres, tray-passed shots... This week, $27, 000 in cash. That didn't surprise you? Who questions cash? Don't ask, don't tell. Amy was his waitress. I'll be right back. You waited on Brandon Valdivia last night? He wasn't drinking. Did you see him with anyone in particular? Just this guy he always hung with. Alex, I think. I don't know his last name. You ever see Brandon and Alex ever get into it or anything? Fight? No. They loved it here, especially Alex. You know, all you meet in this job is Eurotrash and wannabe actors. Brandon was different. He actually cared about who I was, where I was from. He had a lot of money, but mostly he seemed like a nice, smart guy. Now, he's gone and that sucks. I got customers. Hey, I'll be right back. Your Alex is most likely Alex Walder. He's Valdivia's rackmate. They were deployed together in Iraq and now they're assigned to the supply unit. The staff NCO in charge is, uh, Gunnery Sergeant Jerrold Mulhearn. Yeah, but he ships so much gear out of Pendleton that they call him "Gunny Pallet." Like a pallet-- okay. (clears throat) Great. Okay. All right, Sam and Callen are headed to the base and Kensi's coming back here. The quality's lousy. Yeah, not good enough to run facial recognition. What about the elevators? All right. Accessing last night's footage now. Anyone pushing the top button went to the roof. (chuckling) Whoa! Hello! If only your vocabularies could be augmented as much. (clucks tongue) (clears throat) Busted... MAN: We move more gear out of here than any other dock in the Marine Corps. 100, 000 tons a year. Everything from TOW missiles to toilet paper. That's impressive. Any idea who would want to see Corporal Valdivia take a swan dive off a roof? Not a lick. Kid was too stupid to have enemies. I mean, no offense to the dead, but, uh, that rock couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel. What about his hoochmate? Lance Corporal Walder? Yeah. Dumber than a box of hair. Went into sick bay this morning. Probably swallowed his toothbrush. Huh. Those two get along? Yeah, like dumb and dumber. Walder followed Valdivia around like a little lost puppy. Till last week. Uh, they got up in each other's grill, ended up rolling around on the deck. Figured I either had to pull them apart or turn a hose on them. Know what that was about? Hell, no. I just wanted it to stop. Appreciate it, Gunny. You look like you can still handle yourself. You Marine? Navy. Been out a while, though. Well, I'm just an old box kicker, so you can take this with a grain of salt, but was a time when you could make most of these kids into regular Marines. Now, if they aren't gangbangers or convicts, they're just some other kind of major knucklehead. It's almost getting too hard to be worth it. I hear you. I said... "almost." Yeah, right. Hello! Brain-dead? I see half a dozen... Gunny Pallet said Walder went to sick bay. No, I checked. He's not there, and he's not in his rack. PALLET: I said move! Eric. Yeah, get me an I. D. On, uh, Alex Walder's vehicle. Tell me if it's left the base. Checking that for you right now. Why buy multiple copies of the same video game? When I see multiple purchases, I think one thing-- resale. People buy stuff and sell it online all the time. All right, so first, we search for the item, and then we see who has the most active listings. Biggest local seller is B Dog V in Culver City. Brandon Valdivia. He was buying the games for an average of $129, but selling them for half that at auction. Buy high, sell low? That doesn't make sense. Maybe they were fakes. No, his feedback is perfect. 100%-- right there. Maybe we're looking at the wrong side of the equation. Eric, can you compare the retailers where Valdivia bought the games to each other? (sighs) Well, we already know they were small operations. I mean, they aren't owned by the same family, if that's what you mean. They're spread out all over L. A. County. No discernible geographic pattern. What about where the stores got the games? Uh, distributors, wholesalers. All right. Different wholesalers. A few had the same distributor. They all use different banks, but... Each bank is... wait for it... ...on the Secret Service Counterfeit Currency Alert. Different banks, different reporting. And that's why Valdivia went to so many different stores. And that's why it took Treasury two weeks to issue an alert. Valdivia bought all those video games with what the Treasury is calling top quality counterfeit bills. ERIC (over phone): I got to call you back. Thanks, Eric. He bought them with the fakes, sold them online, got real money in return. (chuckles) Not a bad little plan. No, but where is a 25-year-old corporal getting high-quality counterfeit Benjies? Quality's too good for them to be homemade. He's... he was probably buying 'em. (cell phone rings) Yeah. All right, take a look at your laptop. I'm streaming you something now. I've got a search going through Kaleidoscope. And I got a hit on Alex Walder's car. Where? It just went off Pier 60 in San Pedro. NEWSCASTER: ...trying to locate any survivors. The accident was caught on a dockside security camera. Stunned onlookers watched in horror as the car Went off of the pier of the Los Angeles Harbour. Thanks. CALLEN: Okay, so, Valdivia gets tossed off a building, Walder takes a long drive off a short pier. And somehow they're all connected over counterfeit hundreds. You're going in, right? The police divers can handle it, I'm sure. Yeah, but you're a SEAL. You've been looking a little pale lately. Maybe you should go. Uh-uh. Too many bullet holes in me, Sam. I'd sink. The tide's going out. The body could have floated out after impact. The current would have pulled him away pretty quick. Eric, you got any more security camera angles here at Pier 60? Already checking. Oh, and the Secret Service wants to talk to you about counterfeit bills. Stall them. Too late. (sighs) Natalie Giordano, Secret Service. I like your club house. You guys got a secret handshake and a stash of girlie mags? Sam Hanna. Callen. Just Callen. Nice to meet you, Callen just Callen. (sighs) These are the bills that, uh, Valdivia passed. GIORDANO: 1995 series. Rotating serial numbers. Beautiful craftsmanship. Portrait, vignette, ornaments, lettering, script, scrollwork. Not some Photoshop job, either. These were printed in a press with real plates. These are seriously tight. We need to, uh, get into the distribution network, and find out who sold these bills to Valdivia. We're tracking a murder. Generally, hundreds show up in Las Vegas near the casinos, where no one bats an eye at big bills. That's where I'm stationed. You ever get up to Vegas? Now and then. Hundreds are double hard to counterfeit, because they have to beat the pen. On counterfeit notes, the detection pen reacts to the starch in the paper and turns brown. So the printing quality is amazing, the paper is... not so much. That's why Valdivia passed it at the mom-and-pop stores-- less likely to use the pen. So, I sait's an open book on everything we find. I catch my counterfeiter, you catch your murderer. Who knows, maybe it's one and the same. Isn't it great to share? Well, regardless, I will be staying here until we get a collar on whoever printed these. Can you recommend any good restaurants nearby? FYI, no salads. CALLEN: I think room service is probably your best bet. SAM: Room service? Really? She did leave that door pretty wide open with the restaurant thing. Could've drove a truck through it, G. I don't date law enforcement. I think you might want to make an exception this time. Sam, you know the rule. If they got their own handcuffs, I'm out. Look, I think you're making a big mistake. The room service she wants to order isn't on the menu. Eric, tell me something good. Got into the traffic cams on the pier. I pulled this. It's not the best image, but it's good enough to see. CALLEN: Nobody in the driver's seat. A few people on the pier, they, uh, see the car go over. They run toward the crash. SAM: Except that guy. He's walking away. Zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom... I ran him through facial recognition. Hello, Alex. KENSI: Guys. We've got a broadcast beacon from Walder's phone, begins at the pier. He checks his voice mails, then switches off his phone. He's only done this four times, but it's enough to track a pattern. It runs north up the 405 to the 10 East. He could have hitched a ride, or jumped in the back of a truck. ERIC: Hey, hey. Nine minutes ago, someone checked Walder's cell phone voice mail from a pay phone on Wilshire and Western. Yeah, he's using pay phones now. He thinks it's harder to trace. He's moving east, and fast. I mean, what is Walder doing? What a good Marine is supposed to: improvising. Bring up the L. A. Metro map. I want to see the Purple Line. He's on the subway. Next stop's the last one: 7th and Fig. A block away from the Apex Hotel. Why's he going back there? Maybe he left something behind. CALLEN: Walder? SAM: Don't do it. Don't do... (groans) Get your hands behind your back! What's the matter with you? You're trying to jump off the roof? What do you have here? What do you have here? What is this? Are you crazy? No. Then you must've been real scared then. So scared you thought jumping off a roof was better than getting caught by us? Who'd you think we were, Alex? CALLEN: Why'd you go back to the roof? I wanted to honor my friend, to be close to him one more time. Maybe you shouldn't have thrown him off the roof. I didn't kill Brandon. He was my best friend. Everyday in Iraq I was sure we weren't coming back, but Brandon was like, "Dawg, keep your head down and follow me." And I did. I did, and I came back home. Your gunny said he had to pull you two apart. I was just trying to get him to stop having the parties. Stop spending the money. I told him. He was going to get killed for it. Killed by who? There was this kid. Jason. He was a couple of years older than me, and I lived with him in a foster home. He looked out for me. Not for any other reason than it was just the right thing to do. He used to make up these, uh, "G" names for me: G-Money, G-Ride, G-Force... One night, our foster dad got drunk and he beat him to death. I felt bad 'cause I didn't do anything to help him. I still do. Who killed Brandon, Alex? Rick. Rick Pargo. Wow. That was pretty damn cool, Callen. Any of it true? Rick Pargo. You know him? Blast from the past. He's pretty well known by our guys at Treasury. KENSI: Commercial printer. Charged with forgery and counterfeiting. Seven times, and no convictions. I mean, we've been after this guy for years. Eric, see if you can place Rick Pargo on the hotel rooftop the night Brandon Valdivia was killed. Checking that for you right now. 
 
 Nate? He is terrified. You're kidding? So, why go back to the place your friend was murdered? He said he wanted to honor his friend. Mmm, fear is a primal instinct. It-it overrules everything, including cerebral concepts-- like-like honor. Whatever took him back there was so important that he had to suppress his fear. Until he ran into you guys and... Then the fear kicked back in. And I don't blame him, 'cause I'd probably want to throw myself off a roof if I saw you guys coming at me, too. (clears throat) You left a few things out, Alex. What? No. You heard of "Good Cop, Bad Cop." This is called "Bad Cop, Bad Cop." He can do things to you to make waterboarding feel like a sponge bath. You said you went back to honor him. What do you know about honor? We were on patrol in Baghdad. Clearing buildings. We were in this huge old print shop-- had presses and plates and everything. Took a look at the plates. They're for making American money. Hundred dollar bills. We took a set of plates, hid 'em with our gear. Smuggled 'em when we came back. Where'd you find Rick Pargo? He found us. Someone must have told him. We gave Pargo the plates, he made some test batches, but... The paper wasn't good enough. SAM: Let me guess. Brandon was supposed to destroy the bills, but instead, he laundered them online. One more question. What's this? Brandon gave it to me the night he was killed. It's a serial number generator. Agent Giordano, we're in the middle of something here. I thought we were going to share. It generates a new serial number on counterfeit bills. This is a good one, too. Saddam had master forgers working all over Iraq. That's why they're printing 1995 series bills. They're using old plates. It's a hell of a case you guys stumbled into. You're a bartender. You work at a little place in the Valley. Yeah, I'm also Alex Walder's girlfriend. Oh, the things we do for our country. (laughing) I once had to hide in a cake. (sighs) Never mind. That brute Pargo will undoubtedly frisk you, so a wire is out of the question. Ah, a watch. Aha. Tank style, leather band. Microphone and transmitter smartly concealed within. I like. Rick Pargo is in many respects a classic narcissist. He's beaten seven cases against him in the past. I consulted on one of them and I saw him in the courtroom. He literally acts like he's above the law, and that makes him very dangerous. Okay, I'll tread lightly. Pargo will construe any conciliatory gesture as weakness. It's best if you consider at least one well-timed bold gesture. Like kicking his ass? One more thing, courtesy of our colleague from the Secret Service. Have you met her yet? I have not yet met Agent Giordano, but... I'm under the impression from multiple sources that you could take her. I'm looking for Rick Pargo. Who's asking? Alex Walder's girlfriend. Never heard of him. This way. You a cop? (grunts) (whirring loudly) I can't hear her. This guy's not taking any chances. How long do you want to give her? A minute, then we go in. Enjoying yourself? Are you? You got my number generator? It's safe, like Alex. Alex is dead. So you think. I believe you might be interested in seeing this. (beeping) Born operator. Yeah. Well, then maybe we'll call Alex and tell him to bring the number generator over here, if he wants to see you alive again. (snaps fingers) (grunts) Hold it. Move away. My boyfriend's an idiot. I'm just here to make a deal. That was really impressive. I think I like you. All right, darling. (machine's humming stops) With the number generator in place, I can print 20 million in under two hours. What stopped you before? Paper. Yours can't beat the pen, can it? That's why I'm here. I have access to a primo paper source. Let's say I'm interested. If I introduce you, how do I know I won't end up like Brandon? (chuckling) You think I killed Valdivia? I'm just a businessman. And I'm just a debutante. I got a partner who was supposed to come through with the paper. So far he hasn't. That's what got Valdivia so impatient. Now, Valdivia's not with us anymore. 4:30. Oh, uh, just so you know, if this goes south, I will not hesitate to kill you. What, you want to frisk me again before I leave, Rick? We're in. CALLEN: Gordon Taymis... Youngest son of a prominent Canadian paper-making family. You think I ought to wear a tie? Hmm, you're disillusioned. Your father wears a tie. I thought Canadians were all supposed to be happy. Never mistake politeness for contentment. What are the three "P's"? Let's see, we've got printing press. Mm-hmm. Patent green ink. Yeah. And paper, of course. Ah! What's the, uh, power requirement for a ten-ton intagl press? That's a trick question, Hetty. It takes at least a 20-ton press to get the proper raised finish on authentic paper. You're ready, Mr. Callen. Thank you. Take her out to dinner, after the case is over. Agent Giordano? Mm. Then take Sam the next night. You know how he gets. (chuckles) ♪ Rick. Gordon. How're you doing? Hey. I hear you're in the, uh, paper industry. Uh, family business. Uh, third generation. My old man was a printer. Ink in the veins. I'm sorry, um... This just, this just doesn't feel right. It's okay. It's okay, relax. I'm just used to meeting in board rooms, not in bars. Sit down, sit down. Finish your drink. I've seen your work. It's ex-extraordinary. 20-ton intaglio press? Mm-hmm. And I mix my own ink. 1995 series, though, that's old paper. Single security strip. It's still in circulation. That's your problem. You need the right paper to match. My family company, we have the contract with the U. S. Bureau of Printing and Engraving. We supply all the cotton and linen rag. Yeah, but every single sheet has to be accounted for. It does. I'm the compliance officer. Really? Hmm. So, what? The family business doesn't pay? My current level of compensation is, um, inadequate. You see, Gordon has a family and a wife in Vancouver. And a very good friend in L. A. How much paper do you need? Three-foot stack should do it. (sighs) Tha... that's 2, 000 sheets. That's $20 million. Can't handle it? How are you going to move $20 million? Oh, I got a window once every 90 days, where we can unload all we print. At par, guaranteed. Par? A hundred cents on the dollar? My cut's 40%. (laughs) You get 20. And you take care of her out of your end. And I'll need a sample. Sample's right in front of you. Son of a... KENSI: Pargo said "we." He's got a partner. Eric couldn't place Pargo or Eddie on the roof. Neither of them killed Valdivia. But if we can deliver the paper, maybe we can meet the partner. Nobody gets a hundred cents on the dollar for counterfeit money. And what is this 90-day window all about? The bigger question is, how do we get 2, 000 sheets of paper by tomorrow? ERIC: Hey, Callen. Somebody's clicking through your backstop Web site. Hmm! "Supplying high-end cotton and linen products to only the most discerning customers worldwide." Nice turn of phrase, Eric. I minored in Lit. Okay, so I traced the IP address back to Rick Pargo. Oh, he's going deeper now. I hid a hard to read shipping manifest for the U. S. Bureau of Printing and Engraving in the background of one of the shots. So if he clicks on it, he's hooked. He's downloading the JPEG now. (cell phone rings) Hmm. Yeah? PARGO: Hey, Gordy, how're you doing? Hi, Rick. Looks like you and me are going into business. I need paper. Look at you. You got in with Pargo. Is that a Double-Double? I missed lunch. We're sharing, right? (sighs) So, how much paper you need? 2, 000 sheets. Mmm, mmm... by tomorrow. That's gd. Testing my wire, Sam. I got you in my earpiece, G. We're going in. Search 'em! (laughing) You're my newfound friend, Gordy, you know that? Got the number generator. Uh, where's my money? Your money'll be here in a bit. In the meantime, we've got work to do. You are a printer, right? Ink's in my veins. We'll see. Let's go. Unload it! All right. I'll ink it, you wipe it-- that work? Let's do it. (chuckling) Just enough to fill the grooves. Pressure does the rest. That's a born operator, Dom. (chuckles) Oh, yeah! Three seconds, $3, 000. There's no feeling like it. (laughing) All right, they're printing. We got all we need. No, you've got all you need. I'm waiting on one more player. Yeah, if he ever shows up. I'm here to catch a counterfeiter. I'm trying to catch a murderer. And it's not Pargo, because he wasn't on the roof. (printer powers down) Already dry. They're flawless. (vehicle approaching) Company. Eyes open, G. It's Gunny Pallet. He's Pargo's partner. Unbelievable. All right, I'm going in. Dom, if the truck leaves, follow it. PARGO: It's all there. 20 million. Just like the real thing. Yeah, it's, uh, all in the paper. I'm sorry. Uh... You want your money. Here you go. Guys, we had a deal. Where, where you going to get your paper next time? Whoa, whoa, whoa! I mean... W-wait a minute. I... All right, we can, we can renegotiate. I mean... how does ten percent sound? Sounds expensive. Wait until we leave, then take care of them. Frank! (gunshots) Get in there! Get in there! Now! Now! Get in! Let's go! I told you I'd kill you. Pargo! It's over. Eddie! Eddie's taking a nap. Kensi. (Pargo grunting) Turn over! Dom? Following the money. Callen, Pallet's back at Camp Pendleton. And the counterfeit money's still on board. We're on our way. You've got $20 million in counterfeit hundreds. Why would you go back to the loading dock? 'Cause you're going to ship something. Eric, give me a list of all the flights leaving Pendleton in the next four hours and what's on them. Sending the manifest to you now, Sam. SAM: We got payrolls in Afghanistan,   embassy ATMs all over the Middle East and Asia, $20 million in cash flying out tonight. Pallet just printed 20 mil, and he's swapping it for the real thing. We should be in on that swap, then. Tell Hetty we need to intercept the real money. Plane leaves in two hours, G. CALLEN: Stand by, everyone. The game is in play. Armored truck on its way in. PALLET: Get that pallet unloaded! We need to sign for this moneySergeant. Signed and sealed, Corporal. On your way. Aye, aye, Gunny. Hello! The pallet on the right goes on the aircraft! Your right, not my right, Brain-dead! Yes, Sergeant! Let's move it! Let's go, Lollygags! We've got aircraft going OCONUS at 1800. Now move! That aircraft ain't gonna wait for us! That's going 8, 000 miles! Get it secure! Move! What the hell? SAM: Sorry to disappoint you, Gunny. CALLEN: The C130 with your fake $20 million's been turned around. What happened to "almost, " Gunny? The federal government prints $20 million every hour. And for what? Two more wars the civilians won't let us win? That's how you justify it? I wouldn't do that if I was you, Gunny. You tell me that it's the same Navy now that you enlisted in, Chief. I can't say it is. But they still ask the same of us. And that was always good enough for me. Not for me. Not anymore. Don't do it, Gunny. Get down! Don't move! (Pallet grunting) Down! (handcuffs tightening) Part of Pallet's job was shipping $20 million overseas every three months, so he decided to make a switch. Valdivia's mistake was spending it too soon. Messed up Pallet's plan, so he threw him off the roof. Yeah, just leaving. On my way. Born operator? He's growing on me. Mr. Callen. Hetty. Uh, while congratulations are in order, there is one small loose end. The money. The money. Today, Mr. Callen. Strangely, the Treasury wants its money back. Done. You don't want to count it? (chuckles) So do you want to go get a hamburger? Or we could order room service. I've got this rule about dating cops. So you mean I have to wait till I retire? I guess. Well, I'll put it in my calendar. Maybe you could take early retirement. Maybe I will. She must have been some cop. She was.
