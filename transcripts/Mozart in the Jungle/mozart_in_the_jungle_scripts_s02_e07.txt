 ♪ 
 So I pre-RSVPed that we'd tell them when you decide. 
 Okay. 
 Maestro, I just want to say I'm so sorry about the whole passport fiasco. 
 Ah, I haven't been sleeping, and I haven't been eating. 
 Michel, it's okay. 
 There's water. There's a bridge. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 [ringing] 
 [groans] 
 Are you okay? 
 Ay, I... [ringing continues] I feel like my voice is in another building and my body was, like, in an elevator or something. 
 Maybe your ears didn't pop from the plane. 
 Did you try this? 
 No, it's not the plane. Let's go. 
 Oh, uh... 
 Let's go. 
 The people from the VR session wanted me to get one more thing from you, so there we go. 
 211/8, that's a great size. 
 Uh, Maestro, there's one more thing, and I don't want to be a nag, but the lawyers are wondering when you're gonna sign those papers. 
 Ah, the divorce. Okay. 
 Give me the pen. 
 Nice. 
 [cello music] 
 You are so... 
 Okay. 
 So here. Yeah. 
 [murmuring indistinctly] 
 You want me to separate from a cloud. 
 How can you marry the moon? 
 [murmuring indistinctly] 
 Hey. Hey. 
 We're both married and divorced at the same time. 
 Those are opposites. 
 Yeah, and it means nothing, okay? 
 They mean nothing. 
 They cancel each other out! Nothing! 
 Maestro, maybe Anna Maria wants to dissolve the marriage because she met someone else. 
 ♪ 
 No, Michel. 
 No. 
 Oh, I missed you all! 
 How was the trip. 
 Betty. 
 We brought you this back for a little taste of Mexico. 
 Ah! Who gets the scorpion? 
 You, of course. Only appropriate. 
 Cheers. 
 All : Cheers. 
 Ah, I am a bit of an insect of death. 
 [all laugh] 
 Well, I'm almost back, so get ready for 35 more with this bug. 
 We are ready. 
 Hola, Betty. 
 Aqui estas, some guacamole and chips. 
 Well, Bob, you finally immersed yourself in Mexican cuisine on the trip. 
 Hell no. These are from Gristedes. 
 Nothing but PowerBars and Gatorade for this guy down south. 
 Getting sick is for suckers. 
 Oh, my God, but we didn't tell you the craziest part. 
 Warren, tell her. 
 Yeah, well, there was this, uh... 
 A robbery. 
 What? 
 But luckily, they found the guy, but I'd just rather move on past the trauma, that's all. 
 Yeah, no more trauma. No more trauma. 
 All : No more trauma. 
 You're really going wild tonight, huh? 
 Just a little. [laughs] 
 Well, good for you. [knock at door] 
 I wonder who that could be, mm? 
 Yo no sé. 
 Mmm, this is delicious. 
 Mm. 
 Who is that? 
 [laughter] 
 Oh. Oh! 
 You have been playing here so many years, it's hard to comprehend. 
 You're more than just a colleague. 
 You're a dear and loyal friend. 
 All : Aww. 
 And since we are all so thrilled that you will be coming Bach... 
 [all laughing] 
 Keep your sweet ass down right there, and enjoy the rhythmic pumping of Johann Sebastian Cach!

 Hailey. 
 You know, I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 First day I met you, I accused you of sleeping with Rodrigo. 
 Oh, that. Yeah. 
 I know you didn't get ahead through any hanky-panky. 
 No. I mean, any hanky-panky was besides the point. 
 What? What do you mean? 
 Was there hanky-panky? 
 No. Not then. 
 I mean, there was hanky, but there wasn't any panky. 
 But there's been panky since then? 
 Hey, Hailey, shall we get a cab together? 
 Okay, if it's between us girls, maybe a little something did happen in Mexico, but it was, like, completely spontaneous, and it's a one-time thing, and, I mean, like... whatever happens in Mexico, stays in Mexico, right? 
 How much have you had to drink? 
 Not enough, kind of. 
 Aren't there, like, different rules in Mexico, like seat belts and drinking and romance, because it's... it's so romantic there. 
 There's, like, grandmothers and curses and, like...

 Great, fun time. 
 Cynthia, you are so beautiful.

 Come on.

 Come on. 
 Got a little left. 
 Get your glass. 
 Here lies Thomas Pembridge, fast asleep. 
 The maestro has personally invited me into his home to document as he puts the finishing touches on a symphony three decades in the making. 
 [snoring] 
 [whispers] He's sleeping. 
 [snores] 
 [whispering] Maestro, wake up. 
 [grunting] 
 What the hell, Bradford? 
 You told me not to let you fall asleep. 
 I know I did, but, God, man, you've got to know the difference between a man unconscious and a man subconscious. 
 You were snoring. 
 No. 
 I was in a trans-state between waking and dreaming. 
 And I was doing some pretty f*cking great work! 
 Do you want me to keep filming? 
 Oh, for crying out loud! 
 Argh! 
 Ugh! 
 Here we go. Where were we? 
 Oh, yeah, nuh-nuh, ba-ba-ba-ba-bum, ba-ba-bum, do-do, do-do, rum-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-di-da, da-da-da-da-da, woodwinds, woodwinds, woodwinds. 
 Woodwinds, and coming in... da-di-di-di-di, da-da-da-da-da, ch-ch-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
 Uh, you know... [fist pounds] 
 Darling, this is just not working for me. 
 When I asked you to be a fly on the wall, I didn't expect you to be a fly in my f*cking piano! 
 Don't you know anything about the creative process? 
 Sorry, Maestro. 
 [humming] 
 Oh, God. 
 [growls] 
 Now I've lost all my good ideas! 
 Huhh! 
 Do you want to go back to the couch? 
 The couch is bullshit. 
 It's all bullshit! 
 I wanted you to immortalize this moment... the completion of my debut symphony. 
 What do I get? [sighs] 
 You're immortalizing my mortality. 
 I've tried everything to try and stimulate myself... no eating, overeating, sleep deprivation, sleep saturation. 
 I've even soaked cotton balls in rubbing alcohol and jammed them into my ear canals! 
 Why? 
 Well, apparently, Salvador Dali put rubbing alcohol on his eyelids to distort his sense of reality. 
 What happened when you tried it? 
 I got a lot of wax out. 
 Forgive this, but is it at all possible that maybe you can't finish your symphony because you don't want to finish your symphony? 
 Mm? 
 Maybe the only thing more frightening than an ending is a new beginning. 
 What the f*ck does that mean? 
 Maybe, Maestro... 
 [groans] 
 You've been done all this time. 
 Oh, you have a knack for the dramatic, don't you, B.? 
 [chuckles] 
 Nice touch, handing me this. 
 But what are you saying, man? 
 I'm saying I think you've reached the end. 
 I'm done? 
 I think. 
 Come here. 
 Give me a hug! Thank you. Thank you. 
 Bradford, I'm done, done, done. 
 I think, right? 
 I know, it's... you did it! 
 Thank you! Yahh! 
 It's done!

 ♪ 
 You're gonna wear out the carpet. 
 Sorry. Bit nervous. 
 You think we'll have a response today? 
 They asked for the face-to-face meeting. 
 They're ready for you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello, Cynthia. 
 Gloria. 
 Getting over your jet lag? 
 Almost. 
 Hello, Nina. Nice to see you again. 
 Roger, always a pleasure. 
 Nice to see you Cynthia. 
 Hey, nice to see you. 
 Thank you for coming in. We have a response. 
 I think we've made some real progress here. 
 I'm sorry. Were there some last-minute changes here? 
 Not really. I've just filled in the blanks on a couple of things. 
 Page five, it reads, "In the event of a"... 
 Please take your time reading. 
 It's okay. I've read it. 
 You see we've upped the base salary for incoming musicians. 
 We've compromised on the tenure issue. 
 There's been zero movement on pension or health and zero cost-of-living increases. 
 Given the underlying economics... 
 The underlying economics are that you are right now soliciting massive donations for a new symphony hall, while kicking your orchestra to the curb. 
 No, no, no. One thing has nothing to do with the other. 
 Are you intending on having a symphony in your symphony hall? 
 I really think you should read this more carefully. 
 I think we should all read this more carefully. 
 Have you not read this, Ms. Windsor? 
 Can we have a show of hands, how many members of management haven't read management's offer? 
 My guess is you've read it. 
 You're overstepping, sweet petunia. 
 I'm neither sweet nor a petunia, unfortunately for you. 
 [tapping on glass] 
 Could he please not do that? 
 Roger, you're in no position to tell any musician when he can and cannot play, not without a contract. 
 That's really very annoying. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I percuss when I'm nervous, and Darth Vader here is giving me the f*cking death stare. 
 Keep playing, Dee Dee. 
 Just percuss a little quieter. 
 [tapping on glass] 
 See? Compromise. 
 You know, I think something is overtaking me too. 
 I don't... don't think I can really control it. 
 [rhythmic shaking] 
 Nina, control your people. They're acting like children. 
 I find that comment belittling. 
 I don't think a child could play the air piccolo like this. 
 [whistles] 
 I've always wanted to play the cymbals. 
 Crash! [cymbals crash] 
 I thought that went well. 
 You're insane. That was a disaster. 
 No, it was perfect. 
 The disaster was when they presented us with the contract. 
 The rest of it was perfect... only we needed some strings. 
 I have just one question. 
 You get paid whether or not we lose our jobs? 
 Yeah. Thought so. 
 Warren. 
 What's it like working for Biben? 
 Well... they know what kind of Clif Bar I like on the Gulfstream 650. 
 That's so hot. 
 Embarrassed me and blindsided me and f... 
 Don't ever, ever do that to me again. 
 Everything in the contract was something we discussed. 
 Discussed, not agreed upon. 
 Oh, you're charming when you're angry, Gloria. 
 Edward, stick it. 
 If this negotiation goes off the rails, we could seriously damage this orchestra. 
 Sweetheart, I think you got Stockholm syndrome. 
 You've spent so much time around musicians, you think you're one of them. 
 [scoffs] 
 Oh, please. 
 Ooh, it's so hot. 
 Good, now just relax the muscles of the anus. 
 Yeah? 
 Okay. 
 All right, here it comes. 
 May I cup you? 
 Yes, please cup me. 
 Okay, I'm gonna cup it. 
 Are you feeling the suction? 
 Whoa. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah, I feel it. 
 Yeah? 
 I feel like my whole life is gonna go there. 
 Ooh, that means it's working. 
 Ohh. 
 Ay. I... I don't know. 
 It's, like, pinching. Ay. 
 Ooh. 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 Can we take them off? 
 It's like some big Medusa is, like... 
 Ahh! 
 Oh, okay. 
 Yes, yes, yes. 
 Okay. 
 It's like... ohh... 
 [murmurs indistinctly] 
 All right, you're good. You're done. 
 Yeah? 
 Yep. 
 [groans] 
 I don't know. I... [sighs] 
 I... I don't feel anything, and I'm sorry. 
 I... is this gonna work? 
 To be fair, you really need 12 sessions to start to see the full effects of it, so... 
 No, but I don't have 12 sessions. 
 I can't. I can't, because this is something that somebody put in me, you know? 
 And it... you don't believe me when I tell you... 
 No, no, I do believe you. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Your whole aura is just very, well... 
 I mean, it looks like sh1t. 
 You are holding on to something. 
 Mm. 
 You need to let it go. 
 That's always what it is, but I... I don't know. 
 I... this time, I don't know what... what it is. I don't... 
 Imagine... a giant white balloon. 
 Inside of it is all of the pain, rejection, torment... 
 Mm. 
 Within your beautiful soul. 
 Do you know what you have to do? 
 What? 
 Release it. 
 Set it free, just like that.

 This isn't about these boxes, is it, baby? 
 Oh, it's entire... It's very much about the boxes. 
 No, it's about you and me. 
 Bradford, tell me honestly. 
 How many more boxes are coming? 
 Of this size, I would say no more than between ten and five. 
 You know, I don't understand. 
 You asked me to move in here. 
 Yeah, but I didn't expect all this stuff. 
 Stuff? These boxes are me. 
 Please don't separate me from my work.

 f*ck! My toe. 
 I'm so sorry. I'll move that. 
 We're having our first dispute in America, and I would love you to weigh in now. 
 I don't want to get involved. 
 Well, you got involved the moment that you tripped on those CD-ROMs. 
 God, every inch of my apartment is being taken over by a goddamn cardboard army. 
 Hey, you want the horns, you're gonna get the bull, okay? 
 I told you I come with a lot of baggage. 
 Yeah, I thought, like, emotional baggage. 
 What is it?

 Besides, this isn't even baggage.

 Uh... I escaped. 
 So you escaped from "Danse Haus"? 
 Uh-huh. Yeah. 
 So, what, there's just, like, a roving gang of dancers out trying to find you? 
 Did you dance in a small town where they outlawed dancing? 
 Was it a "Footloose" scenario? 
 Shut up, Lizzie. Let him speak. 
 What happened? 
 Okay, so... 
 I went on the show, right, 'cause I thought it was what I wanted, or... 
 I don't know. At least, like, on the road to what I wanted, but I am telling you it was not. 
 It was... it was humiliating. 
 It was so ridiculous. 
 Continue. 
 Okay, so two days ago, I got a call from ABT. 
 They want me to sub for Prince Siegfried in "Swan Lake" next week.

 Okay, stop being so paranoid. 
 Why would they be tracing your calls?

 So not only will the player control all upper body movements, but you can fully shift the perspective. 
 How cool is that? 
 Now, Maestro, this is going to open up a whole youth market for us. 
 'Cause kids these days, they don't want to just listen to music. 
 They want to participate. They want to conduct. 
 Yeah. 
 And with any luck, we'll have millions of tiny maestros all around the world.

 The producers see a great story line in the tortured-artist-dancer-fugitive on the emotional journey of redemption. 
 They said there's a good arc in it, whatever that means. 
 It's a dance term. 
 They said, also, if you return the hard drive, they will write your escape into the show, and you can do the "Swan Lake" gig.
