 Oh, cool, those photos came in. 
 From the big modeling shoot? 
 Yeah, check 'em out. 
 Oh, I wanna see. 
 Okay, here we go. 
 Oh, wow, your butt looks amazing. 
 Oh, where's the rest of you? 
 I think that's my nose there. 
 Oh, guess that's just the tip. 
 I thought this was a body spray ad. 
 Yeah, well, I guess it's more of a butt spray ad. 
 Right. 
 They're a little cheesy. 
 Yeah, a little. 
 Okay, they're very cheesy. It's a start. 
 A start? What, are you gonna become like a big model now? 
 Well, I mean, not a super model or anything, I'm not delusional, but, I don't know, like maybe... maybe acting... or something? 
 I don't know. Guess maybe not dancing. 
 Oh, God, you are looking at me like I just said I like eating whale meat. 
 No, I... I... 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm... 
 I'm sick of starving myself and getting blisters all the time, and being constantly worried I'm gonna sprain my ankle or some sh1t. 
 You don't think models starve themselves? 
 I'm not talking about modeling. I'm talking about, like, you know, taking a moment to question what I'm doing with my life. 
 Maybe you should do the same. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm not judging you or anything, but, like, what are you doing? 
 You're making mates, and going on road trips with your boss. 
 Do you really think you're making real steps towards playing in the symphony? 
 I'm trying. 
 Okay, that's good, but that's not my point. 
 My point is, maybe it's not the end of the world if we don't do these things we said we wanted to do when we were five years old. 
 Yeah, maybe it's not the end of the world for you. 
 I have to go to work now. 
 Hailey. 
 ♪♪ [violin] 
 Like a devil, she plays. 
 That's a woman. 
 Yeah. 
 She's f*cking awesome. 
 She reminds me of my grandmother. 
 ♪♪ 
 f*ck! f*ck! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, what, what? ¿Que pasa? 
 ¿Que pasa? ¿Que pasa? 
 Can't you hear it? I was flat. 
 And the viola section was too allegro. 
 No, no, no, they're playing the tempo I'm giving them. 
 Then maybe you are too allegro. 
 Ana Maria, who's conducting here? 
 Oh, Excellent question. 
 I thought it was the great Rodrigo. 
 Don't do this. Don't do this here. 
 Ana Maria, please, just calm down. 
 Oh, you. 
 Me? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you stoned? 
 Uh, not right now, I'm not. 
 Okay, so why are you always coming in late? 
 Yes, you're coming in a little bit late. 
 Bob, is it time for our ten minute break? 
 Is it? 
 I don't know, I hope. 
 Oh, uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, it is. 
 Take ten. 
 Great. Excellent. 
 Let's take a break. 
 Ana Maria : Yeah. Bravo. 
 Take your break, Union Bob. 
 We have all worked so hard to achieve mediocrity. 
 No, no, don't say those things. 
 No, no, no, we're all working together, and we will... we will succeed together. 
 Sit down, sit down. Give me the violin. 
 Jesus. Can you imagine being married to that? 
 Well, I was for eight years. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, God. 
 What's wrong, kiddo? 
 [sighs] Nothing. 
 Just momentarily wishing I was someone else. 
 Betty, I need to ask you a question. 
 I need to go to the little girl's room, so make it quick. 
 Okay. Um, you said that I was making progress, uh, so my question is, do you think that if I work really hard and I sacrifice, that I will have a chance at playing in this orchestra? 
 Hailey, if you work as hard as you can, and you really sacrifice to be the best that you can be, you will still never have what it takes to make the big leagues. 
 This orchestra is the big leagues. 
 Sorry. 
 It's my policy to be honest with people. 
 You don't have it. 
 Now, pardon me, I gots to tinkle. 
 Take it easy, okay? 
 These people are your friends. They're your colleagues. 
 You care more about them than you care about me. 
 What? 
 No, no, hey, no. No, that's bullshit. 
 That's absolute bullshit. 
 You have grown so soft. 
 Where's your cock? 
 Where's my cock? 
 Hm? 
 You want to see my cock? 
 Let's go to my office, I'll show you, I'll show you. 
 Just give me the keys to that f*cking contraption you have there. 
 Baby, I want to. 
 Okay. 
 Yes, but you don't know how difficult it is to... to be playing in this graveyard, and to see you so changed. 
 Change is natural. 
 Ana Maria, change is okay. 
 Change is good. 
 We have changed. 
 I'm trying. 
 I'm trying. 
 Ay, wey. 
 Rodrigo : Hailey! 
 Hailey! 
 Can you make me a mate, please? 
 But this time make it warm, because last time it was cold, and it was... 
 What? 
 Okay, if you want to make it cold then it's fine. 
 No. 
 It's how they have it in Paraguay, it's called tereré. 
 It's really not that. 
 It's just I... I don't know what I'm doing here. 
 You're learning. 
 No, I'm not learning, and I really don't think I have what it takes to play in a major orchestra. 
 Hey, who says that? 
 My teacher, that's who. 
 Betty Cragdale? 
 Betty Cra... Okay. 
 Betty Cragdale, she's a wonderful oboist. 
 But this is not Betty Cragdale's orchestra, is it? 
 I've said that twice. 
 Yeah, you have. 
 Okay? 
 I'm really sorry, this isn't really your problem. 
 I'm gonna make your mate. 
 Ai, dios. 
 [sighs] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Rodrigo : Everyone. Everyone, everyone, compañeros. 
 As you might suspect, I have some questions of interpretation to go over with our soloist. 
 So, um, rehearsal's over. 
 You guys have been incredible. 
 You've been working really hard. 
 We've all worked really hard together. 
 And as a gesture of thanks for tomorrow's performance, I'm gonna send each and every one of you a car to pick you up, and to bring you to the performance. 
 Because it's not just only the patrons arriving in style, and then it looks like a funeral. No? 
 [laughter] 
 Okay, so, Goodnight, Sibelius. 
 Sleep well. Ciao. 
 It's about f*cking time. 
 What happened to all our sh1t? 
 What sh1t? 
 The desk and the gramophone and the... 
 I gave it to Mike. 
 Oh. Cool. Why? 
 We're leaving. 
 Are we moving to Manhattan with our new found riches? 
 No, I was thinking more like Mumbai. 
 Or Moscow, Ho Chi Minh City. 
 We gotta get the f*ck out of here. 
 Let's go traveling and let's not come back until this stupid-ass money's been spent. 
 You're serious? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm serious. 
 Look. Are you kidding me? 
 Matching suitcases. 
 Check it out. 
 We can sit on them. 
 When we're trekkin' around and our feet get tired... 
 Boom! You have a seat. 
 Have a seat. Have a seat on your new suitcase. 
 [sighs] Lizzie, I have to... 
 I know, I know. No, you have a dream, and you have a life, and you have an oboe. 
 So bring your f*ckin' oboe. 
 Okay? 
 It's not like you're a bass player or something. 
 It'll fit in the suitcase. 
 Uh, Lizzie, what I was actually going to say was I have to think about this because you're right. 
 What the f*ck am I doing here? 
 I'm right? I didn't say that. 
 I know. 
 Thank you for not saying that. 
 And thank you for this beautiful suitcase. 
 So why do you like it so much? 
 Maestro. 
 Hey. 
 It's you. 
 You're back. 
 I like the beard. 
 It's very... It ended up being Sibelius. 
 I've been bicycling all day. 
 You know, now I know why I'm here. 
 But I have so many things to talk with you about. 
 Oh, my God, it's been crazy. 
 "All the world's a stage." 
 Yeah. 
 I know. Yeah. 
 Are you coming tonight? 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, hey, Cynthia. 
 Hey, Warren. 
 So, you didn't take the Maestro up on his offer of a car? 
 The subway's faster. 
 Well, we're both a little early. 
 It's gonna be a bit odd. 
 What, you mean not having the old boy up there in front of us? 
 Yes, that's exactly what I mean. 
 Yes, it will be odd. 
 But, um, well, the new guy's no slouch. 
 And we'll have Sibelius to keep us company. 
 Yes, we will, darling. 
 Shall we? 
 Yes, let's. 
 Okay, let's go. I'm running late. 
 I didn't say... the west side highway. 
 I got a good one for you. 
 Do you know why violinists are such bad lovers? 
 'Cause they only know one position. 
 [laughing] 
 Bob. 
 Hey, Cyn. 
 Hey. 
 Uh, listen, about the other night... 
 Oh, hey, wait. 
 There's no need. 
 I understand that was a one-time only thing. 
 And I'm not gonna tell anybody about it. 
 What happens on West 103rd stays on West 103rd. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 I mean, the chair and the vice chair of the negotiating committee hooking up? 
 That'd go down in legend. 
 That's true. 
 Um, but Cyn, one thing. 
 That night was one of the three best nights of my life. 
 The other two were the night my kid was born, and the night I got married. 
 Little did we know... 
 So, don't worry. 
 My lips are sealed. 
 Thank you, Bob. 
 You're a gentleman. 
 And, uh, you're excellent with your piccolo. 
 f*ckin' A. 
 [laughs] 
 Hey, you guys. 
 You haven't seen Betty, have you? 
 No. 
 Betty? No. No. 
 You're going on the George Washington Bridge! 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Gloria : It's terrific. It's going to be a great, great night. You look lovely. 
 You're down front. 
 Hello. 
 Ah! Thomas. Thomas. 
 Madame la Presidente. 
 I'm so happy you're here. 
 Oh, I wouldn't have missed this for the world. 
 Hello, Barbara. 
 Yes. Hello. 
 I think you forgot your dentures. 
 Oh, well, I see we've begun our celebration a touch early. 
 What are you implying? 
 Nothing, Maestro. 
 I'm so happy you're here. 
 Stay by my side and we'll get through this together. 
 Hey, Cynthia, have you seen Maestro? I have his mate. 
 You look really nice. 
 [laughs] Well, opening night. 
 Listen, Hailey, some day you're gonna be... 
 Uh, look, uh, this mate is gonna get cold. 
 Um, break a leg. 
 And, um, you're a really great player. 
 Like, a great one. 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 It's about 15 minutes to show time. 
 The auditorium is about 85 percent capacity. 
 Nothing unusual on stage at this point. 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 I think you're in my seat. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. 
 I'm supposed to be in this one. 
 Here you go. 
 Opening night is always so exciting. 
 Always. 
 You probably recognize my voice. 
 Excuse me? 
 My voice, you might recognize it. 
 Welcome Bach, this is B. Sharpe. 
 Classical music is our forte. 
 Not ringing any bells. 
 I see. 
 I like your vest, though. 
 Do you? 
 I have a confession to make. 
 I got this in Maui at a Rage Against The Machine concert. 
 That is a shocking confession. 
 I like a sarcastic woman. 
 Bit of a conversation stopper. 
 I suppose it is. 
 I'm Bradford Sharpe. 
 Elizabeth. 
 My friends call me Lizzie, but I'm pretty f*ckin' sick of being called Lizzie. 
 All right, then. It's very nice to meet you, Elizabeth. 
 Marlon, it was supposed to be Mahler tonight. 
 And so sometimes we must navigate new waters. 
 Do you think so tonight? 
 Oh, Maestro. 
 Your mate. 
 Thank you, Hailey. 
 Have a wonderful performance tonight. 
 Thank you. 
 We have a problem, though. 
 No, I boiled it. 
 Come. Come, come, come, come. 
 We received a phone call from Betty Cragdale. 
 She's not coming to the performance. 
 So Christine will betaking her seat as first oboe chair. 
 And right beside her there is an empty chair. 
 Ergo, we need an oboe player. 
 Miss Hailey Rutledge, would you mind playing in my orchestra tonight? 
 I don't have my oboe. 
 Pavel! 
 I called your girlfriend, the roommate, and she brought it. 
 I told her it was for a lesson. 
 She's in the audience. I got her a ticket and everything. 
 Oboe. 
 Thank you, Pavel. 
 Maestro, I don't know if I can do this. 
 This is not about you. 
 It's not even about me. 
 This is about needing an oboe player. 
 Please, would you mind? 
 [speaks French] Je vous en prie. 
 [sighs] [speaks Spanish] 
 Puta madre. 
 [contrabass tuning] 
 [mutters] 
 [orchestra tuning] 
 Thank you, Pavel. 
 Welcome. 
 Te amo. 
 Siempre. 
 [speaks French] Je vous en prie. 
 [cheering and applause] 
 [chanting] Rodrigo! Rodrigo! Go, Rodrigo! 
 [whistling] 
 Tremendous applause as the Maestro prowls the stage like a jaguar... 
 Hey, that's my friend. 
 That's my f*cking friend! 
 Rodrigo? 
 No, not Rodrigo. 
 Um, well, he's a friend, too, but no, no, Hailey. 
 She's in the oboe section. 
 Really? 
 Here. 
 [squeals] 
 [applause continues] 
 ♪♪ [orchestra] 
 ♪♪ [violin] 
 She's a f*ckin' lefty, a lefty violinist, and she can play. 
 Yes, thank God. 
 She can. 
 ♪♪ 
 No. 
 No. No. 
 Oh, crap. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 Rodrigo : Ana Maria. 
 I cannot do this. 
 I cannot whore myself for this audience of wealthy scum. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Ana Maria. 
 Ana Maria : Look at you. 
 You're just a pimp. 
 [chuckles] 
 You have sold out, Rodrigo, and you cannot even see it, because your vision is blocked by your gigantic f*cking ego. 
 And I will not stand in front of this third rate orchestra playing for these bourgeois pigs. 
 No matter how much I love you. 
 Leave with me. 
 What? 
 Baby, leave with me now, mon amour. 
 I have searched my soul. Now we can begin again. 
 No, Ana Maria, not like this. 
 I know we've been through a lot, you and me, but I can't. 
 This is my orchestra. 
 Then to hell with you. 
 [scattered applause] 
 [softly, from audience] Boo, boo! 
 [sighs] 
 Pavel! 
 Can you bring me my violin? 
 Pavel : Yes, Maestro. 
 That crazy bitch just f*cked up my best friend's debut. 
 Would you go to dinner with me? 
 What? 
 Ay, wey. 
 Ana Maria, she's right. 
 But she's not right about you being bourgeois pigs. 
 Although the vast majority of you are bourgeois elite. 
 And some of us are pigs. 
 But she's right about the ego getting in the way, and not allowing me to see. 
 But I can listen. 
 And I can listen to Sibelius. 
 And I can listen to this orchestra. 
 Your orchestra. Our orchestra. 
 And it is not third rate. 
 No, this orchestra is capable of doing amazing things, and we're not there yet. 
 I know, I know, we will be. 
 But in the meantime, please bear with us. 
 And you can blame me if in the short term we don't get there, 
 'cause I'm the conductor, after all. 
 But, um... Thank you. 
 But tonight, I will not conduct anymore. 
 I will play the violin. 
 Not the solo piece because I'm not good enough for that. 
 Warren Boyd. 
 Yes, Maestro. 
 Could you play the solo? 
 I will, Maestro. 
 Thank you. 
 I will join the violin section just like I used to in my youth orchestra days back in Mexico. 
 But we need a conductor. 
 And I think we have one of the best in the world with us right now. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Maestro Thomas Pembridge, would you... would you mind helping us out? 
 Please? 
 All right, listen, Gloria, slap me. 
 What? 
 Slap me hard. 
 That was a little bit harder than I expected. 
 I... I'm sorry. 
 All right. 
 That got rid of the cobwebs. 
 Excuse me. 
 You can do this, Thomas. 
 Whoo. 
 [applause] 
 You're familiar with this piece, right? 
 What are we doing? 
 No, of course. 
 I conducted this in '89, Rio de Janeiro. 
 I know. 
 Look, uh, by the way, I must say, I admire your taste in women. 
 My God, she's a f*ckin' spitfire. 
 [chuckles] 
 Listen, my life is a total f*ck up right now, so... but this, Maestro, I can do. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, Maestro.

 Go, Hailey! 
 Woo! 
 Woo! 
 [applause continues] 
 [cork pops] 
 We did it. 
 We did it. 
 You know, I once did PR for Insane Clown Posse, but these people are f*cking insane. 
 Oh, Rick, over here. 
 You killed it, sweetheart. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Wasn't that amazing? 
 Woman : Well done, Maestro. Excellent work! 
 Man : Beautifully done. 
 Gloria : Oh, here he is, here he is. 
 Bravo! Bravo! 
 Bravo, Maestro, bravo. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Maestro. 
 That's what a real conductor looks like. 
 Well done. Now, can we please get rid of that cocky little b*st*rd with the rat tail? 
 Please, he's my hermano. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 It's like... 
 Maestro. 
 Sorry, sorry. Hailey Rutledge. 
 Thank you. 
 You were so good. 
 Thank you. 
 So good. 
 Hailey. 
 Bob : Maestro. 
 Hey. 
 Maestro! 
 Bobby! 
 Good job. 
 Yes. 
 Thank you very much. You, too! 
 You were great! 
 We headbutt all the time, though. 
 You're one of us now. 
 I know. Thank you so much, thank you, guys. 
 You were incredible. 
 And Warren Boyd. 
 Warren Boyd, thank you for coming to save the day. 
 You were incredible. 
 Oh, well, another run at that middle section. 
 Next time, a little warning. 
 Cynthia. 
 You're back. 
 Can you ever forgive me for being such a daft c**t? 
 Well, when you put it like that, how can I not? 
 Listen, I promise you I've stopped drinking for good. 
 This is just juice. 
 I think you should stop taking those f*cking pills. 
 I'm not taking... 
 No, listen. 
 You were a tad late in the adagio. 
 That only happens when you're a little high. 
 Let's not argue. Not tonight. 
 You did beautifully up there, Maestro. 
 That means more to me coming from you than anything else in the world. 
 "And all we men and women, we're merely players." 
 [screams] 
 Oh, my God! You did it. 
 Oh, I did. 
 Oh, hello. Who's this? 
 Oh, this is Bradford Sharpe. 
 He's smitten with me. 
 Who wouldn't be. 
 Hey, do you think you'd fit in a suitcase? 
 I'm pretty flexible. 
 Woman : Hailey Rutledge! 
 Uh, maybe you guys should go get a drink or something. 
 Hailey Rutledge. 
 My idiot driver took me to the Hoboken Dinner Theater Playhouse, for some reason. 
 Anyway, you were okay. 
 Thank you. Not as good as you would have done it. 
 No, of course not. 
 But still... 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 See you Saturday. 
 Okay. 7:00? 
 No, 6:30. 
 Miss Rutledge, you know this man. 
 Hailey. 
 Yes, he's with me. Alex. Hey. 
 Lizzie texted me. I caught the very end, but, oh, my God, you were amazing. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Yeah, I'm inspired, Hailey, I really am. 
 Oh. Yeah, it's awesome.
