 I love... 
 [gasps] 
 Love L.A. 
 Ah, Maestro, me... me too. 
 I miss home, though. 
 Home New York or home Mexico? 
 Both. I miss my orchestra. 
 Eh, this one's better. Hm? 
 Yeah, you know, they're really good. 
 They're really good. But mine... mine will get better. 
 Yeah, they will get better. 
 Maybe... or maybe you'll never get them there. 
 Hm? 
 Hmm, maybe you'll never get there. 
 Maybe you're a fraud. 
 No, not now, Maestro, not now, not now. 
 Little Mexican street urchin in the big city, huh? 
 [chuckles] 
 Little enfant terrible, eh? 
 You're not such an enfant anymore though, you know, hmm? 
 Maybe you're just... terrible. 
 Shut it, Wolfgang! Shut it, stupid basta! 
 Aw, hell, I'm sorry, Maestro. 
 I... I didn't have breakfast today.

 [indistinct chatter] 
 Rodrigo to stage in two minutes. 
 Okay, okay, copy, copy. 
 Cabron, what's the score? 
 7-1 now. 
 Ay, chingada madre. 
 Oh, yes, yes. 
 Bah, let's go. 
 So are the rumors true? 
 What rumors? 
 So many rumors, I don't know which one you're talking about. 
 That when the New York symphony goes on the strike, you are coming here and not as a guest conductor. 
 Who's saying that? 
 Everybody's talking about that. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, everybody. 
 No, we're not gonna go strike. 
 No, no, no, no, we're not... 
 Relax. 
 You have to conduct a concert. 
 Yeah. 
 One thing is to conduct Mozart, and another labor negotiations. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 You have to come here. 
 Save us, please. 
 [humming] Hmm? 
 We hate our conductor. 
 Really? 
 Ugh. 
 Rodrigo to stage. 
 Okay, one, ready. 
 Enjoy. 
 Thank you. 
 Disfrútalo. 
 Gracias. 
 Ciao.

 Hang in there, Bobby! 
 Come on, Hailey. Let's go. 
 Strike! 
 Hold on, hold on. Who's the ringer? 
 Hailey Rutledge. She's an oboist. 
 Okay, well, I don't see her name on the official roster. 
 I'm a substitute. 
 So you're not eligible. 
 He's right. 
 Hailey's only eligible in the weeks she's playing. 
 She's not playing this week. 
 She's just the maestro's assistant. 
 Whose side are you on? 
 The side of the rules. 
 I'm sorry, Hailey. 
 You can play in three weeks when we're doing the Mahler. 
 Drop the ball. I'm... I'm back in.

 I heard that Maestro Pembridge was, you know, a little bit unsure about the sporting activities, right? 
 That's true, Maestro, but it's a very short softball season, and everyone's very careful out here. 
 And we're just a couple of wins away from making the playoffs. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you think we have a chance?

 Hailey, Mrs. Cook here. 
Tom Tom has head lice. 
 It's been decimating the third grade, so the lesson is off tomorrow. 
 Okay. When did he get it? 
 See you next week. Bye. 
 Okay, I'm not... I'm not horny at all, and I really need to practice.

 Hello, you're Hailey, Rodrigo's assistant, right? 
 Mm-hmm, that's what they call me. 
 I'm Sarabelle. 
 Gloria Windsor told me to come see you so you could train me to be Rodrigo's new assistant. 
 Oh, okay. Uh, great. 
 Well, first, we will start with the mate. 
 I actually made the maestro my very first cup of mate right here in this room. 
 Okay, "'Hai Lai'! First, you will slurp the mate, and then you will... oh, an eagle!" 
 'Cause he made a... he made a tape for me. 
 Um, anyway, how did you get put up for the job? 
 Um, well, my dad knows Gloria. 
 My name's Sarabelle Westmore. 
 Oh, sh1t, like the Westmore Foundation. 
 You guys donated our organ. 
 Oh, my dad did. 
 And how'd you get this job? 
 Um, I play with the blood. 
 You play with blood? 
 Yup. 
 Are you a musician? 
 I'm a singer-songwriter. 
 Do you like this one... or this one? 
 Which fabric sets off my complexion better? 
 Second... 
 Second. 
 It makes your hair look like spun gold. 
 Well, then, I guess we'll go with the second one. 
 Thank you. Come with me. 
 Gloria, we can't have a strike. 
 Can't you just give them what they want? 
 Can't afford to give them what they want. 
 Well, you can afford those curtains. 
 Thanks to my fourth husband, yes. 
 May he rest in peace... and don't pooh-pooh my redecorating. 
 We all need some creative outlet. 
 I'm not pooh-poohing. 
I don't pooh-pooh. 
 Now, Maestro, if you want to help, then please don't call one of our major corporate donors "evil bloodsuckers" in the "New York Times." 
 Hey, no, no, no, I... I... that was taken completely out of context. 
 Because what I said is, "Even though they are evil corporate bloodsuckers, they're nice." 
 [scoffs] 
 You know what that company does in Nigeria? 
 Do you know what they did for our symphony? 
 They put their name all over the program, that's what they do. 
 And gave us 5 million for the privilege. 
 Now, the next thing you can do is use your influence with the orchestra to get them to seriously consider our recent offer. 
 You know they adore you. 
 That's true. 
 They adore you. 
 No, Craig G, no. 
 The L.A. Phil, they like me. 
 They play well, in unison, relaxed, at ease. 
 They know each other. 
They... they're confident. 
 Maybe they feel more secure because they have a signed five-year contract. 
 Contracts, contracts! You see? 
 We're only talking about contracts and red tape! 
 Red tape, red tape all over the place. 
 Cut the red tape. Cut the red tape, okay?

 Because if we don't talk about the music, then we're never gonna get good. [door opens] 
 If we don't talk about music, then when we go to Latin America it's gonna be so problematic because I'm going to be exiled from every single country, from Mexico, from Colombia, from Argentina, from Bolivia, from Paraguay, from Chile, from Peru, from Venezuela, from... where is "Hai Lai?" 
 What... what's going on? What... what is this? 
 Where... what... who are you? 
 I'm Sarabelle, your new assistant? 
 Is that... are you asking me your name, or is it an answer? 
 Um, an answer? 
 Mm-hmm, okay. 
 [sips] 
 Um, hold this for a second. 
 Sarabelle, you know, you could be a very good soprano. 
 Thank you. 
 No? 
 Yeah, but this is not gonna work. 
 Cut the red tape. Cut the red tape! 
 Rodrigo...

 How is your father, dear? 
Out on the yacht right now? 
 Was I fired? 
 No, don't worry about it. 
 I'm fired? 
 Shh, it's okay. 
 [baby crying] 
 Shh. Daddy will be back soon, so that this daddy can go back to work. 
 It's all right. I don't know if you want this or what you want... 
 That's not a human baby, man. 
 Yes, I know. It's a robot baby. 
 Christophe thinks we should practice for when the real one arrives. 
 That's weird... but that's cool, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you mind if, like, maybe I... maybe... 
 Uh, yes, okay. 
 Yes, ah, look at that. 
 Oh, he... he likes you. 
 I don't... you just got to get to know him enough... 
 Maestro. 
 Yes? 
 You can't keep firing assistants on their first day of work. 
 "Hai Lai," look. 
 [baby cries] 
 Oh my God. 
 Get that thing away from me. 
 [baby coos] 
 [speaks Spanish] 
 Sarabelle was nice. 
 She was rich, but she was very nice. 
 No, she was not nice. 
 [high-pitched voice] She... she... she wasn't nice, no. 
 No, she was not nice, no. 
 She spoke with rising arpeggios, and with a minor scale, like "keh, keh, keh..." 
 I can't keep being your assistant. 
 Hai Lai... don't... don't walk away, Hai Lai. 
 [baby crying] 
 Hey, oy, no, no, no, no. Okay, okay. 
 Sorry, here you go. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, trust your instincts, man. 
 You got it. Don't listen to anybody. 
 Everybody's gonna tell you stuff. Just go for it. 
 You got it. You got it. 
 Okay, I tell you what. 
 While you're substituting at oboe, you can find a substituting assistant for me, okay? 
 It puts me in a weird position with the orchestra, since they know that I work for you. 
 Weird position? 
I don't see any weird position. 
 You need to find a new assistant by next week, end of story. 
 Not the end of story! 
 No end of story... 
 Stop, Maestro! 
 This is a ladies' room! 
 And? 
 It's for ladies. 
Gloria spoke to you about this. 
 Step outside, Maestro. 
 Also, are you aware that that girl's father donated our organ and our rehearsal rooms and your apartment? 
 And she can't make the mate? 
 Anyone can make the mate. 
 Hey, that... that's very insulting to you. 
 Hey, how's it going, Cynthia? 
 Hello, Maestro. 
 How you doing? 
 I'm good. 
 This is the ladies' room. 
 And? 
 It's for ladies. 
 One day, it will be everybody's. 
 One day. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Does he have a new assistant yet? 
 I'm working on it. 
 He doesn't want to let you go, huh? 
 What does that mean? 
 Nothing, nothing. 
 I'm just, you know... you know, Triangle Tanya's been shooting her mouth off that she saw him kiss you on opening night. 
 God, all your blood just went to your cheeks. 
 Well, I mean, no. 
 He was just super affectionate with everyone that night. 
 It was, like, 2 1/2 months ago. 
 It hasn't happened again, so... 
 You're really advancing in your playing, Hailey. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Yes, you're... you're getting really f*cking good. I've heard you. 
 So, you don't want any bullshit gossip, trust me.

 Fyah! Like that. 
 This one... this one... is half fake. This one. 
 And then I became really good at dodging them, you know? 
 And after, I don't know, ten dodges or something... when I was eight or nine... he gave me the baton, and that's the reason why I'm here. 
 So in a few weeks, when we're in Mexico City, we better be good, because Maestro Rivera's gonna be in the audience, and he's gonna be throwing batons at us.
