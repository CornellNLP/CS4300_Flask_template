 Previously, on  Proof... 
 I'm working on something unique. 
 We can't afford to waste any more resources on this. 
 It's not a waste. 
 What I understand is the bottom line. 
 You let your employees talk to you like that? 
 She's my sister. 
 Charles : The scan revealed a mass. 
 Cancer has spread. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Turing asked me to investigate life after death. 
 You're not buying into any of this stuff, are you? 
 I'm looking for a former patient of mine. 
 She might be wearing a green scarf. 
 So, no new pictures from the other side? 
 They told me not to talk to you about that anymore. 
 [Tires squeal] 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 Night, Jennie. 
 Save me some sick people for tomorrow. 
 I need help, please! 
 Hey. Here, I'll take him. I'll take him. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 One minute he was fine, and then the next he just collapsed! 
 Get him on a monitor! Oxygen! 
 Someone get a line in, stat! 
 Yes, Doctor. 
 Len : Elevated heart rate, abnormal rhythms. 
 I thought you should take look. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Has he ever fainted before? 
 No, never. 
 Was he light-headed? 
 Was there any shortness of breath before it happened? 
 He was feeling dizzy, but I thought it was nerves. 
 Kyle sometimes gets the jitters before his piano recitals. 
 Oh, recital, that's exciting. 
 What song were you gonna play, Kyle? 
 Chopin's Prelude in E minor. 
 Wow. When I was your age, I was still figuring out how to tie my shoes. 
 You're still not very good at it. 
 Ava : Kyle's a prodigy. 
 His concerts have gotten thousands of hits on Youtube. 
 A celebrity. 
 Mild cyanosis, BP 120 over 70. 
 Let's get a stat glucose, labs, ECG, and a portable chest X-ray. 
 That sounds serious. 
 It's just a precaution to find out exactly what's going on. 
 We'll know more once we get the results back. 
 For now, can you be brave for me and let Dr. Barliss take some blood? 
 Will it hurt? 
 No, not at all. 
 Oh, you mean  you.  Just a little. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I want you to start with the ECG. 
 Is it Ebstein's anomaly? 
 Excuse me? 
 You need to check for Ebstein's. That's what wrong with him. 
 Are you the family physician? 
 No, I'm not a doctor. 
 I saw him collapse at the recital. 
 Well, thank you for your concern. We're running some tests. 
 Heart rate above 110, shortness of breath, bluish color on the fingertips? 
 It's Ebstein's, I know it. 
 Please, he's gonna need surgery. 
 You can't risk waiting. 
 Ebstein's is an extremely rare congenital condition. 
 What makes you so sure that's what's wrong with him? 
 Because my son Matthew died of it eight years ago. 
 I'm sorry you had to go through that. 
 But, despite the similarities, this boy isn't Matthew. 
 That's where you're wrong. 
 Debra : I know how it seems... 
 Strange woman shows up and tells you that her dead son has come back as another boy. 
 But I need you to believe me about his illness. 
 And do what? Open him up and perform open-heart surgery based on your hunch? 
 Gonna go through the normal process of testing, and then I will make a diagnosis. 
 No, they took time running all kinds of tests on Matthew, but they didn't find out what was really wrong until it was too late. 
 And what makes you think this has anything to do with your son? 
 I discovered a video online of Kyle playing at a recital just like Matthew did. 
 A lot of kids play piano. 
 Not at that level. 
 Matthew was a prodigy, too, but it was more than that. 
 Kyle was playing Chopin's Waltz number 7 in C-sharp minor. 
 Matthew's favorite. 
 He closed his eyes and swayed his head exactly the same way Matthew used to. 
 And he tripped just slightly on the arpeggiated runs during the coda, the same place every time. 
 Most people wouldn't even notice it, but I did... because Matthew did the same thing. 
 The similarities were too much to ignore. 
 So I went to experts... people who know about this kind of thing, people who say they're able to communicate with the dead. 
 I wouldn't exactly call those people experts. 
 They each confirmed what I felt, that Matthew had come back to me. 
 I'm sorry, but those people were just telling you what they knew you wanted to hear. 
 No one wants to believe their child is really gone. 
 You're making connections where there aren't any. 
 We didn't catch Ebstein's in time for Matthew. 
 Please don't let that happen to Kyle. 
 Janel : Ivan? 
 This one has real potential. It's identical twins. 
 One of them dies, and then the other one is able to see... 
 Good, good. [Clears throat] 
 Let's follow up with that with our Tokyo investors next week. 
 Yes, right. Okay. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I wanted to talk to you about some of your recent expenditures. 
 Don't you ever feel like talking about something else? 
 How about net neutrality? 
 Do you have an opinion on that? 
 Or are you neutral on neutrality? 
 Specifically, your recent donations to Medics International. 
 Medics International... uh, I don't know. 
 I-I make a lot of donations to a lot of charities. 
 It's not the generosity I take issue with. 
 It's the recent spike. 
 [Sighs] It's a drop in the bucket. 
 Sasha, I am sure you have far more important areas on which to focus your financial expertise. 
 Is everything all right? 
 You haven't seemed like yourself lately. 
 Uh...I picked up a little bug on my recent trip to the Amazon. 
 Actually, it was a 3-foot-long parasite. Would you like to hear about it? 
 [Door closes] 
 Len : I've been going over Kyle's results. 
 It's a good thing you put in for that specialized echo. 
 Who knows how long it would have taken us to find the problem without it. 
 So it is Ebstein's. 
 It's incredibly rare. 
 What made you suspect that's what he has? 
 Well, maybe I'm just that good. 
 [Chuckles] Come on. 
 That's better than good. How did you know? 
 Really. 
 Okay, you really want to know? 
 A strange woman came up to me in the hall and told me. 
 Okay, fine. Don't tell me. 
 I'm serious. 
 After I left Kyle's room, this woman approached me. 
 She believes that Kyle could be the reincarnation of her son, who died of this same disease. 
 That's crazy. 
 [Sighs] Wait a second. 
 Is the kind of thing you investigate for Ivan Turing? 
 Can be. 
 Is that why you ordered the test? 
 I ordered the test because the symptoms said that there's a possibility she might be right, whatever the reason. 
 She was. 
 Man :  A lot of sunshine throughout much of this beautiful... 
 Zed : In my culture, there are those that believe that there's a finite number of vessels for human souls. 
 So, when a person dies, they must wait for a baby to be born in order to return to life. 
 Matthew did die 10 months before Kyle was born. 
 It fits the timeline. 
 But there's no indication that Kyle has any memory at all of a past life. 
 Well, maybe it's there, but Kyle isn't aware of it. 
 There's fascinating research on the manifestation of past lives in children. 
 Current phobias possibly born out of past-life tragedies or special talents present at an unusually early age. 
 Like Kyle's piano-playing ability? 
 Exactly. 
 Some children are even born with identical birthmarks. 
 Maybe Ebstein's can be seen as its own birthmark, a congenital defect that persists across lives. 
 Or perhaps it's just a grieving mother who's desperately clinging to false hope that her son is still out there. 
 Or it could really be her son. 
 And that would be a lovely thing. 
 Zed's probably right. 
 But I do think we should see it through. 
 Zed, I want you to cross-check Matthew and Kyle's medical charts, search for any similarities, and, Janel... 
 Wait, stop the car! 
 I think that's the woman I asked you to find, the one who I thought was a patient of mine. 
 So she is alive? 
 I've seen her before at the hospital. She had the same flowers. 
 I saw her in my NDE. 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. system] 
 Hi, Kyle. How are you feeling? 
 [Sighs] 
 I need to listen to your heart, okay? 
 This might be a little cold. 
 Can you sit up for me? 
 Okay, I need you take a big breath in and hold it, like you're swimming underwater. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Great. You can let it out. 
 Are you the doctor that's going to cut me open? 
 Well, where I come from, we like to call it surgery. 
 And, yes, I will. 
 Where did you go to school? 
 I went to medical school at Penn. And for my undergraduate... 
 Did you get good grades? 
 I did. I was the best in my class. 
 Have you ever done my operation before? 
 I have. 
 How many times? 
 Plenty. 
 Has anybody died? 
 Don't worry. 
 You're not going to. I promise. 
 Now, do you mind if I ask you a few questions? 
 When did you start playing piano? 
 When I was young. 
 I think we may have very different definitions of that word. 
 How did you learn? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, did you... have a good teacher? 
 I mean, most people, they need to take a lot of lessons before they can play the piano well. 
 How did you start? 
 Me and my mom were at the mall, and I saw a piano in the store. 
 And I ran up to it, and I played a song. 
 Oh. What song did you play? 
 The guy in the store said it was called Mozart's Allegro in G minor. 
 And you... you just played it, just like that. 
 How did you know the song? 
 I don't know. I just knew it. 
 So, it appears that this young Kyle is an accomplished pianist before he even touched the keys. 
 That is another sign. 
 Child prodigies are born all the time. 
 We are looking for facts, not signs. 
 What about Matthew's medical history? 
 Well, Kyle and Matthew were both born with A-positive blood type, both allergic to penicillin. 
 That's... that's quite remarkable. 
 A-positive occurs in 34% of the population. 
 Woman : What can I get you? 
 Black tea, please. 
 Perfect. 
 Nothing. 
 But what about the penicillin allergy? That is only 1 in 10. 
 Mm, again, unusual maybe, but not exceptional. 
 What about similar food allergies or birthmarks? 
 No, those do differ. 
 Well, that's my point. 
 Let's not confuse coincidence for conclusive evidence. 
 Carolyn, you have a minute? It's about Ava and Kyle Walker. 
 Excuse me. 
 Is everything all right? 
 I'm afraid not. 
 It turns out Ms. Walker doesn't have insurance. 
 I've done all I can, but unfortunately, it means we have to transfer her son to County Hospital. 
 What? No. You can't do that. 
 I mean, it's a tricuspid-valve replacement. 
 We both know that I'm the best surgeon to do that procedure. 
 And yet, it's still one that the doctors at County are qualified to perform. 
 Well, what if I waive my fee? 
 I'm sure the Walkers would appreciate the gesture, but you're not the only expense, Carolyn, and you know that. 
 He'll still have the surgery, just not here. 
 And not with me. 
 It's out of our hands. 
 Even  I  have to answer to the administrators. 
 I'm sorry. 
 And check in on Mr. Davis. He's the bypass in 205. 
 He needs to be up and moving for his post-op recovery. 
 Thanks. 
 What are you doing here? 
 He does have Ebstein's anomaly, doesn't he? 
 Can we talk outside? 
 I was right? Tell me. 
 We can't be 100% sure until we do the surgery, but the tests indicate that it's very possible that it could be Ebstein's. 
 It  is  him. I knew it. 
 Look, I know that you're very concerned about him, but I don't think Kyle's mother would appreciate finding a total stranger sitting by her son's bed. 
 Ava : Dr. Tyler? 
 I see you've met our guardian angel. 
 You two know each other? 
 We met in the cafeteria. 
 She lost her son to the same disease. 
 I can't possibly thank you enough. 
 Please, I'm just so happy to be able to help. 
 I'm sorry...? 
 Debra offered to cover all of Kyle's medical expenses. 
 You'll be able to do the surgery. 
 Isn't that wonderful? 
 I really believe that fate brought us together. 
 Clearly, you didn't tell her. 
 What would be the point? 
 I just want Kyle to get the care that Matthew couldn't. 
 And I can afford it. What's wrong with that? 
 You don't think Ava might think twice about accepting your charity if she knew what you believed about her son? 
 And then what? 
 Whether or not that's Matthew or Kyle, that little boy could die. 
 Believe me, nobody should know what it feels like to bury your own child. 
 I hear you're the best, Dr. Tyler. 
 We can give him a chance. 
 Isn't that what Kyle deserves? 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Alarm beeps] 
 Man :  Code blue, room 512! 
 Where's the crash cart? We need the crash cart. 
 Why are you not moving? 
 Man : Sorry, Doctor. This patient signed a do-not-resuscitate order. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Beeping continues] 
 [Beeping stops] 
 Time of death is 12:23. 
 So, you saw the red zinnias in the dying patient's room just as you did at County Hospital? 
 That's right. 
 And you say you also saw this woman in your NDE? 
 Yes. 
 And you are positive that this is the same woman? 
 Zed, it's her. 
 Well, do you have any idea who she could be? 
 [Sighs] 
 I thought I knew, but now I'm not so sure. 
 Talk to security. Find out if they know anything about her, who she is, what she's been doing here. 
 And you tell them, if she comes back, I want to talk to her. 
 No, no! 
 Help! Help! 
 No! Help! 
 Kyle? What's wrong? 
 [Breathless] I-I-I had a bad dream. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's okay. You're safe now. 
 It was really scary. 
 I was underwater. I couldn't breathe. 
 Oh. 
 You're all right. 
 It wasn't real, honey. 
 You know, my son used to get nightmares all time. 
 And I would sit beside him in the bed, and he would take my hand, and I would tell him to squeeze it hard as he could. 
 Sometimes that would help. 
 You want to give it a try? 
 Don't go easy on me. 
 [Laughing] Ow! 
 Okay, maybe a little easier. 
 My son would squeeze just like that. 
 And I would promise him, "I am never going to let go." 
 And I'd tell him, "even when I'm not with you, I am holding onto you that tight. 
 And nothing bad can happen to you." 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, he just had a -- he had a bad dream. 
 Baby, I'm sorry I wasn't here. 
 It's okay. Dr. Tyler let me squeeze her hand really hard. 
 He's usually a wreck after a nightmare. 
 I'm used to it. My son was the same way at that age. 
 Thanks. 
 Was it the same dream, peanut? 
 He's had it before? 
 Ever since he was really little. 
 But he knows it's just a dream. 
 Right, sweetie? 
 Debra : Dr. Tyler. 
 I heard you scheduled Kyle's surgery for Thursday. 
 That's great news. 
 Have you been here all day? 
 I don't mind. 
 Maybe it is wishful thinking, but being here makes me feel like I'm close to Matthew again. 
 He'd be 16 now. 
 Probably talking back to us in one breath and begging for a car in the next. 
 Mine would be almost 16, too. 
 By now, we'd probably be fighting about him staying up too late playing video games instead of studying for his S.A.T.s. 
 You lost a child? 
 My son. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Um... 
 Um, I got this for Kyle. 
 It...Was one of Matthew's favorites. 
 Could you give it to him? 
 Very nice. He just had a bad dream. It might make him feel better. 
 Um... 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Did -- did Matthew have any issues around water? 
 Why do you ask? Is that what his dream was about? 
 He dreamt he was drowning. He's had it before. What? What is it? 
 My parents had a summer house by Lake Michigan. Before Matthew could swim, he jumped off the dock. If my husband hadn't been there... Matthew very nearly drowned when he was 5. 
 
 
 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 Peter : Tell the truth. Did you ask me here to autograph that for you? Or do you have another murderer you need me to work my magic on? 
 You know, unchecked ego is usually a sign of deep insecurity. 
 Is it? Ah. 
 Well, I'll remember that next time I speak to the world's greatest heart surgeon. 
 I'm looking into a possible case of reincarnation. 
 It says here... you're an expert. 
 I'm presuming the air quotes around "expert" are implied. 
 Hm. 
 An 8-year-old piano prodigy dies. 
 Eight years later, the mother thinks he's been reborn as another kid. 
 Same unique talent, blood type, same antibiotic allergies, even the same phobia. 
 It's interesting. 
 And that's not all. 
 They're both born with an extremely rare heart condition. 
 You've changed. 
 I've seen things that are hard to explain. 
 You know, but I tell myself that there's always some rational, logical explanation, but sometimes... I wish I had your certainty about these things. 
 I wish... That I were as certain as you think I am. 
 Well, that's a little surprising to hear coming from someone who says they have a direct line to the afterlife. [Chuckles] 
 Oh, it's a gift that's not always readily available. 
 What do you mean? 
 I'm under a lot of pressure... from producers, publishers, m-my fan base. 
 They all expect me to perform. 
 Sometimes I just can't. 
 I use techniques to read people. 
 When the power isn't in me, I just... 
 I-I-I tell people what they want to hear. 
 Are you saying you fake it? 
 I'm saying that I've got so good at these techniques, I'm not certain what's real and what isn't anymore. 
 Aren't I the last person you should be confessing that to? 
 You're a highly respected doctor moonlighting as an investigator into the afterlife. 
 You of all people should appreciate the sanctity of a secret that can ruin a career. 
 Another round. 
 Once we see what we're dealing with, I'll remove the faulty valve, and then I'll replace it with a new one. 
 I'm hoping it won't be any more than four to five hours tops. 
 And how long will it take for him to recover? 
 Oh, his age? We'll have him playing Carnegie Hall in no time. 
 Kyle? 
 I'm sure they just took him for some tests. 
 The young patient in 307, Kyle Walker, did Dr. Barliss order some additional tests? 
 I don't think so, no. 
 Um, Dr. Barliss isn't even on duty right now. 
 Where's my son? 
 Call a code yellow. Shut down all the exits. 
 We'll find him. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Code yellow, 3 east. Code yellow, 3 east. 
 Kyle? 
 Where is he? 
 [Chopin's waltz number 7 in c-sharp minor playing] 
 Thank God. 
 Kyle? 
 Sweetie, you scared me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I wanted to play a song for Debra. 
 You know, let's get you back to your room. 
 You need to rest up for your operation tomorrow. 
 I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to frighten anyone. 
 I just stopped by Kyle's room to wish him luck before his surgery, and he said he wanted to play Chopin's Waltz for me. 
 It was her son's favorite song, just like mine. 
 Listen, Debra, I appreciate everything that you're doing for us, but you shouldn't have taken him without telling me. 
 Oh, I didn't. Matthew took me. 
 Matthew? You mean Kyle. 
 I think you should go. 
 No! 
 I want Debra to come, too. 
 I don't think that's a good idea, honey. 
 You heard Dr. Tyler. You need your rest. 
 Well, I don't see how it could hurt if I came for a little while, I mean, if that's what Matthew wants. 
 Why do you keep calling him Matthew? 
 That's her son's name. 
 She says he's living inside of me. 
 What? What is he talking about? 
 I'll explain it to you later. 
 But for right now, you need to go. 
 No, she needs to hear this. 
 There's a reason that Kyle has the same illness as Matthew. 
 I think Matthew has come back. 
 I think he's returned to me as your son, Kyle. 
 Okay, hang on. That is incredibly inappropriate. 
 Are you talking about reincarnation? 
 Oh, my God. You're out of your mind. 
 Don't come near my son again. 
 He was mine first! 
 Ava, get him back to his room right now. 
 You don't understand. 
 I'm  the one who told Dr. Tyler about Ebstein's right from the start. 
 You tell her. 
 What? 
 [Sighs] Ava, listen. When Debra first approached me... you knew that she thought that, and you didn't say anything? 
 Oh, my God. Come on, Kyle. 
 Don't take him from me, please! 
 Stay the hell away from my son! 
 [Sighs] Tell her! Help her understand. 
 Understand what? 
 Whatever evidence you think there is, he is not your child. 
 Your  son is gone. 
 And you need to let go and move on. 
 And don't come back here anymore. 
 Ivan, I'm so sorry I'm late. 
 I know you asked to see me, but I had to take a look at these e-mails. 
 Actually,  I  asked to see you. 
 Ms. Turing. I... 
 Sasha. Please. 
 I can be just as casual as my brother. 
 Have a seat, Janel. 
 I wanted to talk to you about Ivan. 
 He's been acting strange lately. 
 Strange? In... in what way? 
 I think he's hiding something. 
 What's going on, Janel? 
 There's nothing going on. 
 Business as usual. 
 It's okay. 
 I know you adore my brother. 
 We both do. 
 He's a brilliant, reckless dreamer. 
 [Chuckles] 
 That's what makes him so fantastic. 
 [Chuckles] It's true. 
 Ever since we were kids, Ivan, uh, has always thought that he knows best. 
 And there were times when that incredible ego would lead to ideas and inventions that would blow people's minds. 
 But sometimes they would literally blow up our garage. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We both know that sometimes Ivan needs to be protected from himself. 
 So if there is anything going on that could jeopardize him or this company, it's best for all of us if I know about it. 
 So... 
 I think if there's something you want to know about Ivan, you should ask him yourself. 
 This is between the two of you. 
 And, frankly, I don't appreciate being ambushed. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 I need to speak to you. 
 Can it wait a minute? I just have a patient that I need... 
 Would that be Kyle Walker? 
 [Sighs] 
 I just had a very long, very unpleasant conversation with his mother. 
 Charles, let me explain. 
 Oh, I'd like hear. 
 I'd like to hear why you indulged that other woman's psychotic delusions. 
 Reincarnation? What in hell were you thinking?! 
 Look, I realize I let it get out of control. 
 But I have taken care of it. 
 She will not be coming back. 
 I know, because I've spoken to security, and they're under orders to notify the police if she returns. 
 That's good. 
 Not  good. 
 The mother was extremely agitated. 
 I had to assure her that we were gonna cover her son's entire procedure  without  charge so that she wouldn't threaten to sue us into the ground. 
 Well, at least he'll be able to have his surgery here. 
 Oh, is that what this is about? 
 Your insistence on doing that boy's procedure? 
 I know this may be a special case for you, Carolyn, but that is no excuse. 
 Look, I know that she's upset now, but once I do the surgery... 
 You are not doing the surgery. 
 You just said... 
 She still wants it here, yes. 
 But not by you. 
 Dr. Barliss will continue to handle this case with one of our other C.T. surgeons. 
 What?! 
 She doesn't trust you. 
 And, quite frankly, I don't blame her. 
 Look, I will talk to her, and... 
 No, you won't. 
 I will explain that there.... 
 You screwed up, Carolyn. 
 And you need to think about why, because I don't care how good you are with a scalpel. 
 This kind of thing can't happen again. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Len :  It's me. 
 Come in. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 I've been trying to reach you for hours. 
 You haven't answered my calls, my texts. 
 Well, didn't Charles tell you? I'm off the Kyle Walker case. 
 Yeah, he told me. Why didn't  you? 
 Kyle is  our  patient. 
 [Scoffs] Not anymore. 
 This is about that woman, isn't it? 
 The one who told you to check for Ebstein's. 
 This research you're doing for Ivan Turing. 
 Even if I wanted the third degree, I could get that from Richmond. 
 I thought you said all this Turing stuff was just about funding for Medics International. 
 Yeah, well, it started out that way. 
 But but now you're buying into all that life-after-death crap? 
 That woman's story... dead son comes back to life? 
 Is... is that it? 
 I screwed up. I know. 
 Well, what do you know? The great Carolyn Tyler made a mistake. 
 You're enjoying this, aren't you? 
 I got to say, I am. 
 Yeah, thanks for the support. 
 You're fallible. Welcome to the party. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffles] 
 So, how do I fix it? 
 [Horns honking] 
 Zed : Dr. Tyler, do you have a moment? 
 I have four new consults before noon. Make it fast. 
 I spoke with security about that woman... with the flower and the green scarf. 
 Is she here? 
 No. Not right now. 
 But they were able to question her. 
 And? 
 Her name is Patricia Alcott. 
 Okay. Go on. 
 She works for a charitable organization called Helping Hands. 
 They bring flowers and other gifts to comfort the sick. 
 Well, that would explain why I saw those zinnias in that patient's room. 
 And at County with the coma patients. 
 Apparently, she visits there as well. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Dr. Tyler. 
 How would you like to proceed? 
 I wouldn't. Looks like we have our answer. 
 [Monitor beeping] When we're done, your heart is gonna be better than new. 
 I'm thinking we might even put in an arc reactor just like Iron Man. 
 Where's Dr. Tyler? 
 She had an emergency, sweetie. 
 But Dr. Barliss is still gonna be there. 
 And his specialty is doing surgery on children. 
 Did  you  go to Penn medical school? 
 No, I went to Johns Hopkins. 
 Were you top of your class? 
 Well, I was pretty close. 
 Dr. Tyler was top of her class. 
 I know. She's kind of amazing. 
 To tell you the truth, I think she might have superpowers. 
 I'm 8, not 5. 
 I'm serious. 
 The first time I saw her operate on someone, we were in a category 4 typhoon. 
 That's like a hurricane. 
 Right. 
 We were knee-deep in water, no electricity, and they brought in this little girl about your age. 
 She had her chest crushed by a falling palm tree. 
 Looked like a lost cause. 
 But her father had carried her three miles through the wind and rain to get her there. And Dr. Tyler... she said she wasn't gonna let him go home without her. 
 What happened? 
 We worked on her by candlelight, the wind howling. 
 I thought it was gonna blow us all away. 
 And it was not going well. 
 Everyone thought it was hopeless. 
 But Dr. Tyler never gave up, never even thought about it. 
 She stayed right there with her all night long. 
 And that little girl's father took her home a week later. 
 Whoa. 
 I know. 
 You don't always need it, but it's nice to know you got a superhero on your side when you do. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Cat : Okay, we have work to do. 
 On bypass. 
 Aortic cross-clamp. 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 [Flatline] 
 Let's do this. 
 [Beeping resumes] 
 Zed :  You and Dr. Barliss... you are... 
 Very, very good together. 
 As surgeons. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Tyler. 
 You're not supposed to be here. 
 I know. I just -- is he gonna be okay? 
 The surgery went well. 
 But the next 48 hours are critical. We won't know for sure until then. 
 Please, I want to see him. 
 But there's something you should know. 
 When we opened up Kyle, we discovered that his heart problem wasn't Ebstein's anomaly. 
 It wasn't? 
 No, it was a completely different aortic defect. 
 The symptoms only looked similar. 
 Are you sure? 
 There's no question. 
 But that doesn't necessarily mean... 
 I mean... they both had heart problems. 
 And... and Kyle had that dream. 
 Debra, Kyle is not Matthew. 
 The surgery proved that. 
 Look, you mentioned that you have a husband. 
 Maybe it's time to focus on the life you have rather than chasing after something you might never find. 
 Give my best to both of them. 
 Goodbye, Dr. Tyler. 
 I don't understand. 
 Kyle  did  have Ebstein's anomaly. 
 Why did you lie to her? 
 She needed a way to let go. 
 But everything that she said turned out to be correct. 
 If we keep investigating, I am sure that we... 
 I'm done. I'm done, Zed. 
 People trust me with their lives. 
 I can't allow these distractions to get in the way anymore. 
 It was one mistake. 
 An avoidable one. 
 These investigations for Turing have taken up too much of my time. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm through looking for life after death. 
 I need to concentrate on my work right here. 
 You have a good night. 
 [Up-tempo music plays] 
 I never did thank you, did I? 
 For what? 
 Well, someone got Ava to change her mind about me. 
 Pretty sure it was Kyle. 
 No one else passed his grueling interview process. 
 [Both laugh] 
 It was nice to work together again. 
 Brought back some pretty horrific memories. 
 Oh, my God. You remember Mongolia? 
 It was more like sticks and a sheet than an O.R. 
 And that's not even the worst place we operated. 
 Yeah, that would be the Philippines. You remember during that typhoon? 
 Vaguely. 
 God, water up to our knees, no electricity. 
 There was some electricity. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, maybe it wasn't that horrific. 
 We did watch the sun come up together. 
 Well, I've got... I've got rounds I got to... 
 Me too. 
 Yeah. 
 Janel : I had a conversation with your sister the other day. 
 Ivan : I'm sorry. 
 She's worried about you, you know. 
 Of course she is. 
 Sasha's never happy unless she has something to worry about. 
 I think you should tell her the truth about your illness. 
 You need the support of your family. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know what happens if I tell her. 
 It becomes her fiduciary duty to make that public to the shareholders. 
 My judgment will be called into question. 
 The board will have no choice but to remove me from the day-to-day running of this company. 
 And someone else will be put in charge. 
 Sasha? 
 She co-founded Turing Industries. They'd insist. 
 But you're Turing Industries. 
 That's exactly the point. 
 Telling Sasha would jeopardize everything... all the projects I have in development, all the ones I still hope to do. 
 And then there's our work with Dr. Tyler. 
 I feel like we're getting closer. 
 All that would be put at risk. 
 Sasha would never understand. 
 Exactly. 
 Which is why we have to keep her in the dark for as long as possible. 
 Huh? 
 I still have something very important I need to see through to the end. 
 Okay. 
 Patricia : Hello, Dr. Tyler. 
 I'm so sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. 
 No, it's just I... 
 Wait, how did you know my name? 
 You don't remember. 
 I heard you were looking for me, so I assumed that was because you recalled doing my surgery. 
 You were a patient of mine? 
 That's right. A few years ago. 
 You saved my life. 
 I'm sorry. I... I see a lot of patients. 
 I almost died on the operating table that day. 
 That's why I volunteer to bring flowers to terminal patients. 
 I know what it's like to be so close to the other side. 
 If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be here now. 
 Well, I'm glad I could help you. 
 Are you here to thank me or... it's very... 
 No, no. That's no why I'm here. 
 There was a time during my surgery when I was gone but still conscious. 
 I was aware of leaving my body. 
 You had a near-death experience. 
 Like many other people. 
 Like some of the people you've been talking to. 
 Like you yourself had. 
 How did you know about that? 
 I know a lot of things since my experience. 
 I know that you've been looking into matters of the afterlife. 
 I know what you've lost... 
 And what you hope to find. 
 But you need to stop. 
 There are things that are not meant to be known. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Nothing good can come from continuing your investigation. 
 Leave it alone... for you own good and those you care about. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 I'm helping you, just as you helped me. 
 I don't understand. Who are you? 
 And why did I see you with my son? 
 That's all I can tell you now. 
 I shouldn't have even said this much. 
 They told me not to talk to you. 
 What did you say? 
 [Ringing] 
 Zed, call Janel. 
 I want to see the both of you first thing tomorrow morning.
