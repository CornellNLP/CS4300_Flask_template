 That's right. Pat it down. 
 Is it going to be as tall as me? 
 Maybe it'll be as tall as me. 
 They adore you. 
 They know I'm a pushover. 
 You're a saint, Sidney Chambers. You really are. 
 Is it still troubling you? 
 It's not too bad. 
 That'll teach you to cycle home three sheets to the wind. 
 I don't think anything will teach me that. 
 Andrew! Look at you! 
 There is nothing for it. Straight onto the compost heap! 
 Here we go! 
 There. Good as new. 
 And he's heading straight back to the mud. 
 No sense of decorum, that's the problem. 
 The kids? 
 Kissing you like that in front of your parishioners. 
 They're five. I don't think they care. 
 She calls me Sylvia. 
 It's your name. 
 Do you mind if I pop into town? 
 That's fine. How is it you moan at me when I'm single and then you moan at me when I'm not? 
 Only, my library book's two weeks overdue -- 
 She's too familiar. I don't like it. 
 There's a JB Priestley they've kept on hold for me. The Magicians. 
 I'll ask her not to call you Sylvia. 
 It's too late. The damage is done. 
 What damage? There is no damage. 
 It's rather downbeat apparently but worth a look. 
 What? 
 The Magicians. At the library. 
 Leonard, just go. 
 Right. 
 Come on, Dickens. 
 You didn't tell her how you got that, did you? 
 Thought as much. 
 She doesn't wear stockings, Sidney. 
 I have absolutely no idea what you expect me to do about that. 
 All I ask for is a bit of respect. That's all I ask. 
 If you'd rather be alone that's fine. 
 But if there's anything I can help with... 
 There's a... gambling den. 
 Mill Road. 
 He goes there most days. 
 He didn't know I was waiting. 
 Had no idea. 
 He smiled. 
 I didn't think of that. 
 That the old b*st*rd would smile. 
 "Feeble," he calls me! 
 A "waste of space," and on and on and on. 
 So I took a razor... and I slashed him. 
 From here to here. 
 Who, Theo? 
 Eric Whitaker. 
 Oakfield Boarding House. 
 It's four and six full board. Electric and laundry extra. 
 Money up front, no excuses. 
 Been had too many times before. 
 We're trying to trace a Mr Eric Whitaker. 
 What's he to you? 
 Do you know where he is? 
 I should hope so. He's standing right in front of you. 
 A vicar and a copper. 
 Sounds like the start of a joke I don't want to hear. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Vivian! 
 What have I told you? 
 Hey? Time and bloody time again. 
 I'm sorry. 
 One day you'll say it and mean it. 
 What can I tell you? She was a looker when I met her. 
 So, how can I assist you gentlemen? 
 We were reliably informed you'd been murdered. 
 Theo Graham's a feeble-minded b*st*rd. 
 He'd soil himself killing a fly. 
 So he made the whole thing up? 
 Cambridgeshire Constabulary sharp as a pin, you lot. 
 I'm still here, aren't I? 
 Why would he make it up? 
 Few threads short of a jumper, ain't he? 
 Can't hold down a job. Never pays his rent on time. 
 You were in a gambling den on Mill Road this morning. 
 Gambling's illegal. 
 So is lying to a police officer. 
 It's clean. 
 I had a flutter on the horses. Where's the harm in that? 
 Did you see Mr Graham there? 
 Nope. 
 Did you get into a fight? 
 Nothing to do with it. 
 Theo confessed. 
 And yet here I sit. 
 Praise the Lord. It's a blooming miracle. 
 Where's the sixpence? 
 They didn't have any scrag end, Dad. 
 I had to get shoulder. 
 Ring the bell for me. 
 So you don't want to take this any further? 
 Clergy's sharp as a pin an' all. Nothing to take further. 
 What do we have today, Mrs Whitaker? 
 Ham and potatoes, Mr Clark. 
 Nothing more miraculous than ham. 
 Tell Mr Graham the room's still his if he wants it. 
 Tell him Mr Whitaker looks forward to having a little tete-a-tete with him. 
 We've just seen him, Theo. He's alive and well. 
 But I stabbed him. I saw the blood. 
 He's fine, Theo. 
 I did! I killed him! 
 Mr Graham, I find myself in the rare position of having a crime scene, a confession, but no victim. 
 Call it happenstance, fate. Call it what you like. Today is your lucky day. 
 Not late, am I? 
 No. No. Not at all. 
 I don't think I've seen you out of your garb. Very dashing. 
 Mrs M says you can't go wrong with a flannel shirt. 
 She's absolutely right. 
 She generally is! 
 This is pleasant. An afternoon away from the prying eyes of Grantchester. 
 Isn't it? 
 We should make it a regular occurence. 
 We should. 
 I can't keep him in if there's no crime to answer. 
 I didn't say anything. 
 You didn't have to. 
 What? 
 Lend me a shilling. 
 Why? 
 Just -- 
 I'm having that back. 
 Theo. 
 Don't go back there. Find yourself another room. 
 He'll be out for me now. 
 He will. 
 Don't you love that? 
 Stepping out into the light after hours in the dark. 
 You've an incredible knack of making the ordinary poetic. 
 It's your optimism, I think. 
 My father found it annoying. 
 I find it admirable. 
 Even you can't have anything positive to say about the film. 
 It was... diverting! 
 Diverting?! It was third rate at best. 
 It was so convoluted. It was all I could do to keep my eyes open. 
 I'm sorry. Um... I must get back. 
 What about Fitzbillies? 
 The girls are going roller skating at the Corn Exchange. 
 You don't fancy it, do you? 
 I can barely balance on two wheels. 
 They're dying to meet you. 
 And I'm dying to show you off. Say yes. 
 Yes! 
 Can't remember the last time Cathy kissed me like that. 
 What? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, God, here we go. 
 What do you mean, "Here we go"? 
 This is what you always do. 
 The woman likes you. She's pleasant, attractive. 
 YOU throw a spanner in the works. 
 When have I ever done that? 
 Hm? The jazz singer. 
 That was... an exceptional circumstance. 
 I'd say. 
 I don't know. It's just... something. 
 I'm glad we're being specific (!) 
 How is it we always talk about me? Why can't we talk about you? 
 How's your marriage, Geordie? 
 Nappies and laundry, Sidney. 
 Nappies and laundry. You were the one who said, "Find me a girl." 
 For future reference, if I ever agree to anything it's because I'm not listening. 
 So... you and Margaret. 
 Rumour has it she knows her way around the bedroom. 
 Shut up, Phil. 
 You know what they say. 
 Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere. 
 Shut up, Phil! 
 Officer! There's summat I need to tell you. 
 Oh, Christ on a bike. 
 Get the pints in. I'll be right behind you. 
 Oi! Slow down! 
 Black Austin, two-door saloon. 
 Four-door. 
 Four-door saloon. 
 With a bloody great crack in the window. I want it found. 
 Geordie. 
 Theo was finishing the job he started. 
 How much money did you give him? 
 Five shillings. 
 He won't get far on that. Theobald Graham. I want every bugger looking for him. 
 Sir! 
 Look after the widow, Sidney. 
 She's not a widow yet. 
 She will be. 
 Mrs Whitaker... please. 
 I want to see him. 
 I wouldn't advise it. 
 I wouldn't advise you to stop me. 
 We can pray together if you like. 
 I gave up praying a long time ago. 
 If Theo did this it's because my husband made his life hell. 
 He made your life hell too though, didn't he? 
 How will I tell Joan? 
 Your daughter? 
 HIS daughter. 
 Here. 
 We can tell her together. 
 I'd almost forgotten what it was for someone to be kind. 
 Joan, go with your mother. 
 She's not my mother. 
 I need a word with Theo. 
 Why? 
 Come with me. 
 Why? What is it? 
 There's been an accident, Joan. 
 Your father was struck by a car. 
 I'm so sorry, darling. 
 You think it's me? 
 You think I killed him. 
 Let's have a word outside, Theo. 
 I didn't want to do it. 
 Sidney. 
 sh1t. 
 We'll be all right. We will. 
 Tough as old boots, you and I, aren't we? 
 You don't have to pretend any more. 
 Pretend what? 
 That you like me! 
 Take your shirt off. 
 Mrs Whitaker -- 
 Vivian, please. 
 Do you think Theo is capable of doing something like this alone? 
 Erm... Here. 
 His parents died in the bombing on Vicarage Terrace. 
 The shelter took a direct hit. 
 The police found him hiding in the family home. 
 He barely spoke for a year. 
 I suppose he's as capable as anyone. 
 You HAVE been in the wars, haven't you? 
 I didn't always love my dad. 
 Is that a horrible thing to say? 
 People aren't always easy to love. 
 Do you know any Elgar? 
 More of a jazz man, I'm afraid. 
 Elgar's my favourite. 
 Used to play him on my cello all the time. 
 Till Dad sold it. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 I won a place at the Guildhall School of Music. 
 He put his foot down. 
 She didn't even try stopping him. 
 That's when I knew for certain. 
 Knew what? 
 That I didn't really love either of them. 
 What if Theo didn't do this alone? 
 What if someone helped him? 
 Namely...? 
 I don't know. 
 The widow hasn't cried yet. 
 So? 
 Maybe she was in on it. 
 Just cos she hasn't cried? 
 It's a rule of thumb. 
 It could be anyone. 
 True. 
 It could be the daughter. 
 She hasn't cried yet. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 I like Vivian. 
 Vivian now, is it? You sly... 
 Geordie, don't. 
 Fair enough. 
 You are though. 
 That stolen car you're looking for. 
 Black two-door saloon? 
 Four-door! 
 It's been found. Dumped on Silver Street. 
 Eight o'clock. Don't be late. 
 I wouldn't dare. 
 You wanna know what I think? 
 No. 
 If you're not careful, that widow could become the spanner in your works so to speak. 
 
 
 
 Sir. Just brought in a shoplifter. 
 Good for you. 
 Found her absconding with these. 
 From Eaden Lilley. 
 And I should be riveted because...? 
 She's asking for you. 
 Her name, sir. 
 Go and see about this car. Take him with you. 
 Really? 
 Stay away from the widow, Sidney. 
 What are we to do with you? 
 Of all the places, Amanda, why Cambridge? 
 Why not London? 
 Does my husband have to know? 
 As long as we agree it won't become a regular occurence. 
 Not in my city at least. 
 I think we can draw a line under it. 
 Does Sidney? 
 Not if you don't want him to. 
 We can get you on the next train if we're quick. 
 I don't want to go home. 
 So er... 
 Do you and Margaret...? 
 Whatever you're about to ask I'm not going to answer. 
 Been having a bit of the old in-out, in-out, have you? 
 You really have a way with words, Phil. 
 Are you lot allowed to er...? You know. 
 Of course we are. After marriage. 
 You don't have to take your vow of celibacy or anything? 
 I'm not a Catholic. 
 Aren't you? 
 No! 
 Theo's not much smaller than me. He didn't drive this car. 
 Maybe the seat rolled forward. 
 Aye, aye. 
 That's convenient. 
 For someone who has faith, you're not much of a believer, are you? 
 Why leave evidence? 
 Cos he's thick as pigshit. 
 Most criminals are. It's why they're criminals. 
 And not doctors or lawyers. 
 Where are you, you b*st*rd? 
 Maybe he went home. 
 He hasn't got a home. 
 He did have. Once. 
 Put it down, Theo. 
 Please. 
 Think of your mother. Think of your father. 
 They wouldn't want this. 
 Were you in that car, Theo? 
 Was it you? 
 "The day is past and done. 
 All thanks, O Lord, to Thee. 
 I pray Thee now that sinless the hours of dark may be." 
 I thought you were going out. 
 I am. 
 If the Lord had wanted us with wheels on our feet he'd have put them there. 
 Some days I could happily throttle her. 
 She thinks you won't need her. 
 Once you have a wife. 
 I don't have a wife! 
 I don't even nearly have a wife. 
 She's lonely. 
 She once said loneliness is for the weak of mind. 
 How was the library? 
 Very good. 
 Good. 
 I didn't go... but you know that. 
 You don't have to lie, Leonard. 
 Equally you don't have to tell me everything. 
 What if I want to tell you everything? 
 Well, then, I am here. 
 "The day is past and done," that's what Theo said. 
 It should be "past and over", not "past and done". 
 The reason he got it wrong is because he'd seen the sampler in Vivian's room which also gets it wrong. I've lost you, haven't I? 
 Not quite. - 'Theo and Mrs Whitaker were having an affair.' 
 NOW you've lost me. 
 How else would have have seen it if he wasn't in her room? 
 Why else would he have been in there? 
 Why were you in there? 
 Just get Geordie. 
 'He's not here.' 
 Why not? 
 Buggered if I know. 
 When you see him tell him I think she was in on it. 
 I think she was IN that car. 
 Leave it with us, Sidney. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry to disturb your supper. 
 No-one feels much like eating. 
 We must keep our strength up. We must keep going. 
 Join us. 
 There isn't enough as it is. 
 I'm late for an engagement. 
 Thank you. 
 Theo is in custody. I thought you should know. 
 Poor Theo. 
 Poor Theo indeed! 
 No sympathy for the devil, Joan. 
 I said I'd bring his belongings. Please, I can find my way up. 
 I don't even know your Christian name. 
 Sidney. 
 And... did you find everything you were looking for, Sidney? 
 More than I'd hoped. 
 Why would your lodger have such an intimate photo of you in his room? 
 I think I'd like to sleep now. 
 When we've so much to talk about? 
 Well, at the very least you could let me get changed. 
 My husband always helped me. 
 Five minutes. 
 Five minutes till what? 
 Until you tell me everything. 
 Thank God. 
 David won't settle. Ivy has been a little bugger. 
 Just hope you haven't drunk so much you snore. 
 Hello. 
 Hello! 
 Just make yourself comfy. 
 Are you sure this isn't inconvenient? 
 It's fine. 
 She's having problems with her husband. 
 Seems to be a lot of it about. 
 You get on if you need to, Sylvia. 
 I'm sure he'll be back soon. 
 Do you know what it takes to be a vicar's wife? 
 It isn't all taking tea and village fetes. 
 Mr Chambers couldn't cope without someone by his side. 
 Watching over him, taking care of him. 
 Seeing that he doesn't lose his way. 
 Are you prepared to take on that responsibility? 
 I hadn't thought about marriage, Sylvia. 
 I'm just in it for the s*x. 
 Ask the question. 
 Were you involved in your husband's death? 
 How is it you can even make an accusation sound amiable? 
 No, I wasn't. 
 Why would you think that? 
 You were having an affair with Theo. 
 I think you seduced Theo. I think he'd do anything you asked. 
 When I first met my husband... he said we'd travel the world. 
 Walk barefoot on white sands. 
 Sail the China Seas. 
 On our wedding day he turned to me and said, "You're mine now." 
 So while he spent and drank, I became his skivvy, trapped in this place with all these sad and lonely men. 
 Some days all I wanted to do was feel the sun on my face. 
 So can you blame me if I looked for affection elsewhere? 
 Did you want your husband dead? 
 No. 
 Did you ask Theo to kill him? 
 You're equating a woman who knows how to make love... with a killer. 
 You're glad... that he's gone. 
 That doesn't make me a murderer. 
 Thank you. 
 I stole a bar of Turkish Delight once. 
 Biggest thrill of my life. 
 Till my dad made me take it back and apologise. 
 I hate Turkish Delight. 
 Me too! 
 It wasn't for the thrill. 
 I wasn't saying what you did -- - I know. 
 I know you weren't. 
 No-one tells you, do they? 
 That marriage isn't all sunshine and flowers. 
 If something's worth working for... then you work, don't you? 
 It made me feel nothing. 
 Taking those gloves... which was a relief from feeling everything. 
 I suppose. 
 Theo fell in love with me. That was the problem. 
 So he killed your husband to get him out the way. 
 It would appear so, wouldn't it? 
 Appearances can be deceptive. 
 Wouldn't you say? 
 Have you ever been in love, Sidney? 
 You'd have me believe Theo stabbed your husband and when that failed, ran him down? 
 You've been asking all these questions and I don't get to ask one back? 
 I don't think he was in that car. 
 No? 
 Then who was? 
 You. 
 I was here with Joan. Ask her. 
 Maybe she'd lie for you. 
 I doubt it. 
 And also, I don't drive. 
 So who did? 
 Someone else I seduced? 
 Maybe. 
 How many men would you have me sleep with, Sidney? 
 Have you ever been in love? 
 You killed your husband. And I'm pretty sure I know why. 
 Are you married? 
 No. 
 There must be someone on the horizon. 
 Someone you've dressed so nicely for. 
 Tell me why you wanted him dead. 
 A sensible girl. With a sensible name. 
 Margaret. 
 Do you love her? 
 I barely know her. 
 But she loves you. 
 How do you know? 
 Who wouldn't fall in love with you, Sidney? 
 So what's her name? 
 The girl who has your heart? 
 Tell me why you wanted him dead. 
 What's her name? 
 Amanda. 
 You came to see Sidney. 
 That's why you're in Cambridge. 
 He got a pasting off your husband. Did you know that? 
 I didn't know. Is he all right? 
 He'll get over it. 
 He'll never get over you though. 
 Do you want him to be happy? 
 You know I do. 
 Of course I do! 
 Then take my advice. 
 Steer well clear, Amanda. 
 It's just there are days when there is no-one else. 
 You think he's the only one who'll understand. 
 I know he is. 
 You must know how that feels. You must tell him things you can't tell anyone else. 
 Let him forget you. 
 You can't do it, can you? 
 Her husband is landed gentry. 
 I could never offer her the same life he does. 
 Amanda would... never be a vicar's wife. 
 Did you ask her? 
 She'd only say no. 
 You're just like my husband. You make a decision without even asking her. 
 You've done the same. 
 For Joan. 
 You did it all for Joan. 
 You were saving for her. 
 A penny here, shilling there. 
 But it was the final straw when he threw it away on the horses. 
 Was it not letting her into college? Was that it? 
 Why do you feel the need to investigate other people's lives? 
 Is it because you're dissatisfied with your own? 
 I mean, you must be. You pray. 
 Praying is just a form of want. 
 What is it that you want, Sidney? 
 When you're not trying to be a saint. 
 You killed him. 
 You have no proof. 
 I have all the proof I need. 
 You know the trouble with being a saint, Sidney? 
 You have to be dead. 
 Geordie. 
 Sidney? 
 'Sidney?' 
 Sidney. Sidney! 
 .. as soon as the police show up. 
 Calm down! 
 I knew we should have run. 
 Please, I can't think! 
 You won't get far. They'll find you. 
 Are you ready? 
 I don't understand. Where are we going? 
 Just trust me, darling. You do trust me, don't you? 
 What have you done? 
 Bring the car. 
 What if somebody sees? 
 Just bring the car! Take my hand. 
 Don't be scared. We have to go. 
 Perhaps you should go. 
 Just bring the damn car! 
 Police! 
 What do they know? 
 What do you mean, "What do they know?" 
 Tell us what to do. Tell us what to do! 
 There's still time. I'm not leaving you. 
 Please! 
 What did she tell you? That she loved you? 
 Shut up. 
 Is that why you killed her husband? 
 She was using you. 
 Shut up! 
 It was all for Joan. 
 Tell him. 
 Tell him. 
 Sidney? 
 Geordie! 
 It was no life. 
 Stay away. 
 You deserved better! 
 Stay away! 
 She used you. 
 Just like she used Theo. 
 There's nowhere to go. 
 I had to protect Joan. 
 Geordie, we're coming out. 
 No! Joan! Wait! 
 It was no life! 
 No! 
 Our love for each other is a precious thing. 
 Love should be... nurtured and encouraged. 
 Not manipulated to meet our own needs. 
 Or to defeat our own fears. 
 Love shouldn't be stifled. 
 It should be allowed to blossom. 
 For those who have love... are truly blessed. 
 I was worried I'd frightened you off. 
 I'm afraid to say I'm a man who's frightened of his own shadow. 
 What if I told you there's nothing to be scared of? 
 Then I think I'd believe you. 
 You never stop, do you? 
 You really are a saint. 
 If you don't like me, tell me. 
 Don't worry. I'm not going to top myself. 
 I'm a grown up. I can take it. 
 I'm no saint. 
 Do you believe in ghosts? She won't leave me alone. 
 Anna's with God. 
 She isn't. She's back. 
 You're the girl keeping Sidney out of trouble, are you? 
 I've done something wicked. And I've never felt more alive. 
 You're not defending that monster? 
 I'm going to say what I believe is true. 
 Do you want to tear the village apart? 
 It is not your job to play God. 
 Do you find the prisoner Gary Bell guilty or not guilty or murder?
