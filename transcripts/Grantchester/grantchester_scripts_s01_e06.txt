 Amanda : Sidney Chambers. I just knew it was you! 
 She was admiring you like you were a Botticelli. 
 Just like we used to when you picked up Jen from school. 
 Lilian even held her breath once and managed to faint. 
 You carried her to Matron. We were beyond jealous! 
 (giggles)  You don't remember? 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 Amanda Kendall. 
 Of course! 
 Of course, Amanda! 
 It's been a long time. 
 Mm, years. 
 Before the War, has to be. 
 But you look... 
 Older? 
 Wiser, hopefully! 
 ..different. 
 No pigtails. 
 (laughs) 
 Guard : Morning, Miss Kendall. 
 Ah, morning, Albert. 
 Do you work here? 
 Mm, restoration. 
 And you... Look at you! 
 Who'd have thought it, eh? 
 Who'd have thought? 
 She's down in the dumps. 
 So would you be if you were married to him! 
 I think he forgot to put his teeth in this morning! 
 I think she knows where they are and she has no intention of telling him! 
 I'm never getting married. 
 I don't believe that for a second. 
 I'm going to be come wild and eccentric and full of opinion. 
 I'm sure you have an endless supply of suitors. 
 Dad's always got someone lined up. I like my work. 
 I like my life. 
 You're a man of God. How about, if you disapprove of any of them, you have the power of veto? 
 What if I disapprove of all of them? 
 Well, you won't be the only one. I know I do! 
 We should do this again. 
 Mm, we should. 
 We shall. Next week, go to the theatre. 
 Oh! Toffee apples. We'll have toffee apples. 
 Toffee apples? 
 Mm. 
 How your mind works! 
 You may kiss me, if you like. 
 Next week, then? 
 Next week. 
 Amanda Kendall! 
 Sidney Chambers! 
 Sidney? 
 Archdeacon. I hope this isn't a bad time? 
 A hungry chicken waits for no man. 
 You're having a crisis of faith? 
 God isn't the problem. 
 Crisis of self, then? 
 Sometimes I worry about the kind of man I'm becoming. 
 Good Lord, don't we all? 
 But I've behaved in ways I'm not proud of. 
 Leaving your highly inexperienced curate to hold the fort? 
 Criminal investigations? 
 Women, one of them distinctly German? 
 A friend of mine's getting married, and I can't seem to be happy for them. 
 It just goes to show you're as human as the rest of us. 
 No, it's... It's not just that. 
 Sidney, the race is not always to the swift or... 
 (together) .. the battle to the strong. 
 I've said that before? 
 Many, many times! 
 My job is to make sure those in my charge take a long view of life. 
 That's what I'm trying to do. 
 My advice would be to hold your nerve. Hold a steady course. 
 And if I don't feel I can? 
 Well, there's always academia. Be a bloody shame though! 
 (dog barks) 
 We're your search party! 
 I've only been gone an hour. 
 It's nearly three. Mrs M kept count. 
 I have a theory, if you'd be willing to hear it? 
 All these investigations. 
 They force you to think about life in a manner that's contrary to who you are, your faith, your character. 
 It's unsettled you. 
 I'm fine. 
 Look... 
 I know people think I'm ridiculous. 
 No one thinks you're ridiculous. 
 Oh, they do. I don't mind, really. 
 I know how it feels when the black dog comes calling, and I'm not talking about Dickens. 
 (barks) 
 What I'm trying to say, very badly, as it happens... 
 I'm always here if you need someone to listen. 
 You're going to make an excellent priest, Leonard. 
 From the Archdeacon. 
 Eggs? 
 With his compliments. 
 He summonsed you? 
 He didn't summons me. 
 Someone's been telling tales. Mr Brant. 
 Leonard : It's always Mr Brant! 
 The old miser! 
 They're trying to edge you out. I will not let them do it. 
 Tea at the orchard. 
 I completely forgot! 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I am so sorry. 
 I don't mind, Sidney. 
 No, you should. You should mind. I... 
 You worry too much. 
 What is it? The night with the jazz singer? 
 The rich one's impending nuptials? 
 It's Hildegard. 
 What is it with you and women? 
 It's a mess, that's what it is. 
 They fall at your feet! Even my Cathy thinks you're a catch! 
 I should tell her. 
 Who? 
 Hildegard. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm going to tell her. 
 Good! Excellent! What's stopping you? 
 What's stopping you from doing it right now? 
 Now, shut up for five minutes! 
 Cathy thinks I'm a catch, does she? 
 Don't you go getting any ideas! 
 I'm not here, I'm in the pub. 
 Jones has been shot. 
 Jesus! 
 May God Our Father have mercy on you, forgive all your sins and give you a place in glory. 
 May the blessing of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be with you now and in eternity. 
 No, get off! Get off me! 
 Atkins : She was touting for business 20 yards away. 
 I didn't see nothing. 
 That's a double negative, Annie. Just tell us what you saw and you can go. 
 Bugger yourself sideways, Geordie! 
 No, you're hurting me! Get off me! 
 Geordie! 
 I remember you! 
 I remember you too, Annie. 
 Well, how's about that? 
 You must have been terrified. 
 I'll only talk to him. 
 Give me a minute? 
 See? They fall at your bloody feet! 
 He will make sure you're protected. 
 I isn't no fool. That's a double negative, by the way. 
 No one's going to protect me. No one gives a damn. 
 I give a damn. 
 They were talking, the copper and the man who shot him. 
 So they knew each other? 
 He was asking him some questions about a mate they had in common, then he pulls out a gun. 
 A mate? 
 Well, did you hear anything else? A name? 
 Merlin. 
 Merlin? 
 It's what it sounded like. 
 Jonsie just got married last year. I got pissed at their wedding! 
 Betty, her name is. 
 She's a nice girl. 
 Maybe Merlin's a nickname, or... I don't know. 
 You'll get who did this, Geordie. 
 Put in a word with the fella upstairs, would you? 
 Merlin! 
 (honks horn) 
 That wasn't the name of his mate. That's where he works. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Well, Jonsie, the shooter, their mate. 
 If we find the connection, we find our man. 
 I want the name of every fella that works here. 
 How do we find that? 
 I don't know. 
 Ah, you love me really! 
 I wouldn't be so sure! 
 (gunshots) 
 Geordie? 
 Geordie, did you hear that? 
 Oh, God! 
 Geordie? Geordie? 
 Geordie? Geordie? 
 (mumbles) 
 Heart. 
 Heart. 
 What do you mean, heart? 
 Stay down... 
 Stay down. 
 I've got you. 
 I don't want to die. 
 You're not going to die. 
 You are not going to die. 
 Sorry, you can't come any further. 
 Cathy : Sidney? Oh, Sidney! 
 (sobs) 
 Will you pray for him? 
 We can pray together, if you like? 
 I'm not really the praying sort. 
 When David was poorly, when he was so small... oh, I did then. 
 I won't let him leave us, Sidney. 
 He is not leaving us. 
 Mrs Keating? Chief Inspector Benson. 
 Is there anything I can tell the boys? 
 We'll get the b*st*rd, I promise you that. 
 What was he doing on his own? 
 He wasn't. 
 I was with him. 
 Playing at cops and robbers, were you? 
 All just a silly jape, eh? 
 So you're the vicar I hear tell of, Keating's talisman? 
 What does he do, rub your head for luck? 
 Atkins : Mr Chambers provides religious advice. 
 Well, let me provide you with some police advice. 
 There is a nutcase murdering my men. 
 Get out from under our feet. 
 It's not your men he's killing. 
 It wasn't Geordie he was after, it was the man in the factory, the caretaker, the dead man. 
 Keating just got in the way, is that it? 
 There is some connection between Jonsie, the caretaker. 
 Some other reason. Geordie was convinced of it. 
 Piss off back to church, Mr Chambers. 
 Leonard : What's the matter? 
 I know you're troubled, Sidney. 
 I know you have nightmares. 
 But you must know that God is looking over us. 
 I won't hear any nonsense about this being your fault. 
 If we'd have never gone there... 
 If you'd never met him in the first place... If, if, if! 
 You can't live your life like that. 
 You once said the wisest thing to me. It's life we deal in. 
 The good, the bad. It's how we face it that matters. 
 The police are wrong. They'll be looking in the wrong place. 
 Sidney... 
 My boy... 
 Tell us how we can help you. 
 This is not acceptable. I've been waiting a long time! 
 Take a seat please, madam. 
 I've been robbed! 
 This woman is my mother and she's been robbed! 
 I heard her. Have a seat. 
 Snatched my handbag right off my arm! I had two bob in there! 
 Two bob in my mother's handbag. 
 And my knitting! 
 She was knitting a scarf. 
 I want to speak to your superior. 
 Sit down please, madam. 
 Oh, dear! 
 Mrs Maguire? 
 Oh, no! 
 Mum? Mother? I mean, Mum! 
 Mother? Mother! Mum? 
 Mother? 
 Madam? 
 Is she all right? 
 Mother? Mother? 
 Mum? 
 (door squeaks open) 
 Officer : Old dear having some sort of fit. 
 Oh, for pity's sake! 
 My mother has a very delicate constitution. 
 Thank you. I feel so much better now. 
 My mother feels so much better now, so... 
 You should've been on the stage, Mrs M! 
 I should've done a great many things! 
 Did you find what you were looking for? 
 Atkins : Mr Chambers? 
 Do whatever it is you have to do. 
 Thank you. 
 Great Eastern Street. 
 The bomb site? 
 All council housing. 
 Had complaints, of course. Too modern, too... ugly. 
 Too full of the working classes? 
 Absolutely. 
 So you're taking Jonsie's funeral? 
 Yes, and I understand you're footing the bill? 
 Mm. 
 Well, it's the least I could do. 
 Poor b*st*rd spends five years defending his country, ends up getting shot in a suburban street. 
 Barely makes sense, does it? 
 Band of brothers. 
 People bandy that phrase around, but we really were. 
 Closer than brothers. 
 So you served together? 
 I was his commanding officer. We were in Italy, Germany near the end. 
 We were some of the first to liberate Belsen. 
 Thomas Langshaw... 
 Did he serve under you, too? 
 Yes, he did. Why? 
 He was killed last night. 
 Woman : Darling, what do you think? 
 I know you like the blue, but this is more becoming, wouldn't you say? 
 Oh, sorry! 
 Er, wear the blue. 
 I just want to look my best for you. 
 Wear the blue, Grace! 
 They were shot, both of them. 
 Who's been shot? 
 I'm sure the police are dealing with it. 
 Who's been shot, James? 
 Two men from your squad. 
 Why would anyone want to kill them? 
 Funny, Jones never struck me as the type to have a vicar. 
 Well, everyone has a vicar. 
 It's whether they choose to use them or not. 
 Please pass on my condolences to the family. 
 If the police had a list, names of your men... perhaps they could do something. 
 Perhaps they could warn them. 
 See Mr Chambers out. 
 
 
 
 Are you family? 
 Sidney : 'I'm a friend.' 
 Is he alive? Tell me that much, at least. 
 'He hasn't woken yet. Until he does, we won't know much more. Sorry.' 
 (dead tone) 
 Geordie : 'I don't want to die.' 
 I want to go home. 
 (chatter and laughter) 
 (piano plays) 
 Sidney? 
 I needed to see you. 
 I had to see you. 
 How are the wedding plans? 
 Fine. 
 Fine? Good. 
 This Saturday? 
 Yes, this Saturday. What do you want, Sidney? 
 Amanda, your guests are here. 
 I'll be right in. 
 You haven't even spoken to the Parkers. 
 I will. 
 What are people going to think? 
 Just give me a minute. 
 Let's go on the river, let's have a picnic. 
 Another time. I'll come down to Grantchester. 
 One of your little jaunts? 
 What happened to that growing wild and... and eccentric and full of opinion? 
 You're drunk. 
 I exert my power of veto. 
 Love is a minimum requirement, don't you think? 
 There has to be some in a marriage, or... what hope do you stand? 
 What is it that you want, Sidney? 
 Tell me, what is it? 
 Now is not the time. 
 It was never the time. 
 Yes, it was! 
 It was! 
 Let's get you outside, Sidney. 
 He's going. 
 Bit of fresh air, how about that? 
 I can manage. 
 No, you can't. 
 For God's sake, Guy, get rid of him! 
 Yeah. 
 Sidney? 
 I can manage! 
 I can manage! 
 Mr Brant : Mr Chambers? A word, please? 
 What, Mr Brant? What could possibly be so important? 
 Hildegard : Mr Brant, is this about the wisteria in the churchyard? 
 It's a menace. 
 I don't suppose you could help us cut it back, could you? 
 Well, I'll see what I can do. 
 You're a wonder, Mr Brant. 
 We could go and visit Cathy, if you like? 
 Take something for the children. 
 (pours drink) 
 You drink more and more, these days. 
 My friend may die. 
 But before then. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm fine. 
 Why do I feel like one man went to London, and another one came home? 
 (thud on floor) 
 Mrs Heath? 
 They're all there, all the men from my husband's squad. 
 He doesn't know you're here? 
 A few of them still live in the area, so shouldn't be hard to find. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 You'd never think it to look at him, would you? 
 That he'd been through all that. 
 He saw the camps. He saw evil. 
 After that, how did any of us expect anything to be normal again? 
 Robert Miller? 
 Whoever's doing this are picking us off one by one, aren't they? 
 I don't know for sure. 
 That's what you reckon though, isn't it? 
 I believe you're all in danger. 
 I don't think I've ever felt out of danger since we got home. 
 When was that? 
 It was 46. 
 Me too. 
 Seven years. 
 My wife, she never asked what we did. 
 I never told her. 
 My sister, she asked. She wanted to understand, but... how can you explain? 
 But you saw some things. 
 I did some things. 
 We fought the Nazis. 
 Felt like heroes. 
 They moved us to Berlin, to oversee things. 
 But really it felt like there was nothing to oversee. 
 Yeah. I spoke to James Heath. 
 Oh, that man? He's a bully. 
 What is it he's so afraid of me finding out? 
 Spreenhagen. It's in the countryside outside Berlin. 
 What happened there? 
 My friend was shot too. 
 And if he wakes, I want him to know I've done everything I can. 
 Ask him. Ask Heath what he did. 
 Did you notice? Phoenix. It's what he calls his company. 
 Some people rise from the ashes, don't they? 
 Heath : .. no more than ten houses per acre, central heating, each with their own garden. 
 Basic, but a far cry from the conditions these people are used to. 
 Will you excuse me? 
 This is a private event. 
 Sorry, it won't take a moment. 
 It won't take any time at all. 
 Er, Spreenhagen. 
 What happened, Mr Heath? 
 Grace, call the police. 
 Poor Jones is dead, Thomas Langshaw is dead. 
 There's a reason you're being targeted. 
 Darling, let's get you a drink. 
 Call the police. 
 Do it! 
 I have nothing to hide. 
 Let go of me. 
 You are trespassing, Mr Chambers. 
 Let go of me! 
 Benson : Is it naivety? 
 Or is it sheer bloody-mindedness? 
 Please, tell me. 
 Because I'm failing to understand why you insist on interfering. 
 I was trying to get to the truth. 
 The truth? 
 Mr Heath is withholding information. 
 He's a respected businessman with an alibi for both murders. 
 His wife? 
 Yes, his wife. 
 She's petrified of him, of course she gave an alibi. 
 I'm pretty sure he beats her. 
 Hm! She said as much, did she? 
 She didn't have to. 
 You want the truth? Here it is, Mr Chambers. 
 You are not a police officer. 
 I never claim to be. 
 Get yourself a hobby, I don't know... take up stamp collecting. 
 Don't patronise me. 
 You want me to put you in a cell, you arrogant little sh1t? 
 Mr Heath has chosen not to press charges, against my advice, I hasten to add. 
 You're free to go. 
 What is Mr Heath hiding? 
 Did you ask him? 
 He wasn't exactly forthcoming. 
 He didn't bring any of it back with him. 
 How can it touch some people... and not others? 
 I often wonder that myself. 
 And my wife, she moved to her mother's three weeks back. 
 Said that I wasn't the man she married any more. 
 Couldn't even hold down a job. 
 I don't sleep, you see. I have nightmares. 
 I have nightmares, too. 
 I know how painful it can be to think about the past. 
 But if what happened in Berlin, in Spreenhagen... if it has any bearing on these deaths... 
 Heath said they were trying to escape. 
 Who? 
 German soldiers. 
 Hands on your heads! 
 POWs, three of them. They'd surrendered to us. 
 Heath, the others... they never liked me. 
 Said that I lacked moral fibre, that I was a coward, and this was my chance to prove them wrong. 
 They're running away, see? 
 Bitte nicht! Bitte nicht! 
 Bastards are getting away! 
 Do it, you poof! Stop snivelling and do it! 
 Come on, Miller! 
 Do it! 
 Nein! 
 (three gunshots) 
 They were young boys, really. 
 The others, they just laughed at me. 
 Tell the police. 
 Nothing touches that man. 
 Stand up to him. 
 He's killing us so we can't expose him. 
 We can't ruin his perfect life. 
 You are not a coward. It took courage to disobey his order. 
 Don't let him get away with it. 
 Will you come with me? 
 Of course I will. 
 Geordie : 'Heart.' 
 Heart. 
 (footsteps) 
 What do I tell them? 
 Tell them the truth. 
 What? 
 It wasn't Heath, it was you! 
 (groans) 
 Woman : 'Operator?' 
 Put it down! 
 Put it down! 
 They don't remember. 
 Heath, Jones, none of them remembered. 
 It meant nothing to them! 
 You can't know that. 
 They came home and they forgot. Why can't I forget? 
 You think you're the only one? 
 They didn't care. 
 I remember, Robert. 
 Nobody cared. That's why I did it. 
 I remember what I did. 
 I am not a coward! 
 I know you're not. 
 I am not a coward. 
 I understand. 
 Oh, no. 
 I do. We live in the shadow of it, all of us. 
 But we have a choice, don't we? 
 You have a choice. 
 You can... stay in the shadow or you can live. 
 Let me talk to them. 
 I didn't mean to hurt you. 
 I know you didn't. I can make them understand. 
 Your friend, he wasn't supposed to be there. I was just... 
 I-I know. 
 You must hate me. 
 I don't hate you. 
 I don't hate you! 
 You have a choice, Robert. 
 We all do. 
 No, no! 
 (gunshot) 
 Sidney? 
 Let me get some... 
 (grunts) 
 Did you pray for me? 
 Of course I did. 
 Praying for an old heathen? 
 It worked, didn't it? 
 Don't you ever do that to me again. 
 Thank you. 
 So we found him, but he killed himself. 
 Coward's way out. 
 It was the War. 
 He couldn't forget. 
 That's no excuse. 
 Isn't it? 
 (sighs)  We all have that cross to bear. 
 I killed one of my own men. 
 I said, "All clear." 
 We're clear! 
 I told them it was all clear. 
 But we'd missed a German, and... 
 (gunshot) 
 We told him to stay down, but... 
 (gunshot) 
 Sandy, get down! Get down! 
 'But he was on his feet, and the bullets, they just... 
 (gunshot) 
 I put my hand on his stomach, but there was... 
 It's all right. No, Sandy! Sandy... 
 It... It was... 
 (sandy groans) 
 I want to go home. 
 (moans) 
 I know you do, Sandy. 
 I know. 
 I want to go home. 
 I want to go home. 
 (gunshot) 
 I... I had no choice. 
 He'd written a letter... to his sweetheart. 
 But I never sent it... because it was covered in his blood. 
 And... And I thought that... 
 I thought that no one should see that. 
 You did what you had to do, Sidney. 
 It's all any of us did. 
 (scales played on piano) 
 Very good. Excellent. 
 When I was in London, I spent the night with a woman. 
 What was her name? 
 Gloria. I'm so sorry. 
 Please believe me when I say that since I met you... you've kept me going. 
 I let me husband do this to me. 
 I won't let you do it, too. 
 Everyone always needs me, but erm... but I need you. 
 (footsteps) 
 Your poor face! What happened? 
 They took it down. 
 I am so sorry. 
 I know. 
 It was - 
 I know. 
 I know, Sidney. 
 Nearly D-Day. 
 Mm. 
 Are you ready? 
 I think so. 
 I won't be there, I'm afraid. 
 Something's come up at the church - 
 You don't have to make excuses. 
 Look at us both! 
 Me getting married and you... You with God. 
 It was never meant to be, was it? 
 We could never be so. 
 Thank you for showing me a way out of the shadows. 
 Oh! 
 You do speak in riddles sometimes. 
 Well, for the good times, then. 
 We have had fun, haven't we? 
 We've had a riot. 
 And we will again. 
 We will. 
 What will they replace it with, do you know? 
 Something less dreary, I hope. 
 I hope so. 
 'I had to say goodbye.' 
 'I just needed to say it, I think.' 
 'We have a choice, don't we?' 
 'We can live in the past...' 
 'We can look forward.' 
 'Or we can live now.' 
 'Because we can't change what's happened.' 
 You ready, darling? 
 'We can't predict the future.' 
 'None of us knows what's around the corner. That's the truth of it.' 
 'All we can do is keep a long view...' 
 .. hold a steady course.' 
 You're just going to get on with it? 
 That's all you need to say. 
 What are you doing to poor Leonard? 
 Making him a princess. 
 More of a prince, wouldn't you say? 
 No, definitely a princess. 
 Oh, right! 
 Don't go too far. 
 What? 
 Don't go too far. 
 Cathy : We know you can hear us! 
 They're a worry, aren't they? 
 That's enough now. 
 Just a few more. 
 Come and sit down. 
 No! 
 So...she'll be married by now? 
 She was out of my league. That's the truth of it. 
 Maybe because you're in a league of your own, Sidney Chambers. 
 Perhaps I should just accept that I'm married to the job. 
 Yeah, bollocks! 
 (laughs)  How did I know you were going to say that? 
 Don't worry, we'll find you a wife. 
 Please God, no! 
 Why not? 
 Cos if you have anything to do with it, she'll be a fan of light opera. 
 There is nothing wrong with that. 
 There is everything wrong with that! 
 ♪ And it is, it is a glorious thing to be a pirate king ♪ 
 (laughs)  Truly awful! 
 We'll find you a girl who likes a bit of Becket, then. 
 "Bechet", Geordie. 
 It's "Bechet".
