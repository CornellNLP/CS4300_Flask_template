 Announcer : The 6:39 train from Cambridge... 
 WHY do you like it? That's what I don't understand. 
 Don't you dare say, "Because it's hip." 
 Who says that? No-one says that. 
 Don't they? 
 (laughs)  No. 
 I like it because it's full of intensity and feeling and... 
 Jazz is a metaphor for life. 
 Like a load of chaos and you're glad when it stops. 
 You know what you need? A very large drink. 
 Busy, isn't it? 
 It's London, Geordie. 
 It stinks. I've already got soot up my nose. 
 (traders shouting) 
 I'm more of a light opera man. 
 I'm not sure that's something you should admit to. 
 Gilbert and Sullivan. 
 Not out loud, at least. 
 Pirates Of Penzance. 
 ♪ And it is, it is a glorious thing ♪ 
 Both : ♪ To be a pirate king ♪ 
 Awful. Truly, truly awful. 
 Well, at least it has a tune. 
 That is not tobacco. 
 Geordie, just this one night we are OFF duty. 
 Go on! On your bike! 
 Tell him he hasn't won! 
 Keep walkin', sunshine. 
 He hasn't won. 
 You tell him! 
 Off duty, you say? 
 Without a doubt. 
 How can I help you gents? 
 We're guests of Mr Johnson. 
 Junior or Senior? 
 Junior. 
 Have a wonderful evening. 
 Ah! I was getting worried. 
 Oh, we've finally managed to drag you out the sticks, have we? 
 It was a close call. 
 Inspector. Didn't recognise you without the iron bars between us. 
 No hard feelings, I hope. Nice place you've got here. Very... hip. 
 Sidney, this is Claudie. 
 Hello. 
 Isn't he handsome? Those cheekbones and everything. 
 Don't know about that. 
 Really, Jen? Smoking? 
 Nag, nag, nag. 
 That's what us big brothers are for, isn't it, eh? 
 Stop it! 
 Man : Oi. 
 Dad. 
 Come 'ere. 
 Bloke in blue. Seen his suit? 
 Yeah, it's Savile Row. 
 Man's got money to burn. Been here 20 minutes, hasn't been served. 
 Justin's on it. Someone's got to be. 
 Dad... 
 Boy's gotta learn. 
 This way, gents. 
 (♪ relaxing jazz ♪) 
 "Very hip"? 
 I don't know. 
 What's all this? 
 Ladies love it, Guv. You should give it a try. 
 Cheeky sod. Get yourself a short back and sides. 
 You want anything... you ask Justin. 
 Here we are. Put the troubles of the world behind you, fellas. 
 (applause, cheering) 
 To putting our troubles behind us. 
 No, no. To the Pirates Of Penzance.

 'Scuse me. My friend would like your autograph. 
 Well, what's your name, friend? 
 Sidney. 
 And what is it you do, Sidney? 
 He's a detective. 
 Amanda's an explorer. She's just come back from Kathmandu. 
 Where the hell is Kathmandu? 
 Er... It's er... past the Great Wall of China, just to the right. 
 You two married? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Me neither. You don't keep the carton once you've smoked the cigarette. 
 If you get my meanin'. 
 Where is Kathmandu, anyway? 
 Past the Great Wall of China, just to the right, so I hear. 
 Did you know that life is a metaphor for jazz? 
 Sidney told me that. 
 That's not what I told you. 
 Isn't it? 
 No. 
 This man... 
 I love this man. 
 You're drunk. 
 I'm not. 
 Am I? 
 Very.

 Claudie. 
 It's Claudie. 
 Police. 
 (man's anguished cry) 
 Johnny. 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh, God. Claudie! 
 Claudie. 
 Oh, God! 
 Johnny, she's gone. 
 I'm so sorry. She's gone. 
 Let her go now. 
 An industrial counterweight. 
 They brought it with them. Have you noticed? 
 No uniform. 
 Where the hell is it? 
 Who are you? 
 Detective Inspector Keating, Cambridgeshire Constabulary. Who are YOU? 
 Detective Chief Inspector Williams, Metropolitan Police. 
 I'm his colleague. 
 (sighs) 
 Judging by the amount of alcohol you've consumed, you're off-duty? 
 Look what they've done to her. 
 Come back inside. 
 Guv, come inside. 
 I want 'em hunted down. I want them found. 
 You understand me, Jacob? 
 We'll get 'em, Archie. 
 Don't you worry. 
 Mr Johnson found her. Covered her with his coat. 
 She was wearing a uniform - 
 Thank you... Inspector. 
 Cambridgeshire. 
 Not a lot for you to do down there, I imagine. 
 No, we just sit around all day, picking our arses(!) 
 And you. You weren't much help. 
 Impersonating a police officer. Bloody hell. 
 Johnny : Dad? 
 Dad. 
 D'you get used to it? Seeing the dead? 
 I don't think you ever do. 
 There's no stillness, is there? 
 No... peace. Just... 
 Absence. 
 I must look a mess. 
 A little bit. 
 Man : Amanda. 
 Johnny's sister's died. 
 I know. 
 No, Jennifer needs me here. 
 I'm not going to argue about this now. 
 "Not a lot to do up in Cambridgeshire." 
 We're not on first-name terms with club owners, that's for sure. 
 There are no clubs in Cambridge. 
 Even so. 
 She was just a child. 
 Why kill a child? 
 All I know is something like that would not have happened at Gilbert and Sullivan. 
 Will you tell Johnny? 
 Don't worry - it's not catching. 
 What's this? 
 Egg. I think. 
 At least, it was an egg once. Possibly. 
 I knew I should have gone home. I'm a creature of habit, me. 
 Never have guessed(!) 
 Make myself a cuppa. Boil myself an egg. 
 You don't make your breakfast. Cathy does. 
 Still. Four minutes to perfection. 
 Which I've discovered is exactly enough time to shave. 
 That and a quick change of clothes. PJs off. Suit on. 
 Change of clothes? 
 Mm. All in four minutes. 
 Gives me a quiet sense of satisfaction. 
 This is gonna stop us going home, isn't it? 
 (typewriters clacking) 
 Jen. 
 Sidney. 
 How's Johnny? 
 I don't know what to say to him. 
 It's all right to say nothing. 
 But... 
 I saw Claudie checking coats. 
 But it wasn't Claudie, was it? I recognised your bracelet. 
 Jen, just tell us. 
 Claudie has a boyfriend. He's coloured. 
 You'd think Mr Johnson, of all people, would understand. 
 Claudie was on her way to meet him so I put on her uniform. 
 Why didn't you say? 
 I don't know. 
 You should have said. 
 I don't need to be told off, Sidney. 
 This boyfriend... 
 Erm... Walter Stirling. 
 He works at Borough Market. 
 How are we gonna find this fellow? 
 We already have. 
 Say it! Say what you did! Say it! 
 Say it! 
 (men shouting) 
 Go about your business. Police. 
 This is all YOU! 
 Justin, come here. 
 Did you see her, Officer? When she'd... 
 Did you see her? 
 Did she have time to be afraid? 
 It would have been quick. 
 I hate to think of her afraid. 
 She was coming to meet you. 
 Yeah, I waited. 
 And I knew. I knew he'd done something! 
 Who? 
 Who do you think? 
 I'm studying. Going to be a teacher. 
 None of that matters to her father. We tried talkin' to him but - 
 Don't you put this on the guv'nor! 
 You seen how he is with her! You know how he is with her! 
 Come to the station, make a statement. 
 I do that, I won't have my freedom for long. 
 This is her father's doin'. 
 I'm sure of it. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 It's what Dad wants. 
 He always gets what he wants, does he, your dad? 
 Bit handy with his fists, is he? 
 Oi. That's enough. 
 Johnny. 
 Claudie asked me to tell you something. 
 "Remember what Mum used to say." 
 That's what she said. 
 You told me once how violent your father can be. 
 I won't say nothin' against him, Sidney. 
 Boy, where's the music? 
 We should go home, Dad. 
 He's right, Arch. Let's call it a day, eh? 
 Whose side are you on? 
 What? 
 You want me to be intimidated? 
 Course not. 
 Are you sure? 
 Come on, Arch. 
 Sometimes I wonder about you. 
 We are not closing. Justin. 
 (jukebox plays jazz) 
 (door opens) 
 Oh, Christ on a bike. 
 Any news? 
 There will be, Archie. Don't you worry. 
 No, it's these boys I'm after. Keating. 
 Sir. 
 Can't say I'm into jazz, myself. Prefer a bit of light opera. 
 The investigation's going well. Uncovered quite a few interesting things. 
 Most interesting of all... 
 You're legit. But YOU... Well, there IS a Sidney Chambers in Cambridgeshire. 
 He's a vicar. 
 Mrs Maguire and Dickens won't stop getting at each other. 
 I'm certain the dog knows what he's doing. He has a definite glint in his eye. 
 If you could go to the parish meeting... 
 That dog is the devil. Tell him. 
 I've told him. 
 Why the dickens isn't he home? 
 I'm on the next train. 
 We're gonna miss it. 
 Mr Hopkins telephoned. 
 Guy? 
 He hasn't written his sermon. Tell him. 
 He's on his way. 
 What did Guy want? 
 I'll see you on there. 
 To meet you. 
 Haven't written your sermon. 
 (barking) 
 Please. Come home. 
 
 
 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 I took the liberty of ordering you a sherry. 
 That's what vicars drink, isn't it? 
 You must think me a fool. 
 Of course I don't. 
 It's just the two of us, Sidney. 
 No need to pretend. 
 I love Amanda. 
 And I know she feels the same. 
 Amanda and I... 
 We've been friends for a long time. 
 No, you haven't. 
 Not friends. 
 I've always seen it, I think. 
 Seems such a... trial... trekking down to Grantchester all the time, back and forth, back and forth. So... we're getting married in London. 
 In our local church, with our local vicar. 
 We've set a date. Three weeks' time. 
 Why wait? That's what we thought. 
 You'll still come, of course. 
 Er... I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
 You won't see so much of Amanda afterwards. 
 You know how married life can be. 
 Oh, I suppose you don't. 
 My friend the detective. 
 I'm not a detective. 
 I'm a vicar. 
 Yeah, I can see that. It's the kind face you got. 
 I'm not a threat to anyone. 
 I don't know about that. 
 Drinkin' to forget? 
 Gloria. 
 Always. 
 You're on. 
 Mine's a bourbon. No ice. 
 I like forgettin', too.

 Hey. 
 Preacher man. Where you goin'? 
 I have no idea. 
 (church bell rings) 
 What time is it? 
 10:30. 
 You supposed to be somewhere? 
 Yes. I'm supposed to be somewhere. 
 How do I get back from here? 
 Metaphorically or...? 
 Justin will take you. 
 You're gonna feel bad about this, ain't ya? 
 Don't feel bad. 
 I could say that a million times and it wouldn't make no difference, would it? 
 Sidney. 
 We all do things we ain't proud of sometimes. 
 That's what makes us human. 
 Awful, ain't it? Thing like this. 
 Accident like this happening to Claudie. 
 She was like a sister to me. Such a sweet girl. 
 Gloria and Claudie - were they close? 
 Dunno about close. 
 I think Gloria was jealous. 
 Claudie being younger than her. 
 She can be a bit like that sometimes. 
 You must be special. 
 She never takes 'em home.

 Oh, back at last, then? 
 Are you going to tell me or do I have to guess? 
 I spent the night with Gloria. 
 Bloody hell. 
 I'm supposed to set an example. 
 I'm supposed to be above reproach. 
 It was no good, then? 
 No, that's not what I'm saying. 
 So it WAS good. 
 You sly old dog, Sidney. 
 I found this. 
 A charm from Claudette's bracelet. 
 (telephone rings) 
 It was in her room. 
 Er, Inspector Keating. 
 Charlie Rush. 
 Come again? 
 August 24th 1941. 
 You can do the rest yourself. 
 The bouncer from the club. 
 Jonesie. 
 Get me everything that you can find on this. 
 Sir. 
 How do I explain where I found it? 
 I'll sort that. 
 You been home yet? 
 I missed the service. 
 I have to tell Hildegard. 
 You do that, she's off. 
 Unless that's what you want. 
 You know what you've never been any good at? 
 Please, tell me. 
 Differentiating between tasks that are urgent and those which are not. 
 Mr Finch had nothing prepared for his sermon. Ended up waffling on. 
 It wasn't waffle. 
 It was utter waffle. 
 Oh. 
 She's been waiting ever so patiently for you. 
 It's been hell. 
 Mr Finch! 
 Yes. 
 They're like headless chickens without you. 
 I have a gift. 
 It's the right one, isn't it? 
 Yes, it's er... It's the right one. 
 I had my first piano student yesterday. 
 One of your Scouts. Gareth. 
 Very sweet. 
 And Mrs Maguire recommended a friend of hers who can offer me more permanent lodgings. 
 She's tolerable, apparently. It's her new favourite word - "tolerable". 
 When I was in London... 
 There's something you should know. 
 I saw Amanda. 
 Amanda and Guy. 
 I bumped into them... by accident. 
 So I bit the bullet and told them I could no longer take their wedding because, I don't know, it doesn't seem right, somehow. 
 It's a weight off my mind, really. 
 So I... I thought you should know. 
 What? 
 You're in desperate need of a shave. 
 (barks) 
 Not the Bechet. I love the Bechet. 
 More to the point, YOU love the Bechet. 
 And... Miles Davis? 
 Oh, he's gone, too, has he? 
 If it weren't sacrilegious, I'd say that album was almost a godly experience. 
 That man needs to learn how to write a proper song. 
 You're keeping the Becket, though? 
 Bechet. 
 I'd rather grown to... not... like him, exactly, but tolerate him. 
 High praise indeed, Mrs M. 
 (knock on door) 
 I don't understand. You love your music. 
 We love the fact that you love your music. 
 Has something... happened? 
 I mean, Johnny is so lost. It's er... 
 Can you think what it must be like to lose a sibling without even a chance of a farewell? 
 I mean, it's unimaginable. 
 The funeral's tomorrow. 
 You know all the right things to say. 
 No, I don't. I really don't. 
 (telephone rings) 
 The Vicarage. 
 Charlie Rush. Found dead 12 years ago. 
 In the warehouse where he worked. 
 Beaten around the head just like Claudie. 
 No weapon at the scene, but guess what - Williams was the investigating officer. 
 Arrested Archie, but released him without charge. 
 It's the funeral tomorrow. 
 No, Geordie. 
 Archie at his most vulnerable. You know how vulnerable people like to talk. 
 Mr Johnson. 
 What do I tell people... if they talk about their children, ask about mine? 
 Do I stay silent? 
 Or do I tell 'em, "I had a daughter once. She was beautiful."? 
 She never had the last rites. 
 I know it may sound strange, but... what if she's out there in the cold... 
 .. all alone? 
 God wouldn't allow it. 
 She wasn't cleansed of her sins. 
 I don't think it's HER sins he's worried about. 
 Someone's trying to send me a message. 
 They beat her at my club. Covered her with my coat. 
 Why would they do that if they weren't sending me a message? 
 YOU didn't cover her? 
 No. 
 Just... try. 
 She dragged you here, did she? 
 She thinks I'll know what to say. 
 D'you wanna know what it was Mum used to say? 
 That "However bad things get... you've got each other. 
 You've always got each other." 
 I want her back, Sidney. 
 I want Claudie back. 
 Mr Johnson. 
 You're not welcome here. 
 I want to say goodbye. 
 You're not welcome here! 
 Let him see her, Dad. 
 Or what? Or what? 
 I don't wanna do this. 
 Yes, you do! 
 Archie. Leave him. Leave him!

 Johnny. Don't. 
 Don't. 
 Did you ever love us? 
 Did I ever love you? You, your mum, your sister, you're my whole world. 
 We don't look like you. Is that all it is? 
 Claudie was runnin' away. Did you know that? 
 She was leavin'. Just like Mum tried to do. 
 Careful. 
 With that fella from next door. 
 The kind fella who treated her nice. 
 I mean it. 
 You can't hear it, can you? She was takin' me and Claudie with her and you caught us. 
 D'you remember? Cos I remember. 
 You beat her so bad, I thought that was it. 
 Shut your mouth. 
 You ground her down. You wore her down. 
 And it was a relief when she died. 
 Cos I didn't have to watch you hurt her no more. 
 Shut your mouth, boy! 
 I am NOT...a boy. 
 Still feelin' bad? 
 Course you are. 
 I found this in your room. 
 I let Claudie meet Walter at my place. They were in love. So? 
 So you knew they were running away? 
 We're all runnin' from something, Sidney. Who was I to stop them? 
 What is it YOU'RE runnin' from? 
 (footsteps approach) 
 You are going to like this. 
 Have you ever been unfaithful? 
 Hm? No. And you haven't, either. 
 It's not me, Geordie. It's not what I do. 
 Don't dwell on it. 
 Don't dwell on it? 
 Mm-hm. 
 This was Charlie Rush's address. 
 I lied to her face. 
 It wasn't even a good lie. Accidentally bumped into Amanda? 
 Doesn't even make sense. 
 And THIS was Archie's in 1941. 
 The kindly neighbour. 
 Archie's missus was having it away with Charlie Rush. 
 Are you even listening? 
 Yes. 
 Archie says someone's sending him a message. 
 So say he found out his wife was knocking off the bloke next door. Archie does him in. 
 12 years later, his daughter's killed. It's a revenge killing. 
 Eye for an eye and all that stuff you harp on about. 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe? 
 What? Just "maybe"? 
 Why now? 
 Well, because... 
 (sighs) 
 I don't know. 
 And if we are gonna rip my theories apart... why cover her up? 
 If you're trying to send a message, why not let Archie see her all battered and bruised? 
 Do they serve booze in this place? 
 Bit of communion wine or something? 
 You're dwelling again, aren't you? 
 He was ashamed. 
 Mm? Who? 
 That's why he covered her up. 
 He couldn't face what he'd done. 
 Charlie Rush. Archie bashed his brains in, didn't he? 
 Is this an interview? 
 You think the murders are related. 
 Feels like an interview to me. 
 In fact, I think you KNOW they are. 
 What makes you so sure? 
 I didn't want no part of it then. I don't want no part of it now. 
 Where is Archie? Why are you still protecting him? 
 You scared of him? 
 He went off in the car. I don't know when they'll be back. 
 You dunno where to look for them. 
 When Archie done Charlie in, I should've stopped him. 
 I wish to God I had. 
 He caved his skull right in with that thing. That bit of metal. 
 Then Claudie. It was just the same. 
 It was the same weapon? 
 There was a kid. The night Charlie bought it. 
 A kid in the warehouse. 
 I told him to get the hell out of there. 
 I thought he'd scarpered. 
 (whispers)  Sidney. 
 Man : Sit up straight, Johnson! 
 Recognise this place? Been here before? 
 Look around you. Look at it. 
 Not such a big man now, are you? 
 Sit... up! 
 (man groans) 
 Just do it! 
 Get up! 
 Agh! 
 Justin. 
 That's enough now. 
 What do you want, Justin? 
 An eye for an eye? 
 Claudette for your father? 
 I wanna watch his pain. 
 And now? Now what do you want? 
 An apology. 
 I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 Say it. Say his name! 
 Say his name! 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie Rush. 
 Say what you did. 
 Say what you did! Say what you did! 
 I beat him. I killed him! 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm SORRY! 
 It's not enough, though, is it? 
 So what now? Killing Claudie wasn't enough? 
 An apology? It's not enough. 
 What now? 
 Justice. 
 What if that's not enough? 
 Go on. Do what you have to do. JUST DO IT! 
 It's not gonna bring your dad back! 
 All right... 
 Justin. Justin, this is not you. 
 I know this is not you. 
 You had to cover Claudie up. You hated what you did. 
 You couldn't look at her. 
 You saw what happened to your father, didn't you? 
 Justin. Look at me. 
 Look at me! 
 Look at me. 
 This isn't you. 
 (drops the weapon) 
 (sobs) 
 Funny thing, grief, isn't it? 
 Does weird things to you. 
 Come on, then. How'd you know? 
 We're from Cambridgeshire. Got a lot of time on our hands up there(!) 
 He couldn't face what he'd done. 
 He tried to cover her up. 
 Accident like this, happening to Claudie. 
 An accident, he said. 
 I think that's what he wanted to believe. 
 Some accident. 
 'He got a job at the club. Made himself indispensable.' 
 He'd been biding his time, waiting to take revenge. 
 'When he saw Claudie was leaving...' 
 You off somewhere? Need a lift? 
 '.. he knew the time had come to act.' 
 Benson. That's your guv'nor, isn't it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 He'll be getting a phone call first thing. 
 Outstanding work, Keating. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Er, sorry, sir. 
 Mr Johnson confessed to killing a Mr Charlie Rush. 
 Confessed to who? 
 To him. 
 Confession to a murderer won't stand up in court, I'm afraid. 
 How about to a police officer? 
 And a vicar? 
 How long have you been on his payroll, Inspector? 
 I don't know about in Cambridgeshire, but in the Met slandering a senior officer isn't the done thing. 
 Long enough to cover up a murder. 
 I'm warning you, you jumped-up little b*st*rd. 
 "Inspector Jacob Williams announced that suspect Mr A Johnson had been released without charge, stating he wasn't in the vicinity at the time." 
 Not in the vicinity, my arse. 
 Evans. That's your guv'nor, isn't it? He'll be getting a phone call first thing. 
 (shoves document at him)  Little souvenir for you. 
 (church bell rings) 
 Repentance, the Bible tells us, is a form of sorrow. 
 'Sorrow for one's sins... and the resolution to turn from them. 
 To learn from them.' 
 Recognising our sin means being honest with ourselves... accepting who we are... and embracing who we hope to be. 
 Because that is who God has intended us to be. 
 And we should never pretend to be otherwise. 
 You saved them. 
 Hildegard saved them. 
 You haven't even noticed, have you? 
 Noticed what? 
 While you've been off gallivanting... she's fallen in love with you.

 Leonard : It's very easy. We'll teach you. 
 ♪ And when you get religious ♪ 
♪ You want to shout and sing ♪ 
♪ There'll be a hot time ♪ 
♪ In the old town tonight ♪ 
 For God's sake, Guy, get rid of him. 
 I can manage. I can... manage! 
 ' Hildegard : I feel like one man went to London and another one came home.' 
 I worry about the kind of man I'm becoming. 
 You're having a crisis of faith. 
 I know you're troubled, Sidney. 
 I have nightmares. 
 Sidney, tell us how we can help you. 
 What is it that you want, Sidney? Tell me! What is it?
