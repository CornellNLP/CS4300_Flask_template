 (CHUCKLES) Bloody hell. 
 "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." 
 What do you think? 
 I think it gives me a dignified air. 
 I don't think anything gives you that, Sammy. (LAUGHS) 
 How do you feel? 
 (EXHALES) Ready? 
 To do God's work? 
 (CHUCKLES) What? 
 You soft Northern b*st*rd. 
 Soft Southern b*st*rd. 
 Dearie me. He DID knock you about. 
 It's not the bruises that hurt so much as the words. 
 Your pride's dented. 
 Don't pretend it's anything else. 
 He's in a terrible way. 
 You know how he gets, with the drinking and... 
 He's lost. 
 And we're all lost without him, so... 
 It's Abigail's birthday. 
 Monday. 
 Aggie wants us to spend it with her. 
 Commemorate it,...talk to her. 
 What do I say? 
 My heart stopped when hers did? 
 That what I say? 
 (LAST ORDERS BELL RINGS) 
 How do I find the strength? 
 I don't know. 
 Home time, sweetie. 
 It's me, Mavis. 
 Already had your housekeeper in, shouting the odds. 
 It's more than my life's worth. 
 You're no fun. 
 (GROANS) Woah, careful! 
 Dance with me. (LAUGHS) 
 You're gonna get me sacked. 
 You wouldn't even remember, would you? 
 Night night, Mr Chambers. 
 (CAR HOOTER BLARES) 
 (CAR HOOTER) 
 (EXHALES) 
 (GROANS) 
 (CHURCH BELLS RING) 
 (GROANS) 
 (CHURCH BELLS RING) 
 (DOORBELL TINKLES) 
 It's Sidney, isn't it? 
 Is he drinking? 
 If you'd just come and see him. 
 We've decorated the nursery. 
 It's odd, really. 
 I never saw myself as a mother, but it's going to be such an adventure, isn't it? 
 There has to be a line in the sand. 
 We can't keep playing this game, Sidney and I. 
 Such a shame. 
 What is? 
 You two. 
 Darling? 
 In here! 
 Mr Hopkins. 
 Mrs M was just visiting her sister. 
 She, erm... 
 Oh, good for Mrs M. 
 I was telling her about the nursery. 
 Would you tell the maids to stop moving my things? 
 It's driving me to distraction. 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 You're coming to the fete, I hope, Archdeacon? 
 Absolutely. 
 The highlight of my year. 
 We need someone with a strong voice to announce the tombola. 
 (DOG GROWLS) 
 All the eights, 88. 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 (CHUCKLES) Very good. 
 Very commanding. 
 Hello, Sidney. 
 How long's he been like this? 
 Let's not equivocate, Leonard. 
 I can call you Leonard, can't I? 
 That is my name, after all. 
 Sidney's had a marvellous time here. 
 Absolutely. 
 But perhaps it's time to cut out the dead wood. 
 You can't mean that. 
 Don't tell me you haven't looked at this place and imagined yourself at the helm. 
 We certainly have. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Gary Bell was hanged. 
 I saw it in the paper. 
 I was there. I was with him. 
 Where have YOU been? 
 You got a 15-year-old girl pregnant. 
 Do you know what that makes you? 
 That makes you a rapist! 
 No. 
 Go to the police. Hand yourself in. 
 I loved her. 
 She died aborting your child! 
 She felt the same. She did. 
 Listen to yourself. 
 Look, if I'd have known what she was going to do, if she'd have told me... 
 I lost her, Sidney. 
 I loved her and I lost her. 
 Some days I can barely go on. 
 I didn't think you liked me. 
 I didn't. 
 Not for an awfully long time. 
 I made a promise once - 
 'for better, for worse.' 
 I thought the better days would arrive, but they never did. 
 That's what no-one tells you. 
 That how it starts... is most likely how it ends. 
 Be happy, dear. 
 Can you forgive me, Sidney? 
 (DOORBELL) 
 I could face everyone else if I knew that you'd forgiven me first. 
 Sidney! 
 You wouldn't be up for a pint, would you? 
 By the look of you, you're about ready for a top-up. 
 I'm gonna kill him! 
 Get out of my way! 
 Get off me! 
 Please, Mr Redmond! 
 Please. 
 You knew where he was. 
 I didn't. 
 I am gonna kill him. 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Sam Milburn's back. 
 You've talked to him? 
 Where is he? 
 I don't know. He ran. 
 You have an address? 
 No. 
 He didn't mention a town or anything? 
 If you see him again... 
 Of course. 
 b*st*rd needs locking up. 
 I know. 
 Thank you for the information. 
 (JAZZ MUSIC BLARES) 
 The Lord bless you and keep you. 
 The Lord bless you and keep you. 
 (DOORS DROP OPEN) 
 Sam : Sidney! Help! 
 (EXHALES) 
 (SQUAWKING) 
 Who's to say it's human? 
 Could be from a fox, or... an unfortunate cat, or... 
 I heard screaming. 
 Foxes scream. 
 Not for help, Phil. 
 Natty dresser, this unfortunate cat of yours. 
 That's Sam's. 
 Harding threatened to kill him. 
 This Milburn's too? 
 I don't know. 
 Find out whose this is. 
 Boss. 
 And get some fellas down here, search the meadows. 
 There's more than likely to be a body out there somewhere. 
 You're the only lead I have, so... 
 Sure you don't need a referee? 
 Keep things clean? 
 They'll push Sidney out, whether I take the job or not. 
 They'll throw him to the wolves. 
 You have to love the church. 
 Preach one way of life, live entirely another. 
 It's the Archdeacon. 
 I can't stand the man. 
 That's the first time I've heard you say a harsh word about anyone. 
 He deserves it. 
 He deserves worse. 
 Tell me what to do, Daniel. 
 You don't need me to tell you what to do. 
 Stand up to this Archdeacon fellow. 
 Give him hell. 
 I thought you knew me. 
 You're a brave man, Leonard. 
 Braver than you know. 
 In most things. 
 I'm...I'm sorry. I'm trying. 
 I really am. 
 We were at home. 
 We were in bed together. 
 They've been harbouring him. 
 Did you know that? The Church. 
 No-one's been harbouring anyone. 
 You might forgive the debtor his debts but we can't. 
 You were the only one who knew Sam was back. 
 Why do you do this? 
 Why do you side with the person who's done us harm? 
 I'm not siding with anyone. 
 If it was my little girl, I'd want to string the b*st*rd up too. 
 But if you've taken the law into your own hands... We were If you have gone down that path... 
 We were in bed together. 
 I'm sorry, Geordie. 
 I'm...I'm so sorry for everything. 
 Ah, don't worry about it. 
 We were never really going to see eye to eye, were we? 
 Well, I'm old enough to be your father for one thing. 
 You're not that old. 
 50 next week. 
 (SIGHS DEEPLY) We have different priorities. 
 Don't we? 
 Different ways of thinking. 
 Phil  (through radio): 'Command to 438 over.' 
 (SNIFFS) 
 You found me a body yet? 
 'I'm working on it. That car is registered to an Esther Br*** 41 Spencer Road. I had a little chat with her. She's got a lodger - the Reverent Sam Milburn.' 
 That's Bar Hill. 
 That's barely ten miles away. 
 He's been here the whole time. 
 (ENGINE STARTS) 
 A vicar lodging with a divorcee? 
 Can you imagine it? 
 I thought Sam would be a right stuffy bugger, but he is the loveliest, most un-vicary vicar I've ever had the pleasure to meet. 
 When did you last see Sam? 
 Yesterday. 
 I work shifts behind the bar at the Dog and Whistle. 
 Stay over sometimes. 
 It's easier that way. 
 But he keeps an eye out for Gilly. 
 They should be back any time soon. 
 Who's Gilly? 
 My daughter. 
 And they're close, are they, Sam and Gilly? 
 Thick as thieves. 
 He takes her to the pictures and... 
 Put it this way, she was a surly little madam before he moved in. 
 Now she's good as gold. 
 How old is she? 
 15 next month. 
 Some of her clothes are missing. 
 He's a man of the church! 
 He wouldn't do anything to her. 
 Right. We have no body yet. 
 Until we do, we have several avenues to explore. 
 It's possible Sam Milburn has absconded with a child. 
 What about the blood on the grave? 
 It could be his. 
 Could be hers. Could be anyone's. 
 We found his bloody jacket, Geordie. 
 All right, Phil, let's say he's dead, shall we? 
 The girl's still missing. 
 Could be locked up somewhere, screaming for her mother. 
 Wh She was wearing a white blouse and a navy school pinafore with a prefect badge on her collar. 
 Gillian Bradley. 
 14 years old. 
 Blonde hair. 
 Could still be wearing her school uniform. 
 Her whereabouts, unknown. 
 She's so proud of that silly little badge. 
 You see all this and... 
 You assume. 
 He was vouched for. 
 He had references. 
 References from whom? 
 Bloke who pays his rent. 
 He said he was some bigwig at the church. 
 (SOBS) I just... 
 Someone from the church knew. 
 I think they were protecting him. 
 You seem surprised by that. 
 Abigail's dairy. 
 It's where it all began. 
 He took Abigail to the pictures too. 
 So? 
 What if there's a pattern to what he does? 
 He took Abigail to a hotel. 
 Do you remember? 
 Allen House Hotel. 
 Samuel Milburn. 
 Come on. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Gilly. 
 Don't be scared. 
 I'm a police officer. 
 You're not in trouble, Gilly. 
 Where's Mr Milburn? 
 Where is he? 
 So Sam takes you swimming, does he? 
 Where else do you go with him? 
 The pictures, maybe? 
 Gilly... does Sam ever ask you to do anything you don't want to do? 
 He doesn't ask you for a kiss, say? 
 I know you don't want to talk about it, but you'd be helping us. 
 You really would. 
 I'm not making tea today. 
 I'm on a tea embargo. 
 Oh, my goodness. Look at that one. 
 Oh, it's too frilly. 
 She looks like she's wearing my nanna's curtains. 
 You're a prefect, are you? 
 I hope you give everyone what for. 
 Even the boys? 
 Especially the boys. 
 They're stupid sometimes. 
 Most of the time, I find. 
 You stepping out with anyone? 
 He says I'm not to tell. 
 Why's that, then? 
 You shouldn't have to keep that kind of thing a secret. 
 He says I'm as beautiful as Grace Kelly. 
 He'd be right there. 
 Have you kissed him? 
 As beautiful as Grace Kelly. 
 b*st*rd even uses the same lines. 
 Gilly. 
 Gilly, I know you don't want to get him into trouble and I understand that, but it is so important. 
 Do you know where Sam is? 
 He left, but he didn't come back. 
 He left me. 
 He wanted absolution. 
 He wanted my forgiveness so he could carry on. 
 He'd have carried on anyway. 
 (SIGHS DEEPLY) 
 So, we're back to the search for a body? 
 The girl hasn't seen him since last night. 
 You ask me, b*st*rd got what was coming to him. 
 He misses you something rotten. 
 He might not say it, but... 
 We're fine. 
 (CHUCKLES) What? 
 You're like an old married couple. 
 You wanna take a leaf out of that book of yours. 
 Forgive and forget - isn't that what it says? 
 Not quite. 
 That's what we learnt at Sunday school. 
 Forgive the trespassers and all that. 
 Forgive the debtors. 
 Forgive the debtors, then. 
 You know it better than I do. 
 How did Harding know Sam asked for my forgiveness? 
 He said... "You might forgive the debtor his debts... but we can't." 
 Not many priests use that version of the Lord's Prayer, but Sam did. 
 Harding had to have seen him again. 
 He had to have seen Sam after he fled. 
 Or else how else did he know? 
 Which one of you sleeps in here? 
 We were together all night. 
 Why were they stacking straw? 
 So that's what they were hiding. 
 I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder. 
 We're the ones who lost a child! 
 We're the ones who lost everything! 
 You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but what you say may be put into writing and given in evidence. 
 I'll be fine. 
 I'm arresting you *** 
 No, Geordie. 
 She has no alibi either. 
 You're not obliged to say anything... 
 Where's your compassion? 
 But what you say... 
 Have you no heart? 
 ..may be put into writing... 
 
 
 
 So what does the day hold for you? 
 Nothing eventful. 
 Do you remember when we first met? 
 Course I do. 
 Do you remember why you fell in love with me? 
 That's a very odd question. 
 We arranged to meet at that bar just off the Strand. 
 You'd come from work. You talked non-stop about some artist or other. 
 Velasquez. 
 You were witty and...bright and full of stories. 
 I thought you were wonderful. 
 What happened to that girl? 
 She's here. 
 She's right here next to me. 
 We were parents once. 
 Harding was a father. 
 I was a mother. 
 Sometimes I wonder - what does that make us now? 
 What time did he get home? 
 See, I think you know what time, Agatha. 
 I think you saw him come back. 
 I think you saw the blood. 
 I wasn't at home. 
 Where were you? 
 She's the only one who understands. 
 That when your child dies, most of you dies with them. 
 I didn't know they'd put her here. 
 Mrs Bell. 
 How are you, Phyllis? 
 You didn't come and see me. 
 I meant to. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Have you had other visitors? 
 Agatha bought me a rose. 
 When was that? 
 Last night. 
 What about this morning? 
 She was still here. 
 Fast asleep, poor love. 
 No-one had the heart to wake her. 
 Agatha has an alibi. 
 We're releasing her without charge. 
 Did you go to Abigail's grave this morning? 
 Did you meet Mr Milburn there? 
 Took away so many things. 
 He didn't lose anything. 
 I stabbed him. And he fell. 
 And that was that. 
 Where's his body? 
 In a clearing up in Brading Woods. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Sam's dead. I think the Archdeacon was protecting him. 
 I think he put him into a house with a 14-year-old girl. 
 You're sure of it? 
 Who else could it be? 
 I just... 
 How could he do that? 
 There are days I feel like giving up. 
 Please don't say that. 
 I've tried my best. 
 Of course you have. 
 No-one needs you to be perfect. 
 Or have all the answers. 
 I know. I know that. 
 They just need you to be here. 
 (SIGHS) 
 They need you to listen and... 
 I can set my watch by you. 
 When I was last here... Before or after you put your hand up my skirt? 
 (CHUCKLES) See? 
 Knew you wouldn't remember. 
 Er... Harding tried to talk to me. 
 He said something about visiting Abigail? 
 Yeah, it was her birthday yesterday. 
 They were going to her grave. 
 That's what he said. 
 Where? Here? 
 Harding : 'Aggie wants us to spend it with her. Commemorate ***' 
 Phyllis : 'Agatha brought me a rose.' 
 You lied for them. 
 Phyllis : 'He came to the grave. Told them he was sorry. Wanted them to forgive the debtor his debts.' 
 (STAB) 
 (GROANS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 Sidney : Where's his body? 
 Phyllis, where's his body? 
 He's not here, is he? 
 Why would you bring us all the way out here? 
 What do you gain from stalling? 
 Nature has to take its course. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 (GASPS) Help me. 
 Help me. 
 Help. 
 Help me up. 
 I met Gilly. 
 You fooled us all, didn't you? 
 Help me up. 
 When did this start? 
 Was it at college? 
 Was it even back then? 
 It's bad, Sidney. 
 Abigail? 
 Gilly? 
 (TEARFULLY) I...I think I'm dying. 
 How many more? 
 How many more young girls? 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 How many more? 
 I'll be better. I will. 
 (WINCES) 
 Forgive me. 
 Why? So you can just carry on? 
 You have to forgive me. 
 As a priest, not as a friend. 
 Sidney. 
 Sidney! Sidney! 
 Don't leave me. Don't leave me. 
 You can't do it. 
 I know you. 
 Have some pity. 
 For God's sake, have some pity. 
 What d'you fancy? 
 Knee-trembler's only a shilling. 
 That's very kind, but I've just had my lunch, so... 
 Oh, Christ. 
 I believe I have some damning information which may well result in an arrest. 
 Course you do. 
 Come on, then. 
 (SAM GASPS AND WHIMPERS) 
 I just want peace! 
 This won't bring it. 
 Where does it stop? 
 If he dies, do you have to die? 
 Where does it stop? 
 Abi will still be dead. 
 Agatha! 
 Gary will still be dead. 
 There needs to be justice. 
 This isn't justice. 
 It has to stop now. Let's stop now. 
 I just want peace. 
 I know you do. 
 You won't find it like this. 
 A mother needs to be strong. 
 You ARE strong. 
 Aggie, you are. 
 She told me about the baby. 
 I walked out of the room. 
 And I didn't help her. 
 (TEARFULLY) I didn't help her. 
 (SOBS) I'm so sorry. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Leonard. 
 Good to see you. 
 You've had time to mull over our little tete-a-tete, I hope? 
 Cutting out the dead wood? 
 Replacing it with fine new foliage. 
 What do you say? 
 No. 
 I say no. 
 You won't be removing Sidney from the diocese because you'll no longer be here. 
 And you'll no longer be here because you will be hanging your head in shame in a court dock. 
 Accessory after the fact, they call it. 
 You paid for Sam Milburn's shelter. 
 I got the receipts from his landlady. 
 I was keeping an eye on him. 
 Did you know a 14-year-old girl was living there? 
 Absolutely not. I... 
 You're many things, Archdeacon, but you're not a very good liar. 
 Are you questioning my judgement? 
 Sam atoned for his sins! 
 The Bishop will have something... to say about this. Yes. 
 I knew you were going to say that. 
 He did. 
 He said you'd say that. 
 The Bishop knows. 
 I've already told him. 
 Now... 
 No, wait. Let me finish. 
 It's not Sidney who's the dead wood. 
 You're rotten to the core. 
 You really are. 
 No! 
 I'm not leaving her. 
 Let them stay together. 
 For God's sake. 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 I hate this job sometimes. 
 Still, justice must be done. 
 You think I wanted this? 
 They've suffered enough. 
 I just meant you have to do your duty, however much it costs you. 
 I can't forgive him. 
 I don't know many who could. 
 But I should. 
 You feel what you feel, Sidney, vicar or not. 
 Sidney. Sidney. 
 Thank you for saving me. 
 I'll remember you in my prayers. 
 Drop the charges against the Redmonds. 
 Everything you have done to them, everything you've put them through - it's time to do some good. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 I did it. I told off the Archdeacon. 
 You should have heard me. 
 I was like...Marlon Brando. 
 Oh, I feel giddy with it. 
 Who is he, Daniel? 
 Just a minute. 
 Oh, I see. 
 I didn't know I'd see you today. 
 No. 
 No, no. 
 No, I understand. 
 I thought I'd be waiting for you forever. 
 I can't wait forever. 
 That's what you do, isn't it? 
 When you love someone. 
 I know I waited long enough to meet you. 
 To forgive is not to make light of something that has hurt us. 
 None of us is perfect. 
 None of us will find it easy. 
 These things take time. 
 But there is a strength in forgiveness. 
 There is a potency. 
 Not only for those who have done us wrong, but also for ourselves. 
 In forgiveness...there is love. 
 (CHEERING) 
 Come on girls, you're missing it! 
 Sit down. 
 Right. Speech! Speech! 
 Yes, yes. 
 I'm too bloody old for speeches. 
 You're not too old. 
 Oldest man I ever stepped out with. 
 Sidney, you say something. 
 Oh no, do I have to? 
 Yes. You're the one who gives all the sermons. 
 All right. (GROANS) 
 All right. Geordie. 
 Someone recently asked me why we were friends, seeing as we have so little in common and he's old enough to be my father. 
 Ooh! 
 And he has a terrible habit of beating me at backgammon. 
 But the thing is, I don't think we ARE that different. 
 We both want the world to be a less frightening place. 
 You're a grumpy old sod, but er... well, I would be lost without you. 
 To Geordie! 
 All : To Geordie. 
 Grumpy old sod that he is. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Hello, Jack. 
 I'm a little overdressed, aren't I? 
 No, you look wonderful. 
 Chins off the floor, please. 
 Mrs M and Jack. Can you believe it? 
 There's hope for us all. 
 (TEARFULLY) What the Dickens. 
 What the Dickens. 
 It gets easier with time. 
 What does? 
 Living with a broken heart. 
 (SOBS) 
 Did I ever tell you about the day I got back from Burma? 
 No. 
 It's the day I met Cathy. 
 It's the day I decided not to look back. 
 You don't have to tell me. 
 In your war, you were a hero. 
 In mine... all I did was survive. 
 And thank God for that. 
 The thing is, Sidney,... some days I find it harder surviving than others. 
 And truth be told, I've been a bit lost without you. 
 I'm here now. 
 I'm here. 
 (SQUEALS AND LAUGHS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (SCREAMS JOYFULLY) 
 Dickens! 
 (PANTING) 
 I was just thinking about you. 
 Were you? 
 I was thinking I owe you an apology. 
 If anyone should apologise, it's me. 
 You never have to apologise to me. 
 You know that. 
 I've left him. 
 I've left him, so...erm... 
 I... I don't know what to say. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I know it's an inconvenience and I shouldn't always run to you, but... Guy's... He's so angry. 
 He says he won't let me do this, and my father's... he's all but disowned me. 
 You've left him? 
 (TEARFULLY) I have nothing, Sidney. 
 That's not true. 
 I have nothing. 
 You have me. 
 You've always had me.
