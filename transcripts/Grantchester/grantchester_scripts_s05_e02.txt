 Morning! 
  St John. 
  Ah, wonderful. 
  St John Gurney-Clifford. 
  - Will. 
  Pleasure to meet you. 
  - Pleasure's all mine. 
  Diana! 
  Ooh. 
  Can't face the world without my face. 
  Your bloody mother. 
  Well, you bloody invited her. 
  It's sterling work you do. 
  - Thank you. 
  - I've nothing but admiration. 
  Will's helping troubled boys. 
  Physical training. 
  - Er, boxing. 
  - Ah, you see? 
  Sterling work. 
  Well, it's what they pay me for. 
  How much is that? 
  It's not a great deal, I imagine. 
  Well, respect where it's due. 
  Must be quite some vocation when your chairman is, to all intents and purposes, invisible. 
  Well, there's more to life than financial reward. 
  Oh, he's teasing, darling. 
  Well, I'm very glad you made it, albeit a little on the late side. 
  We have an announcement to make. 
  Amie! 
  At least let the chap finish his coffee. 
  Oh, sorry. 
  I've asked your mother to marry me. 
  And I've said yes. 
  At our age it doesn't do to hang about. 
  Congratulations. 
  You will come to the engagement party, won't you, darling? 
  Whoever that is, I fancy you've done for 'em. 
  My mother's remarrying. 
  He calls her Amie. 
  No-one calls her Amie. 
  Why don't you like him? 
  He puts her down and she doesn't even notice. 
  Ah. 
  It doesn't matter what I think now, does it? 
  No, it's completely out of your control. 
  Embrace the freedom, Will. 
  What, and just watch her make a mistake? 
  Well, it's like I say to the boys. 
  We're a family. 
  And family's all about compromise. 
  St John. 
  What kind of name is St John? 
  Women of a certain age, no disrespect, can be rather intransigent. 
  She's marrying the first man with a blazer like my father's and an entry in Debrett's. 
  I made the mistake of mentioning the television set to Mrs C. 
  Why can't she just be on her own for once? 
  You should've seen the look on her face. 
  Like I'd broken the custard jug. 
  Yeah. 
  Vic says if you can't change something, you have to find another way round it. 
  You mean like going to your mother's engagement party with a protest placard? 
  That's actually quite tempting. 
  Dickie Astor. 
  Owns a finance company in Waterbeach. 
  Just gonna track down next-of-kin. 
  It's the hair. 
  And the tie. 
  Thinks he's in love. 
  Man whiffs like a tart's armpit. 
  - You get a look at the driver? 
  - No. 
  - Make of car? 
  - Maybe. 
  - Number plate? 
  - Yes. 
  And it'll come back to me any minute. 
  These orchids? 
  Don't see many of those growing on Jesus Green. 
  It's a big responsibility, but someone's gotta step up. 
  Will you stop flirting? 
  See what you can find out about these flowers. 
  Boss. 
  Can you confirm this is a murder inquiry? 
  Bloody Larry. 
  For the record. 
  Geordie? 
  She's the love interest? 
  - Why? 
  You jealous? 
  - No. 
  No! 
  Your husband, was he in the habit of buying you flowers, Mrs Astor? 
  Jacqueline, please. 
  Dickie wasn't really the sentimental type. 
  We're keeping an open mind as to motive. 
  Obviously, we're trying to trace the vehicle that ran Mr Astor down. 
  A Morris Eight, we believe. 
  - Oh, I'm so sorry. 
  - You don't have to be sorry. 
  Dickie and I have been together since I was 19. 
  Probably sounds facile to you, but he really did sweep me off my feet. 
  It's all rather pitiful that it should come to this. 
  Bailiffs? 
  Well, it looks like Dickie Astor was high on charisma, low on readies. 
  Here's the client list, but I never sat in on the meetings. 
  Cos Dickie Mr Astor. 
  He done most of them in the client's own home. 
  - Mm-hm. 
  - For the exclusive experience. 
  And I ain't got shorthand, so Or a reference now. 
  Mother's going to have my guts. 
  Fancy a cuppa? 
  Well, only if they've left you the kettle. 
  Right-oh. 
  You do not stay as well preserved as Mrs Jacqueline Astor without some serious investment. 
  Can't say I've noticed. 
  You do know it's not lying that makes you go blind. 
  Bingo. 
  This is definitely not meant for the taxman. 
  It was a nice car that ran Dickie down. 
  The kind that might have come from a house big enough for exclusive visits. 
  What if someone worked out what he was up to? 
  Could've been the client he stole from that ran him down. 
  Well, if we knew the number plate of the car, we could call round and ask them. 
  Retracing your steps. 
  American mumbo-jumbo. 
  Lot to answer for, those Americans. 
  Can you finish this conversation in your head? 
  Suppose you got used to losing stuff, living in a stately home. 
  Mum. 
  Of course back at ours it's either the living room or the kitchen. 
  - Engagement party. 
  St John. 
  - Or maybe the lav. 
  If I can crowbar the mother-in-law out of it. 
  Placard. 
  GSK 786. 
  "I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes". 
  Psalms 101. 
  I thought you hated Psalms. 
  I hate this monstrosity more. 
  GSK 786 is registered here in Grantchester. 
  Elliot House, Way Lane. 
  Way Lane. 
  Never heard of it. 
  - What? 
  - Police enquiry's ground to a halt. 
  All for the want of a little local knowledge. 
  Ah, well, it's wisdom, really, Geordie. 
  It's community spirit, Will. 
  Oh, give me strength! 
  You'll have me wearing one of your uniforms next. 
  - Leonard. 
  - Nothing! 
  Watch the potatoes. 
  Down the end there, through the trees. 
  - Way Lane. 
  - You're a Godsend, Mrs C. 
  I don't know about that. 
  Some of the stories What stories? 
  Oh, all old wives' tales probably. 
  Be home before dark. 
  Hello? 
  Anyone home? 
  You're trespassing. 
  - Er, Police, Mr erm? 
  - Graham. 
  We're looking for the owner of a Morris Eight. 
  Get back to your room. 
  Back to your room, do you hear me? 
  Damn fool. 
  That is an order! 
  Sorry. 
  I'm I'm I'm sorry. 
  Sorry. 
  This belong to you, does it, Sir? 
  Barely used it in 20 years. 
  I shall expect your apology in writing, officer. 
  How do you account for that, Mr Graham? 
  Idiots' lantern. 
  What the Dickens was Will thinking? 
  Yes, well, it's here now, so, just, if you Up a bit. 
  To the right. 
  - Oh! 
  - Perfect. 
  Right, well I'll see you in the morning. 
  Is that what he bought it for? 
  To watch a lot of little people singing in foreign? 
  It's a celebration of the ties between European nations. 
  It's convivial. 
  It's suspicious, is what it is. 
  Right, well. 
  Don't let me keep you. 
  How'd you explain the damage to your car, Mr Graham? 
  Does anyone else have access to it? 
  The gentleman you live with. 
  Your brother, is it? 
  Mr Graham, did you know Dickie Astor of R Astor Investment Brokers? 
  Is he circling in the hope of saving my soul? 
  I suspect you're long past that. 
  Dickie Astor is a family member. 
  Distant cousin. 
  Not distant enough. 
  When did you last see him? 
  R Astor Brokers. 
  A Mr Graham of Way Lane . . made some hefty investments. 
  Investments? 
  Oh, do keep up! 
  The man ran Ponzi schemes, for Christ's sake! 
  He was a con artist. 
  No-one but the most gullible would be drawn into financial dealings with Mr Dickie Astor. 
  - Your brother, then. 
  - Damn fool. 
  Don't call him that. 
  I found our savings book too late. 
  John had already parted with them. 
  For months that b*st*rd was working on him. 
  Bleeding us dry. 
  And then he had the utter gall to turn his attention to the equity in our house. 
  Well, I put a stop to that. 
  I threw Dickie Astor out and gave John the dressing down of his life. 
  If you're having bad luck, shouldn't you ask for help? 
  Instead of taking it out on your brother. 
  Bad luck? 
  You know nothing, with your God and your smug life, comfortably lived. 
  Luck, chaplain? 
  Dickie Astor cleaned us out. 
  We're all well shot of him. 
  Did you get in the car, Mr Graham? 
  Did you follow Dickie Astor? 
  Did you run him over for stealing your savings? 
  Mr Graham? 
  He's a bully. 
  Just one more controlling man who preys on the weak. 
  Thinks everyone should jump when he tells them to. 
  Still not completely sold on St John, then? 
  - Who's St John? 
  - No comment. 
  Any luck, Larry? 
  It's either Paphiopedilum or Phalaenopsis. 
  That's easy for you to say. 
  Neither of 'em grow in England, mind. 
  So, where did he get them from? 
  I don't know, boss. 
  Find out, then. 
  He's bloody useless. 
  Pint? 
  Er, I might go and check on the brother. 
  Oh, well. 
  Suppose there's no avoiding the mother-in-law. 
  I know when she's around. 
  The mice throw themselves on the traps. 
  That is terrible. 
  Got to get my pleasure from somewhere. 
  Pie's in the oven. 
  Pie. 
  Oven. 
  There's a tin of fruit salad for afters. 
  Fruit salad. 
  Marvellous. 
  Don't forget, dishcloths need soaking. 
  I wouldn't dare. 
  Night. 
  Psst! 
  Finally. 
  That was interminable. 
  You're home. 
  Ah there's only so long I could put it off. 
  Cathy says spam fritters are a favourite. 
  I could get used to this. 
  I'm pleased to hear it. 
  Because you are looking at Swinnerton's newest shop steward for ladies' wear. 
  Mum. 
  That's amazing! 
  I know! 
  All them union meetings came good. 
  - Shop steward? 
  - Yeah. 
  Vote was this morning. 
  Let me get my shoes off and I'll show you my badge. 
  Shop steward? 
  It's just another word for communist. 
  It's France. 
  It's France. 
  How many countries are there in Europe? 
  Now, I was going to get snails, but the only ones I could find were in the garden, so It's called a macaron. 
  Must have cost a fortune. 
  Oh. 
  It's a bit dry. 
  Do you think it's meant to be that dry? 
  I think it's perfect. 
  It's definitely a bit dry. 
  Just a touch. 
  Should've come in the other end of the lane. 
  You don't have to crawl through a hedge. 
  - Ordnance survey. 
  - Are you following me? 
  I got here first, so no. 
  Not technically. 
  You know I'm coming with you, don't you? 
  I've tried the door. 
  He's not answering. 
  Is it true Harry Graham's in court tomorrow? 
  He hasn't been charged with anything. 
  So, you are questioning him. 
  Why don't you ask Larry? 
  Am I sensing resentment? 
  No. 
  No! 
  You know the Brylcreem and cologne, that's for you, right? 
  I guessed as much. 
  Well, if it gives me an advantage. 
  You have no principles. 
  I have principles. 
  EXHALES Yeah, until the rent's due. 
  Says the man breaking and entering through a garden gate. 
  It's locked. 
  - We could climb over. 
  - No. 
  Absolutely not. 
  Do they not teach climbing at posh school? 
  My parents wouldn't pay the extra. 
  Wow. 
  This place has got so much love in it. 
  What? 
  That is the least cynical thing I have ever heard you say. 
  Is that the widow? 
  What's she doing here? 
  You go in mob-handed, you'll scare him off. 
  Mr Graham. 
  I'm sorry to intrude. 
  We were worried about you. 
  Where's Harry? 
  He's going to be spending the night at the police station. 
  I don't wanna speak out of turn, but if your brother is If Harry is treating you poorly, I can help. 
  Oh, Mr Graham. 
  Are those begonias? 
  I love begonias. 
  And those erm The little red flowers with the white bits? 
  - Antirrhinum. 
  - Yeah. 
  That's it. 
  I love those. 
  - And the statues. 
  - They're They're my pals. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  Dickie was here, wasn't he? 
  Before he died. 
  Is that why Jacqueline came to see you? 
  What happened, John? 
  - Stay back. 
  - John. 
  Stay back! 
  Thank you. 
  Erm, not so much for the music. 
  Or the macaron. 
  I don't want you to go. 
  You gave your word. 
  I saw a man take his last breaths today. 
  I doubt he spent his final moments worrying what others thought of him. 
  What Mrs C doesn't know won't hurt her. 
  And frankly it isn't really any of her damn business. 
  - Stay. 
  - Look, Leonard, I really - Morning. 
  - Morning. 
  Someone's hungry. 
  Yes. 
  Well Daniel's here, actually. 
  He is here. 
  I see. 
  - And I am here. 
  - OK. 
  And I am perfectly at ease with the decisions that have led to this moment. 
  Who put roses in my custard jug? 
  She's early. 
  - Say they're yours. 
  - What? 
  Say they're yours! 
  Er, they're mine! 
  They're mine. 
  - What are? 
  - The roses in the custard jug. 
  Won't you think of the custard, Will? 
  And put some clothes on. 
  Wandering round in your all-together. 
  I er I just I need you to erm - What? 
  - It's the television. 
  I know it's the television. 
  Can you hear that? 
  What? 
  - Hmm. 
  - It's probably all those Europeans. 
  Is that bits of pasta on the table? 
  Who's brought pasta into the vicarage? 
  Morning, Mrs C. 
  Up, dressed, not desecrating my tableware. 
  At least I can rely on one of you. 
  Ah, I hope you don't mind. 
  I wanted to ask something of you. 
  Of course. 
  Would you mind telling the police, I don't believe Harry Graham could have done this. 
  They're harmless. 
  I saw you in the garden with John. 
  - Spying now? 
  - Unintentionally. 
  It's beautiful, isn't it? 
  It's one place I can hear myself think. 
  Why were you there? 
  I feel sorry for them. 
  Dickie treated those poor old men despicably. 
  Did he treat you despicably too? 
  Did you love your husband, Jacqueline? 
  If anyone else asked that, I'd be insulted. 
  Not at the end, no. 
  I was naive enough to think we married for love. 
  It was all flowers and romance at first. 
  Once he'd drained my inheritance Marriage can be the loneliest of unions. 
  My parents, it wasn't exactly idyllic. 
  Put up with all sorts in a marriage. 
  Convince yourself if you just try harder, make a little bit more effort. 
  The truth is it doesn't matter how much cold cream you use, age always takes its toll. 
  Which is rather unfortunate when your only real value is in how you look. 
  Done? 
  Done? 
  Oh, blast. 
  Esme needs her PE kit ironing. 
  Full-time job being a mum. 
  Is that meant to be subtle? 
  - You don't need to take that tone. 
  - I'm not taking a tone. 
  You're a bobby's wife. 
  You're a mother. 
  So? 
  Am I not allowed to have any kind of life outside? 
  Someone has to say this. 
  Geordie clearly won't. 
  Your little job, it is pin money, Cathy. 
  It's about more than the money. 
  You never listen to me. 
  You've always been a let-down. 
  Have a good day. 
  Ham and mustard. 
  I don't care what you say, we're keeping her. 
  Bye, kids. 
  John grows them. 
  Well, that places Dickie Astor at the house. 
  Trying to con the brothers out of their savings. 
  Well, come on. 
  Spit it out. 
  John gets angry. 
  He lashes out. 
  The poor bullied brother? 
  More damaged than he seems, eh? 
  Maybe I got it wrong. 
  Wouldn't be the first time, let's face it. 
  John's the one Dickie conned. 
  John's the one with the temper. 
  John's Dickie's latest victim. 
  This isn't right. 
  You have no right to keep me here any longer. 
  You must be parched. 
  It's shell shock, isn't it? 
  John's suffering from. 
  Shut down. 
  Scared of his own shadow. 
  I've seen it before. 
  Burma. 
  John was at Passchendaele. 
  Saw his pals blown to smithereens. 
  Well, it's hard to live with someone when they're suffering like that. 
  When he came home, they wanted to put him in the asylum. 
  Christ. 
  John's fiancee took one look, hightailed it. 
  I didn't entirely blame her. 
  - John was - . . broken. 
  He wasn't my brother any more. 
  But you got him back on his feet. 
  I just steer the ship best I can. 
  It's the least you do, isn't it? 
  What else would you do, Harry? 
  Would you lie for your brother? 
  You weren't driving that car, were ya? 
  I haven't seen him drive the thing in years. 
  You think it's him. 
  I didn't see him drive it that day. 
  But if it wasn't you You lock him up . . 
  John's as good as dead. 
  Noooooooo! 
 
 
 
  Noooo! 
  John? 
  John. 
  Now, you put the axe down, Mr Graham. 
  Put it down, John. 
  Johnny. 
  You left me. 
  Well, I'm here now. 
  - I was frightened. 
  - I know. 
  But I'm here now. 
  I should've gone with my pals. 
  And where would I be, eh? 
  Where would I be without you? 
  I love you, don't I? 
  Damn fool. 
  Harry. 
  Johnny, you need to go with these gentlemen. 
  They're good chaps, I promise you. 
  - Are they pals? 
  - Very much so. 
  When you come back, I'll have this place ship-shape again, hmm? 
  Don't you worry. 
  That's it. 
  Take my hand. 
  We just need to ask you a few questions. 
  Is that all right? 
  Then can I see Harry? 
  John. 
  Did Dickie Astor come to your house? 
  The b*st*rd. 
  We're not gonna disagree with that. 
  He wanted your home. 
  Your garden. 
  Did that make you angry, John? 
  He didn't deserve them. 
  Didn't deserve what? 
  Phalaenopsis. 
  The orchids. 
  Did he pick them? 
  b*st*rd. 
  Did you get in your car, John? 
  Palumbina. 
  Paphinia. 
  Paphiopedilum. 
  Did you follow him to Grantchester? 
  Papilionanthe. 
  Papperitzia - Did you run him down? 
  - Paraphalaenopsis. 
  Peristeria. 
  Did you run the b*st*rd down, John? 
  I ran the b*st*rd down. 
  Can I see Harry now? 
  I hate this job sometimes. 
  Do you believe him? 
  War can do terrible things to a man. 
  And this is where you start decrying the younger generation. 
  "No idea how easy you've had it. 
  " You don't. 
  Will you knock, Larry? 
  Phalaenopsis Aphrodite. 
  Aphrodite was the goddess of love. 
  Love. 
  Murder. 
  This is a crime of passion. 
  You can chuck them, Larry. 
  We've got our fella. 
  Oh. 
  Right. 
  No, no, no. 
  Wait, wait. 
  Who were they for? 
  The wife. 
  No, no, she said he wasn't the sentimental type. 
  It was all flowers and romance at first, but not the end. 
  So, who were they for? 
  - Well done, Larry. 
  - Cheers. 
  Rosalind? 
  He was 45 years old. 
  Why wasn't Dickie Astor putting on his slippers and putting up with it like the rest of us? 
  Rosalind. 
  We just wanted to ask you a few questions. 
  Why do they always run? 
  Hey. 
  Rosalind. 
  Rosalind. 
  Rosalind. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Only one thing makes a person look more guilty than running away. 
  That's running away with bags. 
  Open them up, please. 
  Open. 
  You were having an affair with Dickie Astor. 
  You were siphoning off his cash, weren't you? 
  - What? 
  - I think he found out. 
  I think he jilted you. 
  Threatened to expose you. 
  You ran him over. 
  Didn't you, Miss Reece? 
  I can't drive. 
  He got them fancy flowers for me. 
  I never run Dickie over. 
  You can't say I run Dickie over! 
  I loved him. 
  Dickie loved me. 
  - Is that what he told you? 
  - Yes! 
  Sorry. 
  I'm sure he made all sorts of promises. 
  We were going to leave. 
  Move to London. 
  He was going to tell his wife. 
  He saved that money for him and me. 
  He knew life with Mother was rotten. 
  We was gonna get out of this dead end. 
  Dickie Astor didn't save the money, Miss Reece. 
  He stole it. 
  Middle-aged men are so predictable. 
  Oh, we're embarrassing. 
  I mean, naive, dowdy teenager or mature, confident woman. 
  - Which one are you gonna choose? 
  - Well, neither one, obviously. 
  Cue hilarious reference to celibacy. 
  On account of the halo and the celibacy. 
  What happens when you start taking the love of your life for granted? 
  All hell breaks loose, believe me. 
  What happens when they find out you're leaving them for someone else? 
  Someone younger. 
  Someone else he can take advantage of. 
  Where do we find her? 
  Rosalind was your final straw, wasn't she? 
  Charisma and some shared memories can only get you so far. 
  You were leaving Dickie. 
  I'd packed my bags. 
  Convinced myself I'd be back in two weeks, tail between my legs. 
  And that was the choice you made. 
  I'm a middle-aged woman. 
  My choices are limited. 
  No job since I married. 
  No real qualifications. 
  I'm very nearly invisible. 
  You borrowed the car, intending to leave. 
  John helped you. 
  You saw Dickie on the high street. 
  I couldn't lift my foot off the pedal. 
  I don't have to be sorry. 
  But I am. 
  Not for what I did . . 
  but for what we became. 
  Jacqueline Astor, I am arresting you for the murder of Dickie Astor. 
  You do not have to say anything. 
  Will you tell the brothers I'm sorry? 
  So, how's St John Wotsit-blah-di-blah-di-blah? 
  Still here, unfortunately. 
  You might've got him wrong. 
  He might be a sensitive soul. 
  Oh, I doubt it. 
  If I can get on with the mother-in-law No. 
  Really? 
  She made me spam fritters, Will. 
  You are so easily pleased. 
  - Ellie! 
  - No, no. 
  Don't go. 
  Don't! 
  What are you Behave yourselves. 
  You look smug. 
  I don't look smug. 
  I look contrite. 
  That's your contrite face? 
  Well, I was trying to apologise, but fine. 
  Oh. 
  Apologise for what? 
  Look, I know you think I'm cynical and rude And unprincipled. 
  I liked that old chap and his garden. 
  I hope we didn't scare him. 
  I'm sure he's fine. 
  I'm only the way I am cos I don't know. 
  I have to fight twice as hard as everyone else. 
  I'm a woman. 
  If you can't change something, you have to find another way around it. 
  Exactly. 
  You really have to work on your contrite face. 
  - Is it that bad? 
  - Terrible. 
  OK. 
  What about No. 
  No, that is just odd. 
  I know. 
  I'm late. 
  I'm sorry. 
  The meeting ran over. 
  My mum's right, ain't she? 
  I'll hand my shop steward badge back tomorrow. 
  No. 
  Eh, don't do that. 
  As long as she's staying around, we might as well put her to use. 
  Besides, Diana brings me my slippers. 
  You don't bring me my slippers. 
  Even when you were home full-time, I never got slippers. 
  You can get your own damn slippers. 
  Do the job you love, Cath. 
  I'm proud of you. 
  Even if you are a communist. 
  Ooh, what's this? 
  They're dead man's flowers. 
  Road traffic accident. 
  Oh. 
  Sweet. 
  Yeah. 
  Don't say I don't appreciate you. 
  Well, isn't this a lovely surprise? 
  Yes, shame you've had a wasted journey. 
  We have tickets for the opera. 
  Perhaps if you'd telephoned ahead. 
  I came to see Mum. 
  Sorry. 
  You go on. 
  I'll catch you up. 
  Five minutes. 
  The meter's running, Amie. 
  Darling, is everything all right? 
  I know your choices are limited. 
  But this man is er You don't have to compromise. 
  He puts you down just like Dad. 
  He belittles you. 
  I knew you'd do this. 
  Do what? 
  Drag St John into some immature grudge you hold against your father. 
  That is not what I'm doing. 
  You said you wanted me to try, William. 
  You wanted me to be happy. 
  Well, now I am. 
  You don't like that either. 
  Are you sure it's every other man who puts me down? 
  He is a bully, Mum. 
  And you deserve better. 
  If you don't approve of our engagement I don't. 
  I don't approve. 
  Then I don't expect to see you at the party. 
  Fine. 
  Family is one of life's greatest blessings. 
  Our path through life would be pretty lonely without anyone to share it with. 
  Family is about compromise. 
  And service and duty. 
  It is about finding another way round. 
  But family is also about drawing a line. 
  Saying this far and no further. 
  Enough is enough. 
  Matthew says, "If your brother sins against you, "tell him his fault, between you and him alone. 
  "If he listens, you have gained your brother. 
  " And if he or she doesn't listen? 
  Well, then take heart. 
  For we are all His children. 
  There is only one family. 
  And that is the family of our Lord God. 
  And we all belong.
