 JOANNA: Just keep it and not play anymore? 
 No. 
 Explain that one. 
 You always give a guy a second chance. 
 That's, like, the golden rule of guys. 
 Then what's the problem? 
 The problem is I can't let him know 
 I'm letting you in the back. 
 Look, Joanna, you can go ahead and make fun of this, but this is real important. 
 I mean, I'm telling you what guys think, and if you want to be one of the guys, you don't break the code. 
 (latch clicks) 
 BOB NEWHART (on TV): 
 It's no picnic. 
 (door creaking) 
 ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
 Ha! 
 (boy screams) 
 (hissing) 
 No, Thaddeus, go away! 
 Shh... 
 Tell me, what's your name? 
 T-Tate. 
 If Thaddeus comes back to scare you again, Just shut your eyes and say, "Go away." 
 You understand, Tate? 
 He'll mind you 
 'cause I'm going to protect you. 
 I wish you were my mommy. 
 Hmm. 
 Now dry your tears, child. 
 Life is too short for so much sorrow. 
 (woman sobbing) 
 Who are you? 
 It's me, Tate. 
 "Life's too short for so much sorrow." 
 You're wrong. 
 It's an eternity. 
 Just endless days and nights of longing; where's my baby? 
 That's what I want to talk to you about. 
 You, you promised me. 
 You made one with her, the-the lady of the house. 
 Vivien. 
 That's Violet's mother. 
 And I can't give you that baby anymore. 
 Everything's changed, Nora. 
 I'm in love with Violet. 
 I see. 
 I just can't take her brother away. 
 But I can. 
 And I will. 
 That baby is mine. 
 Dad, I'm not a dog! I told you I don't feel well! 
 Just leave me here! 
 No, I don't trust you anymore and I don't trust Tate! 
 Tate? I haven't seen him in weeks! 
 No more, Violet. 
 Your mom's coming home and you're coming with me to get her. 
 Dad, please, I don't feel well! 
 You can lay down in the car. 
 And when you get home, pack up your things. 
 We're leaving this house for good. 
 What? You guys are back together? 
 I don't know yet - your mom wants to go to Aunt Jo's to give birth, and I'm supporting it. 
 No, you don't want to do this. 
 Violet, your mother's been locked up in a psych ward for weeks. 
 I won't let her stay there for another minute. 
 Are you gonna get in the car or do I have to make you? 
 My God, Violet, what is wrong with you?! 
 Get in the car! 
 Your mother wants to see you! 
 I'm gonna throw up! 
 Fine. I'll lay down. 
 What's gonna happen when they get back? 
 What do I say? 
 It's not UTube with a U. 
 It's YouTube. 
 Y-O-U. 
 Oh. 
 If they find out I killed myself, they'll go insane. 
 Literally, for real this time. 
 They can't know. 
 Well, you can't control it forever. 
 I mean, it is what it is, Violet. 
 One of these days, this computer will be obsolete. 
 People will have microchips implanted in their brains or something. 
 We won't be able to watch YouTube or anything. 
 We'll be like all the others here; prisoners in a windowless cell. 
 Who's gonna show me the new ways of the world? 
 Nobody here is happy, Tate. 
 Well, yeah, but they're not like us. 
 They're lonely. 
 We have each other. 
 We'll never have kids. 
 (sighs) 
 I was so worried when Madame didn't have any potatoes, but I have to say these yams are making a cleaner image. 
 Less moisture, I think. 
 I love that Chinese red. 
 I always meant to use it in the powder room downstairs. 
 I'm gonna paint those old cribs, too. 
 Really? Red cribs? 
 Uh, Chad... 
 what did we talk about? 
 (inhales deeply) 
 "Our" babies, not "my" babies. 
 You know what? 
 I can live with a red crib. 
 It might actually be kind of fabulous. 
 You are so adorable when you're happy. 
 (both laugh) 
 Who asked you to decorate the nursery? 
 Let me break it down for you, sweetheart. 
 This is our house and we're having twins. 
 Who's your surrogate, one of those nurses in my basement? 
 No... no. 
 A very, very human surrogate, Elvira. 
 Your lovely mother. 
 You think you're gonna steal those twins? 
 You pathetic homos couldn't steal the sh1t out of your own ass! 
 (both chuckle) 
 VIOLET: 
 You know what? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 As soon as my parents get back, we're leaving here. 
 They're leaving. 
 So knock yourselves out. 
 Honey, your parents aren't going anywhere as long as you're stuck here. 
 And don't you get all snotty, little sister. 
 You'll be begging to babysit. 
 As big as this place is, it does get very, very lonely. 
 It could get ugly, though. 
 Were you a C-section? 
 Is there an existing zipper we might use? 
 Watch it, you goddamn queen. 
 Oh, I am quaking in my loafers. 
 What are you gonna do... 
 murder me? 
 My brown Betty turns to black Betty in 20 minutes. 
 So tell me what this is all about. 
 I need help. 
 Do you know those two guys that lived here before us? 
 Frick and Frack? 
 How could I forget? 
 Well, they're upstairs and they're planning to kidnap my mother's babies and raise them themselves. 
 Well, let me assure you that is never going to happen. 
 My mom's on her way back from the hospital today. 
 And I don't trust them. 
 I called 'cause I want to talk to that woman, the Craig's List psychic. 
 Billie Dean? About what? 
 Getting rid of ghosts. 
 There must be a way. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Chad? Chad...? 
 Come out, come out wherever you are. 
 Put your skanky claw on that crib, you'll be pulling away a bloody stump. 
 Where did you find these things? 
 Around. 
 You'd be amazed at the little forgotten treasures left behind by previous occupants. 
 What you are planning to do is unnatural. 
 Deodorant's unnatural, but it's a public good. 
 We'll make excellent parents. 
 Man shall not lie with man. 
 It is an abomination. 
 So's that hairdo, but I figure that's your business. 
 Why can't you people just content yourself with having pets? 
 Why must you subject an innocent child to your perversions? 
 There's nothing in the studies that indicates being raised by a same-sex couple has any ill effects on children. 
 I assume the same applies to the formerly living. 
 Well, the only study I know is the study of blood and pain. 
 My children came out of my body, and that is something that you will never be able to understand. 
 (wry laugh) 
 Lady, just because you happen to be the hole they crawled out of doesn't mean a goddamn thing. 
 It means everything. 
 Right. Sure. 
 That's why I can't even walk through my own home without tripping over one of your dead offspring. 
 I loved my children. 
 To death. 
 They are a part of me, just like that unborn child is a part of me, and I will not have you put your filthy hands on my grandchild. 
 Grandchild? 
 Wait a minute. 
 Are you telling me that Norman Bates Jr. 
 is the baby daddy? 
 (laughs) 
 You gotta love this house. 
 Listen to me. 
 You can have the other one. 
 The one fathered by Dr. Harmon. 
 I mean, he's an attractive man. 
 But not my grandbaby. 
 A blond and a brunette - just like me and Pat. 
 It's perfect. 
 No. 
 We definitely need both. 
 God, you're vile. 
 You're not suited to raise children. 
 Raise them? 
 Oh, honey, no, no, no. 
 We're going to wait until they reach that perfect, adorable age-- around a year, year and a half or so - and then we're going to smother them with hypoallergenic pillows. 
 That way, they'll be cute forever. 
 BILLIE: 
 So much pain here. 
 So much longing and regret. 
 Fear. 
 Sadness. 
 Guilt. 
 And perversion. 
 Now, can you ferret out the fairies for us? 
 I mean, that's our main concern at the moment. 
 Targeting a particular spirit is going to be difficult. 
 This is a very crowded house. 
 BILLIE: 
 You were so young. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 VIOLET: 
 Oh, God. 
 Please don't tell. 
 They can't know. 
 So what can we do? 
 Somehow, we have to try and dislodge them from the paramagnetic grip of this place. 
 The what? 
 The evil. 
 It's a force just like any other, Violet. 
 Pure physics. 
 Real and powerful. 
 Created by events. 
 Events that unleash psychic energy into the environment, where it's absorbed. 
 Like the way a battery stores energy. 
 You'll see it all the time in places like prisons or asylums. 
 Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain. 
 It draws those things to it. 
 The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. 
 And it has a need. 
 It wants to break through. 
 It wants to move in our world. 
 It's using those trapped between this world and the next as conduits. 
 That's very interesting. 
 But what do we do about the gays? 
 I mean, how do we get rid of them? 
 Oh, there might be a way. 
 I can't promise... 
 He can't be here. 
 Tate. 
 CONSTANCE: 
 Billie Dean, that's my boy. 
 That's Tate. 
 I want to help. 
 You've helped enough. 
 CONSTANCE: 
 Not now, Tate. 
 Go on. 
 What was that about? 
 (chuckles) 
 It's just that, sometimes, when a medium meets a spirit so directly, it has a powerful effect. 
 That's all. 
 It's nothing to concern yourself about. 
 Okay, so what can we do? 
 VIVIEN: 
 Why didn't Violet come? 
 BEN (sighs): Violet's been having a very rough time. 
 She didn't come visit me once, Ben. 
 I'm Dr. Marchesi, the resident physician. 
 How are you, Vivien? 
 Fine. Ready to go home. 
 Have you had any luck convincing your wife to push off the trip until after the birth? 
 Dr. Marchesi is recommending bed rest because of the twins, which I wholeheartedly agree with. 
 And I said to him that we would get a wheelchair at the airport. 
 I will be sitting the whole way to Florida. 
 And I'm only six months pregnant, so it's still okay to travel. 
 I'll be fine. 
 All right, well, wheelchairs are all well and good, but as I told your wife, I wouldn't be surprised if your obstetrician didn't recommend an immediate emergency C-section. 
 Well, in 24 hours, I will be in the capable hands of my sister and her family and an excellent obstetrician. 
 I'll be with people who I trust, and out of this city. 
 Thank you for bringing these. 
 I'll bring them to the doctor. 
 I'd like to hear it from the doctor. 
 Emergency C-section? 
 MARCHESI: I'm sure you're aware that these babies - well, rather, one of these babies - has been developing at a rapid rate. 
 I mean, to the point where he's ready to come out and live on his own. 
 And the other one seems to be getting weaker. 
 Sometimes referred to as intrauterine omophagia. 
 All the necessary nutrients are being devoured by the larger fetus. 
 The alpha, if you will. 
 When were you going to tell me this, Vivien? 
 We will address it all when we get to Florida. 
 Well, I'm on record. 
 It was nice to meet you, Dr. Harmon, Vivien. 
 If I were you, I would start checking to see if there's a medical doctor on that flight. 
 (door creaking open) 
 (door shuts) 
 Let's go. 
 It's difficult to banish a spirit, but not impossible. 
 The most successful attempt that I know of happened when America was known as the New World. 
 Are you kidding? 
 That's like 500 years ago. 
 Spirits do not follow our physical laws. 
 Nor are they affected by time. 
 About the only thing they have in common with the living is their suffering. 
 Regret. 
 Pain. 
 Loneliness. 
 In 1590, 
 on the coast of what we now know as North Carolina, the entire colony of Roanoke-- 
 all 117 men, women and children-- 
 died inexplicably. 
 It became known as the Ghost Colony because the spirits remained. 
 They haunted the native tribes living in the surrounding area. 
 (screaming) 
 Killing indiscriminately. 
 The elder knew he had to act. 
 He cast a banishment curse. 
 First, he collected the personal belongings of all the dead colonists. 
 Then they burned them. 
 The ghosts appeared, summoned by their talismans. 
 But before the spirits could cause them any more harm, the elder   completed the curse that would banish   the ghosts forever. 
 VIOLET: 
 How? 
 BILLIE: 
 By uttering a single word. 
 The same word found   carved on a post at the abandoned colony. 
 Croatoan. 
 Croatoan. 
 So now you know what you have to do. 
 What did she say? 
 We have to get something of his. 
 Something important. 
 Like an heirloom or a ring. 
 Like a talisman. 
 If we have the talisman and we do this special ritual, he'll be gone. 
 That sounds like bullshit. 
 Billie Dean's for real. 
 She studies this stuff. 
 The bigger guy, he wears a ring. 
 It's like a wedding ring, but I can't remember which hand it's on. 
 I don't trust her! 
 Now, why'd she say all that stuff about me? 
 I did something bad, didn't I? 
 Let's just get the ring. 
 How does it work? 
 Will the kid call you both daddy, or is one of you the mom? 
 I'm just messing with you. 
 Seriously, though, are you ready for all this? 
 I mean, you never struck me as the diapers and midnight feedings type. 
 Maybe you should have taken a few minutes to get to know me before you stuck a fireplace poker up my ass. 
 Fair enough. 
 Look. 
 We're all going to be here for a long time, so... 
 maybe we can figure out a way to let bygones be bygones and, you know, cohabitate. 
 I'm dead because of you! 
 Well, there's got to be something I could offer you. 
 I mean, just because we're dead doesn't mean we don't have wants. 
 Desires. 
 Marriage looks hard. 
 Especially to that guy. 
 Always on you all the time. 
 And never in the ways you want, right? 
 It must suck to have to wait till Halloween every year to get a little strange. 
 I can't kill you, but I can make you suffer! 
 Best part is, when I'm done, you'll heal up and I can beat the sh1t out of you all over again! 
 Harder! 
 I like it rough. 
 Not supposed to be like this! 
 I'm not supposed to be here! 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me! 
 I was going to get out! 
 (grunting) 
 I fell in love. 
 God help me, I was going to get out and be with him, and then you killed me, and now I'm stuck here... 
 with him! 
 Chad. 
 I won't go in the house. 
 You don't have to. 
 I packed your things. 
 Is Violet packed? 
 I told her we're leaving. 
 Okay? 
 (inhales sharply) 
 (groaning) 
 (panting) 
 (groaning) 
 (screams) 
 (groaning) 
 
 
 
 What'd you get? 
 He took it off to paint. 
 Why does a ghost need a watch? 
 (knocking) 
 BEN: Violet! 
 (door rattling) 
 Violet! 
 You disappeared on me! 
 What the hell happened?! 
 (knocking) 
 Violet, your mom's waiting in the car. 
 We have a plane to catch. 
 Good. Go far away. 
 Just don't bring mom in the house. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You're coming with us. - No! 
 I can take care of myself. 
 And if you want to, you can come back for me later. 
 But for right now, you just have to trust me and get the hell out of here. 
 Tell mom I love her and good luck with the babies. 
 What's the matter with you? Huh? 
 Are you high or something? 
 I wish. 
 Violet, I stopped at a red light and you were gone. 
 Where did you go? 
 Nowhere. 
 I was right here. 
 I wanted to come. 
 I swear. 
 I couldn't leave the house. 
 Stop it! 
 You're lying. 
 You're on drugs, I can tell. 
 Tell me what kind, right now. 
 Tell me! 
 I'm dead! 
 Don't you get it? 
 When you die in this house, you don't get to leave. 
 That's why you need to go, and take mom somewhere safe. 
 (car horn honks outside) 
 VIVIEN: Ben! 
 That's exactly what I'm gonna do. 
 You're coming with me. 
 (Vivien screaming) 
 Vivien! 
 Oh, Vivien, is-is the baby coming? 
 No! 
 No, it's too soon! 
 No, no, no! 
 No, honey. 
 When a child is ready to be born, there's no stopping it. 
 No! 
 Come on, we got to get you to the house. 
 No! 
 (screaming) 
 I took some pills. 
 I didn't mean to kill myself. 
 VIVIEN: 
 Ben! 
 (groaning) 
 What's wrong?! 
 The babies are coming. 
 No! No! 
 (screams) 
 No! 
 (groaning) 
 Take it easy, now. 
 Don't forget to breathe. Breathe. 
 I can't get any service. 
 (screams) 
 I got to go to the hospital now! 
 It's too late for that; you're already crowning. 
 I'm gonna call Dr. Hall. We'll get you an ambulance right away. 
 Breathe, Vivien, breathe. 
 Oh, God! It hurts. 
 Well, of course it does, honey. 
 That's a woman's curse. 
 (groaning) 
 (panting) 
 She can't give birth here. 
 It's not safe. 
 Well, then make it safe. 
 You know what to do. 
 (phone buzzes) Damn it. 
 (busy signal beeping) 
 sh1t! 
 (glass crashing, laughter outside) 
 Hey! 
 Get away from there! 
 You kids get away from there! 
 (floorboards creaking) 
 Dr. Harmon. 
 It's time. 
 (Vivien screaming) 
 Nurse, bring me my doctor bag. 
 BEN: 
 This is wrong. 
 Find me the 12-gauge scalpel. 
 We have to get you out of here. 
 (screams) 
 (groaning) 
 Where are those towels? 
 Spread them out underneath her. 
 (screaming) 
 BEN: 
 This house. 
 This house! 
 (groaning) 
 VIVIEN: 
 Ben?! 
 Wake up. 
 This house is trying to help. 
 And right now, you are in no position to refuse. 
 Your wife needs you. 
 So you better pull yourself together and get in there. 
 For her. 
 Ben?! 
 (screams) 
 (panting) 
 Who are all these people? 
 BEN: 
 Who are these people?! 
 It's okay, baby. 
 They're here to help us. 
 I forgot how painful this is. 
 (screams) 
 Do you have a little something for her, Doctor? 
 Ether. 
 CONSTANCE: 
 Just to take the edge off. 
 (panting) 
 (breathing slows) 
 BEN: 
 Help. 
 (groans) 
 Oh, I feel another one coming. 
 Okay, honey, remember your breathing. 
 (screams) 
 (sobbing) 
 You're doing great. 
 You're doing great. 
 Just hang in there, honey. 
 You're doing great. 
 (sobbing) 
 Here we go. 
 One more push. 
 (sobbing) 
 (inhaling, exhaling) 
 Just breathe, honey. 
 Breathe. 
 Remember your breathing. 
 (inhaling, exhaling) 
 Breathe. 
 (groans) 
 Breathe. 
 I hate you. 
 I love you. 
 Push, push, push! 
 One more! 
 (groaning) 
 Here we go. 
 One more push. 
 One more big push. 
 Here she comes. Come on, push! 
 Come on, honey, push! 
 Push! 
 Push, honey! 
 God, I love you. 
 (panting) 
 Breathe. 
 I never wanted to lose you. 
 You never will. 
 NURSE: 
 She's coming! 
 Come on! Push! 
 Here she comes! 
 Push! 
 Come on, honey! 
 Push! 
 (groaning) 
 (baby crying) 
 (laughs) 
 It's a healthy baby girl. 
 Daddy, you want to cut the cord? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 (laughs) 
 Violet. 
 (panting) 
 Your baby is stillborn. 
 Is it a boy or a girl? 
 Can I hold it? 
 No. 
 Not just yet, sweetheart. 
 You've got another one coming. 
 (screaming) 
 (screaming continues) 
 What exactly do you think you're doing, young lady? 
 Is that my $12,000 watch that you're putting into the furnace? 
 Croatoan! 
 Croatoan! 
 Croatoan! 
 (gagging) 
 (laughing) 
 Just kidding. 
 (sighs) 
 So where'd you get that one? 
 That press-on nail psychic who was here earlier? 
 I mean, really? 
 The Roanoke spell? 
 Please, tell me you'll be slitting the throat of a chicken next, because I've always found that very dramatic. 
 I also quite enjoy the burning of the sage to rid the house of spirits. 
 It didn't work. 
 Of course it didn't work. 
 It's bullshit. 
 It's all bullshit. 
 People make up these spells and chants in order to feel like they're in control. 
 Well, guess what? 
 They're not. 
 Never have been. 
 What are you doing? 
 My own bullshit ritual. 
 There's not gonna be any nursery. 
 (sighs) 
 We're not gonna be parents. 
 Your mother's babies are safe. 
 From us, at least. 
 I'm doomed to spend eternity with a man who doesn't love me. 
 Of course, it could be worse. 
 Your man does love you... 
 but he'll always be a monster. 
 You're wrong. 
 Tate's changed. 
 He doesn't even remember what he did. 
 Oh? 
 When did he change? 
 When he murdered me? 
 When he murdered my boyfriend? 
 (Vivien groaning in distance) 
 Or did he change when he raped your mother? 
 What? 
 No, that's a lie. 
 Is it? 
 (Vivien screaming in distance) 
 I think you're about to find out. 
 (screaming continues) 
 (screams) 
 Vivien, breathe. 
 You have to breathe. 
 Vivien, breathe! 
 You have to breathe! 
 I need forceps, now. 
 What's happening? 
 It's dystocia. 
 I have to manipulate the baby through the pubic symphysis. 
 I can't, Ben. 
 (sobbing): 
 I can't do it. 
 You can do it. 
 I-I promise you. 
 Look at me. 
 You can do this. 
 (groaning) 
 Dr. Harmon, have your wife stop pushing until I say so. 
 Vivien, can you hear me? 
 You have to stop pushing until I tell you. 
 (screaming) 
 It hurts so much! 
 Squeeze my hand as hard as you can! Squeeze! 
 Get the gauze ready to stop the bleeding. 
 Now, Dr. Harmon. 
 Push, Vivien! 
 You have to push! 
 Push! 
 Push! Push! 
 (screaming) 
 He's coming. 
 Push! You're doing great, Viv! 
 You're doing great, Viv. 
 Oh, God, it's ripping me apart! 
 Don't stop, angel! 
 The end is in sight. 
 I can see him. 
 (screaming fades) 
 (heart beating) 
 (no voice) 
 (screaming) (baby crying) 
 You did it, babe. 
 Honey, you did it. 
 You did it. 
 (baby continues crying) 
 (groans weakly) 
 BEN: Is everything all right? 
 She's bleeding. 
 I have to stop the bleeding. 
 Cut the cord. It's time to separate mother and son. 
 Can I see the baby? 
 Hand him to me. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 I'll get him washed up. 
 I'll bring him right back. 
 (baby crying) 
 (baby quiets) 
 BEN: Doctor, is everything all right? 
 (humming lullaby, baby fussing) 
 (sobbing) 
 Oh, what is the matter with you? 
 He's the most beautiful baby I've ever seen. 
 From blood and pain come perfection. 
 HAYDEN: 
 Hey, bitches. 
 You get all that slime off my baby yet? 
 Nurse, I need pressure on this. 
 BEN: What the hell is going on? 
 She's going into shock. 
 I can't stop the hemorrhaging. 
 Vivien, stay with me. 
 Vivien. 
 Mom... 
 Violet. 
 I'm sorry I didn't go see you at the hospital. 
 I wanted to, but I couldn't. 
 You're here now - that's all that matters. - Vivien. 
 Listen to me. 
 Concentrate on my words. 
 We can be happy, honey. 
 Just like we were before. 
 Before my mistakes, before this house. 
 VIOLET: 
 It's okay, Mom. 
 If you're in pain, let go. 
 I don't think I have a choice. 
 BEN: Hold on, Vivien. 
 Stay with me. 
 VIOLET: 
 Come to this side. 
 Let go. 
 You can be with me. 
 BEN: 
 Don't die. 
 Don't die on me, Vivien. 
 We can still have a life together. 
 We can still be happy. 
 (crickets chirping) 
 My mom is dead. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I know you were close. 
 Yeah, we were. 
 My dad's down there all alone now. 
 That makes me sad. 
 I like your dad. 
 He was nice to me. 
 He's nice to all his patients. 
 Even the ones who lie to him. 
 What? 
 Why did you start seeing him in the first place? 
 Constance thought you needed help. 
 I did. I do. 
 You knew you were dead. 
 Yeah. 
 I knew. 
 Do you know why? 
 The cops shot me. 
 Right here in this room. 
 Why? Why did they shoot you? 
 I don't know. 
 You murdered people, Tate. 
 Kids. Like us. 
 The kids that came to us on Halloween. 
 Why would I do that? 
 (voice breaking): 
 Why would I do that? 
 (sobbing): Why would I do that? 
 No... 
 Why would I do that? 
 I don't know. 
 Why'd you kill those guys who lived here before us? 
 Why would you rape my mother? 
 (sobbing) 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I was different then. 
 I used to think you were like me. 
 You were attracted to the darkness, but, Tate, you are the darkness. 
 No. Before you, that's all there was. 
 You're the only light I've ever known. 
 You've changed me, Violet. 
 I believe that. 
 I love you, Tate. 
 But I can't forgive you. 
 You have to pay for what you did. 
 All the pain you caused. 
 All the sorrow. 
 You murdered my mother. 
 No! 
 You did! 
 That baby-- whatever it was - it killed her. 
 I can't be with you. 
 I won't be with you. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying go away. 
 What? 
 No, no, don't do this. 
 Go away, Tate. 
 You're all I want! 
 You're all I have! 
 Go away! 
 (screaming) 
 Go away! 
 (whimpering) 
 (sobbing) 
 That was very brave. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 Mom... 
 I'm sorry, Mom. 
 I'm sorry you had to die. 
 Shh. 
 I'm sorry you lost your baby. 
 But I didn't lose my baby.
