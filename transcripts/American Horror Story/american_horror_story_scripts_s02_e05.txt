 Mr. Goodman? 
 Mr. Goodman was my father,  alev hashalom. 
 Please call me Sam. 
 I am sorry we have to meet like this, but confidentiality is the heart and soul of my work. 
 Yes, uh, Mother Claudia explained all that to me. 
 She's the only one who knows I'm here. 
 I'd like to keep it that way. 
 The monsignor, he thinks I've lost my mind, but I haven't. 
 I, um... I trust my instincts. 
 Instincts are everything. 
 We ignore them at our peril. 
 Do I... 
 pay you for this? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 I don't do this for money. 
 It's more of a calling. 
 Did you lose someone? 
 Everyone. 
 Is that for me? 
 Um... 
 Please sit. 
 Thank you. 
 He goes by the name Arden, but I believe his real name may be Grouper. 
 He may have been an SS doctor. 
 I mean, there's hardly anything at all in there. 
 Um, just a home address, and even that my be a lie. 
 Probably is a lie, all of it. 
 What do you mean? 
 Have you heard of Operation Paperclip? 
 After the war, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency actively recruited the best Nazi scientists. 
 To get around Truman's express orders to exclude Nazi supporters, they created false biographies for these men. 
 Forgive the question, but have you ever seen him without a shirt on? 
 Me? 
 Oh, no, no, never. 
 SS have a tattoo of their blood type here. 
 It's how they were easily identified by the Allied Forces after the liberation. 
 Do I need to look for it? 
 No, no, no. 
 In fact, don't do anything until I've completed my work. 
 If he is who you suspect, the last thing you want to do is corner him. 
 Dr. Arden? 
 Stop. You leave him there. 
 Where's Sister Jude? 
 I have to speak to her right away. 
 This man is a monster. 
 You should see what he's got in his office. 
 Go, Sister. 
 I've waited so many years for this. 
 I can wait a few more minutes. 
 Drop the gun, or I'll blow your goddamn head off. 
 You put up a bit of a fight, I hear. 
 You had to be sedated. 
 Where did you get the gun, Anne? 
 I took it off one of those detectives. 
 And it's a good thing I did. 
 He would've killed me. 
 Dr. Arden? 
 Grouper. 
 Hans Grouper, I told you. 
 He's a Nazi. 
 The thing in his lab, 
 did you see it? 
 What thing? 
 Tell me, what do you think you saw? 
 Oh, God. He got rid of it before anyone could see. 
 Dr. Arden was in no condition to do any such thing. 
 When I arrived, he was being rushed to the hospital. 
 Good. I hope he dies. 
 Now, come on, wake up. 
 He's not going to die. 
 He'll be back here and soon. 
 Maybe with the police, maybe with the monsignor. 
 You could end up on his operating table, and I out on the street, so before that happens, I want you to tell me what you think you saw. 
 Go and look. 
 We did look. 
 Now, Frank says you claimed to have seen some sort of creature that was alive. 
 Maybe it escaped on its own. 
 I doubt that, Sister. 
 It had no legs. 
 Sister Jude? 
 Can't you see I'm busy? 
 There's a man in your office. 
 What man? 
 Did he say what he wanted? 
 His wife. 
 Her name is Charlotte. 
 Charlotte Brown is her married name. 
 She was born Charlotte Cohen. 
 That's our son, David. 
 He's a sweet little boy, but he has the colic. 
 He cries five, six times a night. 
 Nothing we can do to comfort him. 
 It's enough to make anyone a little cuckoo, especially a woman as high-strung as Charlotte. 
 Cuckoo. 
 High-strung. 
 How about world-class actress? 
 She was very convincing, playing Anne Frank. 
 That's how it all started. 
 She read the diary, and when she was eight months pregnant, we drove down to Boston to see a production of  Anne Frank. 
 Just sort of hit her in some personal way when she saw the play. 
 I would say that people sometimes remark that she resembled Anne Frank. 
 They were the same age. 
 So, the tattoo on her arm... 
 Charlotte? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 And all of this happened after a night in the theater? 
 No. It all started after we had the baby. 
 She couldn't sleep because of the crying. 
 She said it made her feel powerless. 
 She began to turn a deaf ear, and then she began leaving the house and going to a library to read about Auschwitz. 
 It's almost like she wanted to relive it. 
 That she somehow could change the outcome. 
 She'd go on about these babies who were gassed and tortured, and I'd ask her, 
 "What about your own baby, Charlotte?" 
 He doesn't want me. 
 He wants you. 
 He wants his mother. 
 I keep telling you, I can't help it! 
 He's not the one who needs me. 
 She'd come home with bags full of old newspapers, art supplies. 
 She'd disappear into the den to work on her project. 
 Sounds to me like a classic case of postpartum psychosis. 
 How long have you been standing there, Dr. Butt-in-ski? 
 Long enough to make a pretty good diagnosis. 
 The obsession, the manic behavior, the disconnection from her baby. 
 My wife isn't a psychotic. 
 She's a very emotional person. 
 She needs to come home. 
 I think that's dangerous. 
 Did you hear what he said? 
 The man wants his wife at home. 
 They made me change my clothes, Sister Jude. 
 Why do I have to wear this uncomfortable dress? 
 I don't care for it anymore. 
 It'll help make the transition easier. 
 You're letting me go? 
 Charlotte? 
 My God, Charlotte. 
 I've been looking for you. 
 My name is Anne. 
 Charlotte, it's time to come home. 
 Stay away from me. 
 My name is Anne Frank. 
 I'm a death camp survivor. 
 You're my wife and the mother of our baby. 
 Now, please stop this and come home with me. 
 No! You don't know me. 
 Sister Jude, you have to help me. 
 I'm helping you, Charlotte. 
 I'm trying to reunite you with your family. 
 What about Grouper? 
 His crimes against humanity? 
 No, no, go home. 
 Go home. 
 It can't be. 
 David needs you. 
 My baby? 
 I need you. 
 Everything's going to be all right. 
 Okay? You'll see. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 Forget about it, Doctor. 
 It's none of our concern anymore. 
 Kit Walker is my concern. 
 What's this barbaric rumor I hear about sterilization? 
 It's not a rumor. 
 You're not a doctor. 
 You have no right to authorize medical procedures without their consent. 
 Are you afraid? 
 No. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Alma and I always wanted kids. 
 We always talked about having two or three. 
 Always tomorrow. 
 And now there will be no tomorrow. 
 For either of us. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I got us into this mess. 
 No. I don't regret what we did. 
 There's no one to blame except Sister Jude. 
 I think she's the devil. 
 Now? 
 Yes. 
 If you hurry, you might be able to have supper. 
 Supper? 
 I thought you were taking me for the operation. 
 No, Kit. 
 Sister Jude changed her mind. 
 She said you showed signs of true redemption. 
 You're being released from solitary. 
 Yay. 
 What about Grace? 
 Oh, I haven't forgotten about her. 
 I can't believe you'll hear me say this, but I actually miss the food from the kitchen. 
 Oh, you won't be eating tonight. 
 No food for 
 12 hours before the procedure. 
 You said Sister Jude changed her mind. 
 For Kit. Rest up, dear. 
 You're going under the knife in the morning. 
 You'll need your strength. 
 No. No, you can't do that! 
 Let me out! 
 Come back! Let me out! 
 Let me out! 
 Let me out! Someone! 
 We're leaving right after dinner. 
 Meet me by the front staircase at 6:00. 
 Is this real? 
 Don't be late. 
 Kit. 
 I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 Doc, you got to help Grace. 
 Jude's going to sterilize her. 
 It's not right. 
 Grace isn't my patient, Kit. 
 You are. 
 So, why don't we just concentrate on you... 
 ...and then I'll see what I can do for Grace. 
 Deal? 
 Have you given thought to what we discussed last time? 
 You want me to say I killed Alma and those other ladies. 
 Only if you believe it's true. 
 You need to give yourself permission to remember. 
 I think one way to do that is to hear it in your own words. 
 I want you to describe what you think happened. 
 Then I'll play it back for you so you can hear it in your own voice, 
 with your own ears. 
 And if I do that, you're going to tell the courts that I should... 
 that I should stay here, and I-I won't go to the chair? 
 Yes. That is the bargain. 
 But I need to feel you're sincere. 
 My name is Kit Walker. 
 And I murdered my wife. 
 Don't fight it. 
 It'll only make it worse. 
 Who is it? 
 What are you? 
 My name is Alma. 
 Can you take down a message for Mr. Goodman? 
 Goodman. Tell him... 
 it was all a mistake and that he should just go back home. 
 I gave him the wrong information. 
 No, the wrong information. 
 Thanks. 
 What information was that? 
 It's not important. 
 It sounded to me as if there was some juicy little tidbit stuck in your craw. 
 Oh, come on, Sister, spit it up. 
 You'll feel better. 
 How's your leg? 
 Please. 
 Let's dispense with the small talk, shall we? 
 You and I both know that, during my absence, you finally got a chance to stick your nose in my lab. 
 A patient made a complaint. 
 I was obliged to follow up. 
 And? 
 It wasn't all that interesting. 
 I see. 
 Do you mind? 
 You should probably know that I plan on pressing charges. 
 To what end? 
 She's a confused young woman. 
 No, not her. 
 You. On your watch, that crazy bitch got a hold of a loaded gun, and you sent her home without so much as a slap on the wrist. 
 Your ineptitude is staggering. 
 Dr. Arden... I know, in the past, you and I have had our differences, and you're certainly entitled to a... a sense of safety here. I hope, perhaps you and I can start afresh. 
 Is that your idea of an apology? 
 Is that what you're looking for-- an apology? 
 No. 
 I'd prefer you grovel. I think I'm entitled to it. Perhaps if you prostrated yourself on the floor and begged my forgiveness. No? 
 Barring that, I have no other option but to call the monsignor and demand your dismissal. 
 You're through here, Sister. And you know it. 
 Let me do that. 
 Sister! 
 I didn't hear you. 
 
 
 
 Now, now. 
 It's all right, Arthur. 
 You've nothing to be ashamed of. 
 All the nuns here have had some training as nurses. Sit. 
 I've been meaning to speak to you. 
 I wanted to apologize for my behavior the night of the storm. 
 It was... untoward. 
 What do you say we chalk it up to the barometric pressure and never speak of it again? 
 I know what you did, Sister. 
 Thank you for protecting me. 
 Protecting us. 
 Even though I don't fully understand your work, I feel I've been an important part of it. 
 And so you have, my cherub. 
 You'll be free to continue that work once Sister Jude has been turned out. 
 The monsignor will put you in charge, and you'll need a strong right hand. 
 Someone you can trust. 
 I trust you... 
 completely. 
 And I'm very impressed that you managed to get her out and into the woods all on your own. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 She weighed very little. 
 Mikey Curtis, no monkey business! 
 Peggy Cartwright, what on earth is the matter? 
 There's a monster! 
 Well, well, well. 
 Look what the cat dragged in. 
 That didn't take very long now, did it? 
 Stay away from me. 
 Not so tough without your gun. 
 You didn't give it much of a chance. 
 I have to go to work. 
 I'm afraid to leave her alone. 
 It's a period of adjustment. 
 I mean, you said yourself, a baby needs its mother. 
 A normal mother, yes! 
 Charlotte's not normal! 
 She's worse. 
 At least before, she could tune out the crying. 
 Charlotte? 
 Do you want to hold your baby? 
 Yes, darling, why don't I do that?! 
 Hey, stop it! 
 Are you insane?! 
 I thought if I brought her home, she spent time with us, she'd remember who she was, see how much we need her. 
 Please, Sister. 
 You have to take her. 
 I can't handle her. 
 Isn't there some family that could stay with her? 
 She needs professional help, the care of a good doctor. 
 Like the doctor that came in here and diagnosed her. 
 He seemed to understand what she needed. 
 Dr. Thredson? 
 You're welcome to consult with him if that's what you want. 
 Frank? 
 Find Dr. Thredson, send him here. 
 Are you ready? 
 What's the plan? 
 How do we do this? 
 We'll walk out the door, we'll walk straight to my car. 
 Do you understand? 
 What do you mean? 
 How do we get past the guard? 
 Like I said, walk. 
 Night, Jimmy. 
 Dr. Thredson! 
 Excuse me. 
 What were you...? 
 Dr. Arden? 
 That's right. 
 Oh, my God. You're the... 
 you're the man my wife shot. 
 Thank you for not pressing charges. 
 She doesn't know what she was doing. 
 She's out of her mind. 
 Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. Brown. 
 But you needn't worry. 
 I see no reason for punitive action. 
 Not when there's a far more humane remedy at hand. 
 As a matter of fact, we could do it tonight. 
 Then she'll be home by tomorrow, a new woman. 
 Dr. Thredson! 
 Dr. Thredson, Sister Jude is asking for you. 
 Anne Frank, or whoever she is, her husband brought her back. 
 I don't work here anymore, Frank. 
 As a matter of fact, I never did. 
 You can tell her I said that. 
 Are you sure that this is safe? 
 Not only safe, but highly effective. 
 In my hands, the transorbital lobotomy has become as routine as... 
 filling a cavity. 
 Holy apostle, Saint Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, the patron of hopeless cases and things almost despaired of, pray for me, who am so miserable. 
 Make use, I implore thee, of the particular privilege that is accorded to thee, to bring visible and speedy help where help was almost despaired of. 
 Um, bad news. 
 We searched everywhere. 
 Lana Winters is nowhere to be found. 
 I'm certain she's off grounds, Sister. 
 You know, when I was a child, I'd come home after school to an empty house. 
 My father had flown the coop, and my mother worked as a maid in a hotel. 
 It was lonely, so I brought in a baby squirrel I'd found, and kept him in a shoebox. 
 And then, one day, when I came home, he looked sickly. 
 He was dead already, but I didn't know that. 
 I'd forgotten to... 
 feed him for a couple days. 
 So I took him out of the box and I laid him on the table and I prayed my heart out for several hours. 
 And when my mother came home and found us, she screamed bloody murder. 
 She picked him up and threw him in the garbage. 
 She worked hard, my mother. 
 She was exhausted, and she couldn't have known how cruel that was. 
 But I cried and cried, saying, 
 "God didn't answer my prayers!" 
 I remember... 
 my mother was pouring herself a whiskey; the Martin family cure for everything. 
 She looked at me and laughed. 
 "God always answers our prayers, Judy. 
 It's just rarely... 
 the answer we're looking for." 
 It's over for me, Frank. 
 My goose is cooked. 
 I certainly hope you're not blaming yourself. 
 Men are never gonna accept a woman taking charge, especially not a woman as strong as you are. 
 In my opinion, you never really had a chance. 
 What's your poison, sweetheart? 
 Make yourself at home. 
 Dr. Thredson? 
 Oliver. 
 I really appreciate everything you've done, but... 
 I think I want to go to my house. 
 Lana, once they discover you missing, the first place they'll look is there. 
 You're much safer here - at least for the night. 
 First thing in the morning, we go to the police. 
 I already have an appointment set up with Detective Spears. 
 I trust him implicitly. 
 We present the evidence, together we shut down Briarcliff. 
 Relax. That place is behind you. 
 Please, come in. Have a seat. 
 You've had an incredibly stressful day. 
 I'm going to prescribe a little something to take the edge off. 
 I-I don't want any medicine. 
 A big, delicious glass of wine. 
 Well, that doesn't sound half bad. 
 White or red? 
 Red. 
 No calls. 
 I was trying to get a hold of my friend Lois - she might have heard something about Wendy. 
 Lana, you have to realize that I am at risk as well here. 
 I broke you out of a mental institution. 
 I can't afford to let anyone know where you are. 
 Not until we go public tomorrow. 
 You're gonna write about this. 
 You're gonna win a Pulitzer Prize. 
 I just know it, Lana. 
 You are the person to tell my story. 
 Your  story? 
 Here's to taking down Briarcliff. 
 Hear, hear. 
 Mint? 
 Boy... 
 That wine, um, went straight to my head. 
 Would you mind if I used your restroom? 
 Sure. 
 It's right down the hall. 
 Thank you. 
 I think I made a wrong turn. 
 I see you found my little... 
 hobby. 
 You make furniture? 
 Lamps mainly. 
 I make the shades myself. 
 Really? 
 What kind of material do you use? 
 Skin. 
 Grace? 
 When'd you get... 
 Oh, God. 
 Hey, we need a doctor! 
 Those bastards-- I can't believe they actually did it. 
 Dr. Thredson, he promised me this wasn't going to happen. 
 Kit Walker, you're under arrest for the murder of Donna Burton, Alison Riedel and Alma Walker. 
 Wait. 
 Where's Thredson? 
 You guys need to talk to Dr. Thredson. 
 No, we don't. 
 It's a mistake. 
 We got his evaluation and your taped confession. 
 Come on, Kit. Let's go. 
 No, he didn't do it. 
 She's alive. 
 What? 
 Everything you said is true. 
 For Christ sakes, let me talk to her! 
 I saw her! 
 Alma's alive. 
 I saw her! 
 Hello? 
 Hello?! 
 Wendy. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wendy... 
 Wendy. 
 Wendy! 
 She's been on ice for a while. 
 I was hoping she'd be a little more pliable by the time you came to. 
 What's happening? 
 What did you do to her?! 
 Kept her fresh. 
 Normally, by now, I would've... 
 removed the skin. 
 And head. 
 No, we need to keep her around a little longer for our purposes. 
 We're going to continue our therapy now, Lana. 
 You can begin... 
 by kissing her cold lips. 
 Don't worry. 
 She won't bite. 
 I took her teeth. 
 Shh.

 Pot roast. 
 With carrots, potatoes and onions.

 I can clean up down here tomorrow.
