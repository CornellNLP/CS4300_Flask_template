 (humming) 
 Mm. 
 Don't stop. 
 I'll be finished in here in just a second. 
 Why? 
 A shame to waste such a beautiful bed. 
 Don't. No, don't. 
 No, stop, please. No! 
 Stop it! 
 You're drunk. 
 Please, I really need this job. 
 You liked it the last time. 
 That was a mistake. 
 I was just lonely. 
 Want a Camaro? 
 Huh? 
 We got a new shipment in yesterday. 
 No, I... 
 (screaming) 
 (muffled sobbing) 
 Shh. 
 (muffled sobbing in distance) 
 (sobbing) 
 (shrieks) 
 I have loved you since I was 16. 
 Sweetheart, please. 
 This-This didn't mean anything. 
 You've broken my heart for the last time. 
 (whimpers) 
 (panting) 
 (sobbing) 
 We were just getting it back, Ben. 
 I wanted to trust you so badly. 
 I was trying to protect you. 
 Oh, don't try to turn this into some kind of heroic act! 
 You were scared shitless of what I might do if I found out about it. 
 How was I supposed to know he was gonna screw up our investments that badly? 
 He's always made us money before. 
 Well, I am pregnant, and I cannot live in this house after what happened to us here! 
 And now you're telling me that we have no choice, that we're broke? 
 We're not broke. 
 We have money. 
 It's just tied up in this house. 
 Once we sell it, we can take it out. 
 No, no. 
 I-I can't wait that long. 
 I-- we... 
 we have to, we have to rent a place. 
 Viv, what do you want me to do? 
 I'm trying to rebuild my practice. 
 We're already paying the minimum on our cards. 
 I'll get a job. 
 To put more stress on yourself? 
 (sighs) 
 Fine. 
 We'll get a studio apartment somewhere. 
 We can, we can swing that, at least, at least temporarily. 
 Studio apartment? 
 You think that's gonna take the pressure off? 
 My office is here. 
 People see me here. 
 Patients see me here. 
 And not that many, I might add. 
 (sighs) 
 Honey, you're having PTSD. 
 This is a total normal response. 
 We just need to find you a therapist that our insurance will cover. 
 Right away. 
 Don't make me feel like I'm crazy. 
 I have an appointment with the realtor tomorrow. 
 I'm gonna talk to her about what kind of home improvements we can make - hopefully nothing too expensive, maybe something with the backyard. 
 Hopefully we can sell the place without taking too much of a loss. 
 Sure. 
 I'm sure we can. 
 Don't lie to me again. 
 If you lie to me again, we're through. 
 I am just horrified for you and your family. 
 I hardly know what to say, really. 
 And I can just imagine how you might be feeling a little anxious, given all of this. 
 Nope, not anxious. Angry. 
 You know that's how I felt when the boys, you know, did what they did. 
 We'd gotten rather close. 
 They'd have me over for Bloody Marys and omelettes on a Sunday. 
 So to find out what nasty little perverts they were - you probably heard about the poker from the fireplace being rammed up his... 
 Marcy, we have to put the house back on the market. 
 And we have to make back everything we put into it. 
 We just can't afford to take a bath on this. 
 You know, you might want to adjust your expectations. 
 The housing market is dropping daily. 
 And these things aren't about to change until 2013, when we vote that bum out. 
 Well, here's the bottom line: 
 you owe our family. 
 Under the law, you were obligated to disclose any material facts that might have influenced our decision to buy this house. 
 Excuse me, dear, but the law requires us to disclose any death on the premises within the last three years. 
 I did that. 
 Nobody's buying me cooking classes, Mrs. Hormon. 
 Harmon. 
 Nobody's looking out for me. 
 Do you know where I live? 
 I live in a 350-square-foot guest house in Valley Village, with rats. 
 I'd kill to live in this house, regardless of the history. 
 You know, you probably need a more seasoned realtor. 
 Someone who specializes in... 
 Oh, you think you were my first call? 
 I called every realtor in the city this morning-- 
 Coldwellke Banker, Century 21. 
 No one will take this listing. 
 So here's the plan. 
 You are going to bake cookies, you are going to go buy beautiful, expensive, fresh-cut flowers, you are going to maybe make up some nice stories about all the lovely people who have lived here over the years. 
 You're gonna do whatever it takes and you are gonna sell this house, and then my family and I are gonna go live someplace safe. 
 And in return for that, I am not gonna sue you for gross criminal negligence. 
 We on the same page? 
 Good. 
 See? Somebody's looking out for you. 
 It's fresh. 
 I just made it. 
 (knocking, gasps) 
 I thought I'd knock this time so you didn't have a heart attack. 
 Though Lord knows I wish you were dead. 
 Do me a favor, will you? 
 Before I take this one, polish it up. 
 Look, it's cruddy with corrosion. 
 And you know why? 
 Because you're a shitty maid. 
 Adding those to your magpie stash? 
 Until I have a full set. 
 Then it's off to eBay, where I'll make a pretty penny and you'll be accused of theft. 
 You are a thief of biblical proportions, after all. 
 Your specialty being weak husbands. 
 I don't want to be here anymore! 
 I'm frightened! 
 I miss my mother! 
 You think I want to stay in this world of death and rot and regret? 
 Try to find some dignity in the situation. 
 Move on, missy. 
 I can't. 
 I want to, but I can't! 
 Every time... 
 I find my heart breaking just a sliver for you, I suddenly remember, you made this mess for yourself. 
 And I also remember, every time I see that ghostly eye, that I was and continue to be 
 (chuckles) a hell of a shot. 
 You need to pay for what you've done. 
 Oh, I do. 
 Every goddamn day. 
 SALLY: 
 I'm at the end of my rope. 
 (recorder beeps) 
 He's going through with it, and there's nothing 
 I can do to stop him. 
 We're supposed to sign the papers next week, and that's it. 
 23 years gone with the stroke of a pen. 
 I'm so upset. 
 And I wonder if I'll ever be able to love or be loved again. 
 What was the reason your husband is seeking the divorce? 
 He says I'm very boring. 
 I've tried to converse with him on a variety of subjects. 
 Sports for instance. 
 I even learned the names of the football teams he follows. 
 Let's see, here's the Chargers, the 49ers, the Raiders, the Seahawks up in Seattle. 
 That's the West Coast. 
 Then the Cardinals. 
 They're in Arizona. 
 I memorized them... for him. 
 I'm very good at memorization. 
 I can still name the states and all of their capitals, which I learned in the sixth grade. 
 My memory helps with my work. 
 I'm an accountant by trade, but I'm branching out into taxes. 
 (crow caws, dog barks) 
 What are you doing? 
 Cleaning up your mess. 
 My mess? 
 Well, it's not my blood. 
 How long have you been out here? 
 Long enough. 
 What did you see? 
 Why, nothing. 
 Nothing at all, if anyone should ask. 
 I'm very discrete. 
 Don't worry. 
 I did this room first. 
 It's all ready for your next victim. 
 I mean patient. 
 Where's my tape recorder? 
 It was right here. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I never touch the things on your desk. 
 I just get the stains. 
 Do you wanna make a new one? 
 Get away from me. 
 Where is it? 
 Think about the blood. 
 Rushing. 
 Pumping. 
 Filling you up. 
 Filling us both up. 
 I'm done playing this game! 
 You're goddamn fired! 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 I did not want to get physical with her, but I had no choice. 
 I have rebuffed every advance, and believe me, there have been many, but she just won't stop! 
 Unbuttoning, and bending over and... 
 I don't mean to be presumptuous, but my days of romance are long over. 
 Oh, please. Is that why you prance around in that little maid's outfit like you're headed to a fetish ball? 
 Don't want to clean other people's houses in your own clothes, my ass. 
 Ben! 
 It's all right, Madame. 
 I'm not naive to the ways of men. 
 Their need to objectify, conquer. 
 They see what they want to see. 
 Women, however, see into the soul of a person. 
 Is this what you do? 
 Entrap employers? 
 That said, I understand the stress you two are under. 
 Money, the baby, what happened here the other night. 
 I don't mean to listen, but the walls here are paper thin. 
 This unfortunate incident aside, I am happy to work for the two of you. 
 And I certainly need the money, times are tough. 
 I'm perfectly willing to forget the whole thing. 
 Well, Moira, I think maybe it might just be better for you to... 
 Just leave? 
 Just toss me out like a piece of trash, will you? 
 No, you won't. Not this time. 
 I deserve respect. 
 If your husband lays a hand on me again, or tries to fire me with unjust cause, I will press charges. 
 I changed the sheets in your bedroom, fresh towels in the downstairs bath and Violet's. 
 If you don't mind I'd like to take a longer lunch than usual. 
 I'm quite shaken. 
 She's lying. 
 I knew we shouldn't have hired her in the first place, I knew it. 
 You know what I think? 
 What? 
 I think your little... 
 indiscretion in Boston... 
 has really screwed you up. 
 And I think you're acting out and you're being paranoid and crazy and guilty, and you have to get it together. 
 And we have to get out of this house. 
 I'd like to do that without a lawsuit. 
 STAN: And the next stop on our tour of departed souls - the gem of mid-town, Murder House. 
 (nearby clatter) 
 Relax. 
 I'm not here to bust you. 
 Why not? 
 Because what you guys went through last week can haunt you a long time. 
 Seriously, Dad? I'm fine. 
 It'll make a great college essay one day. 
 Okay. But if you ever want to talk to somebody... 
 Dad... 
 I mean, not me. 
 You know, I'm way too expensive. 
 But we can find you someone. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 I'll think about it. 
 He's a great dad. 
 He really cares. 
 You're lucky like that. 
 Where's my tape recorder? 
 Hmm? 
 I need it for my work. 
 Here's your coffee, Dr. Harmon. 
 I don't want any damn coffee. 
 I want my tape recorder. 
 It was in my office until you cleaned up. I need it. 
 Well, it might be down the front of my dress. 
 All you have to do is reach down between my breasts... 
 You're sick. 
 I hope it's not a problem. 
 Your next patient is in your office. 
 My next patient? 
 I'm sorry, I-I didn't have anyone on my schedule... 
 What are you doing here? 
 This is my house! 
 I'm not stupid, Ben. 
 I saw her leave. 
 I just want to talk. 
 Not in my house. 
 Jesus, Hayden, I've called you a dozen times since I left Boston. 
 You left me there, Ben. 
 Without a word. 
 By myself. 
 I know, I know. 
 I'm sorry, but I told you in my messages. 
 We had a home invasion here. 
 I had to come back. 
 Did everything go all right? 
 I didn't have the abortion. 
 What? 
 I decided to keep the baby. 
 Our baby. 
 I'm moving here, and you're paying. 
 You're going to be a father to our child. 
 I've already started looking for a place. 
 I think I really like Marina Del Rey. 
 Hayden, you-you-you really haven't thought this through. 
 I love my wife, my family. 
 As far as support, you have to believe me, the move out here took everything I had. 
 I-I don't have the financial resources... 
 I'm not a whore, Ben. 
 I matter. 
 I didn't say... 
 I matter! 
 (doorbell rings) 
 I'm looking for a Dr. Ben Harmon. 
 That's me. 
 Detective Jack Colquitt. 
 L.A.P.D. 
 I need a moment of your time. 
 The detective wants to talk to me. 
 Fine, meet me tomorrow at 3:00. 
 There's a Norms down the street. 
 BEN:  I told the other officer   everything. 
 My wife and daughter were the ones those animals terrorized. 
 Sorry. That's robbery/homicide. 
 I'm missing persons. 
 I'm here about Sally Freeman. 
 She's a patient of yours. 
 Our first session was Tuesday. 
 I'm sorry... 
 missing persons? 
 Her husband hasn't seen her. 
 She didn't come home last night. 
 He didn't seem too concerned. 
 They're getting a divorce. 
 Her online calendar listed you as a 3:00 appointment. 
 Did she show up? 
 Yes. 
 Then you were the last one who saw her. 
 She also had a Power Point class down at the Learning Annex, but she bailed on that. 
 Well, I can't tell you what we talked about, but I can say it was nothing extreme. 
 Well, I'm not surprised. 
 Just between you and I, everyone I talked to about that gal said she was the most boring person they'd ever met. 
 How the hell do you get anything done with that thing around? 
 Right? 
 Anyway, like I said, it's probably nothing. 
 But if you hear anything, give me a call? 
 Sure. 
 No problem. 
 I'll let myself out. 
 Hopefully run into your maid. 
 Change your mind? 
 No. 
 No... 
 I told you I ain't no faggot. 
 That's not what your dick says. 
 Easy, man. 
 You were cruisin' me, I thought you were fair game. 
 Cruisin' you, my ass. 
 Easy! 
 Help! Help! 
 God! 
 STAN:  Sal Mineo was 37 years old when he died. 
 A Golden Globe winner and two-time Oscar nominee. 
 His father was a coffin-maker who never accepted that his son was gay. 
 They sent away a petty criminal, 
 African-American Lionel Raymond 
 Williams for the murder, calling it a "robbery gone wrong." 
 But you'll have a hard time finding anyone who believes that in this town. 
 Most people believe Sal Mineo died of a hate crime. 
 Our tour concludes with one of the most famous houses of horrors in the City of Angels... better known as the "Murder House." 
 Built in 1922 by Dr. Charles Montgomery-- acclaimed surgeon to the stars -- for his wife Nora, a prominent East Coast socialite. 
 WOMAN: Charles?  But when Montgomery fell on hard times, he became addicted to drugs and developed a terrifying 
 Frankenstein complex. 
 
 
 
 Charles? 
 Charles? 
 Damn it, Charles, are you down in the basement again? 
 Charles? 
 For God's sake, I'm working! 
 Working. I wish. 
 Now, come upstairs for dinner. 
 You've made us wait five whole minutes. 
 (door slams) 
 You've ruined it. 
 (inhales) 
 (wheezes) 
 (sighs) 
 (baby cooing) 
 What have you done to that baby? 
 Can't even tell if it's a girl or a boy. 
 You're a disgrace, Charles. 
 How you can call yourself a man is beyond me. 
 You think I came all the way here from Philadelphia for this? 
 This life? 
 This house? 
 I built you this house, exactly the way you wanted it. 
 And how many servants do we have? Two? 
 And I'm expected to do everything else? 
 Good, Charles. 
 Drink your talent away. 
 You're a waste. 
 Even looking at you I'm sick to my stomach. 
 You'll see. 
 They will write articles about me one day in the  Boston Medical Journal. 
 Ha! 
 (glass shatters) 
 (laughs) 
 Good, Charles. 
 Break everything. 
 (crying) 
 (bell ringing) 
 Daphne, when you hear the baby crying, come in straight away and take him upstairs. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Yes. Oh, come here. 
 It's all right. 
 Shh. 
 It's all right. 
 It's-- here, it's okay. 
 They came again today - the bill collectors. 
 Charles! 
 Do you hear me?! 
 I'm not deaf! 
 Would that I were. 
 Now, you listen to me. 
 You're going to support this family one way or the other. 
 I've arranged for a girl to come tomorrow morning with $60 cash. 
 She's in trouble. 
 She probably has friends. 
 So you'd better not be blotto. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Dorothy Hudson? 
 Come in, lamb. 
 Right this way. 
 Such a pretty girl. 
 But you can't become a legend of the silver screen with an obligation hanging on your skirt. 
 (sobs softly) 
 Now, don't worry. 
 No one will ever know. 
 But we do require payment up front. 
 Here. 
 Drink this. 
 That's it. 
 It'll make you forget. 
 Charles? 
 You ready for Dorothy? 
 CHARLES: 
 Yes, dear. 
 You'll have to help her down. 
 She's a bit woozy. 
 Hurry. Before it wears off. 
 STAN: An estimated two dozen girls went under Dr. Montgomery's knife, thanks to his wife Nora. 
 But the souls of the little ones must have weighed heavily upon them, as their reign of terror climaxed in a shocking finale in 1926. 
 You can't go in there, ma'am! 
 This is my house! 
 Okay. 
 So, mother looks good, uterus looks good, baby looks good. 
 So, I didn't have a miscarriage. 
 Nope. Just a little spotting. 
 The bleeding stopped after a few minutes? 
 Yep. 
 Right after I went into the house. 
 When you're pregnant, you have 50% more blood in your body. 
 A little discharge is perfectly normal. 
 So if this happens again, I don't need to worry? 
 No worrying. 
 Worrying is bad for mommy and baby. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Have you been worrying more than usual? 
 Recently we had some, uh, issues in our house, but we're putting it on the market, so... 
 Read my lips. 
 No moving while you're pregnant. 
 Death, divorce, moving - these are the three most stressful events a person can experience. 
 We don't want any CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone, wreaking havoc in there. 
 High levels could lead to a spontaneous abortion. 
 Excuse me. 
 Um, one second. 
 HALL: 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, I'm just... 
 Ben! 
 HALL: 
 He's not the first father to faint in here. 
 Ben. 
 Ben, we're gonna run a quick 
 EKG and a blood panel, make sure nothing's wrong. 
 And then I think the two of you should go out for a nice big lunch. 
 I'm good. 
 I'm good. I'm fine. 
 (dog barks) 
 (clears throat) 
 (scoffs softly) 
 Good luck selling this lemon. 
 I like it when you don't run. 
 Makes it a whole lot easier to keep up. 
 Leave me alone. 
 Hey, will you run this scene with me while we walk? 
 You be Oscar. 
 I'm not running lines with you. 
 I'm not speaking to you. 
 Ooh, someone's cranky. 
 I'm guessing that trouble in Boston didn't go so well. 
 That girl still giving you grief? 
 It's none of your business. 
 My life is none of your business. 
 Fine. You need some space. 
 I get it. 
 I need, uh, I need $1,000. 
 You're crazy. 
 I'm not giving you any money. 
 I need it. I need head shots. 
 Listen to me. 
 Don't come near me! 
 You bother me again, there's gonna be a problem. 
 You understand? 
 Oh, I understand. 
 CONSTANCE: You won't find any gold buried out here. 
 What are you doing down there in the dirt? 
 I don't know. 
 I keep finding myself waking up here. 
 The same spot. 
 Well, there's no mystery to it. 
 It's stress. 
 Teenage daughter... 
 (chuckles) 
 a pregnant wife, and your business hasn't found its footing yet. 
 I can tell by the cars on the street, or lack thereof. 
 But you'll find your way. 
 Mm-mm. 
 I must warn you about this property. 
 You see, the previous owners soaked this ground in pesticides. 
 Any fruit from this soil would be poison. 
 With soil this toxic, the best you can do is just to cover it up. 
 You know, I see a brick patio with a gazebo under the shade of this pepper tree. 
 Tall glass of Long Island iced tea in your hand while reclining on a chaise lounge. 
 Oh, the sweet hum of cicadas in your ears. 
 (chuckles) 
 Heaven. 
 (grunting) 
 Sheer heaven. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Can I help you? 
 Are you the woman of the house? 
 Are you here to look at the house? 
 Did you have an appointment? 
 Yes. 
 Well, you'll have to call the realtor. 
 I can come back another time. 
 Wait. 
 My husband's upstairs, so... 
 Oh, this wood - it's so lovely and warm. 
 One almost never sees chestnut anymore. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I never even knew what kind of wood this was. 
 And the wainscot here. 
 Louis Comfort Tiffany glass. 
 Yes. 
 Inspired by the iridescence of butterfly wings. 
 And look at the blue. 
 Matches my eyes, doesn't it? 
 It does. 
 (chuckles) 
 Your eyes are a beautiful blue, too. 
 Thank you. 
 And this must be one of the chandeliers imported from his studio in New York. 
 Yes. 
 I looked it up, it's the real deal. 
 The house has four of them. 
 Would you like to look at the kitchen? 
 It's been modernized quite a bit. 
 I don't like this. 
 It's not right. 
 It's not what I want. 
 What's that device? 
 Oh, this? 
 This is, um, this is a pasta arm. 
 It's-It's, you know, for filling up big pots of water. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 If you decide you want the house, I will have this removed before you move in. 
 Do you think I could have a glass of water? 
 Yeah. 
 Or would you like some tea? 
 I-I was making tea before - mint and verbena. 
 (microwave beeps, hums) 
 Ugh. 
 I would have to get rid of that machine. 
 Oh, I know. 
 I'm conflicted about it, too. 
 We are just addicted to our conveniences. 
 We? 
 Do you have children? 
 Yep. I have a daughter. 
 And actually, I'm pregnant at the moment. 
 Pregnant? 
 I had a child. 
 (microwave beeps) 
 Dr. Harmon. 
 A little late to be planting, isn't it? 
 How can I help you, Detective? 
 We found Sally Freeman. 
 She had something of yours on her person. 
 Sally was admitted to University Hospital two days ago. 
 Failed suicide attempt, found in a hotel downtown. 
 She took one too many pills, put herself in a coma. 
 She was brought in without an I.D., which is why it took awhile to find her in the system. 
 Could have saved a lot of people a lot of trouble if you told us. 
 I'm bound under doctor-patient confidentiality. 
 Who are you trying to protect, Doc-- Sally Freeman, or you? 
 You're worse than my husband. 
 I'm paying you to help me through this crisis. 
 The least you can do is pretend to be interested. 
 I'm in pain. 
 I'm in pain! What do I have to do to get your attention?! 
 Kill myself?! 
 Stop. 
 Finally. 
 I got a rise. 
 Now I know what I have to do. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 You heard it on the tape. 
 She did it to herself. 
 Right. 
 It's not a crime to be an asshole. 
 WOMAN: 
 So as I mentioned on the phone, the carpet will be steam clean before move in. 
 There's a dock there for your iPod or your iWhatever. 
 Uh, well, I'll tell you what I do like. 
 I like that security guy at the door... 
 Excuse me. Can my mom and I have a moment? Alone? 
 Sure. 
 I'll be in the rental office. 
 I've got someone else coming in 20 minutes. 
 Glad we moved all the way to California, since we could be totally anywhere. 
 I think it has a certain... 
 You and Dad, both of you - you don't deal with anything. 
 The affair, the miscarriage. 
 For most people that's just life and they deal. 
 But you guys had to uproot everything - drag everyone across the country to start all over... 
 Honey, I don't think you've quite processed what happened to us in that house. 
 That was devastating. 
 That was a nightmare. 
 This place is the nightmare. 
 I love our house, it's got soul. 
 It's where you and I kicked some ass, Mom. 
 You say we were victims of something bad there. 
 I say that's the place where we survived. 
 I love that you see it that way. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 I can't stay there. 
 This is the decision that your father and I have made for our family together. 
 Yeah, whatever. 
 But I'm telling you, you go ahead with this whacked-out plan and I'm out of here. 
 I will run away. 
 And believe me, I know how to leave so you will never find me. 
 HALL: I'm looking at your results and the good news is your EKG is perfectly normal. 
 As for your blood panel, they found a laudanum compound. 
 Laudanum? 
 Apparently they used to use it as an opiate during surgery. 
 But it caused such extreme retrograde memory loss, that they banned it in 1934. 
 (doorbell ringing) 
 Uh, excuse me one second. 
 I'll call you right back. 
 I know you drugged my coffee. 
 Prove it. 
 (doorbell ringing) 
 Hey. 
 Jesus, I am so sorry... 
 You left me waiting in the Norms for three hours?! 
 Mrs. Harmon?! 
 Hayden, hey. 
 Mrs. Harmon! 
 It's Hayden McClaine! 
 We need to talk! 
 Hayden, stop. 
 This is crazy. 
 Vivien? 
 You're acting crazy. 
 Do not call me crazy. 
 I am not crazy. Calm down. 
 I'm angry. 
 Calm down. 
 And I'm pregnant! 
 Mrs. Harmon?! 
 Do not put your hands on me! 
 You're upset. 
 You have every right to be, but before this spins completely out of control, let's go someplace and talk. 
 Vivien needs to know. 
 She needs to understand you have other obligations. 
 I think we should tell her together. 
 We can discuss that, too. 
 I'm not going back to that Norms. 
 Anywhere you like. 
 Well, I am eating for two. 
 You know what I'd love? 
 A big, thick, juicy... 
 She's still moving.
