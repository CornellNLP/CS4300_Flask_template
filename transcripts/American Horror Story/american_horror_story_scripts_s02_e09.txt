 Please, have a seat, Mr. Morgan. 
 Do you mind if I call you John? 
 Johnny. 
 And how did you come to find me, Johnny? 
 I saw your ad in one of those m-magazines they have in the mail, the  Penny Saver. 
 You probably saw my smoking cessation ad. 
 "Guaranteed results or your money back"? 
 I don't smoke. 
 Well, you certainly don't look like you need to lose any weight. 
 Your ad said something about... 
 curbing compulsions. 
 Absolutely. 
 I've found posthypnotic suggestion to be one of the most powerful weapons in a therapist's arsenal. 
 I want to stop. 
 I really do. 
 If I have to go on medication, whatever, I'm willing to try. 
 Tell me about the behavior you want to curtail. 
 Start from the beginning. 
 I always, uh, had these impulses, you know, even as a kid. 
 The first time I tried it, it was scary. 
 But it felt amazing. 
 My whole body came alive. 
 When my foster family saw the evidence... 
 they kicked me out. 
 I bounced from house to house until I learned how to hide it. 
 It's a shame so many people have such a negative reaction to something so natural. 
 Was that the first time you touched yourself? 
 No. 
 I skinned a cat. 
 It was already dead. 
 So... 
 you went around finding dead animals? 
 Yeah. First couple of times. 
 Then I learned that killing them was just as good. 
 Even better. 
 And this compulsion followed you into your adult life? 
 No. I don't harm animals anymore. 
 I haven't since I was a teenager. 
 Did you know that killing animals is a predictor for psychopaths? 
 I learned that in prison. 
 Armed robbery. 
 But it got me thinking. 
 What made me... the way I am? 
 Who were my  real  parents? 
 Well, they had a computer at the joint, and I didn't have nothing 
 but time, so... 
 Mr. Morgan, you know, I-I may not be qualified to help you. 
 No, you  have  to help, Doctor. 
 I don't know what to do, because those thoughts... 
 haven't stopped. 
 If anything, they've gotten harder to ignore since I found out who I am. 
 And what do those thoughts tell you to do? 
 They told me to retrace my roots, so I'm renting the house where my father lived. 
 They also told me to hurt women. 
 But not just hurt them. 
 Skin them. 
 Like the cats. 
 Stop moving! 
 Shut up! 
 This is delicate work. 
 I didn't have the same skills as my father. 
 I didn't get the medical training. 
 I made a mess. 
 You think it's too late? 
 It's never too late to turn yourself in. 
 No, to go to medical school. 
 I'll never live up to him. 
 That's why I wanted to stop. 
 You see, my name isn't Morgan. 
 It's Thredson. 
 I'm the son of Bloody Face. 
 You wanted a word with Miss Winters? 
 What did I tell you about knocking? 
 Oh, it won't happen again, Sister. 
 Have a seat. 
 Your Jude imitation is spot-on. 
 For a moment there, 
 I thought you might cane her. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Awfully sassy for a girl in your condition. 
 What condition is that? 
 Well... the good news is, you seem to have conquered your sexual perversion. 
 The bad news is... 
 the rabbit died. 
 If I were my Aunt Celeste, I would offer you a Drano margarita. 
 A what? 
 You add half a cup of Drano for every two weeks you've been pregnant to a margarita. 
 That's what she gave my slutty cousin Molly when she got preggers by Billy Porter. 
 I'm pregnant? 
 So are we still sticking to the whole rapist story? 
 Interesting you haven't mentioned Dr. Thredson once since you came in here. 
 We starting to get sweet on him now that we're carrying his child? 
 Actually, the whole... rape thing must have been some kind of hallucination from the car crash when I... I hit my head. 
 Well... 
 whoever the daddy is... 
 there's a little life growing inside of you. 
 I can't keep this baby. 
 I can't have this baby inside me. 
 You  can  have this baby, and you  will  have this baby. 
 This is an insane asylum. 
 People hump like bunnies here. 
 You're hardly our first... 
 unwed mother. 
 Most of the babies, they are born a little... 
 cuckoo. 
 So... our staff is very experienced at calming them and... 
 preparing them for relocation to St. Ursula's 
 Home for Lost Children. 
 You're worse than Jude. 
 You're a sadist. 
 Calm down, Mommy, or it's going to be a very long nine months. 
 We don't want to have to restrain you... do we? 
 May I go? 
 Of course. 
 You're awake. 
 I'm so relieved. 
 Oh, Monsignor. 
 No, no, no, you mustn't move. 
 You've been injured, I'm afraid. 
 Shh... 
 What happened? 
 You don't remember? 
 You killed a man. 
 God rest his soul. 
 I had no choice. 
 I was defending myself. 
 He tried to murder me, and worse. 
 You've become unhinged; that's clear. 
 I blame myself. 
 I should have seen it sooner. 
 What? 
 The pressures of running 
 this place were too much for you. 
 No! 
 You've grown paranoid, seeking conspiracy. 
 And now Frank McCann is dead. 
 What did you say? 
 Kindly speak up. 
 I saw the nun, Sister Jude, 
 attack Frank McCann. 
 It was horrible. 
 And then what happened? 
 I made sure the other inmates were secure, and then alerted Dr. Arden to the situation. 
 Why didn't you call the police? 
 There wasn't time. 
 It was... 
 if you'll pardon the expression, bedlam. 
 Sister Jude was on a rampage. 
 She'd already killed Frank McCann, taken Leigh Emerson hostage, and locked herself in her old office. 
 I can't say any of this came as a surprise to me. 
 She'd been showing signs of instability for some time. 
 She seemed to be taking on the delusions of some of the patients here. 
 She accused Dr. Arden of being a Nazi. 
 She came to me... convinced that her young protégé, Sister Mary Eunice, was possessed by the Devil. 
 When I informed her I would be removing her from her position here, she became inconsolable. 
 She threatened me with the same straight-edge razor that she used to murder Frank McCann. 
 She smelled of liquor and... cigarettes. 
 We had her escorted off the property. 
 I-I-I should have called the police then-- I just... 
 I never for a moment thought something like this could happen. 
 I saw her do it. 
 I saw Sister Jude... 
 murder Frank McCann in cold blood and then try 
 to do the same to me. 
 Isn't it true that you yourself are responsible for the deaths of 18 people? 
 Well, sir, the state... 
 found me  not  responsible, which is why they put me in here, but... 
 yes... 
 oh, yes, I am responsible, I know that now. I've... 
 I've had time to reflect upon my crimes... 
 Your Honor. 
 Christmas '62 was a very bad time for me, and the only solace I have is knowing that... 
 because of what I did... 
 there are 18 more people in Heaven. 
 That's a unique perspective, 
 Mr. Emerson. 
 W-Well, I do know, sir, that no matter what, I-I can't... hate Sister Jude for what she did to me - but I  can... 
 try to forgive her, and I can carry on on my own personal road to true redemption, so that one day, when I enter the gates of Heaven... 
 I can apologize, personally, to each of those 
 18 people that I sent there before me. 
 The court magistrate is determined that you will live out the remainder of your days here at Briarcliff. 
 You will, of course, be stripped of your clerical standing. 
 No longer will you be a sister of the Holy Catholic Church. 
 You are once again Miss Judy Martin. 
 Patient. 
 No, you can't do this to me! 
 You did it to yourself. 
 Come back here, you son of a bitch! 
 Come back here! 
 It's a set-up! 
 God, help me! 
 Apparently she had quite the secret inner life. 
 Oh, Sister, you... startled me. 
 I'm just packing up her things so they can be donated to the poor. 
 I was as shocked as you are when I first saw this. 
 I wonder who she was fancying when she wore it. 
 Of course, none of this is of our concern. 
 We had a dream together, you know. 
 She told me. 
 She said you wanted to be Pope. 
 Those things were said in confidence. 
 You know what I said to her when she told me your dream? 
 I said, "Rome is where that man belongs." 
 She was so happy when you said you wanted her on that journey with you. 
 Like a girl who'd just received a marriage proposal. 
 I can't help but wonder, if I'd been paying closer attention, could this tragedy have been averted? 
 Oh, Monsignor, as she herself would say, 
 "No time for navel-gazing. 
 Too much to be done." 
 But you've had to focus on your own goals. 
 There is no other goal than to save souls. 
 She also said that. 
 Of course. 
 I know I, uh... 
 I can't begin to fill the shoes of the... 
 Sister Jude we all knew and loved, but... 
 let me say... 
 I'm here to serve you. 
 I want to help you save souls, all the way to Rome. 
 Get away from me! 
 Get away from me! No! 
 I demand to speak to someone! 
 Now, now, Sister Jude. 
 You mustn't behave so. 
 She's no Sister no more. 
 She's no queen of the castle neither. 
 She's just a naughty patient. 
 Now do as you're told and take these pills. 
 No! 
 Or I'll 
 happily force 'em down your gullet. 
 No! 
 You clip me again and I'll call Frank in here. 
 Oh, but I can't, because you already clipped Frank but good. 
 No! 
 That's a lie! Get off of me! 
 Get off of me! 
 What's all this fuss then? 
 Hmm? Hmm? 
 That's quite enough. 
 Timothy. Please. 
 Why don't you go and find some other tasks 
 for the moment? 
 Yes, Monsignor. 
 Of course, Father. 
 Timothy. 
 Well, I was hoping you might be up for a visitor, but I 
 see that our adjustment period continues. 
 No. No. 
 Monsignor, please. 
 Don't go. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm better now. 
 What's he doing here? 
 Leigh... has something he would like to say to you. 
 And... I think you'll find it more medicinal than any pill. 
 Leigh? 
 I forgive you. 
 You forgive me? 
 I do. 
 
 
 
 Make it tight, Frank. 
 Make it tight. I like it tight. 
 Just ask Sister Chastity. 
 I'll deal with Sister Chastity. 
 You might start by picking a new name for her. 
 You know, I thought by allowing you time in the general population that it would have had a civilizing effect on you, but clearly 
 I was wrong, Mr. Emerson. 
 So you'll spend the next couple days here, reflecting on your behavior. 
 How can I reflect when my hand's tied down? 
 You're disgusting. 
 We all got our crosses to bear. 
 Come on. Where's your spirit of forgiveness? 
 I reserve it for those who are truly repentant. 
 All God's chillun got to have forgiveness - isn't that what your church teaches you? 
 I'm under no obligation to forgive you. 
 I'm no priest, and you are no penitent. 
 I don't need your forgiveness. 
 And therein lies the journey to true redemption. 
 I hope for both of you. 
 It's me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 sh1t. Did they find him? 
 Not yet. 
 Are you okay? 
 You look terrible. 
 Kit... 
 we have to kill him. 
 What? 
 We should've done it when we had the chance. 
 They're gonna find him, and then he'll be free again, and we cannot wait for that to happen. 
 We're not going to. Lana, he's the only thing standing between me and the death house. 
 We have to get him to confess. 
 You know what sodium pentothal is? 
 It's truth serum. 
 Even if we could get our hands on some, those confessions are deemed inadmissible in court. 
 It'll never fly. 
 I'm desperate. 
 Look, I don't know why they haven't turned me in to the state police yet. 
 Maybe 'cause I've seen too much here but either way, I need Thredson to talk. 
 I think I might know how. 
 You know how this goes. 
 You make a sound, I bash your face in. 
 You'd like to kill me right now, Oliver, wouldn't you? 
 This might change your mind. 
 What is this? 
 It's the ultimate cosmic joke. 
 You got me pregnant. 
 I'm gonna be a father? 
 No, Oliver, you're not gonna be a father. 
 Not this time. 
 What do you mean? 
 Oh, no. 
 No, no. Lana, please, please, please don't give him away. 
 I know what it's like to be raised in the system-- 
 it ruins... 
 Oliver, stop! 
 This monster you planted inside me, I'm getting rid of it. 
 And since I'm stuck here, I'm gonna have to get creative. 
 No. 
 Lana, no, please. 
 This is a mercy killing, Oliver. 
 No baby should have to grow up knowing Daddy is Bloody Face. 
 No. He'll never have to know. 
 Kit Walker is gonna take the fall for those crimes. 
 I promise you, it'll all work out. 
 Is that how you see it? 
 Lana... 
 you know me, I can change. 
 I have great determination 
 and now I have reason... 
 Really? 
 You gonna be a real stand-up guy now? 
 Yes. You owe me this. 
 It's my child, too. Please. 
 You're a sociopath. 
 You can't be honest with anybody. 
 I can. I can be... honest. 
 I can. Please help me. 
 Okay. 
 Donna Burton. 
 Why did you choose her? 
 I saw her... 
 at the library a couple of nights. 
 What did you like about her? 
 Her skin. 
 It was fuzzy like a peach. 
 And I wanted to feel it. 
 So you skinned her alive. 
 Yes. 
 And Alison Reidel? 
 She was a secretary at my dentist's office. 
 I always liked her. 
 I put her to sleep first, but she kept talking to me. 
 I was so confused. 
 And what about Wendy? 
 She never loved you. 
 She locked you away. 
 Her skin was fuzzy like a peach, and I wanted to feel it. 
 So you skinned her alive. 
 What? 
 Hey. 
 And Alison Reidel? 
 I think we got it. 
 Hide that tape. 
 I'm not finished here. 
 Hey... bitch. 
 So it was all an act, huh? 
 No. 
 You were never pregnant? 
 No, that part was true. 
 Was. Sadly, your beloved baby died last night. 
 It started as a trickle. 
 Within an hour, it was a bloody mess. 
 It really wasn't that bad, actually. 
 God, you're a monster. 
 You are worse than I am. 
 You killed an innocent child. 
 I have bakery duty later. 
 And after knife count, I'm gonna pocket one, and I'm gonna come back and slit your throat nice and easy. 
 I always wanted to know what it was like inside the mind of a killer. 
 Now I know. 
 Ah, Mr. Walker. 
 I thought it might be you. You really shouldn't be wandering around these halls, you know. 
 You're not even officially part of this institution. 
 However, I'm very glad you're here. We have so much to talk about. 
 Après vous, monsieur. 
 I always keep a bottle of 
 18-year-old single malt in my desk... 
 for special occasions like this. 
 I think you'll find this exceptionally smooth. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just trying to being friendly. 
 Why? 
 Because I've seen what you've seen. 
 They were here. 
 The creatures you told me about. 
 The little green men, except of course, they're not green, are they, Mr. Walker? 
 No. They're obviously a great deal more powerful and technologically advanced than we are. 
 They're terrifying. 
 Mm-hmm. They took Grace. 
 They took her body while I was trying to dispose of it. 
 What would they... 
 what would they want with her? 
 That's what I've been asking myself. 
 Tell me, Mr. Walker. 
 Did you have s*x with your wife just before she was taken? 
 I've almost forgotten her. 
 I'll take that as a yes. You also had relations with our Grace, which is why Sister Jude wanted me to sterilize the two of you. 
 Oh, you're saying it's 'cause of me that those creatures took them? 
 They're experimenting, probably refining some form of eugenics. 
 I want you to help me to bring them back. 
 They're studying you, Mr. Walker. 
 You're obviously valuable to them, and a good scientist always protects his subject. 
 For example, if your life were threatened, they would have to act to preserve their specimen. 
 What are you saying? 
 If you were to be brought to the brink of death, they would return to reverse the process. 
 You want to kill me? 
 No, Mr. Walker. 
 I want to  almost  kill you. 
 Of course, it would be ideal if you were to cooperate, but then, I'm not asking for your permission. 
 You're a crazy b*st*rd. 
 But you got my permission. 
 If there's a chance I could see Alma again. 
 I'll do what I have to do. 
 Well, then, Mr. Walker, prepare to die. 
 You are nothin' but trouble, lady. Give me that. 
 You ain't got the guts to kill no one. 
 Give me the knife, and we'll call it a night. 
 Haven't prayed in years, Father. 
 How does it feel? 
 Strange, but good. 
 Nobody ever gave me this shot... 
 to rehabilitate myself. 
 As the figurehead of this institution, I want all of our patients to find forgiveness and a new purpose. 
 Even you, in spite of your crimes. 
 Oh, I want to be saved, Father. 
 I'm already living in hell. 
 I don't want to spend eternity 
 there, too. 
 You could be my miracle, Leigh. 
 Do you repent of your sins? 
 I do. 
 If I can turn a man like you towards Christ, imagine the reforms I could make on a national scale. 
 Not just mental health. 
 Believe me, if 
 I ascend to the highest ranks of the church, 
 I won't back down from the fight. 
 You're quite an ambitious man, Father. 
 I just want to serve 
 and make a real difference in the world. 
 Do you renounce Satan and all things evil? 
 I do. 
 Turns your eyes to Christ, Leigh. 
 Whatever shackles you, your freedom lives 
 in him. 
 Praise Jesus. 
 Do you intend to lead a new life, putting God first in all things? 
 I do. 
 Then I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. 
 Oh, thank you, Father. 
 I feel like a new man. 
 Thank you, Sister. I just needed to lie down for a bit. 
 Hello, Oliver, I'm here to keep my word. 
 Missing something, Miss Winters? 
 It was you. 
 You let him out, you let Bloody Face out, I know you did. 
 What have you got here? 
 Miss Winters, I thought we talked about this. 
 It's too late, it's already done. 
 Really? 
 Praise God. 
 Your attempt to murder this precious child was unsuccessful. 
 You couldn't possibly know that. 
 Oh, but I do, and I know something else. 
 It's a boy. 
 I think I need another posthypnotic suggestion, Dr. Gardner. 
 I ate an entire bucket of chicken by myself last night. 
 Dr. Gardner? 
 My God, what did they do to you? 
 Nothing I didn't do to you. 
 Give me a cigarette. 
 Come on, goddamn it, give me a cigarette; I've earned it. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry, Lana. 
 Can I call you Lana? 
 Sure. 
 I'm truly sorry for what I did to you. 
 What I did... 
 was more than just wrong, it was immoral. 
 It was criminal. 
 Yes. 
 I don't expect you to forgive me. 
 But I'm gonna make it up to you, I swear it. 
 How? 
 I'm going to get you out of here. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Last time someone said that to me, it didn't go so well. 
 Yeah. 
 You don't trust me. 
 No. 
 I don't trust anyone or anything. 
 Yeah, well, I'm gonna earn your trust. 
 You think so? 
 I do. 
 Yeah, things are going to change around here. 
 Well, hot damn. 
 That pink stuff - that's gonna kill me? 
 Potassium chloride. 
 I'll inject this directly into your heart muscle, which will cause the heart to stop beating. 
 From my experience, it'll take approximately two to four minutes for all the oxygen in your brain to be depleted, and then you'll die. 
 But you can reverse it, you can, you can bring me back to life. 
 This syringe contains atropine, extracted from deadly nightshade. 
 When I need to revive you, I'll inject this along with adrenaline into your system. 
 These two drugs, administered within two minutes after your death, along with a sharp blow to your chest with my fist, will restart the heart. 
 I don't mind telling you... 
 I'm scared. 
 I'll admit 
 I'm feeling slightly apprehensive myself. 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. 
 What are you mumbling about? 
 It's the only prayer I can remember. 
 Just in case. 
 This is going to hurt. 
 The baby's full-term. 
 It won't be long. 
 Grace. 
 Who brought you here? 
 I thought you were... 
 She'll need a room. 
 I'll look after her. 
 Oh, God. 
 Help me. 
 I'm here.
