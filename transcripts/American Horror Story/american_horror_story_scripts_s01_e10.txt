 Ladies and gentlemen, the ham. 
 Ah... 
 Wow. 
 It looks lovely. 
 Now, who wants to say grace? 
 Oh, Mother, may I? 
 Oh, of course, son. 
 I was hoping you would choose to become a part of this family. 
 Dear God, thank you for this salty pig meat we are about to eat, along with the rest of the indigestible swill. 
 And thank you for our new charade of a family. 
 My father ran away when I was only six. 
 If I'd have known any better, I would have joined him. 
 And, also, because she's been trying to get back into this house ever since she lost it, Lord, a big thank you for blinding the cocksucker that's doing my mother, so that he can't see what everybody knows. 
 She doesn't really love him. 
 Amen. 
 Now, Tate, I know that you've had a hard time making the adjustment, with all the recent changes - moving back in here after the... the tragedy that my own family went through... 
 They burned themselves alive after you were cheating on your wife with Constance, Lawrence. 
 It was... 
 that was nobody's fault. 
 Passion drove her to it. 
 One day, you'll understand. 
 There are sacrifices you have to make in the name of love. 
 On a lighter note, I have reserved tickets for everybody, for Saturday, at our community theater, for the opening night of  Brigadoon. 
 I'm delighted to be debuting in the chorus. 
 Well, I, for one, shall be there with bells on. 
 Thank you, darling, for being so supportive and encouraging. 
 You have allowed me to explore another facet of my self. 
 Yay, I love the theater! 
 Don't, Addie! 
 You're a smart girl. 
 You know he killed our brother. 
 Stop it! Beau died in his slumber, of natural causes. 
 Now, you know he had a respiratory ailment. 
 Your brother's in a better place. 
 He suffered with every breath that he took. 
 He only suffered because of you. 
 You know, Tate, unlike your siblings, you were graced with so many gifts. 
 How is it that you can't bring yourself to use them? 
 Just a smile, or a kind word, could open the gates to heaven. 
 No matter how much you want it... 
 ...I will never be your perfect son. 
 Tate, what are you doing here? 
 Shouldn't you be in school? 
 I'm going right after. 
 After what? 
 Oh! 
 Oh, ah! Ah! 
 Hi. 
 How you doing? 
 Viv, I owe you a very big apology. 
 I don't want you to apologize. 
 I just want you to leave. 
 I've been doing a lot of thinking while I've been in here. 
 I think you're the one that's crazy. 
 I really mean that. 
 Vivien... 
 I know you're telling the truth. 
 You were raped. 
 Oh... 
 Who, or-or what has brought you to that conclusion? 
 Because... 
 I know it wasn't anything that I said. 
 Can I sit? 
 I was advised not to tell you this. 
 The psychiatrist and Dr. Hall didn't think you were stable enough. 
 The twins have different fathers. 
 One of the babies is not mine. 
 What? 
 It's a medical anomaly, but... 
 there have been cases. 
 Oh, God... 
 When I came to see you, I was... 
 I was convinced it was Luke, that somehow you two... 
 Oh, God... 
 Vivien... I'm... 
 I'm so sorry about all this. 
 I really am. 
 Do you remember anything about this guy, other than the rubber suit? 
 His eyes, his voice...? 
 He didn't speak, Ben. 
 Don't you think that's all I've been thinking about since I've been in here? 
 How did he get into our house? 
 Where were you? 
 How did he get that suit? 
 I don't have any answers. 
 But we'll find them. 
 Together. 
 Now, I-I've spoken to the psychiatrist, and there are some... 
 legal hiccups to work out because of the gunshot. 
 But you'll be able to come home, in a day or two. 
 I promise. 
 I'm not going back to that house. 
 Constance Langdon? 
 Yes? 
 I'm Detective Granger, this is Detective Barrios. 
 May we come in? 
 We know how upsetting this must be for you, Ms. Langdon. 
 If you could just confirm for us that that is 
 Travis Wanderly... 
 Yes, it's him. 
 Look at that face. 
 That beautiful, beautiful face. 
 Who would do something like that? 
 That's what we're trying to determine. 
 Where did they find him? 
 In a park. In South Central. 
 The colored section? 
 What on earth would he be doing there? 
 We think maybe he was killed somewhere else, and his body was dumped there. 
 Wait a minute... 
 I heard about this on the news. 
 They found a... 
 a young man with his body cut in two. 
 They called him 
 "The Boy Dahlia." 
 Are you saying that... 
 that Travis is "The Boy Dahlia?" 
 Ms. Langdon, did your boyfriend have any enemies? 
 Anyone who might want to hurt him? 
 No. 
 Everybody loved Travis. 
 Right. Right. 
 Well, it's a... 
 it's a rubber mask. 
 I need it tested for fingerprints and DNA. 
 Mr. Harmon, my name is Peter McCormick. 
 I'm a truant officer for LAUSD. 
 Uh... yeah, uh, come in. 
 Living room. Please. 
 Thanks. 
 Right, well, no, I don't need to... 
 I... I don't need to be transferred, I just want to know which department. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 That was a urgent matter. 
 You have blow-flies. 
 Oh, God. 
 We shouldn't have left food out. 
 I guess I better call the exterminator, then. 
 So, I assume you're here for Violet. 
 I know she's missed a few days of school. 
 Yes. 16 consecutive days. 
 Sixteen? 
 Yeah. 
 We've made numerous attempts to contact your wife, Mr. Harmon. 
 It's the only contact information we have. 
 Any more absences, and we're going to be seeing you in juvenile court. 
 ♪ I could be a smack freak ♪ 
♪ And hate society... ♪ 
 Violet. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 ♪ I could play God... ♪ 
 I don't feel well. 
 Can I come in, please? 
 Is this about school? 
 Yes. It's about school. 
 If you want to give me the parent drill, 
 'cause it's going to make you feel better... 
 Why would it make me feel better? 
 Because... I know it's really important to you to be a good father. 
 Only if I've been a good father. 
 And I've been a lousy father lately. 
 I owe you an apology. 
 Is this some headshrinker trick to make me feel sorry for you? 
 I can't imagine what this year's been like for you; moving and starting a new school and all the craziness that happened to us here. 
 Hey, remember last year when you announced you were going to Harvard? 
 I probably said that to make you happy. 
 I knew that. 
 I also knew that you were smart and you can go anywhere you want for college. 
 Come on, Violet. 
 What are you doing? 
 This isn't like you. 
 I can't go back, Dad. 
 Okay, okay, honey, okay. 
 We'll find you another school. 
 No, they're all the same! 
 Honey, you have to meet me halfway. 
 We'll find you a new school, but you have to start going tomorrow. 
 Otherwise, we'll end up in juvenile court. 
 Deal? 
 Deal. 
 Constance. 
 Hello, Lawrence. 
 Am I interrupting anything? 
 No. Uh... come in. 
 I was so sorry to intrude. 
 I just, I didn't know where else to turn. 
 I needed some human... 
 ...contact, I suppose. 
 I'm so bereft. 
 I mean, how much tragedy, how much loss, can one woman endure? 
 Travis is dead. 
 Murdered. 
 Wow. 
 Wow. That's awful. 
 Yes. 
 So young. 
 So beautiful. 
 Not like you! 
 Constance! Constance! 
 That's why you killed m, isn't it? 
 No! 
 Because you knew I desired him like I could never desire you. 
 No, no, no, no, you got it wrong. 
 Now, likely I won't have the upper body strength to saw you in half the way you did my poor Travis, but I certainly could cut off some of the smaller parts. 
 No-no-no-no-no! 
 I just moved the body! 
 I didn't kill him, I swear! 
 He must've pissed off somebody in the house. 
 I don't know which one! 
 It could even have been your son, for all I know. 
 He's got quite a temper on him. 
 In the house? 
 Travis died in the house? 
 I didn't ask any questions. 
 I just moved the, you know, parts. 
 I've got to go to him. 
 Constance, please! 
 Please, baby, he's dead and I'm here. 
 And I'm alive and I still love you. 
 That's your problem. 
 No, you love me, too, I know it! 
 Are you crazy?! 
 Are you crazy? 
 God, I never loved you. 
 I endured you... 
 for the sake of my family. 
 That is all. 
 So you're going back to your boy? 
 Your dead boy? 
 Even dead... 
 even a boy... 
 he's twice the man you are. 
 Well, he is now. 
 Shh, shh! 
 Just listen to me. Listen. 
 Don't be mad. 
 I love you. 
 Spend the day with me. 
 We can play Scrabble, if you want. 
 I'll even let you win. 
 I can't. 
 I promised my dad. 
 So go tomorrow. 
 It's not like they're gonna miss you for one more day. 
 Come on, Violet. 
 Ms. Langdon, we have a few follow-up questions. 
 Not now. 
 This isn't a good time. 
 We spoke to the Korean gentleman at the corner store. 
 He remembers your boyfriend and all the awful fights you used to have. 
 Those Koreans-- they're so suspicious, you know, ever since Hiroshima. 
 That's a concealed weapon. 
 Why are you carrying that? 
 Maybe because you had reason to visit the colored section of town? 
 Why don't you come down to the precinct, Ms. Langdon? 
 I knew it. 
 What'd I tell you? 
 All these old houses, they got crawlspaces of, like, three feet. 
 It's like a gated community for vermin of every sort. 
 You follow these flies and you will find the source of your problem. 
 Great, more money I gotta spend on this goddamn house that I can't afford. 
 So, can you do it? 
 You are in luck, Mr. Harmon. 
 My last appointment blew me off, so I got an opening on my dance card. 
 And what's your rate? 
 I'm gonna have to get in the crawlspace before I can give you an estimate. 
 But I can tell you this much: 
 for the money, I'm the best exterminator on the market. 
 Okay, Phil, take a look. 
 Get me an estimate. 
 This is a disgrace. 
 You two... bunglers... 
 have come to harass the one person in this City of Angels who not only has nothing to do with this crime, but is singularly devastated by it. 
 You are interrupting a grieving process that started with the death of my daughter. 
 And now Travis. 
 That's right. 
 You have been touched by a fair amount of tragedies. 
 Lots of people dying near you. 
 Let's see, there was your son, Beau, was it? 
 How old was he when he died? 
 Beauregard was a mere boy. 
 Taken too soon by his condition. 
 Shitload of noise complaints from the neighbors. 
 He was an exuberant boy. 
 Full of life. 
 Until he died of "natural causes." 
 There was Tate, of course, a mass murderer. 
 I will not sit here and listen to this recitation of torments past. 
 I have grieved enough for two lifetimes. 
 Most people would be broken by the deaths of their children, but my nature would not permit such weakness. 
 You're right. 
 Let's not talk about the dead. 
 Let's talk about the missing. 
 Your husband Hugo and your maid Moira. 
 They disappeared in '83? 
 My husband was unfaithful, that's true. 
 You know, I never understood what he saw in her. 
 Perhaps it was her coarseness that he was attracted to. 
 I heard rumors of a love nest somewhere down in Brazil near the equator. 
 But I never pursued them. 
 I am not one to stand in the way of true love. 
 But what does the whereabouts of two adulterers have to do with the murder of my Travis? 
 See, that's the thing. 
 In 1983, nobody in this department thought they were just missing. 
 And the D.A., he was about this close to filing murder charges on you, Ms. Langdon. 
 I would rather rot in hell than bury you in the same grave as your lover. 
 
 
 
 I ready the notes on the case. 
 They think you killed them. 
 All they had to do was find the bodies. 
 But they never found what they were looking for. 
 Because there was nothing   to find. 
 My husband ran away from me, from his responsibilities. 
 It never bothered you that he just disappeared? 
 Once I discovered that he had cheated, Hugo meant no more to me than dog sh1t. 
 Oh, hello, Harry. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I've been assigned to the case. 
 No more talking. 
 Nothing more is to be said until I consult with my client. 
 But I had nothing to do with Travis's death. 
 I have nothing to hide. 
 Please, Ms. Langdon. 
 If you don't mind... 
 Sorry to introduce myself under these circumstances. 
 Harry Goodman. 
 What did they ask you about? 
 Just my past. 
 Nothing about Travis. 
 Ms. Langdon, listen to me. 
 "The Boy Dahlia" is sexy, sensational. 
 It's gonna bring a lot of attention to this department, so they're moving fast. 
 That's good. I want them to find the murderer. 
 No, they want to pin it on somebody. 
 And right now, that person is you. 
 And if you say one more word, you could find yourself in a very tight spot. 
 The Verminator is here. 
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. 
 If you can't pay rent, don't... 
 I knew it. 
 When you're right, you're right. 
 Get ready to meet your maker. 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 
 Phil! 
 You're a murderer. 
 You need to stay and repent for the countless innocent lives you've stolen! 
 I see. 
 Well, yes, I've heard some great things about your Chinese language program. 
 You're right, China's the future. 
 Hey, just out of curiosity, what kind of financial aid packages do you offer for academic high achievers? 
 Yes, she's been an "A" student until this semester. 
 Her IQ is north of 150. 
 Well, my daughter has a very bright future, that I know. 
 Truthfully, our real concern has been the kids she's been hanging around lately. 
 Hm. They're just not cut 
 from the same cloth. 
 Where've you been? 
 I just took your rook. 
 Checkmate in 13 moves. 
 What's wrong? 
 He wants to separate us. 
 He's gonna send you away. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I just heard him talking on the phone with a boarding school, asking about financial packages. 
 Makes sense. 
 He sent Mom away. 
 I don't know why I thought I was safe. 
 I just assumed I was his little girl. 
 What a fantasy. 
 I'm so stupid and naive sometimes. 
 Of course he's going to send me away, too. 
 There's nothing stupid about you. 
 And I won't let him send you away. 
 Hey! What are you doing with my stuff, man? - Uh... 
 What? Uh, nothing. 
 I'm, uh... 
 I had to move it. 
 Why? 
 Well, it's evidence. 
 You can't leave it lying around. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Hey, man, um... 
 have I made the news? 
 The news... Oh, God, yeah. 
 You've been all over the news. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, what about - what about Constance? 
 She hasn't been in the news. 
 No, no, no, I mean... 
 how'd she take it? 
 Oh. 
 Pretty hard. 
 Cool. 
 Why doesn't she come over to see me? 
 Too soon, I suppose. 
 Travis, come play with us. 
 Yeah, I'll be right there, girls. 
 Those girls... 
 Yeah. 
 Margaret and Angela. 
 Found 'em hiding down here. 
 Sweet kids. 
 A little needy, but... 
 Oh, say, man, do you think, um, maybe you could snag me some clippings? 
 You know, news articles about me? 
 Just thinking about starting a little scrapbook. 
 Thanks. 
 See if I can get my seat back here. 
 Take it from these little dollies. 
 May I have some tea, please? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 Best tea ever. 
 He's so good with them. 
 Lorraine... 
 I don't think I've ever seen Margaret take to anyone so quickly. 
 They've been so afraid up till now. 
 Lonely. We all have. 
 Why am I seeing you now after... 
 after all this time? 
 You're ready now. 
 You're on the cusp. 
 Lorraine, I'm... 
 I'm so sorry... 
 For everything. 
 Prove it. 
 I'm gonna make her pay. 
 Lorraine, I'll see to it that Constance rots in prison for what she did to our family. 
 Constance didn't do anything to our family, Larry. 
 She didn't break any vows, hmm? 
 That was you. 
 You sick son of a bitch! 
 Show your face! 
 Who are you?! 
 You raped my wife! 
 You raped my wife! 
 You raped my wife! 
 Show me your face! 
 Who are you?! Who are you?! 
 Tate... 
 Violet! 
 Wha... Wha... 
 The only reason I'm not killing you is for her. 
 You need to take a little nap, and then it'll all be over. 
 Vanilla latte. 
 Uh, nonfat, decaf, sugar-free shot. 
 Nothing in it that's bad for you. 
 What's wrong? 
 They didn't say. 
 They just want us down at the police station as soon as possible. 
 Now I have already answered all their questions. 
 They cannot pin this murder on me. 
 Something new must have surfaced. 
 An eyewitness, a piece of evidence... 
 I think you're going to be charged. 
 What did you do to him? 
 I just convinced him to leave us alone for an hour or so. 
 Tate, what did you do to him?! 
 I didn't do anything bad! 
 Just scared him a little. 
 He'll be fine. 
 But we're running out of time. 
 You're being weird. 
 Time for what? 
 I figured out how to keep them from sending you away. 
 Can we run away? 
 Kind of. 
 Yeah. I love you, Violet. 
 And I want you to be happy and free. 
 If we take these, we can stay here. 
 We can play with Beauregard, we can play games, watch videos. 
 We can be together forever. 
 You want us to commit suicide? 
 Yeah. 
 And I don't think there's enough in here to really, you know... 
 So I think if we use these... 
 Where did you get those pills? 
 You dad has a lot of samples. 
 Did you hurt my dad? 
 No, I told you, I just knocked him out so I could buy us some time! 
 Listen to me, Violet, we can't get all chicken sh1t about this. 
 We're running out of options. 
 Yeah. Okay, I get it. 
 It's the only way we can be together. 
 Like Romeo and Juliet. 
 I know how to do it so that it won't hurt. 
 Can we do it in the bathtub? 
 Why? 
 'Cause it's warm and nice and I can light some candles. 
 Okay. 
 But we have to go now. 
 I'll-I'll go run the bath. 
 Okay. 
 Help! Dad, help me! 
 He's trying to kill me! 
 Help! 
 Violet, no! 
 Dad! Dad! 
 Dad?! 
 Help me! 
 Help! 
 Help me! 
 What's happening? 
 What did you do to me? 
 You have to stop. 
 Let's just do what we said we would. 
 Dad, where are you?! 
 Help me! 
 Violet! 
 Stop running! 
 No... 
 Please, Tate, please, I don't want to die. 
 It's too late for that. 
 Violet, listen to me. 
 Why am I running around like a crazy person? 
 Did you drug me? 
 I'm not going to hurt you. 
 I have to show you something. 
 And then you're free to go wherever you want. 
 I promise I won't stop you. 
 You have to trust me. 
 I feel weird. 
 Like I'm losing it. 
 Come on. 
 It's so disgusting down here. 
 Okay, come on. 
 Close your eyes. 
 And remember... 
 everything's going to be okay. 
 I love you. 
 Open your eyes. 
 What? 
 No! 
 Don't you die on me! 
 Violet! 
 I died when I took all those pills... 
 I tried to save you. 
 I did. 
 I tried to make you throw them up. 
 You threw up some. 
 Not enough. 
 You took so many, Violet. 
 You died crying. 
 I held you. 
 You were safe. 
 You died... 
 loved. 
 I hardly feel anything. 
 I didn't want you to find out this way, Violet. 
 You or your parents. 
 I had this idea that if you chose to die, with me, you wouldn't be so sad. 
 I never wanted you to see this. 
 I'm so sorry, Violet... 
 Detective, I want it noted that my client is here on her own volition, and that your department hasn't shown a shred of evidence that could link Ms. Langdon to the tragic murder of Travis Wanderly. 
 We have the murder weapon, Counselor. 
 Well, it's not mine. 
 Whatever it is, it's not mine. 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 You are not going to hold me responsible for a crime I did not commit. 
 Do you know this man? 
 He says he knows you. 
 He did? 
 What else did he say? 
 He says he killed Travis, alone. 
 Says nobody else had anything to do with it. 
 And you believed him. 
 Well, he came in with the murder weapon. 
 Described in detail what happened to the body. 
 Details we'd never released to the public. 
 Since he said he knew you, I was hoping you would help us with the motive. 
 Can you tell us anything that might make sense? 
 I'm sorry, Detective. 
 I have no answers. 
 I can only imagine that he confessed for one reason... 
 ...to pacify a guilty conscience. 
 So... 
 all this time, I thought I was protecting you. 
 But you were protecting me. 
 That's all I ever wanted to do, since I first saw you. 
 So why'd you keep it a secret? 
 "Hi, I'm Tate. 
 "I'm dead. 
 Wanna hook up?" 
 I don't think so. 
 I still don't remember dying. 
 Do you? 
 Nope. 
 What happens now? 
 You draw a card, and then discard. 
 No, I mean... like, how's it going to be? 
 Just like this. 
 Like it's always been. 
 It's you and me. 
 Together for always. 
 Hello, Constance. 
 Thanks for coming to see me. 
 What do you want? 
 I just wanted to see you. 
 One last time. 
 I wanted to take the image of you with me into my captivity. 
 Well, take a good look. 
 It's the last time you're ever gonna see me. 
 I know. 
 They're sending me out of state to serve my sentence. 
 Illinois. 
 Though I understand that the penitentiary there has a very fine theater program. 
 Well, you'll finally have that captive audience you've always dreamed of. 
 Aren't you going to ask me why, Constance? 
 Why what? 
 Why did I confess to a crime we both know I didn't commit? 
 I have long stopped asking why the mad do mad things. 
 But if you thought you were protecting me, then you're a bigger fool than I ever took you for. 
 No, I have no illusion that you need protecting. 
 From me, or any man. 
 No. No, this is about me. 
 I need to pay for my crimes, Constance. 
 All of them. 
 Well, it looks like you're going to get your wish. 
 You're going to die in here, you know that, don't you? 
 I don't mind. 
 I can take it. 
 I can endure it all... 
 if you'll just say those words. 
 I know you loved me once, Constance. 
 Just say it... 
 and I can face whatever may come.
