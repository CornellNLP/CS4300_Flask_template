 Water? Coffee? 
 Drano? 
 Holiday dance is tomorrow night. 
 Fundraiser for the new library. 
 I take it you don't give a sh1t about the new library. 
 Uh-huh. Ahem. 
 I want to ask you a favor. 
 Just... give us a little break tomorrow. 
 You know, don't show up with your people and your signs and your "stop wasting your breath" bullshit. 
 If you come, I'm not gonna protect you. 
 It's the holidays. 
 People want to drink, they want to relax, blow off a little steam, spend some time with their families. 
 What the f*ck does that mean?

 Did it work? 
 Yeah. 
 They'll be there. 
 f*ckin' briar patch, huh? 
 Yeah, f*ckin' briar patch. 
 Be sure everything's ready at the school for the walk-through. 
 And tell the mayor to be there. 
 I don't want any f*ckin' pushback when I arrest these assholes. 
 Copy that, Chief. 
 Anything else? 
 Oh, it looks like somebody stole the baby from the Nativity. 
 You know, Jesus. 
 Am I supposed to give a sh1t? 
 Uh, no? 
 That's correct, Dennis.

 OK, I get it. Jesus, Dad. 
 Aimee : Hey, speaking of Jesus, big deal at school, Mr. Garvey. 
 Everybody's talking about it. 
 What? 
 The baby, how it just vanished from the manger. 
 Didn't vanish. It got stolen. 
 So does that mean it's the police's responsibility to get it back? 
 Well, Aimee, as the Chief of Police, I would say that that might be a misuse of our resources. 
 Aimee : Hmm. 
 They're just gonna replace it. 
 That's cheating. 
 Excuse me? 
 You can't just get a new one. 
 It's sacred. 
 Jill, did you steal the baby Jesus? 
 That's sick. 
 It is sick. 
 OK, I have an actual job to go to, so I just want to be clear that I'm not gonna be doing anything about... whatever this is. 
 Cool. Don't.

 Yeah. You got it? 
 We are gonna be in the parking lot... unmarked cars, waiting. 
 Dennis : And if the G.R. sets foot on school property, we're gonna arrest them for criminal trespass. 
 We're gonna scatter two-man teams there, there, there, and there. 
 We'll have 4 more in the vans. 
 Soon as they come on the school grounds, we move.

 The white one. 
 Obviously the f*cking white one, Marlene. 
 f*ck. Good-bye. 
 Did you know somebody stole the baby Jesus? 
 Yeah. 
 All you have to do is run over to the Biggie Superstore and pick a new one up. 
 A new one? 
 For f*ck's sake, Kevin. It's not the actual baby Jesus. 
 No, you f*ckin' do it. 
 Can you give the Chief and I a moment? 
 Here's what you're going to do. 
 Get the f*cking baby, open the box, strip it naked, scruff it up so you can say that you found it in a ditch or a dumpster or something. 
 And why would I do that? 
 Because you need a win, Kevin.

 Kevin : Somebody stole it, now we're gonna get it back. 
 Check the bank that faces the Nativity, see if we can pull last night's camera feed.

 So should I make that the priority... 
 No. Look, the dance is still the priority, but I would like to stop dealing with the goddamn baby f*ckin' Jesus!

 The naked guy who attacked you. 
 You said you talked to him before he went bat sh1t. What'd you say? 
 I don't remember. 
 Did you talk about Wayne? 
 Maybe. 
 OK, you can't talk about the ranch, Christine, OK? 
 It isn't my fault. 
 He attacked me. 
 It is your fault, because you can't tell strangers that you're pregnant with Wayne's baby.

 Did you call the police? 
 Uh, no.

 Just a friend.
