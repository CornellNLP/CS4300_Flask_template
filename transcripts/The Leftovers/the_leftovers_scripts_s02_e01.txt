 Michael : A reading from Thessalonians. "Now we ask you, brothers, to give recognition to those who labor among you and lead you in the Lord and admonish you." Congregation : Yes. Yes. "And regard them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves." Yes. Yes. "Comfort the discouraged." Yes! "Help the weak." Yes! "Be patient with everyone." All right. "See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone. But always pursue what is good." Yes! That's right. "For one another and for all." Yes! Hallelujah! This is the word of the Lord. Yes! We are the 9,261. We are spared. All : We are spared. And for that, we are grateful. All : Amen! Thank you, Michael. Just a reminder for y'all, I'm up in Austin this week getting my surgery. So if you are so inclined, ask of the Lord for competent doctors. Yes! And a powerful anesthesia. [applause] So I'll miss a few sermons. But just like my hip, y'all will get a great replacement. All right. That's right. Met him doing some missionary work down in Brazil. He don't know our style... That's all right. ...but he knows the Good Book. Amen, amen. Better than most. Certainly better than me. My friend Matt Jamison. [applause] Thank you, Reverend Massey. I'm so grateful for your kindness and for letting me be here. I haven't had the pleasure of meeting most of you yet. We've... My wife Mary and I have only been here for a month or so. Well, I'm a man of faith. Amen! But when I heard about this place, when I heard about what happened here, I'd be lying if I told you I understood it. Yes, yes. But I understand it now. [applause] Because you've shared your home with me, I want to share with you what has happened to us, to Mary, who I was told by countless doctors would never recover. Thank you, Matt. We all know what a truly special place we've got here. Yes! Massey : And I know I speak for everyone here when I say, welcome, brother. Welcome! Welcome, sister. Praise Jesus. Amen! Now let us bow our heads for a reading from the Gospel of Luke. So nice to have you. Thank you. Matt : Hi. Massey : Thank you, sir. Thank you. John. So nice to see your face in there today. What you talking about, now? Come on, now, Calvin. You're gonna make the new reverend here think I never come to church. [both laugh] John Murphy. John, nice to meet you. Matt Jamison, my wife Mary. A pleasure, Mary. Welcome to Jarden. Now, where you two in from? Mapleton, New York. It's just outside the city. New York City. Ah, figured. [laughs] Yeah. So what were you gonna say up there? I'm sorry? Well, right before Calvin here cut you off. Seemed like you were about to share something about your wife. Oh. [chuckles] I was just gonna say that I felt a burden lift off of us when we came to your town. For the first time in a long time, we feel safe. Well, there's no place in the world safer. Y'all take care. Thank you. Mm-hmm. [music playing] [music continues] [chattering] Sorry, I asked for the bacon on a separate plate. You got it. I'll bring that right back for you. Every time. Well, it wouldn't be every time if they'd listen, sweetheart. "See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone." Any particular reason you picked that one? I didn't pick it. Readings are predetermined. What is a Thessalonian anyway? Someone from Thessalonia. From Arkansas, right? [all laugh] Bacon and eggs separated. Appreciate it. [goat bleats] Jerry, come on. [goat bleats] Jerry, please. Do you have to... [goat thuds] [clicks] Sorry, folks. Enrique. [music playing on TV] Narrator : "Perfect Strangers" star Mark Linn-Baker departed on October 14, 2012, but "Hard 10" tracked him down to this sleepy village in the Chihuahua province of Mexico. Woman : We know you didn't depart, Mark. Why'd you fake your departure? No comprende. No comprende. Woman : We know it's you, Mark. Mark : No Mark. No Mark esta. Woman : Mark, tell us why you did it. Tell us why. Damn! Damn it! Narrator #2 on TV : They're gone, but so much of them is still here. [music playing] You've tried to move on, tried to live a normal life, but cannot let go because you haven't known how. [continues indistinctly] [spoon rattling] Michael : Hey. [gasps] Uh... my spoon got stuck in the garbage disposal. I'm going for a ride. Other people feed him, you know. He likes Mom's cooking. Back by 10:00. Be safe. [door opens] [cricket chirps] [door closes] You mail the letter? Uh-huh. Good night. Man : Get off me! Hey, we just missed the bus. Officer : Sure, you did. Head down, sir. Ma'am, calm down. You can't keep us out. Calm down, ma'am. f*ck you, man. This is f*cking America. [Taser crackles] Ah! Man : You can't keep people out, man. You're not so special. f*ck your f*cking wristbands! [TV playing] Hello. Hi. You want to pray? Okay. [vehicle approaches] [music playing] What's that? It's a pie. Where'd it come from? It was on the porch. Is it for your birthday? I don't know. There wasn't a note? Just a pie. Hmm. What kind is it? Apple, I think. Looks homemade. Mm-hmm. You think someone's trying to poison you? [laughs] Look at your face. [laughs] You know someone just moved in the Dunbar house. A family. Just now? Mm-hmm. Seem nice. I think we ought to invite them over for dinner tonight. You're gonna work on your birthday? Just being neighborly. Hi. Hey. Saw you moving in. I'm John Murphy. We're right next door. Here. Welcome. Oh, thanks. That's so nice. I'm Nora. Well, I see you got your hands full. No problem. I got her. Did you bake this yourself, John? No, ma'am, I did not. And who's this? This is Lily. Say hello to Mr. Murphy, Lily. [coos] Hey, Lily. [banging] Is everything all right in there? Fine, we're just moving in. You know, chaos. Of course. Well, I'll leave you to it. Just wanted to invite you all over tonight. Having a little barbecue for my birthday. That's so... We don't want to crash your birthday. No, no pressure. Just drop by if you can. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye, Lily. You ask them if they eat meat? I told them it was a barbecue. If they don't eat meat, that would have been the time to tell me. Violet wants to know when she can pick me up. Well, you tell Violet that you will text her as soon as I authorize you to do so. Nora : Hello! Sorry, we rang the doorbell, but nobody answered. We're back here. Come on down. It's Kevin. You're John, right? Right. Right. This is Erika. Hi. Hi. Hi, Erika. How are you? Nice to meet you. Evie, Michael, introduce yourselves. How you doing? Michael. I'm Nora. Nice to meet you. Hi. Hey. So are we early, or... No, right on time. Oh, I thought this was a birthday party. It is. We don't have any friends. [laughing] Erika : Who is this? Nora : This is Lily. Erika : Well, hello, Lily. [laughter, chattering] ♪ I don't need sunglasses ♪ ♪ Ain't no sun without you, baby... ♪ She's adorable. Thank you. Is she adopted or did your mom f*ck a black dude? Evie! [laughs] [laughs] You don't need that anymore. You guys bought the house, right? Yeah, but they said that we should leave them on for a couple weeks so the park rangers don't bother us or something. Your daughter is good with a baby. That's got to be nice. Oh, she's not mine. She's Kevin's. Oh, well, she's pretty. So is he. His secret is moisturizing. [laughs] So you have family around here? Sorry? In Jarden. I figured someone must have tipped you off about the house. Real estate moves pretty quick around here. Oh, no, we were just in the right place at the right time. I have a brother, Matt Jamison. He and his wife came out here a couple months ago. He's helping out in the Baptist church. You know him? I just met him yesterday. Small world. Kevin : Cake looks good. Well, she works the grill, I bake. [laughs] Now, what happened to your head? I fell. Can I... can I put these in the fridge? Absolutely. You want one? Uh, nah. I don't drink. But help yourself. Okay. What? What? What? Oh, what were you looking at? I was just looking at your couch in the other room. We had one just like it. [can pops] [laughter] So I step on the carpet and I feel this squish. I walk around the corner and trickling down the steps like a fancy fountain is water, but in my house. [laughing] So I'm walking up these steps. And you know when you feel like it's a bad idea, but you do it anyway? I open the bathroom door and this wave comes out. A little one, but a wave. And this one is standing in the bathtub with her arms out like Moses and this one's up on the sink trying his hardest not to get wet. And he just looks at me with this serious face and goes, "Evie wanted to know what would happen." [laughing] Gets funnier every time, Mama. Nora : How old were they? Five. And they're lucky they made it to six. That must have been fun to come home to. Well, I was in prison. Oh, yeah? Well, how long were you there for? Six years, 119 days. [chuckles] They think you're kidding. Oh, sorry, no. I really was. Travis County Unit. Go ahead. Go ahead and ask. What? What I did. It's what everybody wants to know. Oh, that's none of our business. What'd you do? Huh. Attempted murder. What happened? Well, didn't try hard enough. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
