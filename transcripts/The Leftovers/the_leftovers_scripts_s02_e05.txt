I don't get-- I can't understand why you came back and went away again. Why would you? I'm doing it all exactly the same way it was that day. The same song, the same places-- the church, the supermarket-- the same fruit in your shake, the same burrito, but it isn't working. I know it was this place. It was the first night we were here and I know it was this place because you woke up, Mary. We spoke. And we laughed. And we... For three hours you were awake and I don't know why you went back to sleep. Is it a test? Can you look at me? Just give a small sign that you're here. Oh, this isn't fair. You can't give that to me and take it away again. So you-- you need to look at me now, Mary, okay? Look at me. Look at me! [music playing] ♪ Everybody is wondering ♪

♪ Think I'll just let the mystery be. ♪ Please pull over to the waiting area. Visitors coming through. We'll let you all through in five minutes. Please pull over to the waiting area. Excuse-- excuse me, sir. My wife has an appointment. We need to-- We'll let you go as soon as we can, sir. [horns honking] Man : Let's go! Ranger :  Please pull over. Visitors coming through. [ranger radio chatter] [whistle blowing] Please pull over. Visitors coming through. Think they could invest in a bigger bridge, huh? Ranger #2 : Come on in. Ranger :  Visitors coming through. That's true, Matt, but then the town would lose its authenticity. [alarm blaring] [radio chatter] [whistle blowing] What's happening? Get back in your car, sir. Can I-- We have runners. We have runners. [grunts] [siren wails] [grunting] Go, baby, go! [stun gun crackling] Hey! [groaning] [groaning, struggling continue] [horns honking] Tech :  Any allergies? No allergies, but she has an adverse reaction to amoxicillin. And the reason for the scan? I was hoping to find out if there's been any improvement in brain function. Anything in her behavior to suggest a change? Um, I'd just like to compare her results to her last scan, please. You can send them to our doctor in New York. You got it. Can you tell me how much the co-pay is? You'd have to talk to billing. Will she feel it? I don't know. [machine knocking] Sir, personnel only once the scan starts. Someone will come get you when she's through. Yeah, okay. [urinating] [phone ringing] ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah... ♪ Oh, oh! Oh, sh1t! sh1t! [sighs] f*ck! [door opens] Mr. Jamison! Would you mind coming back inside? Why? We'd like to discuss the results. I told you to send the results to our doctor. I'm not paying for any more-- There's no charge, sir. But if you could please just come on back in. It's important. [door opens] Mr. Jamison. Charlie Sampson. How are y'all today? I'm good, thanks. Sorry, are you a doctor? No, sir, I am not. If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this and signing it, y'all can be on your way. Waiver of liability? I don't... Sorry, I don't... they said this was about Mary's results. Is there a problem? Yes, sir, there is. You failed to disclose your wife's condition. If you had, we would have never administered the contrast dye. I told you about her condition. I answered all the nurse's questions. You told us she was in a persistent vegetative state. You did not tell us that she was pregnant. Our blood draw showed HCG levels well over 1,000. We couldn't have children. I never thought that-- you're pregnant? Well, congratulations. Now if you'll please just sign the release. What is this? It indemnifies the imaging center  in the event that the pregnancy is no longer viable. Why wouldn't it be viable? Because your wife is a 40-year-old woman in what amounts to a coma. You're looking at close to a 90% chance of her miscarrying. That's why we ask for consent before we administer an MRI. But our tech did not ask for it in this case, sir, because your wife is not capable of giving consent. And if she's not capable of giving her consent for a test, she cannot give her consent for anything. You take my meaning? No. She was awake. She was awake when we-- I would never do that. Of course you wouldn't. Just like you wouldn't want to have to say that under oath if you didn't have to. Now please sign the release. I want my co-pay back. [Matt laughs] I knew it! 10 years we tried. 10 years and nothing. And in one night... one night! It's that place. That's why you woke up, isn't it? So this could happen. Don't you worry about that 90% business. Once we're back across that bridge, you'll be fine. You and the baby. You and the baby. Oh, poor guy. [blinker ticking] Hey there. You okay? I've been better. Anything I can do to help? Yeah. Just conked out on me. I think it might be the radiator. Well, I tried to call for a tow, but there's no reception out here. Well, let me try. Dropped it in the toilet. I've lost two that way. Well, we're just a couple of miles out of town. I can give you a ride. Is that your wristband? You live there? In Miracle? Yes. Me and my wife Mary. She okay? Getting better all the time. Oh, hey. What's your name? Is that your son? [groans] I'm sorry. [groans] We-we have to get in. Get his wristband, son. Man :  Careful, don't rip it. I can't get it off. Stand over here, God damn it. [cracks] [screaming] We have to get in. [Matt groans] All right, come on. Door, get in. [car door opens] [car door closes] Woman :  Matt. Matt, we have to hurry. You have to get us back in. Mary? He won't last out here. [groans] I'm gonna lose the baby, Matt. Please, honey. Get us back in. I will. [winces] Mary? It's okay, honey. I heard you. We'll go right now. No. No! Hey! Hey! Hey! God damn it! Hey! [music playing] [men singing in Spanish] Don't worry, sweetheart. I heard you. We're almost home. Almost home. Hey! Friend. Where are you coming in from? sh1t, are you hurt? Do you want to get in? I know all the ways. Back door, my friend. How much money you got? We live here. Oh. Well, a thousand pardons, sir. Almost home, sweetheart. "Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top. Safe out of fortune's shot." [ranger radio chatter] Hello. Excuse me. This access is for park personnel only. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to return to camp. We live in the park. We were attacked, me and my wife. A man and his son, they were in a red car. Would you like to report this to the local sheriff's office, sir? I'd like to report it to you. Sorry, but we got no jurisdiction if you're not in the park. We live in the park. Please just let us in so I can get my wife home. The longer she's... I cannot let you cross without a valid ID, reservation, or a wristband. They stole our wristbands. [sighs] We live on Scarborough Street. I work at the Sacred Mission with Reverend Massey. We shop at the Safeway on Amarillo. We attend the Jarden Community Pool every Sunday and Wednesday. My sister just moved here, but I haven't memorized her number and my phone fell in a toilet. Please. We live here. Y'all need to go to the visitors' center, get yourselves some replacement bands, okay? Yes, sir. Yeah, thank you. [chain rattles] God bless you. He does every day. Recording :  The visitor wristband is your ticket into Miracle. Visitors must wear their wristband at all times. Spell your name again for me. J-A-M-I-S-O-N. Is this gonna take much longer? We got a wedding in town. You said it was a sanctuary pass? Yes, Reverend Massey sponsored us of Sacred Mission. My sister just moved here. Could she sponsor us? What's her name? Nora Durst. Durst. Excuse me. Can you help us? Could you just wait a minute? [line ringing] May I? Kevin :  Hello? Kevin? Oh, thank God. Um, Mary and I-- they won't let us back into town. We're at the visitors' center. Our wristbands were stolen... Jesus Christ, man. Step aside. ...and now they won't give us any new ones. I'm on the phone. I don't care. Sir, unless they've been here for six months, I can't help you. Now, you hear that? She can't help you. Now step aside, man. Please, will you mind your own business? No, I did my business. I've got my documents. And you don't. So why don't you just roll her on out of here 'cause she doesn't look like she's in a rush to get anywhere. Oh, you've got your documents. That's right. You've got your documents. Yes. [papers crunch] Let's see them, huh? Recording :  Welcome to Miracle National Park... She pretending? No, she's not pretending. He will die. What? She says if you don't get her back inside, he will die. Who? [door opens] Ranger : Matt and Mary Jamison. Jesus, Matt. Are you okay? Yeah. Thank you. You zip-tied him? Man got a busted hand. Works at the church. What, you scared he gonna baptize you or something? Give me the clippers. This is John. He's gonna help you and Mary. Yes, we met. Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. You should get it looked at in case it needs to be set. Erika will take care of him once we get back into town. My wife's a doctor. I'll be fine. Thank you. I'm sorry about your daughter. I've been handing out fliers at the church. Appreciate it. Try to keep it elevated. I always do. I wish I could say this never happens, but every man for himself out there. It can get rough. What were y'all doing in Austin? Just getting a test, a scan for Mary. Everything okay? Yes, thank you. We do it every six months or so to see if there's been any change in her condition. Was there? Sorry? Any change in her condition. N-no. Except for the pregnant part. What? You-- you went through Mary's bag? It fell out. One of the rangers picked it up. Matt, what's he talking about? Please, this is very complicated. It is complicated. Yes, and we... They said the pregnancy is high risk, so the longer we're out here-- I need to get Mary back into town now. John :  Why? What? Why do you need to get Mary back into town now? John, he's been attacked. Yeah, and I'm trying to help, but I'm not getting the whole story. Did she wake up? You brought her here, all the way to Miracle, Texas, and she woke up, right? And while she was awake, you made love. And then, sh1t, she went right back to this. That the story you gonna tell? The only story you can tell? 'Cause it's not true. Because that doesn't happen here. People don't get healed. My wife lost her hearing a long time ago and it's still lost. So, what, God likes your wife better than mine? Your friend Kevin here asked me to help you out. I owe him, so I will. But you got to tell me the truth. The truth? In about five months when your wife starts to show and everybody knows she's pregnant, you need to say that you were sad and lonely and confused. And that you are very sorry for what you did because you knew it was wrong. Jesus, John... That's the truth. Right? Yes. She never woke up. She never woke up. Okay. Well, let's get you home. What happened to you? Excuse me? I know your daughter is missing and that's terrible, I'm sorry, but you were like this before that. You're angry at this place. What happened to you? You know what? I don't think I'm gonna be able to get those wristbands after all. Kevin : Hey, come on. Hey, John. Hey! [door opens] 
 
 What the f*ck was that, Matt? How much money do you have? What? I'm gonna need money. How much do you have? Me and Nora are gonna talk... Now, Kevin. I need to get her back now. Okay, okay. I got that. Thank you. Get her on the bridge. Matt : I've got her. Ranger :  Coming through. Matt :  We'll be fine, Kevin. [chains rattle] [crowd chattering] I'll get us back in. You'll be fine. You and the baby. [drumming] Matt : Excuse me, um... Excuse me. [fiddle playing] Excuse me, ladies. I'm looking for a tall man with a samurai bun. Excuse me, gentlemen... Man : Look at him. Look what he did. Man #2 :  You beat that little grubworm of yours? Hey, what you looking at? Suck on that! [man grunts] Punk! [laughs] Woman :  You want to free him? What? Do you want to free him? Man : Look over here! Yes, of course. Then take his place. Crowd : Yeah! Go! Get up there. Yeah! Yeah, I didn't think so. [clamoring continues] Woman :  Yeah, get up there. Hey! [men grunting] [blows thudding] Y'all okay? Yes, thanks. I'm looking for a tall man with a samurai bun on his head. Swedish guy? Yes, I think so. Name's Elmer or something. Trailer, big green stripe.

May I have a moment of your time? I have a friend I met doing some missionary work years ago. He preaches at a small church across the bridge there. And he's been trying for years to get me to come out and visit him, so I decided to take my friend up on his offer and come here to Jarden. The plan was to stay for about a week. We've been here for three months now. How? Religious exemption. They gave Mary and I wristbands that said sanctuary on them. This morning a man attacked us  and took those wristbands and now they will not let us back in. Sandy, I'm asking for your help. I'm calling upon your sense of community and charity. Mary and I need some money so that I can-- How much? $500. I know that's an extraordinary amount of money, but I give you my word as a Christian I will pay you back. What denomination? 20s.

Get in. They're searching trunks. They won't search ours. [sirens wailing] What's happening? There was an anonymous tip that those missing girls were spotted out here in the encampment. You? It was anonymous, Matt. Now get in the trunk. There. We good? Let them through. Here comes the truck. All right, let's go. Forget it. Move it. Remember that train in Frankfurt? You and me crammed into a single sleeper berth. I had to hold you so you wouldn't fall out. You thought it was romantic. "Do Yeats," you said. [chuckles] And I said, "I only did Yeats to get you to fall in love with me. I don't need poetry anymore." And you said, "You still need it." [chuckles] "Though I am old with wandering Through hollow lands and hilly lands, I will find out where she has gone...

Kevin : What happened? Nora : He's not coming with us. Get in the car. [engine starts] Who the f*ck is that? My wife woke up the first night we arrived in your town. It's the only time in over three years she's talked to me. And there may be no way to prove it, but it happened and I won't ever say it didn't. I don't want your wristband. Mary found hers, so she's back where she belongs and I have no doubt that she'll wake up again soon. And when she does, I'm going to come back and you and I will have a talk. This boy needs help.
