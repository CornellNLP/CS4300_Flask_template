 (Mason) 
 I want what Nolan had, and just like him I'm willing to use what I know when I have to. 
 This doctor's report says you're supposed to be taking a break from playing. 
 You have to postpone that audition. 
 (Mona) 
 I play chess every night with the most brilliant opponent I could ever ask for. 
 - What do you know about them? 
 - Nothing. 
 Except the way they think. 
 (Alison) 
 If you can't tell the world your secrets consider telling each other. 
 - Andrew and I got in a fight. 
 - Some more secrets? 
 (Dylan) 
 No, same secret, I just made the mistake of being honest about it. 
 [instrumental music] 
 Dad? 
 (Alison) 
 Your Beacon Heights success predictor? 
 Yes, but somebody has been messing with it and now it's looking for a particular kind of smart person. 
 Ray? 
 (Claire) 
 Taylor had so much imagination. 
 She thought the Emerald City was out there in the woods around our house and she was going to find it.

 Taylor.

 (Caitlin) 
 Are we even sure we wanna do this? 
 Don't you dare! 
 We can't do this without you. 
 And you owe me. 
 You said you would do whatever it takes to prove to me that you're sorry! 
 Yes, I did, but we're about to break a lot of laws here. 
 Felonies. 
 Maybe that comes easy to you, though.

 Yeah, well, who died and made you boss?

 You never cared about Nolan. 
 Why do you care about this? 
 (Caitlin) 
 Let's just stop fighting and focus on what we're doing here.

 Taylor! 
 Open the door! 
 Taylor, please, open up! 
 Taylor! 
 Taylor, open up! 
 [engine revving] 
 Ah! 
 [clattering] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Would you like some peanut brittle? 
 I'm on a cleanse. 
 You are Ray Hagedorn, aren't you? 
 - That's me. 
 - I'm Mona Vanderwaal. 
 I work... 
 I've been in your office, I change your light-bulbs seen you all over the campus. 
 You just never noticed. 
 My cloak of invisibility. 
 You live here? 
 Well, it's not Walden Pond but it suits me. 
 How long have you been here? 
 I was    years old when I came. 
 What were you doing when you were   ? 
 Playing with my dolls and shoplifting with Hannah. 
 So you were a student here? 
 Then I met a girl. 
 She was smart like you. 
 And where is she now? 
 Your-your girl? 
 She couldn't take the pressure. 
 Does the school know that you live down here? 
 Does it look like I want them to know where to find me? 
 And suppose I were to call campus security in? 
 - Tell them you live down here. 
 - You're not gonna do that. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause you wanna know who messed with your pretty little program. 
 What do you call it, your crystal ball? 
 [scoffs] 
 Impressive. 
 You're like a human Beacon guard, aren't you? 
 My cloak of invisibility allows me to hear more than most. 
 Do you know who did it? 
 What do you think the list is for? 
 Maybe it's a suspect list of who killed Nolan. 
 But I know it's connecting some dots. 
 Me, Alison DiLaurentis Caitlin Park-Lewis.

 Hey, you are my beautiful dreamer. 
 And this can be your fresh start. 
 Did you see the design lab? 
 Did you see the computer lab? 
 Yes, you know me so well. 
 It's everything I want from a school. 
 I know you can do anything you set your mind to. 
 Just like my dad. 
 I'm not perfect, Ava. 
 I've made some mistakes. 
 But you know how much I love you, right? 
 Nobody's perfect, dad. 
 You've always been there for me. 
 And you always will. 
 ♪ You let your feet run wild ♪     
 - Hey. 
 - Mm.. 
 - Let's take a selfie for mom. 
 - Okay. 
 Alright. 
 - Okay.

 We had a fight. 
 Mm.. 
 Sorry. 
 [knocking on door] 
 I'll get that. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [door closes] 
 Look, I hate to interrupt your little tea party.. 
 But we have to stop Mason before my fashion show. 
 What happened? 
 Did he threaten you? 
 (Ava) 
 He's threatening all of us. 
 Okay? 
 And I'm scared he's gonna explode. 
 I can't seem to get him out of my head. 
 I can't think, I can't study, I can't sleep, I can't design. 
 And this fashion show is everything to me. 
 I'm falling apart. 
 I'm sorry, about everything. 
 Don't even. 
 Ava, I'll do whatever it takes to help you. 
 Good... because I have a plan that includes you. 
 Okay. 
 Just tell me what you need. 
 I'm in. 
 Okay, I need you to lure Mason to Nolan's cabin so we can drug him and get his murder confession on tape. 
 [chuckles] 
 - Are you being serious? 
 - Does it look like I'm joking? 
 - Drug him with what? 
 - Anti-anxiety meds.. 
 That Nolan gave me when I was being hounded by the media after I was outed. 
 Look, I did some research and the right dose of barbiturates can actually act like a truth serum. 
 Who looks this stuff up? 
 - You want us to kidnap him? 
 - Call it what you want. 
 But to me it sounds like a simple plan. 
 A simple plan is like taking his phone and figuring out where he was that night. 
 - Wait, you can do that? 
 - Yeah. 
 By hacking into the location settings on his phone. 
 But when have you ever seen Mason without his phone? 
 Right, right, well, he even takes it to the shower. 
 Don't we all? 
 What? 
 It's my only chance to binge the "Golden Girls."     
 - You are so gross. 
 - Look, I need your help. 
 - Okay? 
 - I'll do it. 
 To prove to you that I really am sorry. 
 Sorry for what? 
 [instrumental music] 
 We need your help too, Dylan, in case things get ugly. 
 I wanna stop Mason from terrorizing us just as much as you do, alright? 
 But this seems extreme. 
 He's gonna tell us the truth. 
 And then he's gonna take a little nap. 
 And then this nightmare will finally end. 
 (Caitlin) 
 Dylan, don't you have a big audition coming up? 
 - Yeah, t-tonight. 
 - Okay. 
 So, what if he decides to screw that up for you too? 
 [sighs] 
 I can't take that chance. 
 We didn't get to stand up to Nolan and now we have a real chance to stand up to Mason. 
 And let's not pretend he's only got one secret on all of us. 
 This could go on forever. 
 No... it won't. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [crunching] 
 Mm.. 
 Nolan Hotchkiss, yeah.. 
 That was one hell of a mess to clean up. 
 Can't say I was upset     
 - about it, though. 
 World's a better place without him in it. 
 Oh, that's harsh. 
 He deserved what he got. 
 Did you know her? 
 (Ray) 
 Taylor Hotchkiss? 
 They're the first family of this place. 
 Everybody knew them. 
 But did you know her? 
 She figured me out, a little. 
 Gave me some books to read. 
 I told her about Angela. 
 Your girl? 
 Taylor wasn't the first person to jump off the Haskell Road bridge. 
 For a while, I thought maybe that's what gave Taylor the idea... to jump. 
 But her problems were a lot bigger than hearing a sad end to a love story. 
 My friend Alison thinks that Taylor might be alive. 
 (Ray) 
 That's occurred to me, too. 
 If it's true, she better stay far away from here. 
 Who would wanna hurt her? 
 I tried to warn Taylor. 
 I left her a message. 
 "They're watching." You wrote that on her wall? 
 [dramatic music] 
 [engine revving] 
 [screeching] 
 Aah! 
 - Damn it! 
 - Taylor... my name... 
 - I know who you are, Alison. 
 Now get out of my house. 
 Get out! 
 (Taylor) 
 Why are you here? 
 I need your help. 
 [scoffs] 
 Forget it. 
 I'm the dead girl and I'm gonna stay gone. 
 If you really wanted to disappear you'd be in Florida by now. 
 Not hiding in some forest outside Beacon Heights. 
 I think you wanna know who killed your brother. 
 You've just got it all figured out, don't you? 
 - No, I don't. 
 - No. 
 You have no idea what you've done. 
 You've put me in a lot of danger. 
 Who are you afraid of? 
 I didn't come here just to turn around and leave. 
 If you know anything about me you'd know that. 
 Someone tried to kill me, okay? 
 I don't know who it was. 
 That's why I faked my death. 
 That person probably killed my brother. 
 Listen, I'm not here to hurt you. 
 - I'm looking for answers. 
 - You don't get it. 
 You're hurting me just by being here. 
 - I don't understand - What my brother said to you. 
 On your first day. 
 It was true. 
 My mom is gonna say that you're here because you remind her of me. 
 But it's more than that. 
 She brought you here to find me. 
 She thinks you're dead. 
 She doesn't wanna believe that. 
 That's why she used Mona's program to find you. 
 We don't just look alike. 
 - We think alike. 
 - What? 
 It wasn't the intention of the program but it identifies similar personality traits in people. 
 My mom knew if there was any chance I was still alive you would find me and she was right. 
 That's why you have to leave and I have to get the hell outta here. 
 Damn it! 
 Crap. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 (Mason) 
 You look like you could use a friend. 
 [sighs] 
 Hey, do you ever have one of those days where just everything goes wrong? 
 - Not really. 
 - Yeah? 
 Well, I've got the most important interview of my life coming up and every professor I have has assigned papers. 
 All due on the same day of my interview. 
 That's pretty much how it works for all of us here. 
 You never really seemed that stressed about it before. 
 Things aren't that great in other aspects of my life. 
 Ah, so that's why you're talking to me. 
 I get you, Cate, and you know I'm here if you need a friend. 
 Remember finals week, senior year when we all went out to the cabin with Nolan? 
 We were all so stressed, but the second we got there.. 
 You can't help but relax at the cabin. 
 You know, I could really use that about now. 
 Let's do it, then. 
 Let's go. 
 - Seriously? 
 - Yeah. 
 Yeah, I was supposed to do something later but I'll see if I can get out of it. 
 - Great. 
 - Yeah. 
 Hey, come here. 
 [chuckles] 
 Look, you hang in there, alright? 
 Yeah, I will. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 (man on phone) 
 At the tone the time     will be   :   p.m. 
 Hello? 
 (man on phone) 
 At the tone, the time     will be   :   p.m. 
 [instrumental music over phone] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Ali, please call me back, if you find a certain someone don't bring her back here. 
 Just stay where you are. 
 You wanna talk about it? 
 About why you and Ava are fighting? 
 [cell phone beeping] 
 It's from Mason. 
 He said, "I'll meet you at the cabin at  :  ."     Game on. 
 [dramatic music] 
 You really think that your mom is the one that tried to kill you? 
 I don't, but I can't be sure. 
 I know a grieving mother when I see one. 
 And she sat in my living room. 
 Your living room. 
 From one mom to another. 
 I felt her pain, Taylor. 
 She's your family. 
 When I was little, my dad brought us all out here for the Lyrid meteor shower. 
 There were hundreds of meteors falling down all at once. 
 It was like the sky was filled with a million fireworks. 
 Sounds amazing. 
 My mom and I just laid on top of this truck staring straight up into the sky at all the bright lights. 
 It was like we were floating in space. 
 I swear I could feel the Earth spinning. 
 My mom laughed, she just held on to me. 
 Said she was making sure I wouldn't fall. 
 I feel like you wanna go home. 
 I'd love to. 
 But it's not safe. 
 Maybe. 
 But I think you owe it to Nolan. 
 Why is solving my brother's death so important to you? 
 Whoever killed Nolan is threatening people I care about. 
 And I know it's asking a lot, and you think it's dangerous but you knew Nolan better than anyone. 
 You know his secrets, you know Beacon Heights. 
 I need your help. 
 Taylor, you can trust me.. 
 Like your brother did. 
 (Caitlin) 
 Whiskey, check. 
 Spy camera, check. 
 Rope, just in case, check. 
 Well, this doesn't look weird at all. 
 Ugh, you have to play all of that at your audition? 
 Well, if Mason doesn't kill me first. 
 I have to be ready to play any of these orchestra excerpts at random.. 
 After we kidnap and drug a fellow student. 
 Who we think is a murderer. 
 Dylan, how are you gonna handle all this? 
 I asked for a time extension, but I haven't heard back yet. 
 These are some of the most difficult cello pieces ever written. 
 Old crossing, Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream is a freaking nightmare. 
 Ava hates me. 
 What happened? 
 - I'm the rat. 
 - What? 
 I'm the one who outed Ava and her family to the school. 
 Caitlin, how could you do that? 
 I didn't mean to, like, I-I just told one person and... 
 - Well, one is all it takes. 
 - I know. 
 I'd do anything to take it back. 
 But you can't, it's too late. 
 Well, now I know whose side you're on. 
 It's not about sides, it's about respect. 
 You ruined her one opportunity her right to speak publicly about her family on her own terms. 
 I mean, do you realize how grateful I am that nobody outed me to my parents before I was ready? 
 I know people who weren't as lucky as me. 
 Yeah, I really screwed up. 
 You did. 
 But you also did the right thing telling her. 
 Just give her time. 
 You know, I mean, she'll.. 
 She'll come around. 
 Thanks, Dylan. 
 Why would Nolan trust you? 
 I wish I knew. 
 But he did. 
 That night when he died he was waiting for someone on the roof. 
 That someone was me. 
 We can't do this by ourselves, we need help. 
 - No, Nolan... 
 - I know someone we can trust. 
 No, we've talked about this. 
 I think this could work. 
 Okay. 
 He said there was someone we could trust but.. 
 I never thought that person could be you. 
 That was the last time I saw him alive. 
 I was there at the cemetery that day. 
 I was waiting for everyone else to leave so I could say goodbye. 
 I felt oddly safe there, I guess no one looks for a dead girl in a cemetery. 
 I'm glad that you got to say goodbye. 
 I never got a chance. 
 My mother never left the crypt that night. 
 If Nolan can trust me, why can't you? 
 Okay, so the runway will be here. 
 Approximately, feet long     then I'll have the audience sitting along each side of the runway. 
 The cool retro projector will be here. 
 And... the music should cue at the exact same time as the projector, like so.

 [door opens] 
 A rat and a cheater. 
 Nolan really knew how to pick 'em. 
 How long? 
 How long was it going on? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 What? 
 (Dylan) 
 Look, I think it was before you. 
 (Caitlin) 
 Wait, so it was during Nolan and me? 
 Look, we barely talked back then. 
 Alright? 
 And I never knew if you were Nolan's real girlfriend or if you weren't or.. 
 So this is what you were hiding from Andrew? 
 And from me? 
 It is what made Andrew walk out on me. 
 Yes. 
 - I couldn't lie to him anymore. 
 - Oh. 
 - But you could lie to me? 
 - It was one time! 
 - It doesn't make it right. 
 - You never cared about Nolan. 
 Why do you care about this? 
 I care about being lied to. 
 [scoffs] 
 Says the one who outed Ava. 
 You know what, can you all just shut up so we can do this? 
 I don't blame him for leaving you. 
 When he's not looking put three of these in his drink. 
 He should be telling you his whole life story within the hour. 
 And is that when we come in and beat the sh1t out of him? 
 No, that's when Caitlin dazzles him with her winning personality and makes him feel safe. 
 Like he can tell her the truth. 
 And then we come in, take the camera. 
 [instrumental music] 
 Come on, Dylan, he'll see that the second he walks in. 
 Yeah, well, who died and made you boss, Ava? 
 - Nolan. 
 - Are we sure we wanna do this? 
 Don't you dare, Caitlin! 
 We can't do this without you and you owe me. 
 I made a mistake.. 
 And I'm sorry that it hurt you, but... 
 You said you're willing to do whatever it takes to take your life back. 
 Whatever it takes to stop Nolan  . . 
 Whatever it takes to prove to me that you're sorry. 
 Yes! 
 I did, but we're about to break a lot of laws here! 
 Felonies! 
 Maybe that comes easy to you, though. 
 You know, runs in the family. 
 Screw you. 
 - Ava, I'm sorry. 
 - Don't waste your breath. 
 Let's just stop fighting and focus on what we're doing here. 
 I need things to go back to the way they were. 
 Same, I came to BHU to be laser-focused. 
 I can't nail my audition tonight with this hanging over my head. 
 [dramatic music] 
 We're set. 
 So this is how it's gonna be? 
 After tonight, we're just gonna move on like we're no longer friends? 
 We were never friends. 
 [music continues] 
 [coffee machine whirring] 
 
 
 
 _     Hello, Mona. 
 Hello! 
 - Mind if I sit down? 
 - Oh, please, be my guest. 
 I wanted to get your opinion on something. 
 Yes, you could use a makeover. 
 - About your friend Alison. 
 - Hmm? 
 I'm sure you know she's protecting Dylan, Ava and Caitlin. 
 Why do you think she's doing that? 
 Those three looked like they needed help. 
 - She's very nurturing. 
 - But why those three? 
 - No idea. 
 - Really? 
 - You don't see a pattern? 
 - Of? 
 Isn't this what happened in Rosewood when she was in high school? 
 The way she formed a tight group of people around her? 
 People who were dependent on her? 
 That's not a pattern. 
 That's ancient history. 
 I think it says a great deal about the kind of person she is. 
 That she needs people to be committed to her indebted to her. 
 Nolan Hotchkiss had this little group of his. 
 Ready-made posse, now he's gone and Alison seems to have grafted them on to herself. 
 Ali is a very complex person. 
 It's part of her charm. 
 - Part of yours too. 
 - Huh? 
 I noticed in your file you never told the university what happened on Rue De Ciphler. 
 Am I saying that right? 
 - My French isn't very good. 
 - No, it's not. 
 And no, I didn't tell 'em, it's not relevant. 
 I see... so tell me, do you worry that Alex and Mary Drake may try to find you? 
 [chuckles] 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Oh! 
 But isn't that what got you in trouble with the FBI in the first place? 
 Making connections that aren't there. 
 Letting an obsession with the Jalali case cloud your judgment leading you to take shortcuts? 
 Illegal ones. 
 That's what got you fired isn't it? 
 [instrumental music] 
 It's a funny thing about research, it goes both ways. 
 Excuse me? 
 The chess piece. 
 Good luck charm? 
 Everybody needs a white knight sometime.. 
 But today mine didn't show. 
 [clicks switch] 
 [instrumental music] 
 You've, uh... really done a lot with the place. 
 I'm sorry, they.. 
 They redecorated before I moved in. 
 No. 
 Don't be sorry. 
 It's your home now. 
 Are you sure you don't wanna go see your mom? 
 I don't think she'd ever try and hurt you. 
 No. 
 I just need one night in a place where I feel... safe. 
 [music continues] 
 Yeah. 
 - [dramatic music] 
 - _     Where is he? 
 Yup. 
 Thank you. 
 So, I got them to push my audition to last on the schedule but if I don't leave now I'm not gonna make it. 
 And you're sure Mason knew it was tonight? 
 Yeah, I'm sure, and he's Mr. 
 Punctual so he would never be an hour late. 
 [scoffs] 
 We got played. 
 I wanted this more than anyone, but... 
 I say we call it. 
 [music continues] 
 Alright. 
 Well, then, you guys can go, I'll pack up. 
 What does this mean for the three of us? 
 I don't think you can be friends with people you can never trust.

 Uh, the courante section of Bach's First Cello Suite.

 [door opens] 
 - Hi. 
 - Hope you're hungry. 
 I stopped at your favorite Italian place. 
 Oh, well, that's perfect because I got you your favorite whiskey. 
 Oh.. Cate.. 
 You know, I made a pact with the rest of the team to not drink until Crew season's over. 
 Uh... 
 I just thought since it's you and me I mean, no one's gonna know. 
 Oh, are you asking me to lie? 
 No. 
 Who knew you were so naughty. 
 I thought you did. 
 And I thought I was gonna have to deal with Jeremy. 
 But, uh, guess you took care of that, didn't you? 
 Is it a little chilly in here? 
 I saw some firewood in front, I'll go grab it. 
 And then you and I... can warm this place up together. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [clears throat] 
 [softly chuckles] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Hi. 
 Can I get one pumpkin spice latte please? 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. 
 How'd it go? 
 Honestly, I don't.. 
 I don't really know. 
 I'm sure you killed it. 
 Look, about what I said in the cabin earlier.. 
 Same. 
 Goodbye, Dylan. 
 W-wait, you say that like I'm, I'm never gonna see you again. 
 I'm still gonna come to your fashion show. 
 I made you a promise, alright. 
 I'm-I'm gonna stick to that. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 I understand. 
 - About you and Nolan. 
 - What? 
 Nolan didn't have many ways of expressing himself but he was always really good at passion. 
 Hmm. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And sometimes it seemed that was the only way he could show you how he felt. 
 How he truly felt. 
 And sometimes that passion was.. 
 Was overpowering. 
 And impossible to turn away from. 
 Maybe that's how you can explain it to Andrew. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, we might decide we never wanna leave this place. 
 I like the idea of keeping you all to myself. 
 Alright. 
 I can't have you being cold. 
 [grunts] 
 [intense music] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [crickets chirping] 
 Daddy? 
 Hello, Ava. 
 What a surprise running into you like this. 
 You are a miserable human being. 
 Why? 
 Because I read your file? 
 Because I know your dad called you his beautiful dreamer? 
 Because I know your favorite lullaby? 
 That's the beauty of not wearing the badge anymore. 
 I can play the games however I want. 
 Now, can I have a look in that bag? 
 Or maybe we can work something out between the two of us? 
 You keep the bag and tell me which of your friends killed Nolan Hotchkiss? 
 Or was it your teacher? 
 [dramatic music] 
 [unzips bag] 
 [intense music] 
 What'd you think you were gonna find in there, Dana? 
 A severed hand? 
 I'm not that easy to fool. 
 Then why did you come here? 
 Because you thought that they came back for you? 
 - Isn't that right? 
 - Are you done with that? 
 Offer's still good. 
 You tell me who killed Nolan.. 
 You can forget all about the past. 
 But you don't want to forget the past. 
 You want to bury it along with my family.. 
 And I'm not gonna let you do that. 
 (Dana) 
 I might have it wrong. 
 Maybe Nolan found out about the money and you killed him. 
 [chuckles] 
 Why don't you stay out here for a couple of hours and think about that? 
 Hey! 
 Maybe a bear will eat you. 
 [wolf howling] 
 Okay, I get that he said it was dangerous for Taylor to be here but why are we trusting a crazy guy who lives in the basement? 
 Because I believed him. 
 How long has he even been living down there? 
 Long enough to hear and see an awful lot about this place. 
 Ali, he's the one who wrote the message on the wall! 
 - "They're watching."  
 - Yes! 
 He was trying to warn her, Ali, you need to wake her up and get her out of town. 
 You said it yourself, this isn't Rosewood. 
 No, but it might be just as bad in its own uniquely creepy way. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [sighs] 
 I convinced her to come back here. 
 What am I supposed to tell her? 
 That you made a mistake. 
 Go. 
 (Alison) 
 Taylor? 
 Taylor? 
 - She's gone! 
 - What! 
 Okay, when you say gone, what do you... 
 Missing, Mona! 
 She's not where I left her! 
 Ali.. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [sniffles] 
 [sighs] 
 [music continues] 
 [phone beeps] 
 (Caitlin on voicemail) 
 Ava, it's me, and you were wrong. 
 You can trust me. 
 Look, I've got Mason's phone and I don't wanna bring it to campus, so meet me at the Old Road. 
 Okay? 
 I called Dylan, he's on his way. 
 [car approaching] 
 Got the phone? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Oh, there she is. 
 [engine accelerating] 
 Ava? 
 Caitlin! 
 [intense music] 
 [tires screeching] 
 [sighs] 
 Jesus. 
 Caitlin? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Caitlin! 
 - Yeah, she's breathing, I... 
 - Caitlin! 
 I don't know about    seconds per minute. 
 - She got hit by a car. 
 - Oh, my God. 
 Can you just.. 
 Can you send someone? 
 We're on the Old Road? 
 - Help! 
 - Please as soon as... 
 Somebody help! 
 - What happened? 
 - She got hit by a car. 
 - Somebody help! 
 - On the Old Road... 
 We're on the Old Road. 
 Caitlin? 
 Please help me. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Caitlin? 
 [Ava breathing heavily] 
 [music continues]
