 Previously on Defiance... 
 I was gonna tell you in private. 
 I'm gonna be a grandpa. 
 So did you get to Mendocino, find your mother? 
 Dad, you threw her away. 
 I made a choice. 
 Protect Pilar, the woman I love, or protect her children. 
 What happened to Tommy? 
 Tommy who? 
 [Moaning] 
 You lied to me. 
 You want to talk about lies, Alak? 
 Or should I call you Vizu? 
 We'll talk about this when we get home. 
 Don't touch me. I'm staying here. 
 The pilgrimage can't be interrupted. 
 It's Irzu's will. 
 [Panting] 
 Want to hit the NeedWant when our shift's over,  maybe one get a game of Ivali going,  or try out some of the new talent? 
 [Laughs] 
 Come on, man. It'll be good. 
 Hold it right there. 
 I want my money, fellas. 
 Ah. 
 True gentlemen pay their gambling debts promptly. 
 [Sighs] 
 I didn't expect Cedars to come back like that in the 13th. 
 Scrip, scrip, scrip. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Alarm sounding] 
 Secure the perimeter! 
 I got it, sir. 
 Back there, you two, on me! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Take two men. 
 Set 'em up at the top of the stairs. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Get over here. 
 [Grunts] 
 Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy fellas, easy. 
 Lawkeeper. 
 Thief went that way. 
 Go, go, go. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Must've spooked him. He dropped this. 
 [Electronic humming] 
 Terrasphere. 
 What would somebody want with something like that? 
 I'll take that. 
 Thanks for the assist, Lawkeeper. 
 Glad to help. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Both grunting] 
 You just crossed a line. 
 Let's go. 
 Badge. 
 Whatever. 
 Anything else? 
 Knives. 
 Now. 
 I recommend you not make me raise my voice. 
 So where the hell were you? 
 I needed your help with Kenya. 
 You did fine without me. 
 Not the point. 
 Oh, there's a point? 
 My point is not only can I not trust you when I'm looking at you. 
 I can't even close my eyes anymore without you breaking into an E-Rep garrison and stealing a terrasphere! 
 After everything we went through last year, we're supposed to be a team. 
 Sukar is sick. 
 You lying to me? 
 No. 
 Well, how exactly does a terrasphere cure Sukar? 
 It's complicated. 
 [Scoffs] It's complicated. 
 All right. Let me simplify it for you. 
 Until we get this figured out... 
 Really? 
 I'm not letting you out of my sight. 
 Good morning, Defiance. 
 This is Alak Tarr, back with the best in old and new world tunes ready to jump start your day. 
 Hey, hey, stop. 
 Right now, we're expecting a visit from the Earth Republic's very own Ambassador Tennety. 
 Hey... now we've just collected our millionth ton of gulan... 
 [Moans] of gulanite since the boys in blue set up shop. 
 So please be sure to give our Ambassador Tennety a warm Defiance welcome. 
 You need to stop doing that. 
 I was just playing. 
 Next time, fight me off harder. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Is everything about s*x with you? 
 What's wrong with s*x? 
 Look, I... I don't think I can do this anymore. 
 Wait, what? 
 It's messing up my marriage. 
 I'm going to be a father soon, and I think it's time to put the... the childish things aside. 
 That... that came out wrong. 
 It... it's an old human expression. 
 I could've gotten it wrong. 
 Look, the point is I love my wife. 
 [Sighs] And I mean, there's no future with... with you and me, with this. 
 Is that all I am to you? 
 A s*x toy you can use and throw away. 
 Okay, well, I think you're being a little dramatic. 
 What you are to me, you're a great person with fantastic taste in music. 
 And you'll always have a job right here. 
 You deserve a raise too. 
 5,000 scrip. 
 What? 
 If you're gonna treat me like a whore, you're gonna pay me like one. 
 I'll get the rest to you. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 I'd like you to meet my husbands, Cyrus and Jermaine. 
 They're even more handsome than your last two husbands. 
 Thank you, Madame ex-Mayor. 
 So, Ambassador Tennety, we'll let you wash off some of that road dust, and then we'll go for a tour of the mines. 
 Must you stand so close? 
 Sorry. 
 You're a revelation from any distance, Ambassador. 
 What's with the puss, Amanda? 
 You're bringing me down. 
 Let you carry my bags. 
 Sergeant Poole, bags. 
 Actually, I'd feel much more secure if you carried them. 
 I have a cast. 
 Still. 
 Ambassador Tennety, a quick word if I may. 
 I know you have history with Amanda. 
 I also know you're a liar and a thief, and were you slightly more intelligent, you'd be a mass murderer too. 
 Now, I can prove all these things. 
 Toddle that well-marbled ass back over there and pick up your own damn bags. 
 ♪ Across the storm divide ♪ 
♪ good friends by my side ♪ 
♪ fornicate our way back home ♪ 
 No dirty songs! 
 He's gotta learn sometime. 
 Who said she's a he? 
 [Laughter] 
 All right, you kids, play nice. 
 Thanks, dad. 
 It's good to have the family back together again. 
 Luke's here too, in spirit. 
 So is mom. 
 I wish she'd lived to see her future grandchild. 
 Don't you, dad, wish that she'd lived? 
 Yeah. Me too. 
 Something going on? 
 Quentin, back from the reach. 
 Good to see you. You been working? 
 Yeah, working the mag-lev line. 
 Sorry I... I couldn't get here sooner. 
 I was at the... the radio show. 
 Hi. 
 Catching a cold. 
 Human germs are the worst, right? 
 I was just telling these two how good it feels to have my kids here. 
 Being a dad's the best feeling, Alak. 
 Enjoy it. 
 While you can. 
 One day, your kid'll grow up and see you for what you really are. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Developed a multistep process for refining the gulanite. 
 The extracted crystals are ground into a fine powder then liquefied into the clean-burning, environmentally friendly fuel, petrohol. 
 Ambassador Tennety, congratulations on staying outta jail. 
 You must have one hell of a lawyer. 
 Why is he here? 
 I asked the lawkeeper to escort you, to keep you out of trouble. 
 Just think of me as your honor guard. 
 Would you care to get a helmet? 
 Handcuffs? 
 Yeah. Tough love. 
 With the latest in Earth Republic extraction processing tech, we've manage increase productivity by 20%, decrease the impurity in the final product to the parts per million level. 
 If you come over here, I'll show you. 
 In a standard operation, the miners chip away at the vein a piece at a time. 
 The resulting crystals... 
 That stuff can melt steel. 
 You got any idea what it'd do to you? 
 Well, I wasn't planning on diving in. 
 I'm thinking you drop the camera, cause a splash, singe off those pretty eyebrows of yours. 
 You think my eyebrows are pretty? 
 They're okay. 
 Do I have to stand here? 
 Yes. 
 So, Amanda, how you dealing with the career change? 
 Mayor to hooker, that's quite a fall. 
 Madame, actually. 
 And I find the change invigorating. 
 Yeah, but still. 
 You want me to pull some strings, get you a job at my office? 
 Maybe as a secretary? 
 Thank you. 
 I already work with prostitutes. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What was that? 
 Go. Hey, come on! 
 Hey! Everybody, this way! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Come on! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Come on! Hurry! 
 [Rumbling] 
 Over here! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Over here! 
 [Coughing] 
 Help 'em out. Let's go. Let's go. 
 Take the cuffs off. 
 No way. 
 Where's everybody else? Get down there. 
 The whole tunnel collapsed. 
 You're the only three that got out. 
 Amanda? 
 She's probably dead. 
 Jesus, you're a doll. Chirp Rafe McCawley. 
 Have him come down here right now. 
 We need to start search and rescue. 
 Go. 
 Rafe. Rafe. 
 [Rumbling continues, crashing sounds] 
 [Coughing and grunting] 
 Is anybody here? 
 [Coughing] 
 Anybody? 
 Man : Over here. 
 [Grunts] 
 [All coughing] 
 I'm okay... I think. 
 Ah, sh1t, my hailer's smashed. Yours? 
 I can't find it. 
 Tennety? 
 Tennety! 
 Tennety? 
 [Clang, thud] 
 Tennety. 
 [Panting] 
 She's not breathing. 
 [Blows] 
 [Grunting] 
 Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 No, I... I mean I'm sorry. 
 Really? 
 For what? 
 I said a lot of awful things at that dress-up club. 
 I didn't mean any of it. 
 I... I love you, and you should wear makeup and wigs and whatever makes you happy. 
 And you were right. 
 I lied about working in the family business, and I lied about Skevur. 
 I'm not mad about Skevur. 
 That was _. 
 Where'd you learn that word? 
 My interest in your culture is not all about face paint and dancing in a club. 
 You're right. I'm sorry. 
 Now, is there anything else you want to confess since you're on such a roll? 
 No, I'm... I'm all done. 
 Clean slate. 
 Moving forward. 
 What's goin' on? 
 None of the adjacent tunnels are affected. 
 Amanda, Pottinger, and Tennety are all still down there. 
 Obviously, we need to get to the mayor and the ambassador as soon as humanly possible. 
 Gail, have that roadheader brought in from L-9. 
 Copy that. 
 Q, are you getting any hits? 
 No, there's too much rubble shifting. 
 Why don't we just start drilling? 
 'Cause you'll cause another cave-in and kill 'em! 
 All right, Rafe. What's your plan? 
 I'm workin' on it. 
 [Grunting] 
 Amanda, she's gone. 
 [Grunting] 
 Please. 
 She's gone. 
 [Panting] 
 Come on. 
 Wait, she has a hailer! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Panting] 
 Oh! 
 Okay. They're in this section here. 
 Right. 
 This natural lava vent should take us right there. 
 If it's not caved in. 
 If it's not caved in, but it's safer to drill up here. 
 Well, there's three of them, so they should have 30 minutes worth of air. 
 I'd make it 20. 
 Dad, roadheader's here. 
 Well, get it online. 
 Okay, everybody, let's look alive! 
 [Crack] Ah! 
 [Cracking] 
 Irisa. Irisa! 
 Irisa! 
 [Hailer chirps] 
 Hello? 
 Nolan? 
 Nolan, it's me. 
 Amanda! 
 [Indistinct under static] 
 I'm here. I'm here. 
 Amanda! Amanda? 
 We're buried under rock. 
 Tennety's dead. We're running out of air. 
 [Indistinct under static] 
 All right, if you can hear me, I'm coming. 
 Nolan? Nolan! 
 You got me? You hold on. 
 I'm comin' for you. 
 Line went dead. 
 Well, you hailed Nolan. 
 So? 
 You had absolutely no idea whether he was still alive or not, yet he was the first person you called. 
 [Scoffs] I'm an optimist. What can I say? 
 [Grunting] 
 Obviously. 
 [Continues pounding] 
 Uhh! 
 
 
 
 Tommy. 
 Where have you been? 
 I need your help. 
 The Votans I've been... selecting, they're gathering outside Defiance. 
 They did something to me. 
 What? 
 I don't know. 
 But now whatever's inside me, it's making me sick. 
 It's gonna kill me. 
 Okay, we can fix this. We got to get you to the doctor. 
 No, no, no. No. 
 I need a terrasphere. 
 You're the one that broke in last night, aren't you? 
 There's an endoscientist. 
 She says she can use it to make me normal. 
 It's impossible to steal from the E-Rep. 
 I believe in you. 
 Is that supposed to... convince me? 
 No. 
 But if I'm gonna die, I wanted to remember how that felt. 
 Amanda. Amanda, can you hear me? 
 Pottinger, anyone? 
 Jackson, just easy up on the throttle. 
 Just give me one more gentle hit. 
 All right, pull it out of there. 
 Gently. 
 From here on in, we gotta dig by hand. 
 That lava vent is right on the other side of that wall. 
 All right, come on. Hey! 
 Everybody in here. 
 They got a limited oxygen supply down there, maybe ten minutes. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on [indistinct chatter] 
 Votan trembler. 
 Shook EMC tanks apart during the war. 
 Someone planted this, Rafe, put it in that vent to blow the chamber. 
 What are you trying to say? 
 I'm sayin' our saboteur chose the exact moment two high-ranking E-Rep officials'd be in the chamber, but no miners. 
 Oh, so you think a miner did this. 
 A miner with access to Votan weaponry. 
 You know anybody like that? 
 I'll make some inquiries. 
 We found the shaft! 
 So, who's going in? 
 [Panting] 
 Well, I'm combat certified for jump rigs. 
 All right, that's good enough for me. 
 It's you and me. Let's go. 
 This would be a great honor if we were Sumerian. 
 Mm. 
 Why do you think kings are buried this deep underground? 
 [Groans] Sumerian kings. 
 We're facing death, and you trot out Sumerian kings? 
 Well, they're a damn sight more interesting than British kings. 
 Mm. 
 Richard III. 
 Yeah, all right. He's interesting. 
 George III. 
 Depends... whether you find mental illness intriguing or not. 
 I do. 
 How fortunate for me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm glad I'm not alone right now. 
 I can't imagine what it'd feel like to die alone. 
 Least you're here. 
 To watch you suffocate and die? 
 No, I was rather imagining you being the one to pop off first, a woman being a woman and all. 
 [Both coughing] 
 I'm sorry I was so hard on you when we first met. 
 17. 
 What? 
 17 is the amount of times I asked you to be my advisor. 
 Mm. 
 First time was... weird. 
 Weird? Why weird? 
 Well, you called me Harry Potter. 
 [Chuckles] You don't know... 
 Of course I know who Harry Potter is. 
 I wasn't born in a bloody cave. 
 But you're gonna die in one. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Let's go, Q. 
 Shouldn't we stay here and help? 
 I know you're mad at me, but right now you have to put that aside. 
 I need your help. 
 With what? 
 You'll see. 
 Some baby hydrangeas for my baby and her baby. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 They're beautiful. 
 Oh, you two are so cute. 
 Big plans? 
 Just two girlfriends goin' out to lunch. 
 Ah. 
 Let me grab my purse. 
 Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 You never bought me flowers. 
 You got the rest of your money. 
 I don't want money. I want you. 
 That's never gonna happen. 
 Oh, I hope I don't have too many sulos spritzers at lunch and tell Christie what a hot lay you are. 
 I'm trying to be a good dad. 
 We can have all of the kids that you want. 
 I... don't... love you. 
 Okay, I got it. 
 [Quietly] I am not done fighting. 
 Hey, Christie. 
 Hey. You ready? 
 Mm-hmm. Come on. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Let's go. 
 [Grunting] 
 You all right? 
 [Device bleeps, buzzes] 
 I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm... 
 I'm on my way, so just hold on, okay? 
 You're the strongest person I know. 
 Don't give up on me. All right. 
 You know, she probably can't hear you. 
 Yeah. Doesn't mean I shouldn't try. 
 Come on. 
 Feeling lucky tonight, huh? 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 Oh, no, no, no. One last chance. 
 I'll play. 
 [Laughs] You've been with Alak's whore, Treasure Doll. 
 Treasure Doll, yes. 
 Skinny, but enthusiastic. 
 You should try her. 
 I'd snap her like a twig. 
 She's becoming a problem. 
 For whom? 
 For the family. 
 Christie won't tolerate infidelity. 
 So... 
 You want Treasure Doll removed from the playing field. 
 And you've come to me. 
 Why? 
 Can't trust your own men these days? 
 I'll pay you 300. 
 Money means nothing to me. 
 I have all I need right here, an embarrassment of riches. 
 What then? 
 Reconciliation. 
 I move back to my home, our bed. 
 Mm. 
 Your price is too high. 
 I'll gut the little whore myself. 
 What is all this? 
 Weapons. 
 Enough to drive the Earth Republic out of Defiance. 
 And there's one missin'. 
 I need your help to make this stuff disappear, or else people are gonna think that I... 
 What? 
 You never could look me in the eye when you were hidin' somethin'. 
 Oh, please tell me it wasn't you. 
 Quentin. 
 I had to. For mom. 
 What the hell did she have to do with this? 
 I couldn't leave her in that place. 
 The only way the Votanis Collective would release her is if I paid ransom. 
 Was killing Ambassador Tennety part of this ransom? 
 She was spearheading some kind of military push into South America. 
 Politics. 
 Is that all you have to say? 
 What do you want me to say? 
 That I'm an assassin? 
 Don't you dignify what you did! 
 There was innocent people in that mine. 
 Amanda was down there! 
 You got no right to judge me! 
 I did it to save my mother! 
 My mother, who you just tossed away! 
 Aah! 
 Oof. 
 [Tool clatters on floor] 
 It's okay. 
 Don't worry. 
 They'll be here soon. 
 There's barely any air left. 
 The cave is filling with carbon dioxide. 
 Every breath we take is killing us a little faster. 
 This explanation alone... killing us faster. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, it's okay to admit it. 
 Admit what? 
 Your feelings for Amanda. 
 It doesn't have to affect you and me having s*x. 
 If I did have feelings for Amanda, it'd definitely be a problem. 
 I'm a one-woman kind of a guy... except when I'm not. 
 Anyway, she pushed me away. 
 Yeah, but you let her. 
 She's a big girl. 
 Maybe she was testing. 
 Maybe she wanted to see if you would fight for her. 
 [Gasps] 
 Maybe we should stop having s*x with each other. 
 Maybe we should. 
 Ahh... 
 [Labored] They're gonna break through any second, and we're gonna have all the air we can handle. 
 Amanda... 
 They're not gonna get here in time. 
 We're not gonna make it. 
 But maybe one of us can. 
 Now, I need you to listen to me. 
 I need you to listen to me very carefully, because you aren't gonna find this easy. 
 But I need you to pick up that rock there... and kill me. 
 You're delirious. 
 You'll survive a lot longer with only one set of lungs left. 
 Yeah, it's the only way. 
 Now pick up the rock. 
 Do you hear yourself talk? 
 Let me make this sacrifice for you. 
 Let me do one decent thing with my miserable life. 
 You're no worse... [breathing hard] than a lot of people I know. 
 I am a monster. 
 You have no idea the things I've done. 
 All right, this is our spot. 
 We don't have much time. 
 [Labored breathing] 
 Ah! 
 Det cord. 
 Detonator. 
 Clagger. 
 All right. 
 [Panting] 
 Cord. 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. All right. 
 Okay, go. 
 All right. Got it? 
 We go on three. 
 One, two, three. 
 Amanda! Hey! 
 Amanda! 
 Amanda, hey. Hey. Here. 
 I need you to breathe through here. 
 That's it. Take a breath. 
 Good. And another one. 
 [Coughs] Niles. 
 Hey. 
 Niles. 
 Take him first. 
 No, no, no. We need to get you out. 
 Take him first. 
 Okay. 
 [Amanda coughing, Nolan murmuring] 
 All right. One, two, three, go. 
 [Background chatter] 
 Lawkeeper. Glad you're okay. 
 So am I. 
 [Groans] 
 Who hit him? 
 His son, Quentin. 
 That's who hailed us. 
 He says his father confessed to blowing up the mines. 
 Things got physical. 
 You're sayin' your dad confessed. 
 Yeah. 
 He was tryin' to kill the ambassador. 
 He asked me to come here and help him get rid of these weapons. 
 I said no. 
 I'm no terrorist. 
 Did Amanda get out okay? 
 She and Pottinger are fine. 
 Ambassador Tennety wasn't quite so lucky. 
 This as bad for me as it looks? 
 Your son is over there telling anyone who will listen that you were the one who set the bomb. 
 That's what he's sayin'? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay then. 
 Rafe, if there's anything I need to know about Quentin's story, now's the time to come clean. 
 Nope. 
 You got me dead to rights. 
 I killed the ambassador for, uh... payback. 
 [Scoffs] Payback. 
 For Hyatt and Josef and my mines, my house, for everything. 
 Tell Amanda I'm sorry. 
 You sure that's the way you want to play this. 
 Do what you gotta do. 
 Rafe McCawley, you're under arrest. 
 Dad? 
 Dad? 
 Okay, okay, okay. Let's go. 
 Let's go. Come on. 
 I love you. 
 Rafe McCawley shows his teeth at long last. 
 Hard to believe. 
 Really hard to believe. 
 I'm not sure I do. 
 Well, you push a man hard enough long enough, you take away his livelihood, his dignity, it gets a lot easier to believe. 
 What I said down in the mines, it's all true. 
 What's he talkin' about? 
 What'd he say to you in the mines? 
 Nothing. 
 Niles, wait up. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hi, mom. 
 [Crying] 
 Oh, it is... so good to be out. 
 The Votanis Collective... did they treat you badly? 
 I had to join 'em on a bunch of missions, killed some people. 
 I am so sorry. 
 I am so sorry they made you do that. 
 But now that I am free, we can be a family again. 
 A family! 
 [Laughs] 
 Except for dad. 
 What do you mean? 
 I was smart. I set him up. 
 Used the weapons he's been receiving from the V.C. 
 I gave him this big speech about how I did it all to rescue you, and he felt so guilty, he actually took the blame. 
 He's out of our life. 
 That's a good thing. 
 Isn't it? 
 You really think your father took the blame because you outsmarted him. 
 I wasn't even there, and I can tell you exactly what happened. 
 Your father put the well-being of his child before his own, the same thing he did when he sent me away. 
 He did what was necessary. 
 [Sighs] 
 Such a stupid child. 
 Well, come on. 
 I knew you'd come. 
 Here it is. 
 So how long does your scientist need this thing? 
 The sooner we can get back to the armory, the better. 
 [Both grunting] 
 You're going to kill me? 
 I'm gonna save you. 
 No! 
 [Screaming] Noooo! 
 Aah! [Gags] 
 [Crowd chanting "Become"] 
 [Panting] 
 It's beginning.
