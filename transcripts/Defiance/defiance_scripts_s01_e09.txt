 Previously on  Defiance... 
 It's going to be a beautiful wedding. 
 Sorry I had to cuff you, Ambassador. 
 I want everything headquarters has on Amanda Rosewater. 
 This is Connor Lang. 
 Where she was born, who her friends and family are, and every man she's ever slept with and what she's having for dinner tomorrow night. 
 Quentin! 
 Shut up! 
 If you really want to know what happened to your mother, come and see me. 
 I really need a doctor. 
 [Gasping] 
 Get your gloves on! 
 We've got ourselves a plague. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Music playing on boom box] 
 Stop! 
 Good morning, Defiance. 
 This is Alak Tarr on Raider Radio, broadcasting from the top of the arch. 
 Now, I've been asked to pass on some important information about the contagion. 
 Surgical masks! 
 It is viral hemorrhagic fever. 
 Good for most diseases. 
 Commonly known as the I-rath flu. 
 Surgical masks, get 'em now. 
 There ya are. 
 Humans and Irathients both carry the bug, but Irathients don't get sick. 
 So if you're Human or Irathient, best thing you can do is stay indoors, stay calm, and avoid contact with others. 
 Now, this flu spreads through skin-to-skin contact, so while gloves are helpful, breathing masks are a waste of your money. 
 Surgical masks! 
 So don't bother to spend your money on a... 
 How about you? 
 Surgical masks! 
 [Coughing] 
 Just try to remain calm and avoid all physical contact. 
 Now remember, if you're feeling like  shtako,  report to the triage tents on Bexar. 
 Oh, my God. This is horrible. 
 [Coughing, indistinct conversations] 
 How many? 
 6 dead, 21 sick. 
 Somebody help him! 
 He needs help! 
 [Baby crying] 
 What can we do? 
 Contain the bug, keep the sick comfortable, and hope a cure arrives. 
 Arrives from where? 
 There was an outbreak in the bay area. 
 A former colleague, Eren Niden, spent months working on an anti-viral. 
 If we are lucky, one of the independent outposts will relay the message to San Francisco. 
 Doctor. Doctor, I'm losing her! 
 [Choking] 
 [Violent coughing] 
 Are you sweating? 
 It's hot.

 Hi. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Drinking buddies. 
 I really want to know. 
 Why is there an Earth Republic Garrison camped outside my town? 
 Well, this bug has migrated across the country in a matter of days. 
 I think they're trying to prevent it from heading east. 
 A bit late for that. 
 Our patient zero was traveling with an I-rath caravan headed east. 
 He was intercepted and destroyed. 
 They're imposing a quarantine. 
 They're serious. 
 To prevent the spread of this contagion, they are more than happy to let every Human in this town die, myself included. 
 And when we're all dead, they're gonna roll in here and they're gonna take this town over. 
 And the gulanite mines. 
 We could put together some weapons, some mining vehicles, probably bust through that barricade. 
 And what, risk spreading infection throughout the rest of north America? 
 Look, Earth Republic may be a bunch of cold-hearted opportunists, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. 
 So what, you're saying there's no hope? 
 Mayor, the town council's asking for you. 
 There's always hope, and it's our job to remind people. 
 Let's go. 
 Well... 
 [Grunts] 
 Weren't you stupid letting that one get away? 
 Yeah, I was. 
 Hmm. 
 She's wrong about the hope thing. 
 We're all gonna be dead very soon. 
 So, wanna get drunk? 
 Nah, I'm on the clock. 
 Suit yourself. 
 [All shouting in native language] 
 Dirty I-Raths! 
 Leave an take your desease with you! 
 Dirty I-Raths! 
 Back away, Haints! 
 No. 
 Agh! 
 [Growls] 
 Go to your homes before you're infected. 
 We're immune to your disease. 
 Not if I bite you. 
 [Shudders] 
 [Castithans murmuring in native language] 
 Rathus. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Little Wolf. 
 Nizar. 
 [All speaking native language] 
 That hurt my hand. 
 You'll live. 
 How is Sukar? 
 Still sleeping the deep sleep. 
 We came here for more of his medicine and supplies. 
 Now Earth Republic soldiers tell us we can't leave town. 
 The great sickness has come. 
 If it spreads, I fear Humans will once again hunt and kill us. 
 Little Wolf, will you pray with us? 
 It's my honor to pray with the family. 
 Ha. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Dog barking] 
 16 people dead and... 
 And what? 
 Another 30 laid up in the tents? 
 At the rate we're going, we're never going to survive the E-Rep quarantine. 
 The lawkeepers are keeping everyone inside to contain the spread. 
 Yeah, well, what about the Irathients? 
 They are the carriers. 
 So are Humans. 
 It's not the same thing. 
 It's time you Humans understood the truth about the Irathient race. 
 They carry diseases like anyone else but rarely get sick themselves. 
 It's true. 
 That's not true. 
 Now, this has given them a reputation amongst other Votan races as unclean, as plague carriers. 
 This reputation may be rooted in bigotry, but it's also based in truth. 
 There is a reason the Irathients keep to themselves. 
 There is a reason that my people shun them. 
 Yeah, a good reason. 
 This town is better than that. 
 Irathient carriers walk around for weeks, infecting others, showing no symptoms. 
 That's how this bug gets spread, and it's gotta stop. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 Confine the I-raths, confine the disease. 
 We put 'em down in the mines temporarily. 
 We've asked them to stay inside voluntarily. 
 You can't trust I-raths. 
 And when did a spirit rider ever take an order? 
 Now Rafe has the right idea. 
 I agree. 
 Ozin, get your head out of Datak's ass and listen. 
 [Giggles] 
 All of you. 
 Now, it took a long time to get the Spirit Riders to trust us. 
 We have peace. 
 Now, if we start imprisoning healthy Irathients because they might be carriers, we're gonna have an armed uprising to deal with on top of everything else. 
 Amanda, I have children. 
 Sending the Irathients to the mines, temporarily, would protect them against bigots. 
 It'd be a kindness, really. 
 Oh... 
 We'd be keeping them safe. 
 Safe? 
 Well, let's put it to a vote, shall we? 
 [All chanting in native language] 
 Hear us Idanyu of the flame. 
 There is a storm among our brothers. 
 Calm the wind and dry the rain. 
 Stand us once again. 
 [Trucks rumbling] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Vehicle doors opening and closing] 
 Irisa. 
 Can I come up? 
 So you're here to arrest us. 
 Well, it's more like sequestering. 
 All right, it's a quarantine. 
 We're not sick. 
 But you could be carrying the virus. 
 Irisa, don't look at me like that. 
 You know it's possible. 
 It's a hard time, and you have a duty to keep the peace. 
 I bet you didn't tell Nolan you were planning this. 
 No. 
 Did you really think I'd agree to let you lock me up? 
 Lock them up like animals? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'd appreciate your cooperation. 
 I don't require it. 
 [Grunts, screams] 
 [All grunting] 
 [All speaking native language] 
 I'll slow them down. 
 Go around town, gather up our pwople and get them to safety.

 Rathus, get him out here. 
 Come on brother, She knows what she's doing. 
 Come on. 
 Don't make this any harder on yourself. 
 I won't.

 Hands off her!

 Little dingbat pushed me off the damn roof. 
 You were supposed to let me tell Nolan before you did anything. 
 Yeah, well, I lost track of time. 
 You let her go, Rafe, or I start shooting people. 
 Yeah, well, you won't get far. 
 Nobody wants to hurt the kid, but I will if you don't put that damn Cannon away. 
 Think about it, Nolan. 
 Every Human in town is afraid of dying. 
 People are desperate. 
 If you're Irathient, the best place to be is out of sight. 
 Tell your father it's okay. 
 She's not a parrot. 
 Tell him. He needs to hear it from you. 
 I don't like these odds. 
 Put up the gun. 
 I'm not gonna let you down. 
 Not again. 
 Put up the gun. 
 All right, let's move.

 Nolan. 
 Are you crazy? 
 My daughter is down a hole with a bunch of slag-head miners who think she's typhoid Mary. 
 Look, I know it's hard. 
 I opposed the council on this, and I was overruled. 
 I have to accept it, which means you have to accept it. 
 Yeah? Well, Irisa and I have a rule too. 
 Rule? What rule? We live or die together. 
 She'll be expecting me to come for her. 
 She's not. Are you delusional? 
 You're sweating. Nolan... 
 So what, all right? 
 It's hot, and I'm under pressure. 
 You're sweating too. 
 This is about Sukar. 
 What? 
 Yeah, you feel guilty, she hasn't forgiven you, so you're gonna prove what a great dad you are by getting a lot of people killed. 
 Get out of my way, Amanda.

 Hate to interrupt a moment, but...

 Why would I want to be awake? 
 'Cause we're going on a little road trip, sweetheart.

 Stage one is coughing and sweating, which we've all heard about.

 Very well. 
 When your father came to Defiance, you and your brother were small boys. 
 Christie was just a baby. 
 Your mother, Pilar, was sick. 
 In the old world, the name for it was bi-polar, but that's meaningless here. 
 When the world fell apart, they stopped making her medicine. 
 Well, your father was desperate. 
 Now, I was a quartermaster in the war and knew how to procure, well, challenging items. 
 With the help of Datak Tarr, we were able to keep poor, fragile Pilar on the straight and narrow with old world lithium. 
 All was well. 
 The McCawley family was happy. 
 Well, gradually, over time, and inevitably, the medicine stopped working. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, it's not surprising. 
 It was more than a decade old.

 I don't need to tell you that in this world we live in, there's no place for the fragile.

 Your father came down the stairs and found her buttering your breakfast toast with rat poison. 
 Your father would've shot her on the spot, but I intervened. 
 Oh, we were having an affair at the time. 
 I knew that the guilt of murdering the mother of his children would eat him alive and destroy any chance of happiness he and I might have had. 
 So our relationship did not survive, but against all odds, Pilar did.

 Ah, I'll sleep when I'm dead.

 The Irathient internment was a terrible tragedy. 
 We came through it together. 
 There were so many acts of bravery and kindness. 
 But I'd like to single out for you two people in particular, Lawkeeper Nolan and Connor Lang, who braved the badlands to bring the cure to us all. 
 Ambassador Lang will be missed. 
 I'd also like to thank Datak Tarr for stepping in while I was sick and rescuing our precious medicine. 
 This was a frightening time for us all. 
 The stakes were high, and we learned a bit about ourselves. 
 I certainly did. 
 If you were to ask people in this town, they might say I'm a scoundrel, selfish. 
 I did not ask to lead you through this recent crisis. 
 I had no interest taking on that burden. 
 And quite frankly, I wished to be left alone. 
 But my lovely wife wouldn't hear of it. 
 She taught me that I could not ignore the pain I saw in the eyes of my fellow townspeople. 
 My wife helped me understand community, that there is no greater honor... 
 Than service. 
 No, there's not. 
 Thank you, Dat... 
 There is no greater honor than giving back... 
 Why is my mic off? 
 To the people of this town. 
 [Inaudible] 
 And it is for this reason that I am renouncing my former ways and throwing my hat into the ring as candidate for mayor of Defiance. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Oh,  yenkitso. 
 Amanda, I do hope this town is big enough to withstand a little healthy competition. 
 Of course, Datak. 
 I look forward to the challenge. 
 It'll be fun. 
 I feel this town deserves leadership that's sympathetic to the needs of our Votan population. 
 Never again will we tolerate the incarceration of our Irathient brothers and sisters. 
 [Groans] 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 These things will kill you. 
 And far more efficiently than a poorly planned Volge attack. 
 [Sighs] 
 That was Birch's idea. 
 Mm hmm, and was triggering a radiation leak in old St. Louis also Birch? 
 Mistakes were made. You two are reckless and stupid. 
 You always have been. 
 That's why I stopped working with you. 
 He's dead, you know. Birch. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I guess that makes you and me the last two left of the old gang. 
 Oh, come back and work with me. 
 I can't do this alone. 
 I'm pretty certain I'm being watched. 
 Sorry. 
 I'm not interested. 
 You sure about that? 
 I finally got my hands on one of the  kolovan. 
 Which one? 
 The golden knot. 
 Where is it? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Nicolette, destroy it immediately. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 You're crazy. You know that? 
 Come be crazy with me. 
 Together, we can reshape this planet. 
 Reshape or destroy? 
 You can't create without destroying. 
 I thought you would have figured that out by now, doctor.
