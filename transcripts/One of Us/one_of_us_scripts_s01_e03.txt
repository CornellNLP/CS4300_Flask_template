 They found your girl -- Grace. She was murdered, Bill. 
 Her and Adam Elliot. 
 It's my son. My little boy was murdered. 
 I need to get to Braeston -- finish something that I started. 
 One of us did this. 
 One of us right here. 
 Our prime suspect is Lee Walsh. Do any of you know him? 
 Sorry. 
 We have to get rid of the body. 
 What about the car? 
 75 sheets. 
 Those sheets of acid you got me, the Papa Smurfs, they're flying off the shelves. 
 Come down, join the fun. 
 [Join the party, come on.] 
 I've found the money, sweetheart, for the operation. 
 I knew that you would. 
 I'm going to tell the police what happened. 
 I found something last night... in Rob's room. 
 Robert Elliot? 
 Yeah. How can I help you? 
 This isn't a call we wanted to make... what with everything you must be going through right now. 
 DS told us you're the boy's brother -- off the news. 
 So? 
 Graham Harris. 
 We received a complaint. He says you've been following him. 
 And he's complained? About me? 
 He wanted us to come round and have a word before taking it any further. 
 What do you mean "take it further"? 
 If you carry on, you could be liable to prosecution. 
 We understand, officer... 
 Are you serious? 
 Mm. Mm. 
 Do you know what he did? 
 Rob, don't. 
 We know about the allegations, and we know it didn't get to court. 
 What went on there, that's CID, that's none of my business. 
 You want my advice, try and leave it behind you. 
 That's your advice? Leave it behind me? 
 Calm down, calm down, calm down. 
 After what he did?! 
 Rob, stop it! 
 Look, you're going to have to calm down, OK? 
 I'll stay away. 
 I'll stay away. 
 I'll show you out. 
 Thank you. 
 Take your coat off. Relax. 
 I'm fine. 
 Come on. 
 Really. I'm fine. 
 Have a drink. 
 It's too early for me. 
 Suit yourself. 
 I know better than to try and make Moira Douglas do anything she doesn't want to do. 
 I only came here as a courtesy, Alastair. 
 It's like I said on the phone, I can't do this any more. 
 It's done. 
 I burned your letters. 
 Ever since Gracie... 
 I... 
 It made me think about my family. 
 If they knew what I was doing... 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's torn us all apart, hasn't it? 
 Ever since Gracie. 
 It's like that storm just... ripped us all to pieces. 
 How do you put the pieces back together? 
 Maybe I will have that drink. 
 Hello? 
 You picked up. 
 What do you want, Dad? 
 How are you doing? You and Rob? 
 Don't. 
 Don't pretend like you suddenly care. 
 Adam and Grace have been gone for three days now. 
 I wanted to call earlier. 
 I... just didn't know how to... 
 'What do you want?' 
 Honestly? 
 I don't know. 
 I've been driving all night. I was coming up to Braeston to see you all. 
 I stopped off here... for a break, keep my eyes open, and... never left. Just... been sitting here. 
 I never knew the sunrise on the M8 could be so beautiful. 
 What do you want me to say? 
 'You don't have to say anything.' 
 Look, Dad, turn around and go home. 
 We don't need you. We've managed this long by ourselves. 
 I miss him, too, Claire. 
 He WAS my son. 
 'Was he? What music did he like, then? What was the last film he saw?' 
 What job did he not get a few months ago that he was desperate to get? 
 It's my fault, Claire. 
 It's all my fault. 
 Hi, darling. 
 Hey, sweetheart. What is it? 
 What's the matter? 
 It's nothing. 
 Really, you didn't have to come up, I'm fine. 
 Just tell me. 
 Er... 
 Well, a friend of mine from school... she's dead. 
 She jumped off her balcony. 
 Oh, dear, her poor family. 
 And she, she took something, and she sent a picture to her friends saying that she was going to try it. 
 They made it look like a Smurf. It's sick. 
 I feel like I should send a text to her brother. 
 What would you say? 
 [No-one knows what to do, it's just so horrible...] 
 Mum? 
 Mummy? Are you OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm OK. 
 Yeah, fine, sweetheart. 
 Oh, darling, I'm so sorry. 
 'Hi. This is Claire. Leave me a message. 
 The Beatles. He loved the Beatles. 
 A Day In The Life. 
 That was his favourite song. 
 Well, it was when he was younger, anyway. 
 I'm really... truly sorry, Claire. 
 You have to believe that. 
 You didn't have to come. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Sorry, I know it's freezing, but do you mind if I finish? 
 Go ahead. 
 Are you all right? You look terrible. 
 Thanks. 
 No, I mean it, Claire. Have you slept? 
 There's nothing you could have done about Dad, OK? 
 Do you really think if you'd gone to meet him, things would have been any different? 
 We'll never know. 
 It was selfish. He was always selfish. 
 He was still our dad. 
 I'm going to go and sit in the car. 
 I won't be a sec. 
 Are you OK? 
 I've been wanting to talk to you for days, but I had to look you in the eye. 
 We found it, Rob. 
 Mum found the knife. 
 Knife? What are you talking about? 
 The bloodstained knife you hid in your bedroom, in the fireplace. 
 Mum found it. 
 And... 
 I threw it to the bottom of Glenarvon Loch because I didn't want to lose the only brother I have left. 
 I helped cover up that man's murder, so the least you can do is admit it, admit you killed Lee Walsh. 
 Claire, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Don't lie to me. 
 I'm not. 
 It was in your room, Rob. Mum found it in your room. 
 It wasn't me, I never hid anything there. 
 Like being in a slalom, driving on these roads. 
 How is she -- Maddy? 
 As you'd expect. 
 Bloody tragedy, that girl, eh? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Huh. 
 What? 
 Morning. 
 Good morning. What is it? 
 I... I just wanted to let you know, at the funeral, there will be CID officers, just to keep an eye on things in case Walsh shows up. 
 They'll be plainclothes. 
 Right. 
 Well, thank you. Um... 
 And thank you very much for releasing the... the bodies so quickly. 
 It means a lot to us. 
 Mrs Elliot, I heard about your ex-husband. I'm... 
 I'm very sorry about what happened. 
 Well... 
 .. he always managed to let the world get on top of him. 
 Did you know Adam called him while he was on his honeymoon? 
 Are you sure? 
 Phone records showed a call. It seemed unusual. 
 Your daughter said nobody spoke to him. 
 But if anybody was going to give Peter a chance, it would be Adam, I suppose. 
 What's any of this got to do with what's happened? 
 Why are you here? 
 Just tying up loose ends. I wanted to ask you... 
 When I saw you that day, you said... you hadn't left the house all morning. 
 But here, in this picture, you're over at the Douglas farm. 
 Still wearing your slippers. 
 Oh, right. Yeah, well, I mean... 
 Listen, I was all over the place, you know, I mean, I'd just lost my son. You know, I wasn't... 
 I wasn't exactly, um... 
 I understand. 
 Yeah, I mean... 
 It was... early and we couldn't sleep, so all of us went for a walk. 
 It was a tradition that the two families... 
 We used to do it together, you know? 
 So I... I suppose we did it to honour Adam and Grace. 
 Where did you walk? 
 Oh. Well, we just... 
 We met at the barn or near the barn, and we, er... 
 We just circled the property. We, um... 
 Down at the back at the foot of the hill and then round. 
 Why does it matter? 
 And the slippers? 
 As I said, I wasn't with it. 
 There was a car when I was last here. 
 Under some tarpaulin, on the left just past the fork there. 
 Oh, Rob's. That was Rob's. Yeah, he took it to be scrapped. 
 Just a piece of old junk, really. It's... um... 
 Detective, what do you want? 
 I'm very sorry to have disturbed you. 
 We'll let you know if we get anything on Walsh. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Oh! 
 We actually came by to ask Mrs Elliot a few questions about her ex. 
 Aye, it's an awful thing. Awful. 
 And while we're here, there was something I was going to ask you. 
 Mrs Elliot said that you all went for a walk together the other day and I just wanted to check with you where it was that you went. 
 It was that day that we came to see you. 
 Why does it matter where we walked? 
 Dad! 
 Not now, Jamie. 
 No, Dad, you need to... 
 Jamie, go back inside. I won't ask you again! 
 Now go on! 
 You were saying... Where you walked that morning...? 
 Aye. Er... 
 Right, let me think. Er... 
 We... We met at the stile up there between our two houses and then came down by the barn. 
 Then round the house there and up the path between the fields. 
 Why? 
 Just clearing up a few things. 
 I'm going to leave you in peace. 
 I don't understand -- what's this about? 
 I'm just trying to be thorough. 
 If you can, er, think of anything that might help, please get in touch. 
 Tenner for your thoughts? 
 You heard it. 
 Both of them said they went for that walk in completely different directions. 
 Yeah. I heard it. But... 
 If it's a family tradition like she said, that's not something they'd get wrong. 
 Between that and the car that was there the morning we came... 
 You still think we're wasting our time? 
 You think Walsh made it here that night? 
 What would you do... if the man who murdered your children ended up on your doorstep that same day? 
 Call the police. 
 That's easy to say, but put yourself in their shoes. 
 Really put yourself in them. 
 You don't have a clue what you'd do. 
 When it comes down to it, people are capable of doing things they never thought they could do. 
 Your mum ironed it. 
 Where is she? 
 I don't know. I think I heard her go out, and Claire went back to work. 
 It'll all be over tomorrow, at least. 
 That's what they say, isn't it? 
 You say goodbye to people at funerals. 
 Some sh1t about closure. 
 Huh. 
 Wouldn't it be nice if that were true? 
 Anna, what's going on with you? 
 What does that mean? 
 It means... 
 Since everything happened, you've barely spoken a word to me. 
 There's nothing left to say. 
 What happened... happened. 
 You can talk to me. You can trust me. 
 I know. 
 Haven't I always tried to protect you? 
 I don't need protecting. 
 Is there something you want to tell me? 
 What are you getting at? 
 I'm getting at you being honest with me. 
 You hid it in the fireplace, didn't you? 
 What? 
 The knife. 
 The bloody knife that Mum found, the one that slit Lee Walsh's throat. 
 There was no-one else in the room with me, Anna. 
 Look, I'm not angry. Look at me. 
 I just want you to tell the truth. 
 Oh! 
 Just tell me. 
 It's been a week now. 
 We all need is to keep our nerve, keep silent... 
 But what if they come in and search the place? What if they find the... 
 They need more than suspicion to get a search warrant, Louise. 
 You need to calm down. 
 (OK.) 
 Don't let it get the better of you, Louise. For all our sakes. 
 OK. Right? 
 Yeah. 
 A word, Bill? 
 Aye. 
 Louise Elliot OK? 
 Her world's falling apart at the seams. 
 You heard what happened to Peter. 
 Aye. Can't say I'll be losing any sleep over it, mind. 
 A good man, but a weak one. 
 What brings you here, Alastair? 
 I gave you time off. 
 I want more. 
 More money. 
 You came to me and asked me for what you were owed. 
 I gave you what I had. 
 I'm sorry, but I need the money. 
 Sal and me... 
 Ah. So this is Sal's idea, is it? 
 This is a woman who couldn't be bothered to send as much as a postcard when we lost wee Grace. 
 No, listen, we were just... Sal and me were... 
 So this is what it comes to, is it, Alastair? 
 This is what it boils down to, huh? 
 30 years of friendship. 
 It's nothing I haven't worked for. You know that. 
 I'm not Peter Elliot. 
 I'm not a weak man. 
 And I'm not going to let you bleed me dry. 
 You've lied along with the rest of us. 
 You've had every opportunity to go to the police and tell them what happened. 
 And I'm willing to take my chances that you'll continue to keep your mouth shut, to save your own hide. 
 Because I know you, Alastair, and that's the mistake you've made. 
 You see, I just don't understand all this Facebooking nonsense. 
 How can you have a proper relationship with someone so far away? 
 Well... 
 Something like this. 
 Oh, my, I don't need to see that! 
 That's the first time I've heard you laugh since it happened. 
 I almost feel guilty. 
 What's wrong? 
 My brother Rob did something... 
 No, erm... It doesn't matter. I shouldn't. 
 Whatever it is you're carrying around, you will have to talk to someone. 
 You should talk to that boy Sam about it. 
 You'll feel better, trust me. 
 But tell him to put some trousers on. 
 Nobody needs to see that, horrible little chicken legs... 
 You old bat! 
 Right, you're going in a ditch! 
 Oh, no! 
 There's nothing in the financials as far as I can see. 
 Anything in the phone records? 
 Not really. 
 Just the calls from the hotel phone to Adam's dad and a few from his mobile to Bill Douglas. 
 Could be Grace. Calling her dad. 
 Absolutely nothing to tie any of them to Lee Walsh. 
 Weird. 
 Yeah, Andrew, it's weird. 
 My ex hated dogs. 
 But when one come up to her on the street, she'd stroke it and smile at the owner, "Oh, nice boy," you know? 
 What? 
 People do weird things, is my point. 
 There's not always a neat explanation. 
 Maybe Walsh was just a nutjob with a psycho thing for Grace Elliot. 
 Goodnight. 
 Night. 
 
 
 
 'Here he is. Any words for the bride and groom?' 
 'Er...' 'Words of wisdom?' 
 'Well, we already wrote something in the card. It's in the card...' 
 'We wish you the best, both of you.' 
 'Can't say fairer than that. You look wonderful.' 
 'Ah. Mother.' 
 Hey. 
 I just got off the phone with Leah. 
 Dad's new wife. 
 Jesus. 
 Yeah. She seemed quite nice. 
 Wanted to talk about arrangements and stuff but... 
 Then she said... 
 She asked me why -- like, why he did it. 
 As if I know. 
 I just keep thinking maybe he knew something about what happened to Adam and Grace. 
 Claire. 
 The way he was talking when he called me and he was coming up here. 
 It sounded like he wanted to tell me something. 
 And on his honeymoon, Adam calls him. 
 Why, after all these years? 
 Claire, we've been down this road. 
 We hardly knew Dad, not any more. 
 What if he was the reason? 
 Stop. 
 OK. Just stop. 
 We'll drive ourselves mad thinking like this. 
 Now where's Mum? We're going to be late. 
 I'll get her. 
 Mum? 
 Mum... 
 We need to go soon, we can't be late. 
 I know, I know. 
 I was... trying to decide what to wear, and then I realised it doesn't bloody matter. 
 Adam doesn't give a damn whether I wear the stupid dress or the skirt or the... 
 He doesn't give a damn whether I go to his funeral at all. 
 Maybe not. 
 But I do. 
 Here, here. 
 [It's, you know...] It must be stress or something... 
 I still can't believe it. 
 I know... 
 I know she's gone. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Does that make any sense? 
 They say when you have a limb amputated, you can still feel it. 
 And even though it's not there, you can't shake the sensation that it is. 
 And the worst thing is that it itches. 
 It itches and it burns and it hurts, and you can't do a thing about it. 
 It's your brain, apparently. 
 It's wired to think that your arm or your leg is still there, and it can't accept that it isn't. 
 It's like the world doesn't make sense without it. 
 Screw this. 
 Don't suppose any of you has a charger on you? 
 Get that squatter escaping up the stairs! 
 What is it? 
 They found me, brother. 
 Did you go the garage? 
 Because I told you I would bring you what you needed! 
 Nah, nah, some crackheads must have seen me on the estate. 
 Where are they? 
 I think I lost them. 
 Ah, sh1t. 
 Chuck the phone, OK? I will sort this. 
 Trust me, you will walk. 
 Just keep your mouth shut, OK. 
 Now chuck the phone -- now. 
 Maddy, can you get that? 
 I'll get it! 
 Who was it? 
 Maddy, go to your room. 
 Why? 
 Just go. 
 Nice to meet you, sweetheart. 
 Me and your mum are going to talk a wee bit of business. 
 High five. 
 OK. 
 What in the hell do you think you're doing? 
 Relax, Grandma, I only pay housecalls if I've got a good reason. 
 My boy got hauled in. 
 And much as I like to think I'm a great boss, he's going to start singing my name. 
 What do you expect me to do? 
 I can't stop your dealer talking. 
 No. Well, I wouldn't have thought so anyway. 
 But me and you, we're in this together, like, aren't we? 
 That stuff you gave me, that killed a lass. 
 So... you've got responsibilities here. 
 That girl stole the LSD from her brother, that's his responsibility. 
 Not mine. 
 Are you serious? 
 If I hadn't sold you those tabs, you'd have found them from somewhere else and that girl would still be dead. 
 OK. 
 All I'm saying is, it's in your interest to make sure I'm not arrested. 
 I'm going to go to ground, lay low. 
 But if I get picked up and put in a cage... 
 .. then you sure as sh1t are, too. 
 Say goodbye to your daughter for me. 
 Right, OK, I gotta go, bye. 
 Hey, I was just about to call you. 
 What's happened? 
 I take it you've not checked your e-mails. 
 We both received one this morning from Jamie Douglas. 
 It's a screen-grab from a messenger chat between Claire Elliot and her boyfriend. 
 He sent this just now? 
 Mm-hm. 
 It's not admissible. 
 No. 
 But it's enough for a warrant. 
 Already being processed, and I've spoke to Inverness CID, just in case. 
 Look who woke up! 
 "Sunset and evening star And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep... Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell... And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell... When I embark. For, though from out our bourne of time and place The flood may bear me far... I hope to see my Pilot face-to-face When I have crossed the bar." 
 So you made it here after all? 
 Aye, aye, Bill. 
 Well, you know how much Gracie meant to us -- 
 Sal and Me. 
 Of course we came. 
 Aye, she'd have liked that. 
 Listen, Alastair, there's no need for you to come into work tomorrow. 
 Or ever again. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Been up for about two years. 
 Sam? 
 What happened to just talking to someone, eh? 
 It's overrated. 
 I wasn't lying to you... 
 .. when I said I didn't know about the knife in the fireplace. 
 It wasn't me. 
 It wasn't. 
 So how did it get there? 
 I wasn't staying in my room alone... 
 Anna? 
 No. 
 Since we came back to Edinburgh she's barely said a word. 
 This whole thing, she's... 
 Something's happened to her. 
 There's a darkness there. 
 It's a side of her I can't... I can't quite... 
 Jamie, what do you think you're doing? 
 Now today's a hard day for all of us but I don't want you drinking! 
 Ma, I'm 17. 
 Yes, you're 17, not 18. 
 Can you hear yourself? 
 You think I've never drunk before? 
 You've got blinkers on. 
 What if your father sees you? 
 Right, we should all do what Dad says, cos he's such a saint. 
 I know you're upset -- we all are -- but there's no need for this, Jamie. 
 He's been lying to you did you know that? 
 Just stop. 
 Please, just stop, not today. 
 He's got Parkinson's. 
 What did you say? 
 You heard me. 
 He found out months ago. 
 Then he said me and Grace had to get tested, to see if we had it too. 
 It's true. 
 It's true, and I'm sick and tired of all these lies. 
 That's why I contacted the police and told them about what happened to Lee Walsh. 
 You did what? 
 Don't worry. 
 I kept us out of it. 
 I said in my e-mail that all we knew was Rob coming by the house, talking about someone crashing into the fence. 
 As far as the police know, we had no idea what went on. 
 Oh, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, what have you done? 
 Mrs Elliot. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm so sorry to do this today. I really am... 
 Have you found Lee Walsh? 
 We're going to need to speak to you all down at the station. 
 But what for? 
 Let's talk more at the station, eh? 
 I don't understand -- why can't you just tell us what this is all about? 
 Why don't you just come with us? 
 Anything you have to say to us, you can say here. 
 In case you hadn't noticed, I'm burying my brother. 
 This is about Lee Walsh and it can't wait. 
 Have you found him? 
 Just come with us now -- let's not make a scene, eh? 
 There was this, er, crash, and a car came off the road. 
 We helped the man inside. 
 We tried to help him, then we called an ambulance, but the storm was... 
 They said it would take a while to come. 
 I needed some supplies to help him, so we sent Rob over to Bill's farm. 
 While he was away we found a note in his pocket. 
 It had our postcode on it. 
 We're going to need to see that. 
 I didn't bring it. 
 I thought I was only going to my brother's funeral. 
 And when did you realise who the man from the car was? 
 We were on our way back from the barn, the news was on. 
 The suspect in Adam and Gracie's murder. 
 Rob looked like he'd just seen a ghost. 
 He said he recognised the man. 
 He ran out. 
 Angry. 
 Mum and Dad went out, following him. 
 He'd gone to get the guy -- 
 Walsh. 
 We went to look in on him and he'd gone. 
 Mr Walsh? 
 So we went out into the storm and we found him. 
 Did he say anything? 
 No, he was too unwell, he couldn't speak. 
 We took him back to the Douglas farm. 
 Out of the storm, you know. 
 And did you talk about what you should do, now that he was here, in your house? 
 There was an ambulance supposed to be on the way. 
 And we agreed we'd call the police. 
 We'd keep Walsh locked up until the police arrived. 
 Who went to call the police? 
 I couldn't bring myself to, not for him. 
 We received an e-mail from Jamie Douglas. 
 He came into possession of an online conversation your sister had with a friend -- Sam, I think his name was. 
 She said, "My brother's done something terrible". 
 What was she talking about? 
 I think I'd like a lawyer. 
 If that's the way you want to go, we could do that. 
 Look, I just want to get to the bottom of what happened to Adam and Grace. 
 Why did Lee Walsh come up to your house in the first place? 
 How was your dad involved? 
 Did he know Walsh? 
 We're going to find out what happened. 
 Forensics have been there for hours, we'll find the truth. 
 Isn't it better to get in front of it... 
 OK, I did it. 
 OK? 
 I killed him. 
 Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for travelling with us. 
 We're now arriving at Victoria Coach Station. 
 Welcome to London, ladies and gentlemen... Have a nice day... 
 Thank you. 
 Your brother just confessed to the murder of Lee Walsh. 
 You, your mum and Anna, and the Douglas family, you'll be kept here overnight and you'll be charged in the morning with attempting to pervert the course of justice. 
 Most likely you'll be granted bail. 
 This probably won't come to trial for a few months. 
 Even with all of this... 
 .. I'm glad that the man that murdered my brother... 
 .. is dead. 
 How are you holding up? 
 I ordered us a taxi to take us to the station -- shouldn't be too long. 
 So do I get an apology, then? 
 I think you've got that the wrong way round. 
 You both thought I did it. 
 But neither of you believed me, no matter how many times I tried to tell you. 
 And now you know, so you owe me an apology. 
 Not now, Jamie. 
 So when? 
 When are you going to stop treating me like I'm still the same person I was when I was 13? 
 You listen to me. 
 You shut your mouth and you keep it shut! 
 No matter what your mother and me thought, we believed in you, we tried to protect you. And what do you do in return? 
 You tell your mother about my condition on the day of Gracie's funeral. 
 Is that how she needed to find out that I was dying? 
 I don't need protecting, Bill! 
 That's not what I was doing. 
 You know, I am a lot tougher than you give me credit for. 
 I know that! 
 I wanted to tell you... 
 .. but I couldn't. All right, love? 
 I just didn't know how. 
 You lied to me. 
 And you had Jamie lie to me, too -- and Gracie. 
 You happy now? 
 I wanted the police to know the truth. 
 Yeah, by sending them Claire's private e-mails... 
 It wasn't e-mails, Dad. -- I knew her password -- that's all. 
 You violated someone's privacy because of a pathetic schoolboy crush. 
 Now you listen to me and you listen to me good -- you keep your mouth shut. Keep it shut, and don't you have the gall to lecture me about trust any more. 
 Do you hear me? 
 I'm going to the prison. 
 That's where they said they've taken Rob. 
 Good. 
 You should go. 
 Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 
 'Can you do me a favour? Can you just go outside and... get some shots of the building and the car and just stuff, so that when I put it all together it'll be easier, it'll be easier to edit. Is that OK?' 
 'Here, take it with you. Read it.' 
 'If you carry on you're going straight to hell.' 
 Bill! 
 Bill. 
 Bill! 
 You remember Rob taped Adam and Grace's wedding -- him and a bunch of friends, they filmed the whole thing. 
 I've been watching it me and Mum have -- and it's full of things that never made it into the final version. 
 All right, slow down, slow down. 
 I saw something on that tape. 
 You and Adam having an argument. 
 You handed him something and you told him he was going straight to hell. 
 Why? 
 Does it matter? 
 Tell me the truth, Bill. 
 Is this something to do with why Adam was killed? 
 The case against you is too strong. 
 It's not a question of whether you'll be found guilty, but when.
