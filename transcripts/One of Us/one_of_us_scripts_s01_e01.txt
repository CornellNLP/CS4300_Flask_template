 'That day was my first memory of you. I remember that morning, I had a sword in my hand and I thought I could take on the world. But then I went out into the world and I realised something - the real world, and the other people that live in it, are terrifying. And then I saw you standing there, and you seemed so...confident. The fun-sized little princess who had it all figured out. And you spoke to me. Not that you had much choice about it. That was the upside of living next-door to each other in the arse end of nowhere. We did everything together. Even ended up at the same uni. Mum, Claire and Rob took me down and said their goodbyes. And then, when they left, I felt scared all over again.' 
 But you came to my room, and we drank red wine, and you told me I didn't have to be scared and, since then, I haven't been scared... of anything... because I have you. 
 Aw!  
 Aw! 
 And that's why I'm stood here... dressed like an idiot...  
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, thanks! 
 ..for our first dance. 
 Come on.

 (Panicky breathing) 
 We turn our thoughts and prayers this week to those affected by these terrible storms and floods. 
 There's a question I've been getting asked a lot recently. 
 If our God is a loving, caring God, why are we suffering like this? 
 Why are people losing their homes? 
 So it goes when hardships come. 
 Things we cannot control. 
 We lash out. 
 We question His existence... 
 RADIO NEWSREADER: An extremely powerful weather system is heading towards Scotland, with the Met Office having issued a red weather warning. Heavy rain and gale force gusts of wind...  
 (Switches off radio) 
 Can't move for all this talk about the frickin' weather! 
 (Tinny music on headphones) 
 Jamie. 
 Jamie! 
 Take those things out. 
 Why? 
 Why? Because it's bad manners, that's why! 
 I can hear that racket from here. 
 Right. 
 God forbid any part of Sunday morning be any fun whatsoever. 
 This. See this? 
 This is music. 
 This is Hank Williams. 
 There you are. Beautiful!

 Hey, Charlie. 
 What brings you all the way out here? 
 Bill, Moira. 
 I... I got a call from Edinburgh Police. 
 They've... found your girl, Grace, in her flat last night. 
 There'd been a break-in. 
 She was murdered, Bill, her and Adam Elliot. But I just... 
 No, no, no. 
 What about the baby? 
 Sorry.  
 No! 
 We need someone to identify them.  
 No, no. 
 I was thinking, Louise's other boy, Rob, he lives in Edinburgh, doesn't he? 
 (Sobbing) : She's my child, Charlie. 
 I... I should go and see her. 
 Not like this, Bill. 
 (Bird call) 
 (Wings flap) 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Approaching vehicle) 
 (No! Why would you say that to me?) 
 (Why would you say that to me, Charlie?) 
 (Panicky breathing) 
 (Distant voices) 
 (Answerphone beep) 
 Hi, At. Me again, your big sister. 
 Remember me? 
 Still haven't heard from you. 
 Maybe I don't want to. 
 You're probably...  
 (Door opening) 
 ..disgustingly tanned. Anyway, give me a call when it fades. Love you. 
 Hope it was brilliant. 
 Is he coming back then?  
 Who? 
 That fella of yours who went off to save the world in Nairobi - 
 Mr Lover Lover.  
 That was my brother... back from honeymoon. 
 Forgot I told you about Sam. 
 That'll teach me to drink on a school night. 
 Morning, Meredith. How are you today? 
 Fine. 
 Here. 
 I have something for you. 
 Oh, can I help? 
 This one? 
 This was given to me by my grandmother. 
 I wanted you to have it.  
 No, no, I couldn't. I couldn't. 
 I won't take no for an answer. 
 Thank you. 
 It's beautiful. 
 I know you'll take good care of it... as you have of me. 
 Is something wrong? 
 I looked into what we talked about. 
 There's this pill - it sends you quietly off to sleep. 
 I can't do that, Meredith.  
 If there was anyone else I could ask. 
 We've been friends a long time now. 
 It's against the law. 
 Laws are like cobwebs, which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through. 
 Jonathan Swift. 
 Another quote from another book I haven't read. 
 I'm going to die, Claire. 
 I... I can't, Meredith. 
 We can do it so you won't get into any trouble.  
 I... 
 You're upset, that's all. 
 I should... I should get on. 
 (She sighs) 
 Rob! Wait! 
 I thought you were going to give me a lift to work. 
 I can't. I... 
 I forgot I'm supposed to be at Mrs Wilson's place. 
 I thought you finished her garden months ago. 
 Yeah, I guess not. 
 You know, I don't think you should be in work.  
 Oh, not this again. 
 It's too soon. 
 What happened to me is in the past. 
 Life goes on, Rob. 
 Locking myself away isn't going to help. 
 OK, then. 
 You can kiss me, you know? 
 You be OK? 
 Good luck with Mrs Hill. 
 It's Mrs Wilson. 
 Right. 
 (Mobile rings) 
 Hello? 
 Adam and Grace...  
 Claire? 
 ..they're dead. 
 Someone killed them. 
 Our little brother's gone, Rob. 
 (She sobs) 
 (Water trickles) 
 I've got some stuff to sell on. 
 Laptop, jewellery, some photo frames. 
 You've been busy. 
 Aye, take a look. 
 You've nicked some right old sh1t here, Lee! 
 Have you ever tried not getting high before you break into some place? 
 A bit of free advice for you, mate. 
 Just tell me what I can get for what's in the bag! 
 Everything all right, pal?  
 I'm in a hurry. 
 Need to get somewhere.  
 Where? 
 A place called Braeston, out in the islands. 
 I need the money for a train ticket. 
 I cannae get you anything for a few days, pal. 
 I need to find somebody to buy this sh1t first. 
 Front me. I'm good for it. 
 Right, cos I'm sitting on my savings, me!  
 Come on! 
 You must have some money! 
 I'm out, man, honest. 
 Is everything all right? Are you in trouble? 
 I need to get to Braeston, finish something that I started.  
 Like what? 
 They're all in there. 
 I checked. 75 sheets. 
 250 microgram LSD. 
 I can just see you now... at your kitchen table, counting out tabs of acid, one by one. 
 You're a regular smiley face Nigella Lawson, aren't you? 
 If you want me to go and sell this sh1t to someone else, I will. 
 All right. All right. 
 I saw you in my street. 
 Well, we have to take precautions. 
 Someone like you. 
 You understand. 
 It's all there. 
 (Siren in the distance) 
 OK, then. 
 Will I be seeing you again then, Grandma? 
 Take care, dear! 
 (Thunder claps) 
 I hope you don't mind... 
 Oh, it's fine. Claire drinks in the house. 
 Not that it's helping. 
 I've been sat here since I found out, just... 
 Just... Just sat here. 
 I'm glad you came over. 
 I know we haven't always... 
 I mean, I said things at the wedding... 
 Oh, it doesn't matter now. God. 
 Just... Just before Charlie Fuller came and told me... I'd killed a bird. 
 I shot it clean out of the sky... and I was so proud of myself. 
 It's just a bird, Louise. 
 What kind of person...gets pleasure out of death? 
 Hey. Can you help us? I just need a couple of quid, that's all. 
 No, sorry. 
 Don't try and run, yeah? You keep your mouth shut, you understand? Give me your keys. 
 Keys, thank you. 
 And your wallet. Come on! 
 Mum. 
 (Sobbing) : Rob. 
 (Sobbing continues) 
 I called Dad. 
 I thought it was better he heard it from us - not on the news. I kept getting his voicemail. 
 I don't want him up here.  
 No-one's asking him up here, Mum. 
 Why on earth...?  
 He is not setting foot in this house! 
 (Glass smashes) 
 sh1t. 
 You all right, Mum? 
 Well, I'm not drinking, if that's what you mean. 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 Don't pick it up with your hands, Mum, you'll cut yourself. 
 Leave it.  
 (Phone chimes) 
 Leave it. 
 (Phone chimes) 
 Someone really wants to get hold of you. 
 It's Sam. I told him what happened. 
 You're still in touch with Sam?  
 What do we do with all his stuff? 
 (Sobbing) : It can't just stay there forever, can it? 
 It can't just sit there. 
 (Phone chimes) 
 Jamie, love... 
 Ma! Would it kill you to knock? 
 You should come downstairs. We should try and eat something. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 I can't stop wondering why. 
 Why? Just for money? 
 A robbery? 
 Adam Elliot was always a wayward sort. 
 Nothing but trouble, even as a lad. You remember. 
 And then he gets our Gracie pregnant, when she's got her whole life ahead of her. 
 Irresponsible, that's just who he is. 
 What are you saying? 
 Someone broke into their home. 
 Maybe there was a reason. 
 Maybe Adam was involved in something... 
 (Knock at door) 
 All right, folks? 
 What are you still doing here? 
 I wanted to make sure that everything was done on the farm and that everything was locked down for the storm tonight. 
 You're not going home in this, are you? 
 It's just a bit of weather, Bill. 
 No. No. Absolutely not, no way. 
 I won't hear of it, Alastair, at least until it passes. 
 He should stay, shouldn't he? 
 Of course. We insist. 
 (Beeping) 
 sh1t! Come on. 
 (Car horn sounds continuously) 
 Oh, my God! 
 sh1t! 
 Oh, Jesus.  
 Do you recognise him?! Who is he?! 
 Go round the other side, Claire.  
 Do you know who he is?! Who is he?! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Hello?! Can you hear me?! Can you hear me?! 
 I'll call an ambulance.  
 Yes, yes! You do that, Mum. 
 You know a hell of a lot more than me, Claire. Can we move him? 
 Support his head! Get his legs!  
 OK, OK. 
 We'll need something to carry him on!  
 What can we use?! 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Don't move him any more than you have to! 
 I've got it! I've got it! 
 His leg's stuck! 
 All right. Easy. Easy. Easy. 
 Be careful with him.  
 Slide him over, yeah? 
 OK. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 We need to get him inside.  
 OK, wait. 
 Hurry up, come on! Come on! 
 Just pull!  
 Lift! 
 I don't know. It looks... 
 I mean, his...his leg is hurt and... 
 Oh. All right, OK. 
 Well...yeah, yeah, OK, but quick as you can, please, yeah? 
 Helicopters aren't coming out in the storm and the ambulance says it will be several hours. 
 The roads have all flooded, apparently, all over. 
 This is useless. 
 He's got an open fracture - I'm going to need to splint. 
 What about Bill? Maybe he has some vet supplies at the farm. 
 That'd work. Rob, get over there, grab everything you can. 
 Wait. Do you need me to come with you? 
 No, I'll be fine. It's only next door. 
 
 
 
 TV : The Met Office weather warning remains in place throughout the night, as gusts of wind, some reaching gale-force, continue to batter Scotland. This weather front from the Atlantic continues to bring heavy rain... 
 Right...I'm going to turn in. 
 Bill, Moira, I'm so sorry to burst in like this but a man's just driven off the road by our place. 
 Oh, my God. Is he...? Is he badly hurt? 
 We don't know right now. Erm...we've called an ambulance, but God knows when it's going to get here. 
 Claire needs some medical things - she thought you might have some for the animals. 
 Of course I do. In the calves' barn. I'll show you where it is. 
 Yeah, I know where it is, Bill.  
 Hold on, I'll come with you. 
 How...? How's he doing? 
 Pulse is decent but his temperature's high. 
 That wound on his head needs cleaning. 
 I'm going to need some water. 
 I'll... I'll get some. 
 Hey, you're awake. 
 Hello. Are you hot? 
 You want your coat off?  
 (He groans) 
 Careful. Careful. Shhh. 
 HE GROANS Shhh. Don't... Don't try to talk. 
 It's OK, the ambulance will be here soon. 
 OK, OK.  
 (He moans) 
 There we go. 
 Claire. 
 Gently, gently. 
 Claire? 
 Claire?  
 What? 
 Can we...? 
 The water's almost ready. 
 What?  
 We found something on him. 
 It's got our postcode on it. 
 Why would he have our postcode written down? 
 So he was coming here? 
 Or Bill and Moira's - the postcode's the same. 
 But he was coming here deliberately. 
 So who the hell is he? 
 Thanks, Bill.  
 No problem. 
 TV : Police are anxious to trace a homeless man who has been named as Lee Walsh. 
 He's considered to be dangerous and the public has been warned not to approach him. 
 That's him.  
 What are you talking about? 
 That man... That man's in our house. 
 We should go over to Bill and Moira's... see if he's a friend of theirs.  
 Right, see if they happen to be friends with any junkies who drive a Lexus. 
 Oh, Claire, we can at least ask. 
 Well, maybe he's well enough to just tell us himself. 
 (He moans in pain) 
 Rob! Rob!  
 Rob, stop it! 
 Stop it, stop it! Rob, get off him! Stop it. 
 What are you doing?! 
 Stop! Stop!  
 What are you doing?! 
 What is it? You're fine. What is it? Just breathe. 
 He was right!  
 Right about what? 
 The news report - it says they think this is the man that killed Adam and Gracie.  
 Oh, dear lord. 
 This man? He did it? 
 How do you know? 
 Well, that's what they're saying. They're saying that on the news. 
 What's he doing here? 
 Why did he come here? 
 Rob, go and call the police. 
 They won't get here any quicker than that ambulance.  
 Go. 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 'Emergency. Which service do you require?' 
 Ambulance.  
 'Ambulance service.' 
 Hi. We called for an ambulance a while ago. 
 'Braeston farm?' 
 Yeah, that's us. Listen, it's not as bad as we thought. 
 We're just going to take him to the medical centre in the morning. 
 'Are you sure?' 
 Yeah, he's fine and, in the storm, we'd rather you didn't waste resources. 
 We won't need anyone. Thank you.  
 'Thank you for letting us know.' 
 Here, put him here. Here. 
 They're on their way... but they said the flooding's getting a lot worse. 
 People are evacuating their houses, so it could be quite a wait. 
 Same goes for the ambulance. 
 So what now? 
 He had a folded-up envelope with our postcode on it. 
 Here? Why would he...? 
 Do you know who this is? 
 Why the hell would I know? 
 Because you saw Grace and Adam all the time down in Edinburgh. 
 I just thought you might know who it is...  
 I have no idea who it is, Moira, not a damn clue! 
 Why would I?  
 Tell your boy to watch his mouth, will you?! 
 He's a grown man! And how dare you fling accusations...!  
 Shut your mouth! 
 Stop it! Stop it! 
 The ambulance and the police are on their way. 
 We just need to wait, that's all. 
 What if he wakes up again? 
 He had our address. What if he...? He's a killer. 
 What if he...? What if he...? 
 Cages. 
 What? 
 The old dog cages in Bill's barn - we could keep him in there till the emergency services arrive. 
 You're not serious?  
 He's right. 
 He's right. We could keep him in there and we'd be safe. 
 I've done what I can for now. 
 What he needs is fluids and rest. 
 He was up and moving earlier. 
 That doesn't mean he isn't bleeding internally and, if he is, we won't know until it's too late. 
 The beating didn't help. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 It's just the same. 
 What is?  
 (She weeps) 
 What? 
 Mum? 
 What is it? 
 Claire gave Adam this watch for his 21st birthday. 
 She had it engraved.  
 And you still want to keep him warm? 
 Claire. Claire... 
 There's a room for you all at our house tonight. 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 (Elastic band pings) 
 (White noise builds) 
 What was that? 
 It's nothing. 
 Just go to bed. 
 I'll be in soon. 
 (Rain hits windows) 
 (He exhales) 
 (He sobs) 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 (She breathes sharply) 
 (Thunder continues) 
 (He whimpers) 
 Help. 
 Help me. 
 How are you?  
 I'm fine. 
 Right. 
 That day we got your diagnosis... I remember, before you went to bed, you told me you were scared about tomorrow. 
 And I told you not to think about it, that there'd be good days and there'd be bad days, but we'd live each day as it came. 
 No thinking about tomorrow. 
 I found the money, sweetheart, for the operation. 
 I knew that you would. 
 Maybe we can start to feel normal again. 
 Wouldn't that be nice? 
 (Panicked breathing) 
 (Indistinct shouting) 
 Someone here did this. 
 It wasn't me... 
 So who? 
 Look, the storm's over. The police will be here any minute, so... 
 No. 
 No, they won't be. 
 I didn't call them. 
 I...  (He sniffs)  I told the ambulance not to come. 
 Jesus. 
 Rob, what have you done? 
 I was so angry and I... I wanted to just... let nature just take its course. 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 (Door opens) 
 (Kick echoes) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Your boy... Your boy's going to go to prison for this. 
 He didn't do it. He didn't. 
 I-I-I... 
 I... 
 I saw someone last night... walking through the yard, towards this barn, but it wasn't Rob. 
 It wasn't, I'm sure of it. 
 Oh, come on. He's as good as admitted it. 
 Don't tell me that you know what's happening, Moira, because you don't have a clue! INDISTINCT ARGUING He said he was going to call the police and he didn't!  
 Mum, we will just call the police and the police will sort this out. 
 Your boys are rotten to the core - they're septic. 
 But there's no surprise there, is there? 
 They're just like their father. They're their father's sons. 
 The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it, Louise?  
 How dare you! 
 How dare you talk about my sons like that!  
 Oh, my God, what has he done? What?! 
 I need to talk to you. 
 It's OK. We'll call the police It wasn't, it wasn't... 
 Anna! Just wait! 
 Anna. 
 Wait. 
 I just...needed some air. 
 I didn't do this. 
 OK, I know I lied about calling the police, but that was just a mistake. 
 I wasn't thinking.  
 Would you tell me if you did? 
 Of course I would. 
 Same way you told me you've been stalking Graham Harris? 
 He raped you. 
 And you said... you said you wanted to kill him. 
 Yeah, but I didn't hurt him. 
 I thought about it...but I didn't. 
 I thought about it, too. 
 I don't... 
 I don't blame you. I wouldn't... I wouldn't blame you for any of it. 
 You sure about this? 
 Aye, Bill, I'm sure. 
 We should talk to him, now. 
 W-what's going on? 
 That man, the suspect that Rob saw on TV... he came here last night and now he's dead. 
 OK.  
 Is that all you've got to say? 
 A man is dead. 
 But you knew that, didn't you, Jamie? 
 What the hell? Why would you say that? 
 I saw you, son. 
 I couldn't sleep. I got up and I saw you come out of the barn. 
 Louise saw you, too. All right, she saw someone, anyway. 
 Was it you, Jamie? 
 Just...please just tell us the truth so we can help you. 
 I just... 
 I wanted to look at him. 
 Why? 
 To see the person who killed Grace. 
 Fine. If you think I'm guilty, let the police decide. 
 (Door closes) 
 'I'd never thought he'd be capable of something like this.' 
 I'm praying that he didn't, but... it wasn't that long ago... 
 That's in the past, Moira. He's gotten his head straight now. 
 As far as I'm concerned, you two are family. 
 You've already lost one bairn, I will not let you risk losing another, not over that piece of dirt. 
 Whatever he's done, he's our son, Bill. 
 Right. OK. 
 No, thanks. No, no, I've got it. 
 Boss? 
 Oi, where's DI Wallis? 
 On the phone. 
 (He sighs) 
 Give me a call me back when you have any more... 
 (He clears his throat) 
 That's right, OK.  
 Boss. 
 The Adam and Grace Elliot case - got a sighting of Lee Walsh. 
 Some guy in a garage recognised him off the news. 
 He was getting petrol at a service station. ANPR verified it. 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 Location's marked on a map, which should be with you now. 
 20 miles south of where the victims grew up. 
 Who's the liaison officer assigned to the families? 
 Uh, local cop, er, Fuller, I think. 
 Get him on the phone now. 
 (Door opens) 
 Did you call the police? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 We've had a talk... me and your brother. 
 We don't need any more harm coming to our families... to either of them. 
 We've suffered enough. 
 Don't you think? 
 Now, we've all seen the news and the watch that he took from him. 
 The man in that cage... killed Adam and Grace. 
 But the police don't know that he's here. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm not saying anything. 
 I think we should just... take a moment... and think about what happens if they do come here. 
 One of us did this. 
 One of us, right here. 
 Now, do we want that person going to prison... because of him? 
 His face is all over the news! 
 They're looking for him! 
 What about the press? 
 I mean, the phones have been ringing off the hook all morning. 
 They'll be here, on our doorstep, in no time. 
 Then we'll deal with it. 
 W... We can't do that! 
 We need to come clean about all of this! 
 Can't you see that? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know what to think any more. 
 I've lost my boy. 
 I just... 
 I just want all this to go away. 
 Dad? 
 Jamie, just stay there. 
 But you've got a phone call.  
 Not now. 
 It's the police. 
 Go back in the house. 
 Go on. 
 Bill Douglas here. 
 Us and... and Louise Elliot. I'm looking at her right now. 
 It's fine. 
 Everything's OK. 
 When she gets here? 
 But thanks for letting me know. 
 Will do, all right. Bye. Bye. 
 Charlie Fuller. 
 The detective's coming from Edinburgh. 
 What? 
 What have you done?! 
 What was I supposed to say, Claire? 
 OK, what are we going to do? 
 Nothing like an eight-hour delay to really reset your body clock, is there, eh? 
 Maybe you're just getting a bit old, eh? 
 Ooh, ouch. 
 (He clears his throat) 
 'You have one new message, received yesterday, 4:11pm.' 
 'Dad, it's Claire. I don't know how else to say this. Adam... Jesus Christ. Adam's dead, someone killed him, him and Grace.' 
 Are you all right? Who was that? 
 (Phone beeps) 
 No-one.
