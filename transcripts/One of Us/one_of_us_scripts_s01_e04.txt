 They've found your girl, Grace. 
 She was murdered, Bill, her and Adam Elliot. 
 I need to get to Braeston to finish something that I started. 
 What would you do if the man who murdered your children ended up on your doorstep that same day? 
 We have to get rid of the body. 
 There's this pill. It sends you quietly off to sleep. 
 I can't do that, Meredith. 
 A friend of mine from school... she's dead. 
 They made it look like a Smurf. It's sick. 
 It's in your interest to make sure I'm not arrested, but if I get picked up... you sure as sh1t are too. 
 We found it, Rob. 
 The bloodstained knife you hid in your bedroom, in the fireplace. 
 I never hid anything there... 
 I take it you've not checked your e-mails. 
 We both received one this morning... from Jamie Douglas. 
 I kept us out of it. 
 I said in my e-mail that all we knew was Rob coming by the house, talking about someone crashing into the fence. 
 Oh, Jamie, what have you done? 
 Why did Lee Walsh come up to your house in the first place? 
 We're going to find out what happened. 
 Look, I did it. I killed him. 
 Carry on and you're going straight to hell. 
 I saw something on that tape. Tell me the truth, Bill. 
 Is this something to do with why Adam was killed? 
 Of course it bloody matters. Tell me the truth, Bill. 
 What did you say to my brother? 
 Why can't you leave things well alone, eh? 
 Why do you have to pick at things, girl, over and over again? 
 What were you arguing about? 
 You're not going to like it, Claire... 
 He was seeing someone else, another woman... 
 Just before the wedding, I saw the two of them together in Edinburgh a few weeks ago when I was there. 
 No, not Adam. 
 You asked me to tell you the truth, Claire, and there it is. 
 That's the truth. Are you happier now? 
 I knew Adam. We spoke nearly every day. 
 Something like that... 
 He felt bad, sure. He hated himself. 
 He promised me he'd end it and I told him to, in no uncertain terms, to save Grace's feelings. 
 You handed him something in that video. 
 You told him he was going straight to hell. 
 His marriage certificate. I had it in my pocket. 
 I was keeping it safe for him. 
 I showed it to him to remind him of the vows he was breaking. 
 Of the commitments he was flaunting in the face of God, of his family, of his friends. 
 Why didn't he come to me? 
 He was ashamed. 
 Now... I think after everything that's passed... He made a mistake. 
 He felt bad. 
 At the end of the day, we're all of us just human. 
 Don't let it change the way you remember him. 
 I've got to go. 
 What about that one? It has three pools. 
 What are we going to do with three pools? 
 Well, maybe they're different temperatures. 
 And it's got six restaurants! 
 I said we could stay somewhere nice after the operation, not somewhere only Richard Branson can afford. 
 Fine. I'll limit myself to places with just the one pool. 
 If you'd be so kind. 
 This is meant to be your day off. 
 I'll be quick. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. Is that DI Wallis? 
 Yeah, it's Constable Hartley, at Niddrie station. 
 I've got someone in lockup here that says they want to talk to you. 
 About a case. 
 His name's Jay Clark. Do you know him? 
 Yep, will do. 
 What happened? 
 Sorry to call you... 
 No, no, it's fine. What happened? 
 Victoria was changing her bed and knocked open her drawer by mistake. 
 Out came a whole handful of pills. 
 Gathered from the medication from the other patients. 
 She must've been doing it for a while now. 
 The only reason someone would have amassed a pharmacy like that... 
 I know. 
 The only person she'll see is you. 
 I'm just forgetful, that's all. 
 I keep picking up pills I think are mine, putting them in that cupboard there. 
 I quite forgot about them until that lady knocked them out by mistake. 
 You and I both know that's not true. 
 Aye, we do. And only us. 
 This is my fault. 
 No. 
 If I'd helped you... 
 I asked and you gave your answer. 
 You have nothing to apologise for. 
 Except you're not going to stop trying, are you? 
 It's what I want. I am ready. 
 And I want to end it on my terms. 
 Or die trying. 
 OK. I'll do it. 
 Darling, you don't have to. 
 I'll help you. 
 I'm here to see Rob... Rob Elliot. 
 Elliot. You've already got a visitor. 
 I just need five minutes. 
 Never been so pleased to see a pig in all my life. 
 Don't get too excited, I'm not here to let you out. 
 Well, you best be soon... 
 .. cos they want to know the name of my supplier. 
 You know it's your word against mine. 
 Yeah, you're right. True, true. 
 Except... I have audio recordings of every single one of our conversations. 
 You think I'd go into business without taking out insurance? 
 And before you go looking, I don't keep them at my flat. 
 Don't say anything. 
 I'll talk to your dealer, the guy who gave up your name, and I'll get him to retract his testimony. 
 You're in over your head, aren't you, Grandma? 
 I'll get it done. Just give me a some time. 
 Yeah, well, you've got till six tonight cos that's when they've got to charge me. So if I don't hear from you by then... 
 Thanks. 
 The redirect on Adam's post has come through and I've been on the phone for the last hour trying to cancel his gas and other... 
 Trying to explain to a complete stranger that my son is... 
 You don't have to do that, Mum. Let me. 
 Adam Elliot. 
 No, I'm not the account holder, I'm calling because he's... 
 He passed away. I need to cancel the account. 
 Yeah. I'll hold. 
 Is everything OK at work? 
 Fine. Thanks. 
 Mum, do you recognise that number? 
 Which? 
 This one... 
 Well, it does look a bit familiar, but I can't... 
 You know I don't really have a head for numbers... 
 Let me see... 
 He made these calls when he was on honeymoon. 
 Look, five calls to the same number at four in the morning. 
 What are you talking about, darling? 
 It's Bill Douglas's mobile number. He didn't call any of us from honeymoon, but he called Bill. 
 Five times. 
 What was so important that he needed to call him at four in the morning? 
 Sal? 
 There's no need to look so surprised. 
 I cook you meals -- breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
 Try and look nice for you. 
 Can't afford anything fancy, mind. I'm not exactly catwalk-ready, but I try. 
 I do try to look nice for you. 
 I laugh at your jokes, too. 
 Even when they're not funny. 
 I do all these things for you, day in, day out, year after year... 
 .. but that doesn't make me stupid, Alastair. 
 I don't do them because cleaning up after you gives me so much joy, do I? 
 I do those things because that's what we signed up for. 
 Sal... 
 No, I'm talking now. This is when I talk! 
 I know about what you and Moira have been up to. 
 Because, like I said, I'm not stupid. 
 I've known for the last two years. 
 But I didn't do anything about it because I was scared, scared I'd be left with nothing. 
 Even though it went against everything I believe about what's right and wrong in a marriage, about what I thought I'd do when I was faced with such a thing... 
 Please... 
 And then what happened with Adam and Grace, it just made me stop and think... 
 .. how bloody short life is. 
 And then after you told me about all what you'd done... 
 I just finally saw my chance to do something for me. 
 Getting that money. 
 Well, I've got something now, haven't I? An incentive. 
 A reason to go. Finally I get something. 
 It's not your money, Sal. 
 Oh, it is when you take out all the cash out of the account. 
 I didn't bring it with me. 
 Like I said, I'm not that stupid. 
 In fact. You keep it, you keep it. 
 I'll buy myself some new things. 
 Treat myself to something nice. 
 As it's written in Romans, "Do not be conformed to this world... but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God. What is good and acceptable and perfect." 
 Hello? 
 What are you doing? 
 Why are you looking through Dad's stuff? 
 I... I thought you'd be at church. 
 Yeah. Well. 
 A lot's changed recently. 
 Rob's in prison because of you. 
 Because he confessed. He told them he was guilty. 
 How long have you been reading my conversations with Sam? 
 A while, on and off. 
 A couple of years back, you and Adam were chatting, he said your password for everything was butterfly. 
 So I just tried it once. I never meant to... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I promise I won't try it on again. 
 It's just everything recently... it's gone wrong. 
 Dad's got Parkinson's. 
 Oh, Jamie. I'm so sorry. 
 After he heard, I had to go in and get tested. 
 All these secrets. I'm stuck out here in the middle of nowhere. 
 You start to lose yourself. 
 Oh, come here. 
 You can talk to me, you know? I'm just up the road. 
 Any time. 
 So what were you looking for? 
 It should be... Yeah. Here. 
 sh1t, he should've been out all morning... 
 Take it. Go out the back door. 
 Go on. Go. 
 Thank you. 
 Jamie, what's that taxi doing outside? 
 Ja... Sal? 
 Jamie's upstairs. I thought it best... given the circumstances. 
 What's this about? 
 Do you want a cup of tea, or... 
 No. I won't. 
 I came here to say my piece, that's all. 
 I'll say my piece and leave. 
 Is this about me firing Alastair... 
 No. It's not about that. 
 He needs to know, Moira. 
 Know what? 
 I told Alastair I was leaving him this morning. 
 I've known that he and Moira have been... 
 .. for a while and I finally did something about it. 
 I thought you should know because maybe you want to do the same. 
 No... 
 They'd go to a hotel, in Inverness, two or three times a month. I went there once. 
 I saw them have dinner. 
 Their legs sliding up and down each other like a couple of teenagers... 
 Get out. Go on. Get out. 
 It's true, Bill. 
 Get out of my house! You're rotten, both of you. 
 Rotten to your b*st*rd bones. 
 Now get out! 
 They're going to start wondering why you're so interested in me. 
 How's this for a deal? 
 Say one word about me and I'll ruin you. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Before I got this job I worked in computer crime, s*x offenders mainly, child pornography. 
 Horrible job, but I learned a lot. 
 A lot of technical stuff. 
 I got a hold of some material and put it on a USB stick. 
 It wouldn't be hard for me to go to an evidence locker and upload what's on there onto your laptop. 
 The material I put on there could put you in prison. 
 Same as you're facing now. More, more time, probably, but in this version, you spend time in the s*x offenders wing. 
 In this version, when you do finally get out, you go on the register. 
 In this version, you're branded a paedophile for the rest of your life. 
 You know what people do to paedophiles when they find out they live on their street, don't you? 
 You wouldn't do that... 
 That's evil. 
 It's self-preservation, isn't it? 
 Yeah, but you're not like that. You couldn't do it. 
 Am I not? 
 My offer's still the same. 
 You've got till six tonight and then I'm telling everybody that wants to know. 
 I just got a call. There's someone waiting for you back at your station. 
 Says it's urgent. 
 Right. 
 Bill. 
 How long? 
 You and Alastair, how long? 
 When we first... 
 You were away, I was lonely... 
 Don't give me excuses. 
 No, you're right. I wasn't lonely because you were away. 
 I was lonely because I always am. 
 Even when you're here. 
 And so you are absolved of all blame. I make you cheat. 
 I make you lonely. 
 Oh, spare me the judgment. That's not what I'm saying. 
 I'm not blaming anyone. I'm just trying to tell you... 
 I didn't set out to do something wrong. 
 I was lonely and it happened. 
 Is that what you told yourself the last time? 
 It's not the first time you've betrayed your wedding vows, is it? 
 How many others have there been since you slept with Peter Elliot? 
 20 years, you kept that from me. 
 20 years. 
 They were our friends... 
 .. our neighbours. 
 Bill, it's me again. Adam. 
 After this, I'm done calling. 
 If you don't want to talk to me, I don't give a sh1t. 
 But you need to know this. Grace is my wife now. 
 She's my wife! 
 I love her, she loves me and that's not... 
 That's never going to change. I don't care what you... 
 How dare you? 
 How f*cking dare you... on my wedding day? 
 When we get back, you're going to stay away from me and Grace. 
 It's not like she's even your daughter. Is she? 
 Does Dad know? Is that why he left? 
 Cos he was screwing your wife. 
 I don't care any more. I don't want to know. 
 I don't want to hear from you ever again. 
 Jesus... 
 Adam and Grace were brother and sister. 
 Your dad and Moira Douglas... 
 How did you find this? 
 Bill's number was on Adam's phone bill. 
 And I didn't think anything of it at first... 
 We have these tapes at home of the wedding day. And I saw this bit... 
 I hadn't seen it before. Bill and Adam are arguing in it. 
 Screaming at each other. And Bill tells Adam he's going to hell. 
 Sorry. 
 I went to Bill about it this morning, I asked him and he said that Adam was having an affair... 
 He lied to me. 
 Is this... 
 Could this have something to do with what happened to Adam and Grace? 
 Leave it with us. 
 I think you need to go home and be with your family. OK? 
 Do you have the envelope you found on Walsh's body? 
 Has anyone else seen it? 
 Just Mum and Anna. It's been in my pocket the whole time. 
 How do I tell them? 
 My mum... my brother... 
 We're going to look into this, I promise. 
 We're going to find out what went on. 
 As soon as possible, which is the whole point of me ringing you now. 
 We're pulling all phone records and bank statements for Bill Douglas for the past six months. Putting together a timeline of his movements. 
 Good. While you're at it, I want you to run that through the lab. 
 An envelope? What am I looking for? 
 Just run it through everything they've got. 
 Fine. 
 Where are you off to? 
 Just... Just something I need to do. 
 Right. Also got something else for you now. 
 
 
 
 Keep it down in there! 
 I'll talk! 
 Change of plan. 
 The surgeon's dates have shifted, he needs us earlier. 
 So good news. We're leaving tonight! 
 Tonight? 
 So, better get packing. Yuki, thank you. 
 Much appreciated. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Send me an e-mail, OK? Come on... 
 I'll be fine. Back annoying you in no time. 
 Good luck. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 So, we better get packing. There's a flight leaving tonight... 
 And, um, the operation? 
 End of this week, probably he wasn't quite sure... 
 The main thing is we get there. 
 But we're paying him a lot of money, how can he just change the dates around at the last minute? 
 Look at it this way, we'll be in the sun a lot sooner than we thought. 
 But Mum, it's so quick, it seems crazy to be shifting it around so late... 
 We have to go, now! 
 It's OK, I'm sorry. 
 I know it's scary. And it's sudden. 
 But this man says he can help. 
 He's the only one that can operate. 
 But what if he's wrong? 
 What if he can't get it out of my head? 
 He's the best. 
 He's the best there is, at exactly this kind of tumour. 
 And hey... this was going to be a surprise, but... 
 I booked the resort you found. The one with the three pools! 
 But what are we going to do with three pools? 
 Swim in them all, my darling. So, better get packing fast. 
 That's the DNA results from the envelope. 
 Oh, cheers. 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t. sh1t. sh1t. 
 Hiya. Fuller, listen, it's Andrew. 
 You're going to want to get round to the Douglas residence... 
 Mum. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 Bill. 
 Bill? 
 Bill. What's going on? 
 What do you mean? 
 What the hell is going on? I want you to tell me the truth. 
 Calm down, Louise... 
 Claire has told me about the message. 
 The message that Adam left on your phone. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What is this? What message? 
 Bill told Adam... 
 .. that he and Grace... 
 .. were brother and sister. 
 That's ridiculous... 
 Yes, it's ridiculous, isn't it? 
 It's ridiculous, but he believed it, so why, why, why would you say such a thing?! 
 Louise, Louise -- get out of my house. 
 I'm not getting out of your house until you give me an explanation. 
 GET OUT! 
 I want you to tell me the truth... 
 Both of you, just calm down... 
 Not until you tell me about my son! 
 Explain yourself! 
 GET OUT! 
 This isn't helping. 
 Tell me why you said that to my son, Bill. 
 Why would you say that to my son? 
 Get out! 
 Bill. 
 They've asked me to take you in. 
 William Douglas, I'm detaining you under Section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Adam and Grace Elliot... 
 What? 
 No... 
 They have evidence, Bill. 
 Claire found an envelope on the victim's body, it had your fingerprints on it. 
 I see. 
 That's-that's wrong... 
 Say it's wrong, Bill. 
 Say you didn't do it! 
 Say you didn't kill our baby girl. 
 I need a minute to put some clothes on, Charlie. 
 If that's all right? 
 Course. 
 Bill, enough. 
 Just put the gun down. 
 You know what I was just thinking... 
 If it wasn't for this illness... 
 .. I wouldn't have known. 
 None of this would have happened. 
 If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have had Jamie and Gracie tested... 
 .. and I wouldn't have found out that Gracie wasn't mine. 
 It ate away at me... 
 You understand? 
 I'd often wondered about you and Peter in the past, but I put it from me. 
 I put it out of my mind. 
 But now... 
 It was easy enough to get a piece of Adam's hair. 
 Send it to the lab. 
 I just wanted to forget, you know. 
 I didn't want to know, I tried to move on, I tried to move forward but I couldn't! 
 You know, that kind of thing, it's like an infection. 
 You just can't seem to shake it. 
 Knowing that my wee Gracie... 
 My wee baby was carrying a child with her own brother. 
 With her own brother, Moira. 
 How could you? 
 Because of you, Adam and Grace would have been living in sin. 
 It wasn't her, Bill... It was you. 
 Don't blame others for what you've done. 
 I tried to talk to him. 
 You hear me, Louise? 
 I tried to talk to him. I told him he was wrong. 
 If only he'd listened. 
 You're joking, right? 
 You can't be... 
 It's no joke! 
 What are you doing? 
 This is BULLSHIT! 
 Don't take that attitude with me! Do you hear me? 
 OK. If you don't believe me, here, here, take it! 
 Go on, take it! 
 Carry on and you're going straight to hell! 
 'They went on their honeymoon anyway. He called me, again and again. He said it didn't matter. He loved her. And nothing was going to change that. "Love". In whose name we all too often do our worst. Can you imagine how that feels? To watch your little girl grow up... To love her more than life itself. And for her to be... corrupted.' 
 Hey, Gracie, it's me. 
 Listen, I'm in Edinburgh for a couple of days, you know, I was just wondering if you wanted to meet up? 
 You know, I need to... 
 Oh, I see. 
 How long for? 
 No, no, no, it's all right. 
 No, no, ring me when you get back. 
 Ring me in a few days. 
 It's all right, it's all right, love. 
 OK, OK. 
 Bye-bye. Bye. 
 'She said she was out of town for a few days. But now I know she was lying. She just... didn't want to see her old man. Had her life to lead, you know. If she'd just been honest, things would've been different.' 
 I'll take that phone to start with. 
 Come on! 
 Come on! Do you want to stab me? 
 Come on! 
 Come on! Come on, do it if you're going to do it! 
 How do you like that, huh? How do you like that? Huh?! 
 You thought you'd rob a drunken old man, but I deal with bloody filthy animals every day of the week. 
 Do you hear me?! 
 You're no different! 
 Get away. 
 'I was desperate. I didn't see a way out. But I just knew it had to end. It had to stop.' 
 How would you like to make three grand? 
 What? 
 I'm serious, listen to me. 
 How would you like to make three grand? 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. Look, look... 
 .. there's 15 hundred here. 
 15 hundred quid. I was going to buy supplies with this tomorrow. 
 But it's yours, do you hear me? 
 Cos there's a lad, there's a lad I know, he's done a really bad thing and he has to be stopped. 
 For good. Do you hear me? 
 Do you understand me? 
 No, no man, I don't do that sort of thing. 
 Five grand! Five. Five -- please. 
 I know you need it. Please. 
 Yeah, OK. 
 You get the rest when it's done, all right. 
 Now I'll meet you back here next week. 
 Same time, same place. 
 All right? 
 'Grace came home the following night. She wasn't supposed to be there. He must have seen pictures of me with Adam and Grace in the flat. Must've looked around and found our address somehow. And ended up here.' 
 'Maybe he wanted the rest of the money, I don't know. I realised something, in all the panic.' 
 I need the bathroom. 
 'I still had my knife in my pocket from the night before. I wasn't thinking, I just didn't know what to do with it. So I kept it. So I knew where it was. And I thought... Just to be safe... Your boy Rob... He was so angry. I thought maybe if it all did come out... and people ended up finding out what we did... Maybe I'd have a way out. An escape.' 
 'I just wanted them to stop' because it was ungodly. 
 It was ungodly. 
 She had a kind heart, our Gracie. She was an innocent. 
 And I wanted her to stay that way, Moira. 
 I wanted her to stay that way. That's-that's all. 
 The things we do... 
 God in heaven, the things we do to protect the ones we love. 
 To survive. 
 Bill, no... 
 Yes, do it! Do it. 
 Come on, do it. Do it! 
 Mum! Mum! 
 Do it! 
 I guess it'll be the first decent thing you've done! 
 Yes, it will be. My boy, my boy... Your own daughter... and our grandchild! 
 Go on, do it, Bill! 
 Their blood is on your hands, Bill! Pull the trigger! Pull it! 
 Pull it! Pull it! Pull it! 
 Pull it! 
 It's not all my fault. 
 And I can't, I can't. I can't. 
 I can't. I can't... 
 You coward. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 It'll be fine, Mum. 
 Where did all this composure come from? 
 Definitely not you. 
 Juliet. 
 Sweetheart, I'm just going to talk to Andrew for a minute. 
 But we're in the queue... 
 You keep our place. 
 OK. 
 How'd you find me? 
 I knew you were booked to go to Mumbai. I figured... that you'd decided to go early. 
 I never thought you were listening when I talked about all this. 
 Oh, yeah. I listen. 
 I appreciate you keeping the rest of the team outside. I need a minute to talk to Maddy to try and explain. 
 If that's all right? 
 There is no team, Juliet. Just me. 
 When I started in this job, I had so much fire in me, you know? 
 I thought putting bad people away changed things. 
 But over time, that way of thinking... It goes, you know? 
 Seeing murderers who walk because a search warrant's been overturned by some defence lawyer trying to make a career. 
 Seeing abusive husbands who might get two months if you get lucky and then they're right back out beating the crap out of their missus again. 
 Seeing the same thing happening again and again... 
 You said I checked out a while back. Maybe I did. 
 Or maybe I just got tired of going round in circles. 
 I did it. I took those drugs and sold them. 
 Maddy needs this operation. I did it to give her a chance... 
 I figured that. That's why I'm here on my own. 
 It's up to you what you do next. 
 It's not about me. 
 It never is, is it? 
 Good luck with the operation. 
 Andrew... 
 You'd better get going. Don't want to miss your flight. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 What was that all about? 
 Nothing. 
 Just saying goodbye. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I... 
 I tried to come and see you earlier but I just couldn't. 
 It's OK, it's OK. I get it, I get it. 
 Why did you confess? 
 I thought I was protecting you. 
 What? What are we doing if we can't trust each other? 
 We were going to end it, weren't we? 
 I mean, before everything that happened to me and you were there for me and I needed you... and I couldn't have asked for more. 
 But we... We've been broken for a long time. 
 But I can, erm, I could try harder... 
 Just let it go, Rob. 
 I don't need protecting any more. 
 You're bright and early this morning, my love. 
 I couldn't really sleep. 
 I was up all night, thinking... 
 I... 
 I can't, Meredith. I'm so sorry, I can't do it. 
 I understand. 
 It's nothing to do with right and wrong, it's nothing to do with getting caught, even. 
 Christ, I'll probably be going to jail anyway. 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean, sometimes you just have to do what's right for you. 
 Despite what the world says. 
 We make choices. And we have to live with them. 
 I didn't know. I didn't know. 
 If I'd known... I'm so sorry. 
 'We have to choose which way we go. What we do. And dear God, if we make the wrong choice... it can destroy us. Because everything we do has consequences.'

 Please!

 I'm here to help people.
