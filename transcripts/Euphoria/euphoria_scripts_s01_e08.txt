 WOMAN: Go ahead, Rue. 
  - (MUSIC PLAYS) 
  - RUE: I met someone. 
  She's helped. 
  Now, I want to stay clean. 
  - So, thank you. 
  - (APPLAUSE) 
  LESLIE: I'm really proud of you, Rue. 
  - You've come a long way. 
  - (SCREAMING) 
  Just take your time. 
  You're delicate. 
  RUE: Every time I feel good, I think it'll last forever. 
  These states will wax and wane. 
  I think I need your help. 
  RUE: In bad times, there would be good times. 
  (GIGGLING) 
  But also, in the good times NATE JACOBS: You're f*cking dead to me. 
  RUE: There would be bad times. 
  You look different. 
  I miss the old Kat. 
  FEZCO: Leave Rue and her friends alone. 
  Is that a threat? 
  RUE: I guess it's true. 
  Life is always this way. 
  You're okay, baby. 
  You're okay. 
  RUE: One of the benefits of showing up at the hospital in the middle of the night with a kidney infection is that the first thing they do NURSE: Take this with a full cup of water. 
  RUE: is give you something to bring down your fever and subdue the agonizing pain you're in. 
  - Is this Vicodin? 
  - Yes. 
  - Five milligrams? 
  - Uh, yes. 
  RUE: I know what you're all thinking. 
  (SIGHS) 
  I, um, I got my wisdom teeth taken out, like, a year ago, and they gave me Vicodin. 
  It It just wasn't It wasn't good for me. 
  It really, really upsets my stomach. 
  - NURSE: Oh. 
  Okay. 
  - Yeah. 
  I think I'll just go with plain Tylenol. 
  Are you sure? 
  Kidney infections are extremely painful. 
  I'm sure. 
  Unless (SIGHS) 
  I can't quite remember what they put me on instead. 
  It was, like I don't know, it sounded like a candy name. 
  It was like, uh, like Roxi - (WHISPERS): like Roxis - Roxicet? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, that's it. 
  Roxicet. 
  Yeah. 
  I'll go with that. 
  7. 
  5 milligrams. 
  NURSE: Okay. 
  Let me check with the doctor. 
  Thanks. 
  RUE: It's not a relapse if it's warranted. 
  It's a hall pass. 
  (WHISPERS): God, please don't get in the way. 
  DOCTOR: According to the paperwork that your mother filled out, it appears that you have some pretty extreme substance abuse issues. 
  So, I think you're right. 
  We should just stick with Tylenol. 
  (EXHALES) 
  Huh. 
  Okay, yeah. 
  You know, if I ever come back here with cancer, - I really hope you're not my doctor. 
  - (DOCTOR LAUGHS) 
  - Uh-huh, yeah, I'm serious. 
  - (DOCTOR LAUGHS) 
  Wait. 
  Can I Can I still get the Vicodin? 
  They put me on Cipro, which is the antibiotic they give to people that are exposed to anthrax, started me on Lexapro, which is one of the few antidepressants - that doesn't make me crazier. 
  - (GULPS, SIGHS) 
  And kept me there for three days. 
  - It was actually really nice. 
  - (IMITATES IV DRIPPING) 
  I love hospitals. 
  If I could spend the rest of my life in a hospital, I would. 
  - Hey. 
  - Because when you're in a hospital, - you have zero responsibilities. 
  - (LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
  They make sure you eat, sleep, stay hydrated, and if anything bad happens, there's always a doctor nearby. 
  Thank you. 
  It's also the best place to be in the event of a mass shooting, unless the gunman kills all the surgeons. 
  The point is, I had zero anxiety. 
  WOMAN (ON TV): Gel enhancement, gel enhancement nails. 
  WOMAN 2 (ON TV): What are gel enhancement nails? 
  Fake nails? 
  - WOMAN (ON TV): Yes, fake nails. 
  - (BABY SCREAMING) 
  RUE: Then at nighttime, when everyone's asleep, I close my eyes and imagine all the little beeps to be the sounds of birds, and the lukewarm air blowing through the vent to be a warm breeze. 
  Your hospital bed can sort of feel like a poolside chair on a hot summer night in the Caribbean. 
  (WAVES SWASHING) 
  (SIGHS) 
  Plus, Jules came to visit. 
  Did all this happen because I left? 
  No. 
  You promise? 
  Yeah, I promise. 
  I've felt like this my whole life, Jules. 
  Not all the time, but sometimes. 
  You make it better, though. 
  (MONITORS BEEPING STEADILY) 
  I'm sorry. 
  For what? 
  For not telling you the truth. 
  RUE: For everyone who was calling me manic, I was, like, 92 percent correct. 
  But something was different about Jules. 
  Rue, you look f*cking amazing. 
  Jules, I am deeply uncomfortable right now. 
  Listen, you look hot. 
  And the fact that you usually dress like Seth Rogen, although you make it cute sometimes, like, it crushes my soul. 
  RUE: I don't dress like Seth Rogen. 
  When was the last time you didn't wear a hoodie and sweatpants? 
  I don't know, like now. 
  Exactly. 
  Which is why we're gonna finish. 
  (RUE GRUNTS) 
  It was, like, the most amazing weekend ever. 
  I legit cannot stop thinking about it, you know. 
  It was, like, the first time (SNIFFS) 
  I ever felt like I had a family, that wasn't my dad, or, like, you, kind of. 
  And, oh, my God. 
  Rue you would die for Anna. 
  - RUE: Who's Anna? 
  - She's just, like, next level. 
  I don't know. 
  Did you guys, like, hook up or something? 
  (SNIFFS) 
  Yeah. 
  It was kind of crazy. 
  We went to the club, and the energy was, like, crazy in there. 
  It, like, matched hers, and then I was feelin' it. 
  And she just, like, grabbed me and sort of like, pushed me down, and like, kissed me. 
  And she f*ckin' bit me. 
  What do you mean she bit you? 
  Like, when we were hooking up, she, like, fully bit me. 
  - (UNZIPS) 
  - Look. 
  Oh. 
  Okay. 
  - Did it, like, feel good? 
  - Yeah, it felt amazing. 
  - (ZIPPING) 
  - That's it, she just Has anyone ever done that to you? 
  No. 
  - Do you want to see what it feels like? 
  - I don't know. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  - Ow! 
  - What? 
  - Ow! 
  - You don't like it? 
  I don't think so. 
  I see. 
  But you like it. 
  I liked it. 
  I don't know. 
  You've gotta meet these kids. 
  'Cause I swear, you would f*ckin' flourish in that energy. 
  I've never felt anything like it. 
  There. 
  Mm. 
  I missed you so much. 
  You look beautiful. 
  Thanks. 
  You, too. 
  By the way, f*ck Nate Jacobs. 
  - f*ck Nate Jacobs. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  I know you're not supposed to say this kind of sh1t out loud, but if I ever had the chance I would f*ckin' - (NATE SCREAMING) 
  - (GUN FIRING) 
  - (FLESH SIZZLING) 
  - What a f*ckin' pussy. 
  (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
  Oh! 
  Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night Dance until the morning light Forget about the worries on your mind You can leave them all behind To the beat of the rhythm of the night Oh, the rhythm of the night Oh! 
  Hi. 
  I'm Leslie, Rue's mom. 
  ALL: Hi, Leslie. 
  They asked me to write a letter about what your addiction has cost us as a family, and as I sat down last night to write it, I couldn't stop thinking about the day you were born. 
  Holding you in my arms for the first time, looking down at you, your sweet, beautiful face I had never felt so much love and joy in my entire life. 
  And I thought that what if in that moment I heard a voice, some omniscient narrator who said, "Here's what's going to happen. 
  Your daughter is gonna be funny, and smart, and outgoing, You'll see it instantly, from a young age. 
  " - Are you guys drinking wine? 
  - I mean, barely. 
  We were waiting for you to leave so we could get into the hard stuff. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - (RUE CHUCKLES) 
  That's cool. 
  I'm not triggered or anything. 
  Aah. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  It's a joke. 
  Okay, let's take some pictures. 
  Come on. 
  LESLIE: "She'll be charismatic and make friends easily. 
  " Aw, you guys look so cute. 
  LESLIE: "She'll be kind and sensitive. 
  Maybe too sensitive. 
  She won't be an easy child. 
  She'll struggle. 
  " Just walk in, and hold your head up high, baby. 
  LESLIE: "And in turn, you'll struggle to understand her. 
  " - SUZE: You look beautiful. 
  - I don't know. 
  LESLIE: "To understand what's going on inside of her head. 
  The night terrors that can't be interrupted. 
  The times after dinner where she'll just sit at the kitchen table and count the tiles over and over, until she hyperventilates. 
  " - Do you have a a date? 
  - KAT: No. 
  LESLIE: "To fight to hold her in your arms, to tell her it's okay. 
  " Do you think this makes me look stupid? 
  No, not in the least. 
  LESLIE: "To calm down. 
  The kicking. 
  The screaming. 
  The anxiety of being harmed. 
  The transitions from day to night, from home to school, from meal to meal. 
  Of losing her mother or father or little sister. 
  " CAL: Hey. 
  NATALIE: You guys have such a beautiful home. 
  MARSHA: Aw, thank you. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - You look beautiful. 
  - Thanks. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  - That's an understatement. 
  - LESLIE: "Of being alone. 
  " (WHISPERS): Hey. 
  I really like her. 
  LESLIE: "The panic attacks, mood swings, confusion, disorganization. 
  " - SONIA: Have fun, mija. 
  - I will. 
  (GIRLS LAUGHING, CHATTERING) 
  - Look at you! 
  - Oh, my God! 
  LESLIE: "And all that rage. 
  Not just at you, but at herself. 
  And the tough part is" Aah! 
  You want some, Cass? 
  LESLIE: "you'll feel as helpless to help her as she does herself. 
  " - What is it? 
  - Gatorade and Everclear. 
  LESLIE: "You'll make mistakes. 
  Small ones and big ones. 
  " f*ck it. 
  MADDY: f*ck it. 
  Aah. 
  LESLIE: "You'll look for help from people who aren't helpful. 
  Or who don't actually understand what's happening. 
  " (CLICKS) 
  LESLIE: "And the guilt will never leave you. 
  " (SOFTLY) 
 : Love you, Grandma. 
  LESLIE: But if you remain calm and patient, if you listen closely, you'll begin to understand her more. 
  " You okay? 
  Yeah, I'm just having an asthma thing. 
  LESLIE: "The counting, the repetition, the need for symmetry. 
  That if you kiss her left cheek before bed, you have to kiss her right cheek. 
  And her forehead. 
  Then her chin. 
  That it's about balance, stability. 
  The need to organize her feelings and thoughts, so she can breathe easier. 
  " - I feel really good about tonight. 
  - MADDY AND LEXI: Really? 
  Yeah. 
  I mean I was thinking this is the first time since the beginning of high school that I haven't, like, been in love with somebody. 
  Honestly, I love that for you. 
  (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) 
  I've always, like, really been into pickup trucks. 
  You can take your shoes off the dash. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  LESLIE: "And there will be moments of relief - in her and in you. 
  " - (LAUGHING, CHATTERING) 
  "Moments that feel so normal and calm, and rewarding that you'll find yourself praying they last forever. 
  " (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
  LESLIE: "Even though she's only a child, and all the hard parts have yet to even come. 
  " Kat. 
  Hi. 
  Wow. 
  (DOGS BARKING) 
  (BARKING CONTINUING) 
  (ENGINE STARTS) 
  They jaws dropping He take me shopping, Robin jeans CASSIE: What if these are, like, the big moments in life? 
  Like, my mom always talks about how high school was like this big, monumental part of her life. 
  But I cannot imagine being 40 and looking back at this, like, "Wow. 
  " Yeah, but that's because most people peak in high school. 
  I definitely haven't peaked, so I feel like I'm not even a person yet. 
  Yeah, I'm definitely at, like, 25 percent peakness. 
  I feel like I'm at a hundred. 
  But I can definitely get to 150. 
  Honestly, I never thought I'd make it this far. 
  What do you mean? 
  I don't know. 
  I just always had, like, this overwhelming anxiety that something bad would happen. 
  MADDY: In all fairness, last summer, there were, like, three weeks where I thought you were dead. 
  Okay, but she's been sober for, like, three months. 
  Weren't you in rehab, like, six months ago? 
  Uh, yeah. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  CASSIE: Maybe people are nostalgic about high school 'cause it's, like, the last time in their life that they get to dream. 
  (PHONE BUZZES) 
  CASSIE: After this is just bad jobs, and bills, and bad husbands. 
  Maybe I'm generalizing, but I don't know. 
  Do you guys get what I mean? 
  I don't know. 
  I kind of feel the opposite. 
  I feel like high school's super f*cking suffocating. 
  - CASSIE: Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  Hmm. 
  (PHONE BUZZES) 
  I'll be right back. 
  When we land, they clear port Tell the driver I got a show, Fifth classy shot Versace stomp (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

  My wrist dancing, neck dancing Nails dancing, my ears dancing These bitches dance, they pussy poppin' They jaws droppin' First of all, ew. 
  Second of all, ew. 
  - NATE (PANTING): Just a second. 
  - MADDY: Are you, like, not hard? 
  (PANTING) 
  NATE: Not yet. 
  f*ck. 
  It It doesn't really feel like you're hard. 
  NATE: I am. 
  I'm I am hard. 
  Nate, this isn't something you just, like, lie about. 
  Maddy, I just got a lot of sh1t on my mind, okay? 
  MADDY: Like right now? 
  Like, during s*x? 
  - Maddy, stop. 
  - Stop what? 
  Talking. 
  Stop talking. 
  f*ck. 
  Okay, I'm officially turned off. 
  Just get off me. 
  - Why the f*ck are we even having s*x? 
  - We weren't. 
  NATE: You know what your f*cking problem is? 
  You can't keep your f*cking mouth shut. 
  Yeah, and you can't keep your dick hard. 
  Maybe the reason I can't keep my dick hard is because everyone at school is spreading these f*cking rumors about me. 
  MADDY: They're not rumors. 
  They're facts. 
  You literally had, like, 40 different guys' dicks in your phone. 
  - I told you not to f*cking tell anyone. 
  - Yeah, well, I told people before you told me not to tell anyone. 
  Yeah, but you told them out of f*cking context. 
  Really? 
  What is the context? 
  I'd tell you, but I don't even f*cking trust you anymore. 
  Kind of like how you f*ck me, but you're not hard anymore? 
  Huh? 
  Keep talking. 
  Come on, keep f*cking talking. 
  Keep talking. 
  Huh? 
  - (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
  - (SOBBING) 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  Look, Nate, I don't mind if you're into guys. 
  - I'm not into f*cking guys, Maddy. 
  - Sexuality is a spectrum. 
  f*ck. 
  What the f*ck are you talking about? 
  It's not like anyone's 100 percent straight or 100 percent gay. 
  Oh, that is 100 percent bullshit.

  Hey, look, I don't really know you. 
  You might be a good girl, you might not. 
  But I do know my son. 
  - Do you? 
  - I'm not defending him. 
  But I do want to protect him, and what I know is this relationship you two have is not sustainable, and it's only a matter of time before it takes the both of you down. 
  Sometimes two people in the universe who aren't meant for each other find each other. 
  You're a beautiful girl, and a smart one. 
  - It's time to let go. 
  - (SCOFFS) 
  Your whole family is so f*cking weird.

  This is the first game back for the Hawks starting QB Nate Jacobs. 
  It could be the final game of his high school career unless he can bring home the W, and get this struggling team to regionals. 
  ANNOUNCER 1: Speaking of struggles, he's had a lot off the field. 
  It's been a big topic of conversation, not only around the team, but also in this community. 
  Here's the big question Can he overcome this? 
  ANNOUNCER 2: I think Nate Jacobs is gonna unify this ball club. 
  ANNOUNCER 1: Thankfully his teammates have his back.

  Thank you? 
  - I feel a little stupid, so - (CHUCKLES) 
  Can I ask you a question? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Why don't you kiss me? 
  I kiss you. 
  No. 
  Why don't you, like, kiss-kiss me?

  It's But that night at the carnival when you were flirting with that girl, I just I don't know. 
  I just had, like, this reaction, and I just, like, hated you. 
  Whether that's fair or not, I don't know. 
  I But, um I guess I just I guess I just wanted to hurt you as much as I imagined you'd hurt me. 
  And I know that sounds juvenile, but it's true, and I wouldn't even be saying this to you, because you're actually not like this. 
  You're actually really kind, and you're actually really nice, and I'm just I just I'm so shitty, and I just wish I could go back Kat, I liked you since I sat down next to you. 
  You know, and I know that you think there's, like, zero chance that we're gonna be together forever, and, uh I don't know. 
  I guess, we're both juniors, so you're probably right about that. 
  You know, I mean, like, is one of us gonna get hurt? 
  Yeah. 
  Probably. 
  But I'll do my best to make sure that it's me. 
  I'm crying.

  Why do I feel like you're the reason Fez's house got raided? 
  You know, sometimes, when you do illegal sh1t, bad things happen to you. 
  You've never done anything illegal, Nate? 
  You talking about your friend Jules? 
  No, actually, I'm talking about your dad. 
  I just want to make sure you've given it some forethought. 
  I know over the years you've lost some brain cells. 
  I wouldn't want you to say something you might regret. 
  What are you gonna do? 
  You gonna ruin my life? 
  I f*cking promise you I can do that a lot better than you can. 
  - What do you want, Rue? 
  - I want you to leave Fez alone. 
  I want you to leave Jules alone. 
  If you ever f*ck with them again, I'll destroy your life. 
  I'll destroy your dad's life. 
  I'll f*cking burn your whole sh1t to the ground. 
  'Cause I personally have no problem walking into any police station and telling them that Nate Jacobs's daddy likes to f*ck little kids. 
  You look very pretty tonight. 
  Are you sure that Jules told you everything? 
  You know what I like about her? 
  She has these very real dreams. 
  And I seriously think that she's going to achieve them. 
  If you look at everyone inside, most of them are going to go on to lives these lives that aren't even f*cking worth mentioning. 
  Not Jules. 
  What about you? 
  Honestly, - I don't really give a f*ck. 
  - Yeah, I gathered that. 
  That's probably why you're spending all your time with someone who's going to leave you and won't even remember who the f*ck you are in ten years.

  Moments that feel so normal, and calm, and rewarding that you'll find yourself praying they last forever. 
  Even though she's only a child, and all the hard parts have yet to even come. 
  And at the age of 16, she'll overdose, spend four days in a coma, and you won't know if she'll live or die. 
  But when she wakes up, she'll be given the opportunity to get clean, to become a different person, a better person. 
  Here's the toughest part. 
  No matter what you say, or do, or wish, the decision will be all hers. 
  And all you can do is hope she gives herself the chance that she deserves.
