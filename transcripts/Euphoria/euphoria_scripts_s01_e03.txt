 Engaged in sexual activity. 
  - Holy sh1t. 
  - RUE BENNETT: For the first time since getting out of rehab, I was feeling good about the world. 
  Keep your mouth shut. 
  These dudes ain't f*cking around. 
  MOUSE: Come on, just try it. 
  TEENAGE BOY: (DISTORTED) 
  You're so hot. 
  MADDY: I'm just trying to get back at my ex-boyfriend. 
  TYLER: Let me take you out tonight. 
  Hey, I'm Ethan. 
  I'm Kat. 
  WOMAN: Cassie's smitten like a kitten with you. 
  CHRIS MCKAY: Why you got to make everything so sexual? 
  - (PHONE PINGS) 
  - Euphoria - S01E03 "Made You Look" Rue: When Kat was 11 years old, she went on a family vacation to Sandals, Jamaica. 
  (Kat screaming) 
  I need help! 
  Someone get this jellyfish off me! 
  Help me! 
  Rue: She quickly discovered that she hated the ocean - But f*cking loved virgin piÃ±a coladas. 
  - Oh! 
  Feels so good! 
  Rue: Up until that moment, Kat had a relatively good life. 
  I mean, life wasn't amazing, but it's not like she fantasized about killing herself. 
  It was good enough. 
  She was popular enough, smart enough. 
  The only thing that was, like, actually amazing was Daniel. 
  Daniel was like a dream, like, gorgeous, like, really nice. 
  Like, the kind of boy that would text her every night before bed and say And the kind of boy that would meet her outside of school every morning just to make sure he could hold her hand as they walked down the hall. 
  She could never figure out why Daniel chose her, what Daniel actually liked or loved about her. 
  She just knew it felt really good. 
  - (bell ringing) 
  - Whatever. 
  It didn't matter. 
  - It's better not to jinx these things. 
  - (slurping) 
  - Can I have another one? 
  - Sure. 
  - Oh! 
  - (slurping) 
  Rue: During her eight-day stay on that stupid island, Kat drank 72 virgin piÃ±a coladas. 
  She was in heaven. 
  And then she got home. 
  Heavyweight champion of the world! 
  Oh, my God. 
  What happened? 
  Rue: When Kat had left for Jamaica, she was 107 pounds, when she returned, she weighed in at whopping (breath quivers) 
  - Kat: Get up. 
  - Rue: Despite being five-two, - which was tall for her age - (groaning) 
  her body was not prepared to house the extra 20 pounds. 
  - (groaning) 
  - Rue: It was noticeable. 
  (screaming) 
  (phone dings) 
  (sobbing) 
  Rue: Kat did her best to minimize the fallout. 
  (sighs) 
  (sighs) 
  - You're wearing two sweatshirts? 
  - No. 
  Rue: At least Daniel didn't make a big deal out of it. 
  That's why she liked him. 
  He didn't care about what people thought. 
  He liked her for whatever reasons he liked her, and 20 stupid pounds would never change that. 
  (bell rings) 
  Until fourth period. 
  It wasn't even in Daniel's handwriting. 
  It was Kendra Sutherland's. 
  Whatever. 
  f*ck her. 
  f*ck him. 
  She didn't actually love Daniel. 
  She was 11. 
  And when you're 11, you fall in love with, like, everyone and everything. 
  - It's not real love. 
  - (Kat sobbing softly) 
  Real love is when you can't exist without someone, when you'd rather die than be apart, and the whole world goes dark, and nothing else matters but the person standing in front of you. 
  I just want you to know I'm in. 
  I am all in. 
  For the first time in 140 years, I felt something I thought had been lost to me forever. 
  Say you'll wait for me. 
  We love each other. 
  Rue: That's real love, and those were real men. 
  Men who'd never leave her, -disappoint her, break her heart. 
  -(crunching) 
  Real men whose love would spark and ignite and inspire. 
  - - The summer before high school she started writing fan fiction. 
  By the year's end, she had become one of the most prolific smut writers on Tumblr. 
  She was known for her AU crossovers and her consistent NC-17 ratings. 
  But what made her famous was her story, "The First Night," a 7,000-word fic that was largely credited with starting the "Larry Stylinson" conspiracy theory. 
  Uh-oh, oh, oh! 
  That Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction were secretly f*cking. 
  "It's the first night of the 'Take Me Home' tour. 
  " (crowd cheering) 
  Musician: London, we've got a little song for you tonight! 
  Rue: "Louis was unusually nervous. 
  "His mouth was dry, palms sweating, "when suddenly, he felt the press of Harry's body from behind. 
  " Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
  Rue: "Harry can sense the nervous tension "running through Louis's stiff body. 
  - "'What are you doing?' - 'To calm your nerves. 
  ' "'You're my best mate, and this is what mates do for one another. 
  ' "'But Harry, what if someone sees?' "'Let them. 
  '" Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
  "As Harry takes Louis into his mouth with surprising ease, he begins to suck his cock with torturous finesse. 
  " Ooh Ooh! 
  Ooh! 
  (whistle trills) 
  Girl: Ugh. 
  Kat doesn't even have asthma. 
  She's just fat and doesn't wanna exercise. 
  (students laughing) 
  Rue: With 72 hours of publishing "The First Night," it had garnered 184,265 notes, and then three weeks later, Kat had amassed over 53,000 followers. 
  She had become extremely popular online. 
  No one in real life knew that she was famous. 
  Whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp And no one online knew that her life was actually super depressing. 
  - Maddy: Ew! 
  (Laughing) 
  Take those things off. 
  - - (girls chattering) 
  - She'd regularly fantasize about telling her followers how much she hated her school, her town, and how everyone in it was full of sh1t and a f*cking asshole. 
  She'd tell them to surround the school, show up right after the morning bell prepared for war. 
  - (warriors roaring) 
  - (bell ringing) 
  They'd demand the release of their queen. 
  And if anyone even hesitated (screaming, groaning) 
  The scary thing is, is they'd actually do it. 
  They'd do anything she asked. 
  That's how much they loved her. 
  Granted, they didn't know who she was or what she looked like. 
  - (speaking Dothraki) 
  - It's me, ThunderKitKat. 
  - (shouting in Dothraki) 
  - (warriors shouting) 
  -(Kat moaning on video) 
  - Rue: And then that video came out. 
  And they did see what she looked like, and they still loved her. 
  And not only did they love her, they wanted to f*ck her. 
  Tay Keith! 
  f*ck these niggas up! 
  Look, I just flipped a switch Flip-flip, I don't know nobody else that's doin' this Bodies start to drop, ay, hit the floor Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ay It's a Rollie, not a stopwatch, sh1t don't ever stop Smokin' on the chicken, the bass is kickin', my head is spinnin' Smokin' on the chicken, the bass is kickin', my head is spinnin' Smokin' on the chicken, the bass is kickin', my head is spinnin' This the flow that got the block hot sh1t, that's super hot Hey, I'm Rue. 
  I'm an addict. 
  All: Hi, Rue. 
  Rue: And I've been clean for 60 days. 
  (applause) 
  For the record, I'm not not telling the truth. 
  I've actually been doing really well. 
  Because the morning after that whole drug-dealer-face-tattoo fentanyl excursion, I, uh, got in a little bit of trouble Fez: Oh, sh1t. 
  (phone buzzes) 
  Rue: for disappearing for like 16 hours. 
  Leslie: Where have you been? 
  - I'm sorry. 
  My phone died. 
  - Bullshit. 
  You're doing drugs. 
  - I'm not doing drugs. 
  - Then where have you been? 
  And why weren't you answering you phone? 
  - And why are you sneaking into the house? 
  - I was with someone. 
  - Who? 
  - It does It doesn't matter, Mom. 
  It matters, Rue. 
  It matters. 
  You're doing drugs. 
  Gia, go back to sleep. 
  Rue, are you Are you okay? 
  Yeah, Gia, I'm fine. 
  You can go back to sleep. 
  She's okay, baby. 
  Okay, go to bed. 
  Good night. 
  I will not allow you to walk up into this house at 5:30 in the morning and lie to my face. 
  So tell me the truth right now. 
  Where were you? 
  Mom, I don't want to have to tell you everything that's going on in my life. 
  If you want to drug test me, just drug test me. 
  (urinating) 
  Rue: She wasn't the only person upset with me. 
  Jules: I'm not kidding, Rue. 
  I'm not trying to become best friends with someone who's gonna f*cking kill themself. 
  I know. 
  I didn't mean to do this. 
  I've been through, like enough traumatic sh1t in my life that I don't - I can't like - I get it. 
  I get it. 
  I don't want to be around you if you don't stop using drugs. 
  Okay. 
  I mean it. 
  I know. 
  I'll stop. 
  I promise. 
  I just need you to do me a favor. 
  You're not gonna like it. 
  (urinating) 
  You're still grounded until I don't even f*cking know. 
  What else is there? 
  I told you I wasn't lying. 
  (sighs) 
  Rue: So, I decided to stay clean. 
  And I have been, for a while. 
  But I've also been coming to this meeting for longer. 
  - Girl, it's your 60 days today, right? 
  -(Rue laughs) 
  Ah! 
  Oh, God. 
  So good! 
  Rue: Hmm, I don't know. 
  I just didn't want to depress anyone. 
  Plus, I really have been trying, and that counts for something. 
  Two months ago, I woke up from a comma. 
  I didn't know what happened, but from the looks of my mother and little sister's faces, I knew that whatever it was, whatever I did it wasn't good. 
  It scared them. 
  It really scared them. 
  And, uh, at that moment, I decided to at least try and change. 
  'Cause I owe it to them. 
  I owe it to everyone I love, and everyone who loves me. 
  The hardest part, uh, has been feeling like I owe it to myself. 
  (Sighs) 
  And, uh, maybe that'll get easier. 
  I hope it will. 
  Thank you. 
  (applause) 
  Rue: (sighs) 
  I don't know. 
  It's just been a really weird couple of weeks. 
  I didn't know it at the time, but Jules was falling in love. 
  - (bell rings) 
  - (students chattering) 
  It's gonna take a bit of work - Oh, oh, work - - Now that you're here - Whoa, oh, work - 'Cause people come and go - - - But I think you should know - That I - - - I think this will work Ooh, ooh - Ooh, ooh! 
  - - Ooh, ooh - - Ooh, ooh! 
  - - - It's gonna take a little time - But with you by my side - - I won't let go - - Till I've got what's mine - - ' Cause people come and go - - But you should know - - That I That I - - I'm takin' it slow - - It's gonna take a bit of work - Ooh, ooh - Oh, oh, work - - Now that you're here - - Whoa, work - Ooh, ooh Jules: I'm not saying I'm in love. 
  I'm just saying I really, really, really like him. 
  - Who? 
  ShyGuy118? 
  - His name is Tyler. 
  It doesn't really matter. 
  They're both little fuckboy names. 
  He's not. 
  For real, like, he's so sweet. 
  - What school does he go to? 
  - St. 
  Mary's. 
  Ew. 
  Private school. 
  You're just jealous. 
  Rue: Aside from that being a really shitty thing to say, it's also not true. 
  She'd just been acting weird all week. 
  I'm not jealous. 
  I mean, you've been acting weird, like, all week. 
  - What? 
  - Yeah, like, every time I'm on my phone, you just stop talking. 
  You're literally like my dad. 
  Sorry. 
  It's fine. 
  You wanna see his dick? 
  My head is spinnin', smokin' on the chicken, the bass is kickin' My head is spinnin', smokin' on the chicken, the bass is kickin' This a Rollie, not a stopwatch - sh1t don't ever stop - f*ck. 
  Smokin' on the chicken, the bass is kickin', my head is spinnin' Ew. 
  The bass is kickin', my head is spinnin' Girl: Stick it out! 
  (laughing, chattering on video) 
  Girl: What a tiny twink! 
  Guy (on video): Shut it. 
  Just give it What the f*ck? 
  Guy (on video): f*cking step on it. 
  It's too small, - It could never satisfy you. 
  - Kat! 
  Dinner! 
  I'll get her. 
  (muttering): Ay, Jesus, girl. 
  Kat! 
  Hey! 
  What? 
  Take pictures of your toes later. 
  Dinner's on the table. 
  And I feel okay, okay, okay, okay Okay, okay, okay - Bye. 
  Love you. 
  See ya. 
  - Maddy: (sighs) 
  I can't believe I haven't even told you, like, how insane my parents are being. 
  All week long, she's just been going on and on - (phone buzzes) 
  - about how much she hates my dad. 
  - (phone buzzing) 
  - I'm just like, you can't do this to me. 
  He's my dad. 
  I don't know. 
  I know he has issues, but so does she. 
  And he's not telling me sh1t about her. 
  -(phone buzzing) 
  - Nate: Yeah. 
  That's, like, not cool of your mom to put you in that situation. 
  Yeah, but if I say that, then she's gonna make me - an enemy, too. 
  - (phone buzzing) 
  Literally the last thing I need right now is - (phone buzzing) 
  - Who keeps texting you? 
  - My dad. 
  - Well, do you want me to respond? 
  - He's texted you like 15 times. 
  -(phone buzzes) 
  No, I'll just call him later. 
  (phone buzzing) 
  I mean, it's huge, right? 
  Mm Don't front. 
  It's a big dick. 
  You know what? 
  It may be, but, uh, we can't really tell, 'cause it's just f*cking floating in space. 
  - So? 
  - So, there's no way to compare scale. 
  You know, if there's a f*cking hand in the frame, at least you can be, like, okay, it's about the size of an adult male hand. 
  Or like twice the size. 
  Or a f*cking fraction of the size. 
  Rue. 
  This is an objectively big dick. 
  (bell dings) 
  Rue: Some people say that eyes are the windows to the soul. 
  I disagree. 
  I think it's your dick and how you f*cking photograph it. 
  Aah! 
  There are two different types of dick pics. 
  Solicited, and unsolicited. 
  Solicited makes up for about one percent of all dick pics sent and received. 
  But within that one percent, there are three categories. 
  Jules? 
  Terrifying, horrifying, and acceptable. 
  I know what some of you are thinking. 
  Rue, terrifying and horrifying sound like the same thing. 
  Well, to a trained eye, it could be the difference between - (heavy metal song playing) 
  - Yo, sorry about the mess. 
  My mom's, like, out of town? 
  (whispers): A basic hygiene issue. 
  - (bell dings) 
  - Rue: Or (speaking gibberish) 
  (buzzer drones) 
  Rue: a life or death situation. 
  So, here are some key things to look out for. 
  All right! 
  Uncapped deodorant touching the floor. 
  Horrifying. 
  Jug of lotion. 
  Terrifying. 
  Dirty fingernails. 
  Horrifying. 
  A medieval sword? 
  Run-for-your-fucking-life terrifying. 
  So, what constitutes this rarefied, sought after, acceptable dick pic? 
  All right! 
  Wow. 
  Okay. 
  So his pen1s is the size of an Evian bottle. 
  - Well, the lighting is nice. 
  - Jules: Mm-hmm. 
  - Uh, his room looks clean. 
  - Jules: Mm-hmm. 
  - Looks well-groomed. 
  - Right? 
  Okay, yeah. 
  I'm beginning to understand the appeal. 
  Thank you. 
  But here's the thing. 
  I, like, sent him a few pics from the school bathroom during class - because he asked me to - Wait. 
  Like, nudes? 
  I can't talk about it. 
  But I need your help. 
  Yeah. 
  Sure. 
  Whatever. 
  I want, like, good, professional partial nudes. 
  Like, classy, but not too arty. 
  Like, like I took them with very little thought or effort but could also be in f*cking MOMA. 
  Rue: Be cool, Rue. 
  - Yeah. 
  It's, like, easy. 
  Whatever. 
  - Jules: Yeah. 
  (Kat muttering) 
  Excuse me. 
  Sorry. 
  Sorry. 
  - Cashier: Hey. 
  - Hi. 
  Look at you, still doing the grapefruit diet. 
  Yep, I literally wanna die. 
  Yeah. 
  It's only bad for the first two weeks. 
  Then your stomach shrinks, and you adjust, and you are reborn. 
  (laughs) 
  Oh, wow. 
  Can't wait. 
  - How much? 
  - Uh, that'll be $3. 
  25. 
  Yo, can you please, maybe hurry the f*ck up? 
  Huh. 
  Um, could I pay you the rest tomorrow? 
  I'm sorry, baby. 
  There's a policy. 
  Hey, Kat, I, uh, I gotcha. 
  - Oh, hi. 
  - Hey. 
  How you doing? 
  - I'm good. 
  How are you? 
  - Sweet. 
  I'm good, I'm good. 
  - Hey, Erika. 
  How much was it? 
  - Erika: Uh, $3. 
  25. 
  I have, like, $1. 
  25 here. 
  Do you, um For a grapefruit? 
  Do you want Do you want something else to eat? 
  Oh, no, no, no. 
  No, 'cause if you don't have enough money on you right now, I can totally I can get you, like, some actual food, or She's doing the grapefruit diet. 
  It's not easy. 
  Don't tempt her. 
  Okay. 
  Cool. 
  All right. 
  Um - Thank you. 
  - Yeah, well, um I'll see you in, uh, biology. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Um, thanks. 
  - Yeah. 
  Sure. 
  - Goodbye. 
  - Aw, man, do it upright. 
  - (mutters): f*ck it. 
  - Aw, you got moked out. 
  - You suck, man. 
  (laughter) 
  Maddy: So you're basically in a long-distance relationship. 
  No, we like FaceTime every night. 
  Aw, that's so sweet. 
  You guys are full-on in love. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Stop! 
  - I really like you. 
  - McKay (on phone): I like you, too, Cassie. 
  I like you more. 
  Ew. 
  We are not in love. 
  But he did invite me to spend the weekend with him. 
  Maddy: Like, the whole weekend? 
  - Cassie: Yeah, like Friday and Saturday night. 
  - - Wait, is your mom gonna let you go? 
  - It doesn't matter. 
  I'll just kill her in her sleep if she doesn't let me. 
  BB: Sounds like true love to me. 
  - Cassie: Whatever. 
  She can't stop me. 
  - - Maddy: Honestly, I love your mom - - Cassie: Yeah, well try living with her. 
  - - (girls chattering) 
  - Do any of you guys know how Bitcoin works? 
  - Hmm. 
  No. 
  - No. 
  But you know who probably does? 
  It's a worldwide cryptocurrency and digital payment system. 
  Kat: I literally have no clue what you're talking about. 
  Well, there's no easier way to explain it. 
  Look, why don't you just tell us what you're trying to do, and we can tell you how we can help. 
  - Kat: Um - Unless it's human trafficking. 
  I don't f*ck with human trafficking. 
  I'm not human trafficking. 
  Yeah, us, neither. 
  Okay. 
  Um I was just wondering if it's like, a good way to anonymously get money online. 
  Ashtray: That's literally what it's made for. 
  (Scoffs) 
  (mutters): Dumb ass. 
  Cool. 
  I feel like that's it. 
  Rue: No, it's good, it's good. 
  I like it. 
  Finishing, eight or nine? 
  Tell me it's the perfect time Wait. 
  Yeah, that really does look like I took it.

  - Yeah. 
  Hiding from the rainfall Come into my bedroom, come into my bedroom Come into my bedroom, come into my bedroom - Got it.

  Like, hot enough that you'd want to f*ck me, or like, cute? 
  Like like me? 
  Or like him, me? 
  Either. 
  Yeah. 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Should I, like, show more? 
  Like - Rue: I don't know. 
  - What do you think? 
  I I mean, it's whatever. 
  Whatever you, um, like to do. 
  I mean, what do you think, though? 
  Come into my bedroom, come into my bedroom - Um f*ck.

  - (phone buzzing) 
  - It's my mom. 
  Hey, Mom. 
  I'm just at Jules's house. 
  Um, well I have NA tonight. 
  So, like nine-thirty-ish? 
  Okay. 
  Uh, love you, too. 
  Bye. 
  - NA? 
  - Yeah. 
  Narcotics anonymous. 
  Wait. 
  You've been clean for like, two weeks, right? 
  -(murmurs): Yeah. 
  That's right. 
  - Rue! 
  - What? 
  - f*ck you, come here! 
  - What? 
  - You've been Come here! 
  Oh, my God! 
  (kissing) 
  I'm so proud of you. 
  Rue: I've never met anyone in my entire life like Jules. 
  (breathes deeply) 
  Um, I'm gonna go get a glass of water really quick. 
  Okay. 
  - Okay. 
  - Jules: Whatever, bitch. 
  - Rue: Oh, f*ck me. 
  - (water splashing) 
  (mutters): f*ck. 
  Oh Taking it all Taking it all Taking it all for love Uh I got to go. 
  - But, uh, love you. 
  - Okay. 
  - And I'll see you later. 
  - (kisses) 
  - Bye. 
  - Love you. 
  Rue: Love you, too. 
  Spend some time with it Make it under Spend some time with it Make it magic Spend some time with it To make under Don't know where to go I guess we'll keep it on the low There's just no cure anymore I guess we'll keep it on the low I've seen some better days Rue: And, uh, at that moment, I decided to at least try and change. 
  'Cause I owe it to them. 
  I owe it to everyone I love and everyone that loves me. 
  And, uh, maybe that'll get easier. 
  I hope it will. 
  Thank you. 
  (indistinct chattering) 
  Yo. 
  Sixty days, no small feat. 
  Rue: Thanks. 
  - Very moving share. 
  - Thank you. 
  Can I ask you something? 
  How'd you survive that OD? 
  - What do you mean? 
  - I mean, somebody had to save your life, right? 
  - My sister. 
  - Ali (whispers): Aw, man. 
  Older or younger? 
  Younger. 
  Um - I have to get home, so - Like 12, 13? 
  - I don't really understand what the point - Curiosity. 
  Yeah. 
  She was 13. 
  That's some heavy sh1t. 
  But, hey. 
  We've all done some bad sh1t in our lives, right? 
  Comes with the territory. 
  But, man, now you just got me thinking about what that does to a 13-year-old, a 13-year-old kid, who finds her big sister overdosed. 
  What that moment must do to somebody How it affects the rest of their lives, you know, how it affects their ability to trust. 
  Leaves it hard for them to get close to people, you know, relationships. 
  Makes it hard for them to fall in love. 
  Living with the fear that at any moment, the rug can be ripped out from under them, and they lose everything. 
  Especially the people that they love. 
  You ever think about that? 
  Yeah, probably f*cked up for life. 
  But, hey, you're gonna have to make peace with that. 
  Just like you're gonna have to make peace with the fact that you could be responsible for some sh1t like that, and then get up in front of a whole group of people who are struggling with the same issues, and lie about being clean. 
  You know what I'm saying?
