 MAN: You're beautiful. 
  Thank you. 
  I didn't know it at the time but Jules was falling in love. 
  JULES: I really like him. 
  Who? 
  Shyguy118? 
  JULES: His name is Tyler. 
  Who keeps texting you? 
  What the f*ck? 
  WOMAN: I love you. 
  - I love you more. 
  - WOMAN: I need your help. 
  I want professional partial nudes. 
  I've never met anyone like Jules. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm sorry I should go. 
  Let me know when you want to stop trying to kill yourself. 
  Whoo-hoo-hoo I don't understand why we have to drive seven hours to see a psychiatrist. 
  Because (SIGHS) 
  we want the best care possible for you. 
  RUE: When Jules was eleven years old, her mother took her on a road trip. 
  (EXHALING) 
  (EXHALING) 
  Whoo-hoo-hoo (JULES SIGHS) 
  Oh, oh! 
  - Wasn't Dali, like, a sexual predator? 
  - Was he? 
  I hadn't heard that before. 
  Would you like me to take it down? 
  No. 
  It's a cool painting. 
  It is a cool painting. 
  RUE: He was actually really sweet, though. 
  They talked for over an hour, and only later did Jules realize that she hadn't lied once. 
  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh RUE: After the session, they wanted to give her a tour of the Unit. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Well, what's the Unit? 
  DR. 
  KAY: Think of it like a second home, where children can learn how to feel better about themselves. 
  (HESITANTLY): Okay. 
  Let me give you a tour. 
  So, this is our common area, where we have group sessions, watch movies, play games, have art class. 
  Um, on Tuesdays we have canine therapy. 
  Uh, Thursdays we have music therapy. 
  (DR. 
  KAY CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) 
  (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
  - BOY: Dr. 
  Kay! 
  - Allan! 
  Suck my dick, you f*cking c**t! 
  DR. 
  KAY: Allan! 
  (BOY CURSING INDISTINCTLY) 
  (GRUNTING) 
  DR. 
  KAY: Usually there's two to a room, depending on how many patients are with us. 
  Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh So the kids live here? 
  For short periods of time. 
  And this is the quiet room. 
  I'm gonna f*cking rape you, Dr. 
  Kay! 
  - (POUNDS WALL) 
  - You just bought yourself another 30 minutes in the quiet room, Jesse. 
  (SPITS) 
  RUE: It was around then when Jules thought she had just about had enough of the tour. 
  I think I wanna go home. 
  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh RUE: And that's when Jules realized, this wasn't a tour at all. 
  It was an elaborate plan to admit her to a f*cking psychiatric hospital. 
  Mom! 
  Mom! 
  No, no, no, no, no! 
  (SCREAMING): No! 
  No! 
  No! 
  RUE: During the ensuing struggle, Jules accidentally scratched an RA across the face, which she felt really guilty about. 
  But quickly, that guilt turned into anger and that anger, into defeat. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Jules. 
  - How are you feeling? 
  - JULES: Better. 
  Good. 
  Good. 
  Why don't you tell the group a little about yourself and why you're here. 
  JULES: I don't know. 
  Maybe because I was, like, sad for a really long time. 
  What do you mean by a long time? 
  Maybe since I was seven or eight or something. 
  And I've been to see, like, a bunch of doctors. 
  I've been on, like, a bunch of medications, but nothing's really helped, so Maybe these mitts will do the trick. 
  - (PEN SCRIBBLES) 
  - And, Jules, do you self-injure? 
  RUE: The truth was, Jules hated herself. 
  (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) 
  RUE: She hated how her brain worked the way it would get stuck on a thought, - like choking. 
  - (COUGHS) 
  (COUGHING, GRUNTING) 
  DAVID: All right. 
  Keep present. 
  RUE: And it would just play on an infinite loop, until she couldn't think or breathe or stand to be alive. 
  DAVID (SOFTLY): This is hard, Jules. 
  You're going to get through it, okay? 
  RUE: She didn't just hate her brain, though. 
  She hated her body, not every part, just her shoulders, and her arms, and her hands. 
  Also her chest, her stomach, her thighs. 
  Her knees were the worst. 
  Plus her ankles, and her big, f*cking, stupid feet. 
  (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) 
  She hated her life, not because it was bad, but because when you hate your brain and your body, it's hard to enjoy the rest. 
  So, Jules developed a few coping mechanisms. 
  None of them healthy, and a few scary enough to land her in So, how are you liking the Unit? 
  It's okay. 
  - Are you making any friends? 
  - Not really. 
  Well, that'll change. 
  Wait. 
  Can you leave me the rest? 
  Sure. 
  (SIGHS) 
  (CRINKLING) 
  (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) 
  - This guy did some damage. 
  - JULES: Allan? 
  I did something really stupid. 
  Is everything okay? 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Please don't be mad at me. 
  Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh RUE: Eventually Jules got better and came home. 
  Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh RUE: But her mom got worse and went away. 
  Ooh-ooh-ooh RUE: And her dad quit his job to be closer to home, which she liked, 'cause she loved her dad. 
  By 13, she started to transition. 
  And by 16, Jules had gotten a little slutty. 
  And every guy was the same: cis, white, married, engaged, in long-term relationships, and always, always I mean, I'm a hundred percent straight. 
  Um, cool. 
  So do you like top? 
  - No. 
  - Cool. 
  'Cause that's, like, not my thing. 
  Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh RUE: Some were sweet. 
  Some were weird. 
  And a few were aggressive. 
  (GAGGING) 
  CAL: Spit. 
  RUE: And whenever anything got too uncomfortable - (CAL GRUNTS) 
  - (MUFFLED SHRIEK) 
  RUE: Jules would just imagine that she wasn't really herself, and this wasn't really her life. 
  She was just a character in a book or a movie or a show. 
  That none of it was real, and if it was, how did it matter? 
  It's not like her body ever really belonged to her in the first place. 
  (GRUNTS LOUDLY, PANTS) 
  (GRUNTS) 
  RUE: But f*ck it. 
  She'd save it for the memoirs. 
  'Cause that was the night she met her new best friend. 
  And although she had never really been in a relationship or even in, like, love, she imagined spending the rest of her life with her. 
  How they'd live together in some shitty New York apartment, and maybe date other people, but always sleep in the same bed. 
  She even said it to her once, which was probably a mistake, for, like, a lot of reasons. 
  Plus, that was before she fell for Tyler, like, hard, like, really hard. 
  (TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) 
  What are you smiling about? 
  I don't know. 
  Just life. 
  And I never felt so alone Felt so alone, no, no, no RUE: There's nothing I'm really passionate about. 
  You know, like, I'm not dying to say or do anything, really. 
  And every time I admit that to people, they're like, "Oh, my gosh, that's so sad. 
  " But I think that's the case for most people. 
  You know? 
  Like, when I look at my mom or like, the kids at my school Like, their profiles or their posts and their Tumblr rants you realize they're all just f*cked up, too and lost. 
  They just have a reason to mask it whether it be, like, their, their families or their boyfriends or their hashtag activism. 
  And they're just reaching for something - to make it all seem meaningful. 
  - Rue But sometimes I just sit and think - Rue. 
  Rue. 
  - like, what's the point? 
  Rue, I don't give a sh1t. 
  - Why'd you call me? 
  - Honestly I didn't really have anybody else to call. 
  Well, what happened to make you call? 
  Um you know just like (SCREAMING): Open the f*cking door! 
  f*ck! 
  just the usual bullshit. 
  Rue, you know that drug addicts don't reach out for help unless there's no options. 
  So what happened? 
  (SIGHS) 
  Um I was with my best friend. 
  Okay, well, she's I mean, she's a new friend, but we hang out every day. 
  And, um It's stupid. 
  It's stupid. 
  - ALI: What? 
  - I just I misread the whole situation. 
  And now it's gonna be really, really, really really f*cking awkward. 
  And I guess that hanging out with her was was the best thing that's happened to me in a while, so Does the way in which you feel about her remind you of anything? 
  - What do you mean? 
  - You know, like the obsession, the feelings, the withdrawal. 
  What, like drugs? 
  Bingo. 
  Okay, but this is a good thing. 
  Didn't drugs feel real good the first time you tried 'em? 
  sh1t. 
  Everybody now is doin' their thing Yeah. 
  It's gon' be a good night, tonight, man. 
  Let's get this money. 
  If you wanna have a good time Just grab your partner and step on a line What's good, bro? 
  - (BELL RINGS) 
  - RUE: f*ck. 
  - LEXI: You wanna go on the Gravitron? 
  - Uh, no. 
  - The Ferris wheel? 
  - Nope. 
  - Why? 
  - RUE: Because I don't wanna die. 
  MADDY: Where are you? 
  I'm standing by the f*cking Ferris wheel. 
  I don't see you. 
  Why do you always do this to me? 
  - JULES: Whoa! 
  Whoa! 
  Aah! 
  - KAT: We're gonna die, die! 
  JULES: Oh, my God.

  - CAL: No, it is a big deal. 
  You got one of the best slide-steps I've ever seen. 
  You've got promise. 
  You've got talent. 
  You're not pushing yourself hard enough. 
  NATE: Dad, I think McKay's gonna be just fine. 
  I'm just trying to help him keep a girl like her. 
  (SNICKERS) 
  Why? 
  It's not like we're in a relationship. 
  Plus, I don't even care about football. 
  Whoa. 
  It's not just football. 
  It's life. 
  It's about maintaining your focus. 
  It's about putting your all into everything you do. 
  Why do you think I have the business I have? 
  Why do think I have the family I have? 
  The success that I have? 
  Why do think this chili has been voted best chili in the county five years in a row? 
  'Cause you refuse to lose. 
  No.

  It's not that big of a deal, Cass. 
  It's a figure of speech. 
  - It is a big deal. 
  - It's really not. 
  You literally just told me that you loved me. 
  What does that have to do with anything? 
  You just told Nate that we're not even in a f*cking relationship. 
  That's because I know the guy. 
  He's just gonna talk sh1t. 
  - Like what? 
  - Like about you. 
  Or whatever, Cassie. 
  What do you mean, whatever? 
  Like whatever the f*ck you've done. 
  What have I done, McKay? 
  Look, I don't want to talk about this right now, Cass. 
  We're in the middle of a f*cking carnival. 
  I don't know what you're talking about. 
  It's not like it's that big of a f*cking secret, Cassie. 
  You know what? 
  It's cool. 
  We should just call it a night.

  So, you think Nate's cheating on you? 
  I don't know. 
  He's just been acting super-weird lately. 
  Have you gone through his phone? 
  I've never not gone through someone's phone. 
  Bitch, you're my soul mate. 
  BOTH: Thank you. 
  MADDY: Yo, what's going on with you and McKay? 
  I thought you two were in love.

  RUE: I didn't let you do that!

  - I'm sorry. 
  (GROANS) 
  I feel so bad. 
  That was literally the meanest thing - I've ever done. 
  - Oh, sh1t, hold on. 
  It's my mom. 
  Hey, Mom.

  Apparently, Gia's not answering her phone. 
  - JULES: Uh - It's just going straight to voicemail. 
  (SNIFFS, SIGHS) 
  (SNIFFS) 
  It burns. 
  MADDY: It's so weird to think that, like, no matter what happens, the universe is just out here giving, like, zero f*cks. 
  Wow. 
  (LAUGHING) 
  GIA: You look super cute. 
  EMMA: Thanks.

  - Oh, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  - There's your issue.

  - Trust me. 
  Oh, and milk, and milk. 
  - GIA: No!

  Three glasses. 
  EMMA: That's how I went from a small A to a full B. 
  - (GIA GROANS) 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Fine, I'll try it. 
  - I'm telling you. 
  - You gotta do it. 
  - How old are the boys again? 
  They're, like, our age. 
  Yeah. 
  - (ETHAN LAUGHS) 
  - KAT: That's a lot. 
  - I know. 
  - They are so good. 
  Right? 
  I could drink these, like, every day of my life. 
  Yes. 
  Uh, how 'bout you grab another slushie, I go get more tickets, and then get super drunk and ride the Ferris wheel? 
  Deal. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay. 
  All right. 
  - All right. 
  - (BOTH LAUGH) 
  - Thank you. 
  - No problem. 
  Just tell your sister I really need her - to cover my shift on Wednesday. 
  - Okay. 
  For real. 
  She's not answering any of my texts. 
  I promise you I will say something. 
  BECKY: I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend's family for the first time. 
  It's really important. 
  Yeah, I got you. 
  Thank you. 
  You're the best. 
  MADDY: Honestly, f*ck that whole family. 
  CASSIE: For real. 
  'Cause right now I'm looking at a thousand versions of myself, and not only do I look good, I f*cking feel good. 
  - It's a bitch. 
  - So, if they've got something to say, they should just say it to my face, right? 
  Or you could just say it to their f*cking face. 
  Right? 
  That's what I would do. 
  - I feel like this is a turning point. 
  - Totally. 
  We should just pick the hottest, most confident, bad bitch version of ourselves, and be that for the rest of the school year. 
  MADDY: Yo. 
  (BOTH LAUGH) 
  And this year's winner of the chili cook-off is Cal Jacobs! 
  - (CROWD CHEERING) 
  - Make it six years and running! 
  (CHEERING, WHISTLING) 
  Yeah, I'm not supposed to be here right now, because I'm dressed like a hooker, and none of you like me, but I just wanted to say congratulations. 
  NATE: Maddy, get out of - (CLATTERING) 
  - CROWD: Ooh! 
  What in God's name is your problem? 
  - You, c**t.

  - Hey. 
  - 'Sup, Cass? 
  You wanna ride the carousel? 
  DANIEL: Cool. 
  sh1t. 
  She's not answering. 
  - It's just going straight to voicemail. 
  - I mean, she can't be too far. 
  Well, I have to get her home in like, 30 minutes. 
  - Gia! 
  - Gia! 
  Excuse me. 
  Sorry. 
  Gia! 
  - Gia! 
  - RUE: Gia! 
  f*ck. 
  Okay. 
  Uh It'd be faster if we split up. 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay.

  JULES: Hey. 
  Tyler? 
  No. 
  No! 
  No, I'm not trying to hurt you. 
  I'm not. 
  I'm not here to hurt you. 
  I know that you have these ideas about me, based on the first time that we met, and I understand that. 
  But I'm not the person that you met that night. 
  Can you let go of me? 
  You know, over the past few weeks I've spent every moment of every day getting to know you. 
  At night I fall asleep to you. 
  And in the morning I wake up to you. 
  I kind of feel closer to you than I do to anyone in the whole world. 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  I don't trust you, Nate. 
  I don't trust you, either. 
  - (WHISPERS): Open your mouth. 
  - (WHISPERS) 
  Nate Wider. 
  Nate. 
  Nate, stop. 
  God, are you broken inside. 
  And that's precisely why I don't trust you. 
  Because you're so broken you don't even trust yourself. 
  And that's scary. 
  Not just for you, but for me. 
  And for my entire family. 
  (PHONE BUZZES) 
  I wouldn't answer that. 
  You're gonna wanna hear this. 
  Over the last three weeks, you have knowingly produced and distributed child pornography. 
  Including obscene images that were taken on school property. 
  I've compiled all these photos, along with an IP address, and an account that's linked to your name. 
  I don't know if you're familiar with child pornography laws in this state. 
  But they apply to minors just as they apply to adults. 
  I sent them to you. 
  No. 
  You sent them to an account of a person that doesn't f*cking exist. 
  And I mean, anyone can anonymously report child pornography, right? 
  - Then I'd tell them everything. 
  - Okay. 
  You could do that, but, um here's what would definitely happen. 
  You'd end up on a s*x offenders list. 
  It means no more college. 
  It's gonna be very f*cking difficult to find a job. 
  And everywhere you go, for the rest of your life, you'll be harassed, and spat at, and treated like a f*cking animal. 
  You deserve better than that. 
  'Cause I know you. 
  You're kind. 
  You're smart. 
  You're generous. 
  You got a big heart. 
  You deserve whatever the f*ck it is in this world that you want. 
  So keep your head down. 
  Keep your mouth shut. 
  Don't try to ruin my life, and I won't have to ruin yours. 
  You know what I think? 
  I think you're a f*cking faggot, just like your daddy. 
  (SLAPPING) 
  - (BREATHES HEAVILY) 
  - (JULES GASPING) 
  You have a nice night. 
  (SOFT KNOCKING) 
  (KNOCKING CONTINUES) 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Do you think I could, uh, sleep over? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, of course. 
  Come on. 
  Is everything okay? 
  Um Here. 
  So how'd the date go with Tyler? 
  Um He didn't look like his picture. 
  Come here. 
  Are you sure you're okay? 
  What?
