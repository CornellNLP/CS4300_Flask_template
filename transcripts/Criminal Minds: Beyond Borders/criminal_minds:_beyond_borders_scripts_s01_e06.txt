 Oh, crap! 
 We need to post! 
 What? No! 
 Relax. We're on our honeymoon. 
 We're not at a photoshoot. 
 But all our adoring fans and jealous friends await us. 
 Ah, well, then.

 Hm. 
 Yeah. 
 Wait, wait. Let me see it.

 I've got the pictures, a wedding ring, and a marriage certificate to prove it, so don't get any crazy ideas. 
 I love you, Johnny. 
 I love you too, baby. 
 When we get back to the hotel, I'm gonna show you how much. 
 Oh. 
 That's gonna have to wait. 
 What? Holding out already? 
 I thought we had a few years before that started. 
 [Laughs] 
 No, silly. 
 I have a surprise for you. 
 But we have plans back at the hotel. 
 Okay, I know being spontaneous takes you out of your comfort zone, but trust me, you're gonna like this.

 Josie, we'll revisit this in a few years. 
 You got to trust me on this one.

 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 Hey, boss. 
 Hey. 
 Everything all right? 
 Yeah. Josie got accepted to USC. 
 Congratulations. 
 Yeah, yeah. It's a great school. 
 I'm just not sure that she's ready to move that far away from home. 
 She's not ready or you're not ready? 
 Okay, Simmons, enough sharing the new crunch tips you learned. 
 It's good to see some things never change. 
 Except, you seem to be packing a bigger gun, this time around. 
 Well, it's been a long time since I shot anything. 
 I figure the bigger it is, the better chance I have at hitting something. 
 Aloha. 
 Okay, let's download everyone, Monty. 
 Okay. American newlyweds John Davis,  a software developer; and Susie Davis, a jewelry maker, are missing in San Pedro, Belize. They were last seen at a local watering hole named Serranos, where, I hear, the cow-foot soup is to die for. 
 Bride's father grew suspicious when the couple suddenly stopped posting on social media or wouldn't answer his calls. 
 So he called the hotel and found out they got a hotel service car, a red jeep, 2 days ago, and never returned it. 
 They assumed that they they drove to the other side of the island and eventually would come back. 
 His next call was to the U.S. consulate. 
 Where, it turns out, our newlyweds registered as soon as they arrived. 
 Who registers with the consulate? 
 Hmm. Somebody efficient, organized. 
 Speaking of, I just checked their credit cards and it seems that they've been inactive ever since they left Serranos 36 hours ago. 
 Unfortunately, the kidnapping of foreigners by drug cartels in central America and neighboring Mexico has become commonplace. 
 Except, there's been no ransom demand. 
 Monty, check with local P.D. 
 See if any other tourists have gone missing in Belize over the last few years. 
 You got it. 
 On a rural road at night? You think maybe they saw something they shouldn't have? 
 Then they're definitely in trouble. 
 And they need our help.

 So we don't have an embassy in San Pedro. 
 We'll check in with the consulate and get clearance for all our weapons and vehicles. 
 Simmons : Copy that.

 Mae, I want you to meet with the RSO to get a feel for the situation on the ground there. 
 Way ahead of you, boss. 
 I already traded emails with the Regional Security Officer, who gave me the lay of the land and said that there have been no recent abductions. 
 Simmons,  have you had a chance to run a topographic profile yet? 
 Yep, roger that. 
 The terrain they were last seen in changes very quickly from paved roads to rainforest jungles. 
 And anything this beautiful has to be dangerous. 
 Funny, that is what my Tinder profile says. 
 [Chuckle] 
 Even though Belize borders with Mexico, it has much more in common with the Caribbean. 
 That's why they all speak Creole. 
 Exactly. It's a pidgin language derived mainly from English, but includes Spanish and West African languages  like Bantu and Akan. 
 Let me guess. You speak that, too. 
 [Speaking Creole] 
 [Laughs] 
 What? 
 I so would've hated you in high school. 
 [Laughter] 
 Jack, it's good to see you again. 
 You too... how's the family doing? 
 Getting too big, too fast. 
 Oh, I know it all too well. Thanks for having us. 
 Well, much like last time you were working here, wish it was under better circumstances. 
 Well, let's see what we can do about changing that. 
 We ran a preliminary investigation. 
 We spoke to witnesses at Serranos, followed the road that they drove on, but weren't able to find them, or anything criminal in nature. 
 So your team has concluded there was no crime committed here? 
 Well, there's always the possibility of a crime having taken place, but, with our small police force, limited resources, we have done everything we could within our capabilities. 
 Well, you mind if we kick the tires on this? 
 Of course not. 
 Just try not to scare away too many of the tourists. 
 Jack. 
 Monty's on the batphone. 
 I got your notes on the RSO, saying there've been no recent tourist kidnappings in Belize. My search is showing the same thing, going 5 years back. 
 Monty, throw out a wire net with Interpol. 
 See what comes back. 
 You've got it, boss. 
 What else can you tell us about our lovebirds? 
 They've got quite the social media footprint: Facebook, Twitter, sweet source page. 
 Simmons : Sweet source? 
 Crowdbased fundraiser, so that couples who are financially challenged can help to raise money for their dream honeymoons. 
 So they weren't targeted for their money. 
 They certainly do look very much in love. Having a blast. Miss you. Thank you! 
 It's well-planned, detailed. 
 Yeah, by giving away locations and times, they're making it easier for them to be tracked. 
 So the unsub could've stalked them via posts, saw them more up close and personal, and then followed them that night. 
 Monty, see if anyone local was checking out our honeymooners' site. 
 I already parsed the access logs, to identify any site visitors with source routing that originated in Belize. 
 Now, I'm just filtering traffic, looking for packets that traveled through the Latin American or Caribbean Internet exchanges,  but nothing's popping up. 
 Well, if we go by their set itinerary, they were supposed to come back to the hotel for a romantic candlelit dinner, but never made it. 
 Clara, Mae, pay a visit to the hotel and see if you find any leads. 
 Simmons, go to the road near Serranos and see if anything pops out at ya. 
 I'm Randall Cowen. 
 I-I just flew in. 
 My daughter's S-Susie Davis, the missing bride. 
 I'm Jack Garrett, FBI. 
 Why don't we step outside here? 
 Sorry to make you wait. 
 I'm Agent Russ Montgomery with the FBI's international response team. 
 I'm Steven Davis. This is my wife, Mary. 
 What's going on? 
 We spoke to Susie's father, Randall. 
 He said that they got into some kind of trouble on their honeymoon? 
 Unfortunately, yes, but we have boots on the ground and we're knee-deep in an investigation. 
 What happened? 
 We're not completely sure, yet, but we do know that they're missing. 
 We're doing the best that we can, so let's try to stay positive. 
 Mr. Cowen, I'm a father also, so I can imagine how difficult this must be. 
 Rest assured, we're on top of it. 
 I appreciate that, Agent. 
 So, anything you can tell me, at all, about John and Susie? 
 Any troubles? 
 Not that I know of. 
 They seem very much in love. 
 Is there any tension between you and your daughter? 
 No, no. Why do you ask? 
 Well, you seem to be a man of means, but your daughter had to raise money for her own honeymoon. 
 When my wife died, Susie was all I had left. 
 What I saw as protection, she saw as smothering. 
 So, when she turned 18, she decided to march to the beat of her down drum, and with that came financial independence. 
 One day, you're coming home and they're yelling "Daddy" and jumping into your arms and, before you know it, it stops. 
 Anything else? 
 Susie's a spark plug. If she's in trouble, she'll fight to the end. 
 Please stay by your phone. 
 We'll let you know anything as soon as we do. 
 Thank you. 
 At least she's a fighter. 
 That's not good. 
 Fighters can end up dead quickly, depending on who's holding them. 
 He-e-e-lp! 
 Please! 
 Someone, anyone, please, help! 
 Susie? 
 Susie, you there? 
 John? 
 John, are you okay? 
 I'm in a lot of pain. 
 Okay. Okay, we have to get out of here. 
 Can you see anything? A door? 
 Some way out? 
 No. 
 [Eerie music plays] 
 [Footstep] 
 John. 
 John. 
 John, look out! 
 Aaaaah! 
 Oh! 
 Aaaaah-aah-aah! 
 Aaaahhh!!! 
 We're gonna need full access to your security footage. 
 That way, we can review or interview any guests they may have spoke to. 
 These people are on vacation. 
 We understand that, ma'am. 
 But their lives might be in danger, so any information that we have can help out. 
 I'll have security get you what you need. 
 This way. 
 Makin' friends everywhere we go. 
 Thank you. 
 You take the left? 
 Yep. 
 I told you, while you were gone, that I almost got married, right? 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 I met this guy and we just really, really fell hard for each other and... 
 Decided to take the plunge. 
 Then, I had to choose between him and the job, so, I chose good-old J Edgar. 
 Mae, if your fiancé made you choose, he wasn't the right guy, in the first place. 
 Well, he didn't make me choose, but he would've, so I just decided to rip the band-aid off and spare us both the inevitable. 
 So, wait, it was your decision, not his? 
 I don't wanna talk about it anymore. 
 I'm sorry. That's none of my business. 
 Well, the husband's side of the room would've made Felix unger proud. 
 Yeah, well, the wife's side looks like Chernobyl. 
 So the husband is organized. 
 He set the itinerary. 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 They were planning a romantic, candlelit dinner on the hotel beach. 
 If John was so very detailed, what threw them off course? 
 Abduction? 
 Maybe. 
 Or Susie. 
 Just look at the way she packed. 
 Looks like she was ready for anything. 
 Or she's a hot mess. 
 Trust me, there's something to all this madness. 
 She's spur of the moment. 
 She's spontaneous and she could've changed the plans. 
 Let's give Monty a call. 
 [Beeping] 
 Hello, angels. I was just about to drop you a line. 
 I just spoke to John's parents, who said that he and the missus were complete opposites. 
 He was... 
 Neat and she was a slob? 
 They said it more eloquently than that, but yes. 
 Any luck on Susie's emails, texts, and/or search engines,  por favor? 
 First off, there's nothing normal about Susie. 
 Her search engine is like a Jackson Pollock painting: Fashion, gluten-free recipes, waxing secrets, "which 'survivor' contestant are you?" 
 All of these searches are things you can get or have for free. 
 It just reiterates that they didn't have very much money. 
 Look, I know you said  their credit cards  went dead 36 hours ago, but what about any charges out of the norm before they went to Belize? 
 Ah, there's some small purchases, here and there, some nickel-and-dime stuff for food and water, but there is one that's a little bit more expensive, from a place called Supernova. 
 What is that? 
 It's an online company where you can purchase a star. 
 Oh, yeah. I've heard of that. 
 You can give them as gifts or name them after loved ones. 
 It was a honeymoon gift. 
 According to his social media page, his love is for astronomy. He is the president of his local amateur astronomers' association. 
 Nerd city. 
 Which I am a proud member of. 
 Well, if the shoe fits. 
 Monty, did Susie buy John a telescope? 
 Yeah, I was about to get to that: Top-of-the-line, from a local store near their home. 
 Susie was gonna surprise John with a star. 
 Monty, I want you to find  the best place  for stargazing in Belize and let Simmons know. 
 My guess is that's where they were last heading before they went off the grid. 
 Simmons, this is your conscience speaking. 
 I'm sure glad my conscience is a genius. 
 You know, there's seven levels of intelligence and three types of genius? 
 Lucky for you, I'm all of the above. 
 Brag much? 
 Only to my friends, and girls I meet at Applebee's happy hour. 
 Ooh, lowhanging fruit. 
 Hey, I work 14 hours a day and live with my grandmother. 
 Fair enough. What do you got for me? 
 Looks like our honeymooners were going stargazing. 
 That seems to be everywhere. Just look up. 
 True that, but people from all walks of life come to stargaze at Belize's world-renowned Coral Atolls. 
 I'll put that on the bucket list. 
 To get there, they would've had to travel by boat by leaving from Banyan Bay, which means that they would've turned right in a 1/2-mile. 
 [Eerie music plays] 
 I think I may have found where our couple went offroading. 
 Our vics were driving a red jeep, right? 
 Yes, sir. It was a part of their honeymoon package.

 He's speaking Creole. 
 [Speaking Creole] 
 So, people from the island, they call him and tell him where the junk is. 
 He goes, he picks it up, sells it as scrap metal. 
 He was just doing his job. 
 So why'd he run? 
 Why? 
 'Cause I no know you. Yu waan teif mi cah. 
 He speaks English. 
 Yes. Creole is based in English. 
 Man, that is a hell of a dent. 
 What kind of car rail would cause that? 
 None. 
 This dent was made by a battering ram mounted on a bumper, to inflict impact without taking any in return. 
 And it was hit in the passenger side, so they never saw it coming. 
 It's a classic blitz attack. 
 It's not intended to kill, but to push them off the road. 
 The method of attack is significant. 
 These people were taken. 
 Might already be dead. 
 Unless we have a body, we have to assume they're still alive. 
 Aah! Aah! Aah!

 I'm not seeing any signs of deception. 
 He's making clear eye contact. 
 He's using an active voice. 
 He's not equivocating or self-minimizing. 
 And his record is clean, so he's bein' straight with us. 
 How do people let you know about junk around the island? 
 Somebody call. I go in... he says somebody calls him, just like the man who told him about the jeep. 
 Do you know this man? 
 No, the man just come in Di shop... the man came into his shop, told him that he was on his way to go fishing. 
 Stop an tell mi he see Di jeep. 
 And saw a jeep just off the road, down in the ravine. 
 What'd he look like? 
 [Speaking Creole] 
 He wore sunglasses and a baseball hat, so he didn't get a great look at his face. 
 [Speaking Creole] 
 And he was tan and spoke Creole, so he was definitely local. 
 [Speaking Creole] 
 [Speaking Creole] 
 I asked him if there was anything else that he saw, out of the ordinary, and he said that he knows fishing and that man was no fisherman. 
 So he gets the tow truck driver to clean up his mess for him and then contaminate any evidence in the process. 
 He wasn't fishing. 
 No. 
 He was trying to get rid of something in the bay. 
 Or someone. 
 Tillet, how about we go fishing? 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 Your hunch was right. 
 Our officers found a bloated body in the bay about a kilometer from shore. 
 Looks like it was in the water a short time. 
 Is it the husband? 
 Most of him. 
 His hands and feet are missing. 
 Why is this tent in the middle of the beach? 
 The guests are seeing this. 
 It's causing concerns. 
 It's not our intention, but this is the scene of a crime. 
 And, since San Pedro doesn't have a morgue, we're gonna have to do an onsite autopsy. 
 Did you say autopsy? 
 What are you thinking, Clara? 
 You know, removing the hands and feet are usually used as either a form of punishment for a crime, such as thievery, or as a method of torture. I mean, sometimes they... 
 [suspenseful music plays] 
 Male, 25 to 30. 
 Unsub knows his way around a blade. 
 They are not surgical, but they are clean. 
 Marks on the neck, torso, and ankles show that the victim was weighted down in the water, probably by fishing line. 
 Open his shirt. 
 Where is his heart? 
 The missing heart, along with the hands and feet, point to this being an ancient Mayan ritual. 
 Which tracks, since Belize was ground zero for Mayan culture. 
 Right, but he is not just cutting them off and out. 
 He's actually eating them. 
 It's an act of dominance. 
 Eating the heart is an effort to absorb the victim's strength, while the hands and feet represent the most extreme ends of the body, thus encapsulating the whole being. 
 Knife marks, clean cuts, no hesitations. 
 So he weighted down the body with weights, but, somehow, John got loose. 
 Low tide. 
 Slack water got pulled back out of the ocean and a current could've shaken our DB loose from his watery grave. 
 Appears he's a mission-oriented, anger-excitation killer. 
 He targeted the Davises, with the intention to ritualistically kill the husband. 
 Which is in step with the Mayan rules of engagement with other warriors. 
 His need to remove the hands and feet is all part of a premeditated delusion. 
 He's sadistic, fueled by fantasies. 
 And, in modeling himself after a traditional Mayan warrior, the unsub is building confidence and adding credence to his fantasy. 
 Which, in itself, is a form of association and detachment that allows him to justify his actions. 
 His social skills, like with the tow-truck driver, suggest that he could be living a normal life, probably be employed, mid-30s. 
 Well, why cut his heart out, then put his shirt back on? 
 Dressing can be a form of remorse. 
 But then, that contradicts the brutality in which he kills. 
 Which then speaks to it being a compulsion or part of his ritual. 
 The weighting and the dumping of the body could be a forensic countermeasure? 
 It suggests that he's done this before. 
 Mae : So, potentially, there are more victims in the water. 
 We need to drag the bay, asap. 
 I'm sorry, Jack, I don't have those kind of resources. 
 Well, I do actually. I have an old military buddy who opened a dive shop down here. I'll give him a call. 
 I forgot. You always have a guy. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 Autopsy notes on two male skeletons pulled out of the bay, both missing hands and feet. 
 I'm all ears. 
 Monty, how's that security footage from the hotel going? 
 Nothing yet, but I'm still looking through it. 
 It's a couple weeks' worth of security footage. 
 Copy. 
 I've told so many people that they've lost loved ones. 
 It never gets any easier. 
 And, Monty, it never will. 
 But you help more than you know. 
 [Melancholy tune plays] 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Yes, of course. I'm with you. 
 Is that my little girl? 
 Sir, everyone behind the yellow tape here. 
 Mr. Cowen. 
 She in there? 
 It's Johnny, not Susie. 
 Oh, God. 
 Is she dead, too? 
 We don't know yet. 
 But she could be? 
 What if I never see her again? 
 You can't think like that. 
 Okay, my buddies over at Interpol finally got back to me. 
 We ran the DNA on the two skeletons that were just dragged out of the bay and we got a hit. 
 Both were males, however, we were able to identify one as Anuk Michelson, 35, Dutch. Last known photo was taken a week before he and his new wife, Monica, disappeared. Local authorities said, after renting a car, they took off on a day trip and never returned. 
 I remember this. 
 About a year ago, Anuk's parents wanted their son to be pronounced dead so they could claim the insurance policy. 
 The insurance company performed an investigation and concluded there was no proof of foul play or that Anuk and his wife were deceased. 
 They theorized that Anuk and his new bride skipped town to avoid their growing debt. 
 We accepted the insurance company's findings. 
 No body, no crime. 
 Clara, anything come from the interviews? 
 All of the hotel guests and employees were clean, or at least had solid alibis. 
 So, both missing couples were honeymooners. 
 Monty, look into anything else that's happened in that bay over the last few years.

 The unsub is killing and consuming part of the males, but keeping the females alive, thus absorbing their strength and their property, which was a common warrior practice. 
 Property? 
 Historically, women were considered legal possessions that men could leverage for a variety of reasons. 
 [Suspenseful music plays]

 Mae : Three dead bodies, all males, so why does the unsub feel the need to keep reasserting his dominance? 
 Jack : His M.O. is so specific, it's doubtful he killed the women in a different way.

 [Cartoon sound effects on television] 
 [Gasp] 
 So what if he's taking the dead men's women as his wives? 
 So our unsub is not only a cannibal, but also a polygamist? 
 Mayans were monogamous. 
 The only practicing polygamists in the area were Aztecs. 
 So this ritual is Aztec, not Mayan? 
 But Aztecs were Mexican? 
 Right. 
 So we're looking for a Mestizo who's good with a blade and had access to all of our victims.

 I reached out to my friends at a webpage called The global missing peoples network. 
 Denise Brown of Toronto posted  about her daughter Trish Brown's mysterious disappearance 3 years ago in Belize, where she met a boy named Colin Jackson on a cruise ship  and they eloped. 
 Where were they last seen? 
 At the San Pedro courthouse. 
 Here's the last photo they took. 
 You remember this, Tillet? 
 We didn't handle that. 
 Yeah, because Trish and Colin came in on a cruise ship, it fell under maritime law,  so the Belize Police Department didn't investigate. 
 Ship security botched the investigation and eventually filed it with Canadian Interpol as a cold case. 
 So we believe this third body could possibly belong to Colin Jackson? 
 Same height; estimated weight, based off bone density; makes it more than likely that it is. 
 Now, Trish and Colin  borrowed Denise's credit card so they could rent a car for the day, to see the island. 
 Two out of our three couples rented cars. 
 The other was a hotel assigned guest car. 
 Simmons, get on the horn. 
 Find out where that hotel gets their cars. 
 Now, I cross-referenced all the dates that our three couples either went off the grid or were declared missing, and they all seem to fall within the first few weeks of October. 
 Focus on traumatic events occurring in the first part of October. 
 Combine that with information you find out on the bay. 
 Let's shake something out of this tree. 
 What have you got? 
 Okay, I uncovered an event from 3 years ago. 
 A car accident took place near the bay, same location the dead bodies were dumped. 
 Go on. 
 A tourist couple in Belize on their honeymoon killed a local woman, Rosa Kiaten, when they hit her car directly into the bay. Her body was recovered by her husband, Antonio, a local butcher. 
 If this is the unsub's wife, it explains why he's so good with a blade. 
 But this happened on April 21st, not in October. 
 The death could be a stressor, the foundation of his mania, but it could be something else that triggers him. 
 The Aztecs have an elaborate calendar full of numerous festivals and ceremonies. 
 October 13th is the day of the jaguar. 
 Aztecs believed that it was a good day to do battle. 
 Monty, we need an address for Antonio, asap. 
 Got it. Antonio and his wife shared a place above the family butcher shop. 
 He's attacking tourists with a car, like the one that killed his wife. 
 "You took my beloved. Now, I take yours." 
 It's  Mano a Mano. 
 His actions are demonstrating extreme arrogance and a sense of entitlement. 
 Not just entitlement. 
 In devouring the flesh of his enemies, Aztec warriors were embodying their gods. 
 So, by eating people, the Aztec warrior becomes a god. 
 [Beep] 
 Sorry, everyone, but I'm going to need to reroute you. Antonio closed the butcher business soon after his wife's death and moved. I'm checking tax records to see where to. Simmons : Okay. The hotel rental car and both of the other rentals came from San Pedro car rental. And guess what. Tax documents say Antonio started working there 3 years ago. And rental car companies are independent contractors. They're not hotel employees. That's why we never interviewed him. But, working a car rental window explains how he had access to all the couples. And how he knew when to attack at their most vulnerable moment, because he could GPS their every movement. [Suspenseful music plays] [Crickets chirp] ♪ [Snarl] [Barking] Ino!

Only I can protect my family. You think that, by controlling women, that, somehow, makes you more of a man? Real men don't hurt their families. They love them. They protect them. You're not a man. You're just a coward. Shut up! You're weak. [Suspenseful music climbs] You are weak. No. I am strong. I am a god. You're not a god. A god could've saved your wife, Rosa! You're just a fraud! You're a fake! You're a failure! No! [Thud] Uh. [Melancholy tune plays] They're still alive. We need a paramedic. [Crickets chirp] Oh, sweetheart. Daddy. [Sobbing] She okay? Um, beyond the obvious trauma, she's dehydrated, but, she'll make it. The other two women? They'll physically be okay, but, Stockholm syndrome survivors tend to have mixed results. I'm sorry that it got weird between us in the hotel room. No, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being so judgmental. It's not judgmental if it's true. It's just that, what we do, it's so dangerous and scary, and it's made me afraid of any kind of commitment and I just don't wanna make someone... Like me? That's not what I meant. Okay, I would be a liar if I said that it hadn't crossed my mind. Look, Mae, losing Brad, it hurt. It hurt like hell. But what would've hurt even more? Never having been with him. No, when you love someone, you love 'em unconditionally. They know the risk. [Melancholy tune plays] ♪ That was one for the playbooks. Just glad you're a good shot. [Chuckle] I couldn't help but think about my daughters. The look in that little girl's face. Well, being able to relate to those moments is what makes you a good agent. Maybe so, but as a parent, it scares the hell outta me. I just wanna protect 'em forever. Randall : I love you, Susie. [Sobbing] I'll be right back. Yeah. Hi, honey. It's Dad. I'm in Belize. I was just... I was just thinking about you and us and school and... I can't wait to visit you at USC. [Chuckle] I love you, too. What am I doing now? Coming home.
