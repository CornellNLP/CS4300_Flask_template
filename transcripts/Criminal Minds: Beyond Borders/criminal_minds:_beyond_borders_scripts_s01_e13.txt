 Jack :  Over 68 million Americans leave the safety of our borders every year. If danger strikes, the FBI's international response team is called into action. 
 [Singing in native language] 
 [Girls giggling] 
 Emily : Slow down, girls!  Relantir! 
 No, Mama, we're racing! 
 Shh! It's late. Go. Go. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Come on, Abby. 
 They haven't gone to bed before 10:00 this whole trip. 
 Can you blame them? 
 They're excited to have a little brother. 
 I know. They really do adore him. 
 Did you see how Samuel wouldn't go to sleep till he kissed them both good night? 
 It was so sweet. 
 I wish the orphanage would let him stay with us. 
 I know. 
 Just two more days, and then he'll be ours forever. 
 Can you believe it? 
 Hmm. 
 "Lumière." 
 [French accent] 
 "Lumière." 
 [Laughing] Shut up. 
 [Chuckles] 
 "Peinture." 
 "Peinture." 
 [Speaks French] 
 What? 
 I don't know. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Sam's little accent is amazing, isn't it? 
 I wish he could hold onto it, but he'll probably lose it once we get him into school. 
 Which is why it's so important for us to always remind him of that. 
 French and creole is part of Samuel's foundation, and I want to honor it. 
 So can we come back every year? 
 Yes. 
 [Sighs] 
 I love you, Mrs. Wagner. 
 You're not so bad yourself. 
 [Girls giggling] 
 Both : I won! 
 What?! 
 No, you didn't! 
 Yes, I did! 
 Oh, no. Another tie. 
 Sorry, girls. Gonna have to wait till tomorrow. 
 Are your allergies still bothering you, boo? 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. Come here. 
 Ah. Good. 
 You all right? 
 Come on, Abby. 
 Grace :  Bonne nuit,  Papa. 
 Mm. Good night, my beauties. 
 Good night. 
 Feel better, okay? 
 Good night. 
 Night, Mama. 
 Tomorrow's a  big  day. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Go to sleep, guys. No chitchat. 
 Okay. 
 I love you to the moon and back. 
 Love you, too, Mama. 
 [Rattling] 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 Oh, I cannot believe we ate all that. 
 Yeah, well, who knew that Monty's grandma has a dozen signature dishes? 
 It's just a little something from every country that we've been to. 
 God, she is so sweet. We're gonna hurt tomorrow. 
 [Laughs] 
 Mae : Really, you guys? 
 A little help here? 
 The soap's right... 
 Yeah, all right, at your service, at your service. 
 Okay, okay, okay. You wash. We will dry. 
 No, really. Relax. 
 Grab a towel. 
 Daddy, can you tell me a story? 
 Okay. Has to be a quick one. 
 About the dragon. 
 About the dragon, about the dragon. 
 All right, where did I leave off? 
 He was alone in the forest. 
 And he couldn't find his family, right? 
 Right. He was scared. 
 But that is when he found another dragon, and they bought a little dragon house together. 
 And they had dragon food. 
 I'm pretty sure you're gonna need a little more garnet and gold in your wardrobe. 
 That's Florida state, Dad. USC's cardinal and gold. 
 Yeah, and it's a lot farther away. 
 Says the man who travels the globe. 
 It's not like I'm the first kid you've sent to college. 
 That's the problem. I know what comes next. 
 The bill? 
 No, no. 
 It's just gonna be a little quieter around here. 
 I'm sorry I'm going so far away. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Your mom and I just want you to be happy. 
 I am. 
 Friday night, we'll celebrate. 
 As long as Dad doesn't have to save the world. 
 Oh, this party's happening. 
 He'll be here, right, Jack? 
 I wouldn't miss it. 
 All right, I'm gonna hit it. 
 See you in the morning. 
 It wasn't this hard with the boys. 
 We've got two left before we're empty-nesters. 
 That's unchartered territory for Unit Chief Garrett. 
 It's late. This can wait till tomorrow. 
 No. I'm almost done. 
 Okay. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 I'll be up in a minute. 
 ♪♪ 
 Monty :  Jack, we need you and the rest of the IRT back at base asap. 
 Let's get everyone up to speed, Monty. 
 As you know, the Wagners woke up two hours ago to a complete nightmare. 4-year-old Abby was taken from their hotel room in Haiti. 
 That's not exactly a popular vacation spot. 
 For the Wagners, it is. 
 Owen and Emily have done outreach programs down there for the last decade,  but this trip was to adopt a 2-year-old named Samuel. 
 Was there a ransom note? 
 Nothing. 
 That's unusual in poverty-stricken nations. 
 Usually they want a fast payout. 
 Unless they want something bigger than the family could provide. 
 Yeah, like trafficking, which was rampant among the local children since the earthquake, but very rare among foreign visitors. 
 It's rare, but it happens. What's the window? 
 Eight hours. 
 The family went to bed after 10:00. 
 When they woke up at 6:00, she was gone. 
 We need to narrow that down. 
 Well, the unsub probably waited a few hours to guarantee that everyone was sleeping. 
 Agreed. Even the most exhausted parents may not fall asleep right away, so we should look at a 12:00 midnight, 1:00 A.M. at the earliest. 
 That takes us down to a five or six, which is better, but still gives our offender a massive head start. 
 And they've vanished in a country that's not equipped for this. 
 Simmons, call your contacts for a search and rescue. 
 Any hotel surveillance? 
 Not enough. They've only got five cameras. 
 We need a map of the property. 
 Sending now. 
 How long have the Wagners been in Haiti? 
 Uh, 12 days. 
 That's long enough to establish patterns and put them on our unsub's radar. 
 Yeah, and a young, healthy American family's gonna stick out there. 
 We'll head directly to the Wagners and meet the local officer. 
 We need to get as much information as possible before the media gets ahold of this. 
 Yeah, a beautiful American child missing? 
 The media's gonna have a field day with that. 
 The Wagners were in Haiti to make a difference. 
 We're not about to let this end in tragedy. 
 ♪♪ 
 [ Giggling ] 
 Jack : "Beyond the mountains, more mountains"... 
 Haitian proverb. 
 Ah. Welcome. 
 Inspector General Brasier. 
 [Car doors closing] 
 Unit chief Jack Garrett. This is my team. 
 Great. Thank you all for coming so fast. 
 The Wagners are inside. 
 Mae : Wait. Did they make those? 
 Yes. 
 They haven't wasted much time since she's been gone. 
 They keep mentioning a case about a Madeline? 
 Madeline McCann was almost her age when she was abducted in Portugal. 
 When was this? 
 2007. 
 And what happened to her? 
 No one knows. She was never found. 
 The question, then, again is why risk taking a child that stands out? 
 Well, Haitians taking Haitian children happens out in the open. 
 Bad men go to rural villages and sometimes convince the parents to send their children to school, but those parents never see their children again. 
 Yeah. They, uh... They're called paper orphans. 
 It's happening in Nepal, as well. 
 Documents are forged saying that they have no living relatives. 
 Sometimes they're even adopted by unknowing families. 
 Then maybe they're trying to send the Wagners a message because they were here to adopt. 
 That seems like a huge risk for a personal vendetta. 
 Come. 
 Abby was taken from her room. 
 Do you think it's somebody who works at the hotel? 
 Do you have any suspects? 
 No comment. 
 The Wagners made these flyers, but they haven't talked to us. 
 No comment. 
 You think they have something to hide? 
 Are you the FBI's IRT? 
 The press have been at it all morning. 
 They're vultures. 
 We'll handle them. 
 My name's Jack Garrett, and this is my team... 
 Agents Seger, Jarvis, and Simmons. 
 Owen Wagner. Um, Emily and Grace. 
 [Paper rustling] 
 When was this photo taken? 
 Yesterday. 
 We passed them out to everyone. 
 We couldn't just sit still. 
 I understand. No one can. 
 We tasked people while we were in flight. 
 We've had all vehicles searched in and out of Port-Au-Prince for the past two hours. 
 We'll continue that until our investigation gives us more specifics. 
 General, I need all the security footage from the hotel and city. 
 Ah, the earthquake took out all the traffic cameras, but the hotel has their footage pulled up. 
 I'll want eyes on that, too. 
 [Dog barks] 
 Where are we with employee interviews and background checks? 
 Ah, no one is standing out. 
 I can't believe that Abby's gone, and... and no one saw anything? 
 It has to be someone who works here. 
 We don't want to jump to any conclusions, but I can assure you we'll leave no stone unturned. 
 Agent Simmons has search and rescue here to assist him. 
 I'm, uh... I'm gonna need something of Abby's for the search team. 
 Her, um, blanket and stuffed elephant must be with her because we can't find them in the room. 
 What about what she was wearing yesterday? 
 Uh, her sweatshirt. I'll get it. 
 I'll go with you. 
 When these kinds of things happen to other people... kids usually aren't found. 
 You know, just when I can't imagine a bigger nightmare, I start worrying about... Child trafficking. 
 And if Abby was taken by somebody like that, then she could be hundreds of miles away right now. 
 Agent Simmons, I'd like to join you. 
 You know, actually, uh, I was hoping that you could help me retrace your family's steps from the orphanage to the hotel last night. 
 Okay. I can do that. 
 Clara : Great. Let's go this way. 
 We'll avoid the madness. 
 He's right, isn't he? 
 This feels like an organized abduction. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Crying] 
 She loves this one. 
 Thank you. 
 Lamp is "lumière," and book is "livre." 
 You are doing so good. 
 Merci. 
 [Chuckles] 
 When is Abby gonna come back? 
 Well, we are here to help find her. 
 Why would somebody take her? 
 She doesn't belong to them. 
 Mama, you need a hug? 
 Yeah. 
 Ooh, that's a good squeeze. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Thank you. 
 Can I watch something? 
 Yeah. 
 [Sniffles] 
 It's all my fault. 
 No. 
 I lost my key. 
 Someone must have used it to get in here. 
 It's the only way. 
 I can't find my key. 
 We haven't determined that yet. 
 The room is still being processed. 
 I always wake up... 
 Ever since Grace was born. 
 I think it's instinctual. I wake up at least once a night. 
 [Crying] 
 But last night, I slept through, and now my baby's gone. 
 Hey, hey, hey, this is not your fault, okay? 
 It's not. 
 I keep wondering, "why didn't Abby wake up or cry?" 
 It's because I gave her the medicine for her allergies and she was just sound asleep. 
 What did you give her? 
 [Sniffles] 
 It was right here. 
 Did they take it with them? 
 Wh-wh-why would they do that? 
 Well, it could be to look after her. 
 And if she's asleep, then she's not scared, right? 
 Grace : Mom? 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 I need some help. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Oh. So, here we go. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 I have children. 
 This is my biggest nightmare. 
 The answers are here. We just haven't found them yet. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, we checked. 
 There's no unlocked windows, loose vents, or forced entry. 
 There's also no extra security. 
 Emily said that she lost her key. 
 If it was stolen, then that means that the offender was close enough to the family to access Emily's bag. 
 The door beeps when it's unlocked. 
 Don't you think that would be too loud in the middle of the night? 
 Yeah. 
 So, what if someone came in while the family was still at the orphanage? 
 They would have laid in wait for hours until everyone fell asleep. 
 I mean, it's extreme, but so is taking Abby. 
 Where would they hide? 
 Ah. 
 [Grunts] 
 No one could fit under here. 
 They could in here. 
 That takes a lot of patience. 
 Yeah, and it's bold. 
 What if the Wagners had opened the closet? 
 I want your officers to focus on prints in here. 
 Then Emily and I met here back in 2004. 
 We were both part of an aid program after hurricane Jeanne hit. 
 And that's when we fell in love with the country, the... hey. 
 Ah.  Bonsoir. 
 The culture, the strength of the people. 
 Well, it's the second nation to America to gain their independence. 
 Right. 
 We always knew that we wanted to expand our family, but for years out-of-country adoptions were illegal here. 
 But after the 2010 quake, there were so many orphaned children, they really didn't have a choice. 
 You know, it's a beautiful thing, what your family's doing. 
 Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! 
 Samuel! 
 I heard about Abby. This is awful. 
 Um, I need a complete list of all employees and volunteers, past and present, anybody who had access to the family. 
 General Brasier called ahead. 
 I've already got it for you. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 And just to confirm... 
 Samuel had no living relatives, no aunts, uncles, siblings, anybody who'd want to punish the Wagners for adopting him? 
 Samuel is not a paper orphan. 
 I knew his parents, and sadly they died of cholera a year ago. 
 He was the only one spared. 
 Leila, Leila! 
 Ah, pardon. 
 Merci. 
 There are no cameras near the Wagners' room, but I'm piecing together what I can. 
 Is anything standing out? 
 Not yet. 
 Doesn't look like they're wearing a uniform. 
 Employees have all been cleared... 
 So this could be an outside vendor. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That has to be Abby. 
 [Computer beeps] 
 What's up, Jack? 
 The unsub left the hotel grounds with Abby at 1:49 A.M. 
 They were on foot. 
 Calculate how far they could have gotten by now. 
 On it. 
 And since all the employees checked out, we need to broaden our search to every independent vendor who would have known this property. 
 Uh, compiling a list now. I'll hit you guys back. 
 [Keypad beeps] 
 Clara. 
 We got a lead. 
 [Cellphone rings, beeps] 
 Hey, I was just gonna call you. 
 What have you got? 
 We picked up the trail outside the hotel. 
 The dogs led us about two miles north of the city. 
 It's a gang-infested area. 
 It could have been used as a meeting point if we're still talking about trafficking. 
 According to the surveillance video, they snuck her out of the hotel. 
 [Dog barking] 
 What's going on? 
 Hold on. 
 [Barking continues] 
 Clear! Clear! 
 FBI! 
 [Barking intensifies] 
 Hey. Get them back. 
 [Man speaks foreign language] 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Hey, Jack. 
 Found Abby's stuffed elephant. 
 She was here, but she's gone. 
 And, Jack... 
 We've got blood. 
 Not human blood. 
 That's a relief, but there's a lot of it. 
 We need to find the source. 
 The dogs are searching the area. 
 These unsubs have a million places to hide. 
 Why would they stop just two miles from the abduction zone? 
 What's in this area? 
 It's run by gangs who deal in drugs and guns, not children. 
 This is beginning to feel a lot less organized than we thought. 
 Leaving the toy behind, stopping so close to the abduction site doesn't add up to someone who's done this before. 
 Mae : Exactly. It wasn't well-planned. 
 They just disappeared on foot and needed to rest before walking off again. 
 But why this particular place and not another shelter? 
 Jack : The offender's telling us a lot. 
 First they waited in a closet and then calmly walked Abby off the property. 
 There's patience, despite the risk. 
 When Abby's arm slipped out of the linens, it didn't even faze the offender. 
 They just tucked her back in... lovingly, even. 
 Well, they brought along Abby's medicine, blanket, stuffed animal, almost like they were comforting her. 
 The unsub could be a mother. 
 Predisposed female. 
 That's never good. 
 Abby and this place must hold some sort of... 
 Emotional significance. 
 [Dogs barking] 
 [Barking intensifies] 
 A pauper's grave. 
 This dirt hasn't been disturbed. 
 There's no way Abby's in there. 
 That's her blanket. 
 It's unmarked. 
 This area has seen flooding and much disease. 
 Could be anyone. 
 Well, whoever's in there may be connected to our unsub. 
 We need to identify the remains. 
 I'm sorry. We cannot do that. 
 Burying the dead is a sacred act. 
 I understand completely, but we need to process this scene, and looking in this grave is step one. 
 I'll make a call, but this is not going to be easy. 
 
 
 
 Simmons : Hey, guys, I got the source of the blood from the shack. 
 This looks like a religious ritual. 
 A friend of mine is a healer who may be able to help determine which ritual it is. 
 Mae, send your photos to Clara. 
 Done. 
 And can you please have your friend meet us back at the hotel? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 Mae, you stay here until we can find out who's in this grave. 
 I'm not sure how long that's gonna take. 
 We're nearly 12 hours into Abby's abduction. 
 We got to move on this. 
 Now that we know this is an emotionally driven unsub, chances are she feels a bond with Abby. 
 Which means the Wagners have seen her. 
 They just didn't know it. 
 Our viewers would like to know how to help, but avoiding the media has made everyone suspicious. 
 We're busy  looking  for Abby. 
 Is it true you drugged your daughter before bed, making her more susceptible to the abduction? 
 She has allergies. 
 Wait. Who told you that? 
 We had to do our own investigating since the authorities locked us out of the process. 
 We heard your wife gave her the medicine. 
 Do you think she gave her too much? 
 Hey, hey. No more questions. 
 This is Unit Chief Jack Garrett with the FBI's international response team. 
 Agent, do you have any leads? 
 I said no more. 
 Have you questioned Owen and Emily Wagner? 
 A-are they considered suspects? 
 They had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance. 
 Some polls beg to differ. 
 People think the mother should be charged with negligence at the very least. 
 That's enough. 
 Drugging her daughter. 
 Turn off your camera. 
 Turn it off! 
 Now, you listen to me. 
 While you're out here picking apart the parents of a missing child... 
 It's my job. 
 I said listen! 
 This family is in the middle of the worst thing that's ever happened to them. 
 You need to seriously reconsider your reporting and find some humanity. 
 Let's go. 
 [Sighs] 
 How's she holding up? 
 She's still standing. 
 You think she's up for a cognitive? 
 I don't know. 
 [Emily crying] 
 Did you get the photos from Mae? 
 Yes, but it doesn't look like any ritual I've ever seen. 
 Hopefully the healer will have some insight. 
 His name's Jean-Paul, and he's on his way. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Jean-Paul? 
 Not what you were expecting for a witch doctor, eh? 
 We're nothing to be afraid of. 
 Oh. I appreciate you meeting me. 
 Of course. 
 I'm so sorry this little girl was taken. 
 I saw the flyers all over the city. 
 [Keypad beeps] 
 Do you know why anyone would take her to this grave? 
 Who is buried in here? 
 That's what we're trying to figure out. 
 Pauper's graves such as this is a desecration in Haitian culture. 
 So would that be why there's an animal sacrifice there? 
 A living child and sacrificial animal feels like conflicting ceremonies. 
 Whoever has taken her is confused, which makes them incredibly dangerous. 
 However, there is an ancient ritual one year and a day after the death of a loved one. 
 It's to reclaim the spirit from ancestral waters and to elevate the spirit of the dead to a new spiritual evolution. 
 So this person thinks they can transfer a dead spirit into a new body. 
 Yes, but the ritual itself is dangerous. 
 It requires the host body to be wrapped in linen before soaking them in water. 
 Done in the wrong hands, it's led to drowning. 
 It sounds like waterboarding. 
 I would never suggest practicing this with such a young person. 
 So, um, how much time do we have before Abby's physically endangered? 
 She was taken before sunrise, so this will be over before the next one. 
 It's impossible that someone connected with Abby. 
 I would have noticed. 
 Not necessarily. 
 You never knew to look for anyone. 
 And now, during times of stress, details often get buried. 
 There's a way that we can dig them out. 
 I'll do anything to help. 
 Good. 
 Have a seat. 
 I'm gonna walk you through yesterday morning, but first you need to block out any stimuli, so... just close your eyes. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Just relax. 
 Did you wake up early? 
 Yes. 
 And... everyone was hungry, so we went downstairs for breakfast. 
 Was it crowded? 
 No. 
 It's a simple setup. We serve ourselves. 
 Then where did you go? 
 We walked to the orphanage. 
 But the girls wanted to play, so we stopped for a few minutes, and then we kept... 
 Okay. Hold on. Slow down. 
 I need all the little details so we can fill in the blanks. 
 So, where'd the girls play? 
 In this little park near the orphanage. 
 Were there vendors? 
 What did it smell like? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Fried plantains. 
 Okay. 
 How about the sounds? 
 [ Children laughing ] 
 Laughter. 
 There were some other American kids running past us. 
 Had you seen them before? 
 Yeah. 
 Abby dropped her elephant, and a woman handed it to her. 
 Was she with the other children? 
 She was their nanny, I think. 
 An American? 
 No. She was Haitian. 
 And what did Abby do when the nanny handed her the elephant? 
 She said, uh... 
 Merci! 
 And then Abby ran over to me. 
 But the woman kept staring at us. 
 Oh, God. Is that her? 
 It's a small gesture, but, yes, that could have been the connection she needed. 
 Was that family staying at this hotel? 
 I don't know. 
 Can you describe what the nanny looked like? 
 [Sighs] 
 Do you remember what she was wearing? 
 Some kind of uniform, but it wasn't from a hotel. 
 It was different. 
 She had a name tag. 
 What did it say? 
 Sara. 
 Could be a local woman from a babysitting service. 
 Does this help? 
 Yes. 
 Monty? 
 Hey, Jack. 
 I got a weird overlap with the vendors. 
 We think the unsub works for a babysitting service. 
 Funny, because that's the weirdness. 
 Someone's cornered the market. 
 I've got five businesses offering babysitting services, but they all have the same owner and address. 
 I'm sending it to Clara now. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 I think it's gonna be on that corner. 
 Monty said the owner has all of the nanny services in the city. 
 I'm willing to bet he runs more than that and he's got something to hide. 
 Now, where is this place? 
 Hey! 
 ♪♪ 
 Hey! 
 Come on. Get up. Get up. 
 [Speaking French] 
 Merci. 
 [Speaks French] 
 Call the authorities. Let's get them out of here. 
 There's no sign of Abby. 
 [Woman vocalizing spiritually] 
 Okay. Time to talk. 
 [Speaks french] 
 Why should I help you? 
 Well, it's men like you... The ones who hurt children... 
 They never survive prison. 
 So, I'll tell you what... You give me the names of all the people who work for your little babysitting enterprise, and I'll see to it that you go away for weapons and drug running... How about that?... 
 Because I'm sure you'd like to sound like a tough guy in there as opposed to the, uh, coward you really are. 
 And you're the one calling  me  a tough guy. 
 Why don't we start with anyone named Sara? 
 I know 10 different Saras. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, listen... we're looking for a Sara who lost a loved one about a year ago. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You think that helps you find her? 
 Welcome to life in Haiti. 
 [Spits] 
 Okay. 
 Can you get a list of Saras? 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 I'll get the list. 
 Good. 
 Mae, where are you guys with the remains? 
 Uh, haven't seen any yet, but they're almost done digging. 
 Okay. We got to hurry. 
 The healer said that Abby could be undergoing some kind of ritual that could be fatal by sunrise. 
 Okay, well, as soon as I have any samples, I will rush the results, but we could still be looking at hours before I know the identity of... 
 Lieutenant Jarvis. of whoever's in here. 
 Hang on. 
 Yeah, we got a problem. 
 It's a mass grave. 
 This is gonna take a lot longer than I thought. 
 [Singsong voice] 
 Elsie. 
 Elsie. 
 [Fabric tears] 
 Elsie. 
 Mae : I've got 10 bodies here. 
 They're all male except one. 
 Apparently that section of the slum suffered from a fatal flood a year ago. 
 Yeah, and because of the extreme poverty, many of them were buried at the same time. 
 Well, the remains are all deteriorated, so without hours to examine each one, I can't determine a cause of death, so I'll take your word for it that they drowned. 
 Now, the young woman is the only female, so I started with her and I found something interesting. 
 She has separation of her symphysis pubis and laceration of the ligaments on her pubic bone. 
 So, whoever she was, she had recently given birth. 
 How old was she? 
 15, 16 tops. 
 Well, oftentimes younger women than that are married off and pregnant earlier than that. 
 This was almost discarded. 
 Guys, hold on. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I've got the remains of a premature infant. 
 This may be a young woman who didn't die in a flood. 
 Most likely it was childbirth that killed her. 
 Okay, well, that's awful, but it also helps us narrow down to who that is and how they're connected to one of these Saras on the list. 
 Thanks, Mae. 
 Yeah. 
 Monty, hey. 
 Okay, so, I've run the list of all babysitters named Sara,  and it turns out it's not a popular name in Haiti. 
 However, Saraphina is. 
 I'm thinking Osse had her shorten it to sound more American. 
 Yeah, well, we believe the Saraphina we're looking for lost a daughter during childbirth, and if she's partaking in the ritual, she believes that Abby is gonna bring back the spirit of her own child. 
 And she didn't take a Haitian child who could have died from a number of diseases. 
 She wanted a healthy American girl who had a higher chance of survival. 
 Right. Losing her granddaughter and daughter could be a trigger, but we're certain that she's had a lifetime of stressors. 
 Okay. I'm cross-referencing all churches, prayer lists, and death records. 
 Now, when you say "stressors," do you think that she's lost more than just the daughter and the infant in the grave? 
 Yes. Look into other family losses. 
 [Keys clacking] 
 [Computer chiming] 
 All right, Saraphina Labeau has lost five loved ones since 2009. 
 Uh, one was her husband. 
 The other four were her children. The first death was a stillborn. Her husband died in an aftershock while scavenging for metal rubble. Then the largest outbreak of cholera killed hundreds of thousands, including all of Saraphina's children except the oldest. The only survivor was her daughter Elsie. 
 I mean, she's had a lifetime of stressors, more than anyone should bear. 
 It's been years in the making, but she's suffering from a grief-induced psychotic break, which makes her more unpredictable.

 Saraphina's in the midst of a psychotic break. 
 Our presence may trigger something. 
 We need to be prepared for anything. 
 Merci. 
 Saraphina? 
 Yes? 
 We need you to put Abby down. 
 Who is Abby? 
 She's the little girl in your arms. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 This is Elsie. 
 See her beautiful soul? 
 Oh. Let me see. 
 Get away from her! 
 Go away! 
 We're not here to hurt you. 
 No one is gonna hurt you. 
 She is beautiful. 
 May I see her? 
 No! 
 No, no, no! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 It's okay. 
 Get away from her! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Aah! 
 It's okay. 
 [Crying] 
 No. 
 It's too late now. 
 They are all gone. 
 Why don't you... why don't you tell me about Elsie? 
 I prayed... 
 That she had a better life. 
 I lived with that hope... 
 But then she was buried in a grave with strangers. 
 I had to get her back. 
 She belongs here with me. 
 Don't you see? 
 Listen... 
 Your hope... 
 Should mean something. 
 You were being a good mother. 
 You still can. 
 Just let her go. 
 It's okay. 
 [Shouts indistinctly] 
 [Sobbing] 
 No! 
 [Screams] 
 You did so good. 
 [Sobbing] 
 It's okay. 
 You're okay now. 
 [Sobbing continues] 
 We're happy to report Abby Wagner was unharmed. And luckily that allergy medicine everyone was worried about turned into a blessing. Abby slept through everything until she was rescued. 
 Good job, you two. 
 [Girls giggling] 
 [Gasps] Hi! 
 Hi! 
 This is my sister. 
 Hello, Abby. 
 Hi. 
 And this must be Samuel. Hi! 
 Thank you for finding her! 
 Oh, you are so welcome. 
 Do you want to color with us? 
 Yeah. Let's color.

 Hey. Hi. Wow. 
 What army are you feeding? 
 My grandmother only knows how to cook in one size. 
 Yeah, but it is good. 
 No doubt. 
 Thanks for coming. It means a lot. 
 Oh, we wouldn't miss it. 
 Aww, thank you. 
 Hi! 
 [Gasps] 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Kristy, oh, my God. 
 Hi! 
 Can't believe I haven't seen you yet. 
 Oh, well, you've been busy. My gosh. 
 And you guys haven't stopped since you've been back. 
 Mom! 
 Yeah. 
 Mom, he keeps hitting me! 
 I'm gonna do damage control. 
 Stop it! 
 Can you hear them? 
 Noted. Good luck. 
 Okay. Everyone, gather 'round. 
 I'm, uh, usually the one that makes the toast, and it's usually mushy, so it's your turn. 
 Is it? 
 [Chuckling] 
 Yes, it is. 
 Josie... 
 The day you were born, I... 
 I remember thinking... 
 "This is gonna be something." 
 And I was right. 
 Watching you grow up has been one of the great joys of our lives. 
 And letting you go is... 
 That's about the hardest thing that... 
 That I've ever done. 
 But that's how I know it's the right thing to do because your mom and I are so proud of you. 
 No matter how far away that you go, this will always be your home. 
 We love you more than you'll ever know. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Cheers. 
 All : Cheers!
