 Jack : Over 68 million Americans leave the safety of our borders every year. If danger strikes, the FBI's international response team is called into action. 
 ♪ 
 Gavin, come on. These ladies are waiting on their photo. 
 Okay, here we go. 
 Ready? 
 Smile. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Laughter] 
 [Horn honks] 
 Hey. Thank you so much for coming, you guys. 
 Bye. 
 Come again, okay? 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Bye, Hank! 
 Thank you! 
 Bye. 
 All right, ladies. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Time to call it a night. 
 [Camel groans] 
 Come on. 
 [Middle eastern pop music plays] 
 Yo, what's up, Hank? 
 [Sighs] 
 I need a beer. 
 I think I can help you with that. 
 But first, you up for hitting Omar's tonight? 
 Yeah. I just need to go home and take a quick shower. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 If I wasn't so tired, I'd punch you right now. 
 [Laughs] 
 Go grab a cold one from the trunk and stop complaining. 
 [Music continues] 
 [Bottles clinking] 
 I said go grab a beer, not brew it from scratch! 
 [Sizzling] 
 What the hell? 
 [Coughing] 
 I can't breathe! 
 [Coughing] 
 It burns! 
 [Coughing] 
 [Pounding] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Groans] 
 [Footsteps clacking] 
 What special honor brings you to my office? 
 Where's my octopus coffee mug? 
 Excuse me? 
 Unh-unh. Don't. 
 Beth from carpool told me she saw you take it from the kitchen. 
 Have you asked yourself why you're listening to someone whose glasses are thicker than old coke bottles? 
 Beth's stigmatism has no bearing on her veracity. 
 I think Beth is just a little bitter that someone didn't give her a call back after the first date. 
 What... 
 She had an indefensible position on Moore's law. 
 Semiconductor density is a super-sexy topic. 
 With transistors approaching single-atom width, Moore's law is only relevant for... 
 She thought it was invented by Roger Moore. 
 And enforced by the 007. 
 Ouch. 
 That does not preclude her having seen you take my octopus cup of drinking. 
 Except the fact that I don't drink coffee. 
 Oh. Good point. 
 Hug it out? 
 Not necessary. 
 Okay. 
 Mm. 
 LAN party... Wednesday, my crib. 
 Of course. I'll bring the bean dip. 
 B.Y.O.C.! 
 I  don't  drink coffee. 
 But I do enjoy a nice cup of tea. 
 [Computer chimes] 
 [Beep] 
 Jack, we need you and the rest of the I.R.T. back at base asap. 
 Where we off to this time, boss? 
 Cairo, Egypt. 
 Mm. The land of pharaohs. 
 More recently, like the land of social unrest and instability. 
 Let's catch everyone up, Monty. 
 As-salaam-alaikum, agents. Okay, Malik Said, 25, a first-generation Egyptian American, was found dead this morning  on the outskirts of Cairo when an unsub threw this into his car. 
 Simmons : [Whistles] Wow. 
 Chemical attacks... Brutal. 
 Burns everything inside and out. 
 Also causes trouble breathing, coughing up blood, and tissue necrosis before it kills you. 
 Killing with gas as a murder weapon is not only uncommon, it's also highly unpredictable. 
 The gas could be an indication that our unsub wants his victims to suffer... 
 Getting off on the visceral brutality of watching them boil alive. 
 A true sadist. 
 So why Malik? 
 Malik Said was R.O.T.C. in college, served in the army for two years till he tore up his knee and got an honorable discharge. 
 He moved to Egypt to start a business. 
 So an ex-military American killed in Egypt by a chemical attack? 
 Could be terrorism. 
 Just last year, a wave of terror attacks swept over Egypt's northern Sinai peninsula. 
 They used chemical gases and left many civilians dead. 
 Yeah, those attacks were carried out by a known islamic state affiliate called the province of Sinai, a known splinter group of the Muslim brotherhood. 
 So, what was Malik doing out there at that time of night? 
 We think he was there to meet Henry "Hank" Willis, a 25-year-old American graduate student from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, who, like nearly 600 other U.S. citizens  is currently studying in Egypt. 
 Hank was an employee at the camel shop and clocked out just minutes before Malik was killed. 
 Where is Hank now? 
 In the wind... Local P.D. has had no luck in trying to find him for questioning, but they did find his phone in the car, along with Malik's. They're sending over the data now. 
 What's Malik and Hank's connection? 
 Uh, undetermined. They didn't go to work or school together, and they didn't share any social media friends. 
 Hank's phone at the time he clocked out at work puts him at the scene of the crime. 
 Yeah, but if you're gonna kill somebody, you don't leave your phone behind. 
 Unless you panic. 
 Hank is a suspect, and we need to find him before the Egyptian police do. 
 They'll shoot first and ask questions later. 
 Well, Hank could have run anywhere by now. 
 Or moved on to his next victim. 
 [Lantern squeaking] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 [Muffled] 
 Help me! 
 Help me! 
 Help me! 
 Help me! 
 Help me! 
 Monty : "Listen to your convictions, even if they seem absurd to your reason." Egyptian proverb. 
 Once we de-plane, the deputy minister will confirm our modus operandi while in Cairo. 
 Hey, Jack. 
 Seems the deputy minster's already decided to come aboard. 
 What's he doing? 
 He's telling us it may be  our  plane, but it's  his  country. 
 Welcome to Cairo, agents. 
 Unit chief Jack Garrett. 
 SSA's Clara Seger, Matt Simmons, and Mae Jarvis. 
 I'm deputy minister Akram Sarkis. 
 'Ahlaan. 
 Deputy minister, we put in a request for weapons clearance. 
 I'm afraid it's been denied, due to political recourse. 
 The fact that an American student, also a former soldier, Has been murdered in Egypt is already drawing international attention. 
 Any perception that Egypt's government is being influenced by outside sources, particularly American, and tensions in the region could boil over. 
 Of course. I understand. 
 In return, I'd like to get some armed escorts. 
 That shouldn't be too hard. 
 Any luck tracking down Hank Willis? 
 Negative. 
 He kept a low profile... Very few friends or co-workers. 
 Anything else that can help us moving forward? 
 It seems that Malik Said was not the first person to die by this M.O. In Cairo. 
 A local resident, Jabir Ghannam, was gassed in his bedroom a few days ago. 
 Why are we just learning about this now? 
 We believed the man's death to be a suicide and didn't make the connection until we started to investigate Malik's death. 
 It's a strange way to kill oneself. 
 What makes you think it's suicide? 
 The victim was alone, and there was no forced entry into the apartment. 
 Who found him? 
 His wife. 
 She was at her parents' house with their daughter, and when she returned to the apartment, she made the discovery. 
 We looked into her alibi. It checked out. 
 We'd still like to have a chat with her. 
 Of course. 
 Clara and Mae, you check in with Jabir's widow, see what she has to say. 
 Simmons and I will take a drive out to the crime scene. 
 Then we'll regroup back here. 
 You are more than welcome to use any of our facilities if need be. 
 Well, thank you, Deputy, but our resources are on the plane, and seeing as the airport is central to the rest of Cairo, it makes sense to use this as base camp. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Excuse me. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Agents. 
 Yeah? 
 Please. 
 Give me something good, Monty. 
 Hank and Malik's phones both had red phone applications on them. 
 Red phone? 
 Point-to-point telephonic encryption designed to protect callers from having their communications intercepted. 
 The messages erase themselves both off the screen and the server 90 seconds after being opened. 
 They wanted a secure line of communication between them. 
 So what were they trying to hide? 
 Think these guys are C.I.A. 
 Should we give the company a call? 
 If we want to wait six months for a definitive answer. 
 But, Monty, why... 
 Don't I bring the family in for an interview and see what they know? 
 Yes. 
 But if they  were intelligence,  they would have never told their families the truth. 
 Let me see what I can fish out of them. 
 Just remember... they'll have mundane cover stories, and the details won't add up. 
 ♪ 
 Mae : We're so sorry for your loss. 
 I told the police that Jabir wouldn't kill himself. 
 He loved his family too much. 
 But... They would not listen. 
 Clara : We understand. 
 Do you? 
 Are you two mothers? 
 Do you know how it feels to be alone in the world and wonder how you will feed your child? 
 I don't. 
 But I do want to find out who did this to your husband and bring them to justice. 
 Yeah, I would like to believe you, but nobody cares for the poor in this country. 
 We can help you. 
 Did you or your husband know either of these men? 
 Did he have any arguments, disagreements, grievances with anyone of recent? 
 Have you walked down the streets of Cairo? 
 That's every day here. 
 Did you husband have any outstanding debts or business dealings gone wrong? 
 No. 
 Jabir was sick for so long. 
 I pray now he has found peace. 
 Sick how? 
 He had headaches, coughed a lot. 
 How am I supposed to know? I'm not a doctor. 
 What did he do for a living? 
 There are few jobs in Cairo. 
 Like most men, he went down to the barricades every morning. 
 The barricades? 
 It's a wall in Cairo where men go to find work, if you're picked. 
 Mostly manual labor, but every little bit helps. 
 The day of his death, where were you and your child? 
 I-I told the police this already. 
 I was at my mother's house. 
 She's sick. I take care of her. 
 Jabir was supposed to meet us, but he slept in. 
 Is that your daughter? 
 Yes. 
 That's Bishara. 
 Jabir took it. 
 Is that jabir? 
 Yes. 
 He had a beautiful eye. 
 Your daughter... Where is she now? 
 With her teta. 
 Please. 
 Find the men who did this to my husband and make them pay. 
 We have preserved everything, as you requested, Agent Garrett. 
 Thank you, Minister. 
 I'd say we can rule out terrorism. 
 And how do you figure that? 
 It's hard to spread fear from an isolated location. 
 No witnesses, no media coverage, no point. 
 Terrorists like attention. 
 This place doesn't give them that. 
 But I can see why the unsub drew Malik out here alone at night. 
 It's the perfect place to strike undetected. 
 Yeah, the desert acts as a natural forensic countermeasure, too. 
 The sun, the sand, critters... They remove trace evidence. 
 High winds cover up the rest. 
 If the unsub left anything behind, it's blown away. 
 So, let's walk through this. 
 Malik drives up. 
 Hank gets in. 
 We know this because his phone was found on the passenger side. 
 Why does he then get out again? 
 Malik pops the trunk. 
 Oh. 
 Someone was thirsty. 
 [Blows] 
 What do you got, Jack? 
 Sand covers, but it rarely sticks. 
 From the look of this blood splatter, someone was struck here, then they fell to the ground. 
 This was a blitz attack to incapacitate Hank. 
 He's not our unsub. He's a victim. 
 Mrs. Said, I am sorry for your loss and appreciate you coming in at this time. 
 If it helps catch the monster who did this to my son, then so be it. 
 Now, can you tell me what Malik was doing in Egypt? 
 Malik had been visiting Cairo since he was young. 
 He had a special connection to the land. 
 That you left. 
 Yes. 
 It's ironic. 
 You fight and claw to get out of someplace to give your children a better life, and then they grow up and go right back to the place you ran from. 
 What was Malik's business in Cairo? 
 He had an export-import business. 
 What kind of export-import? 
 Egyptian spices. 
 [Door opens] 
 I'm Brenda Willis, Hank's mom. 
 Of course. 
 I'm Russ Montgomery, one of the agents working on your son's investigation. 
 Any updates on Hank? 
 Not yet. 
 But if I could please ask you to give us a mo... 
 I am so sorry that we are meeting under these circumstances. 
 I can't imagine what you're going through. 
 My thoughts and prayers are with you and your son Malik. 
 Thank you for your kind words. 
 I hope that your boy is found soon. 
 Thank you. 
 Since you're both here... 
 One of the things that we're trying to figure out is how Hank and Malik knew one another. 
 Oh... I have no idea. 
 I'm very close with Malik. I speak to him all the time. 
 But he has never mentioned her son... Hank? 
 Mrs. Willis, were you going to say something? 
 What? 
 No, I... 
 It's been a long couple of days. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. 
 Of course. 
 No worries. 
 Mrs. Said, I can reach you wherever it is you're staying and give you updates as I receive them. 
 I cannot go until my son's body returns home. 
 Then I will take him and have him buried next to his father. 
 Now, Mrs. Willis, if you'll come with me, I'll be able to fill you in on the details of your son's disappearance. 
 Okay. 
 [Sobs] 
 All right. Mrs. Willis, what aren't you telling me? 
 I was just trying to protect her. 
 Malik's mother doesn't know who her son really was. 
 But you  do? 
 Yes. 
 Look, I understand that there are certain people's professional lives that require them to live a lie. 
 And for some, that's true in their personal lives, too. 
 Mrs. Willis. 
 My son might be missing, but her boy is dead. 
 The last thing that woman needs is to be alone. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Hey. How'd it go? 
 Hank's not responsible for Malik's death. 
 He was abducted. 
 Any luck with Jabir's widow? 
 Yeah, I mean, she's angry, but she's also grieving the loss of her husband. 
 Yeah, she said that Jabir was sick, but she wouldn't tell us how. 
 How could we expect her to tell us the truth with the Egyptian military standing right there? 
 Oh, speaking of, Monty was able to get us Jabir's medical records, and there have been several pages redacted, so there are things that they don't want us to know. 
 They might become a problem, Jack. 
 That's why I suggested we use the plane as a base. 
 Ever since the military coup, I'm sure everything the Egyptians are offering is bugged. 
 Well, not to mention we share very different views about what democracy means. 
 We have had better luck looking into the gas that was used on Malik. 
 It is a lachrymatory agent. 
 It's similar to phenacyl chloride, which is a popular riot-control gas. 
 It's banned by international convention, but it is used by the Egyptian government. 
 The gas, when dispensed in large crowds, weakens as it spreads, causing only nausea, but in a contained space, it'll kill you within two minutes. 
 So where did the unsub get his hands on a government-controlled gas? 
 Or did the unsub work for the government? 
 [Computer chimes] 
 Hey, guys, I think I know what Hank and Malik were really hiding. They were in a relationship. 
 Homosexuality is against the law in almost all of the Middle East. 
 Punishable by arrest, whippings, even death. 
 Well, under the Al-sisi regime, homosexuality is legal in Egypt, but men suspected of being gay are subject to arrest on charges of debauchery, and over 250 men have been arrested on related charges in this last year alone. 
 Well, it's only legal in name. 
 Their basic freedoms are still in danger. 
 Which is explains why Malik and Hank were using red phones to send messages to one another. 
 And why they never had any pictures together. 
 This isn't a murder. 
 It's a hate crime. 
 [Groans] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Groans] 
 Where's Malik? 
 [Snake hissing] 
 Oh, no. 
 Get that thing away from me. 
 You brought this onto yourself... 
 You and all your friends. 
 No, no, no. 
 Please. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 No! Aah! 
 If Hank is alive, we're running out of time to find and save him. 
 So if this  is  a hate crime, who's committing it? 
 Well, take your pick. We've got a lot of options. 
 The Arab Spring puts the Muslim brotherhood in power, then two years later, they're totally taken out of it. 
 Could be a fractured group that's still active. 
 Or the current regime. 
 They legalized homosexuality as a way to make nice to the west, but behind closed doors, they've got a different agenda. 
 Like appeasing fundamentalists. 
 What about the first victim... Jabir? 
 Does this mean he was gay? 
 We could interview the wife again. 
 
 
 
 Hey, guys, on Malik's phone, I found some text messages. 
 I thought the red phone application erased all messages. 
 The messages do, but the senders don't. The thing about the 256-bit cipher is that it's designed to protect against brute-force attacks on consumer-grade hardware. It's not really intended to protect against the unmitigated power of the national geospatial intelligence agency. 
 Yeah, let's try that again in English. 
 Okay. 
 There's a hidden list of contacts... 10, to be exact. 
 Now, the encryption is weak, so our computers can crack it, but the messages are gonna be a little harder. 
 Tracking names down the good, old-fashioned way won't speed this up. 
 If I could just focus on  one  name, I could put all my efforts into that. 
 And I can probably get you their messages. 
 You said Malik's mother was unaware of her son's lifestyle. 
 Then maybe this is as simple as a process of elimination. 
 [Coughing] 
 That rush you feel is the viper's poison working its way through your system. 
 What do you want? 
 Answers to my questions. 
 Why would I tell you anything? 
 Because if you do... 
 I will give you the antidote. 
 Sabah was his cousin, Wahlaan, his landlord, and Galila was his fiancée. 
 You sure of this? 
 Yes. 
 They took a break recently, but Malik told us they would get back together soon. 
 Who is Omar? 
 I've never heard of Omar. 
 Or Mahdoor. 
 They played soccer with Mahdoor. 
 "They" who? 
 I think what's important here is to focus on finding Brenda's son and whoever did this to Malik. 
 Brenda. 
 You know my Malik? 
 Then why didn't you say so earlier? 
 Because you've been through a lot, and I didn't want to upset you. 
 About what? 
 About Malik... and Hank. 
 They were friends? 
 They were in love. 
 Shame on you... To speak ill of the dead. 
 [Door opens] 
 Monty : You were right, Jack. Omar was the only name his mother did not know. It seems Omar has a moving party for LGBT members in Cairo. You text him, and he texts you back wherever the venue is that night. 
 Smart way to keep one step ahead of the local P.D. 
 It's Malik and Hank's M.O. 
 All right, I'm sending you Omar's work address now and a photo to identify him. 
 Good work, Monty. 
 Oh, one more thing. 
 One of the names on the list is  supposedly Malik's ex-fiancée. 
 You got a name and address for her, too? 
 On its way. 
 Jack, why don't Mae and I go ask the deputy for assistance interviewing Malik's ex-fiancée, and then you and Simmons can go talk to Omar without a babysitter? 
 Sounds like a plan. 
 ♪ 
 [Vendors shouting] 
 Khan el-Khalili market is the original burial site for the Fatimid dynasty, who founded Cairo. 
 Wow. 
 "Wow"... yeah. 
 That's exactly what the ancient romans said when they saw it around 100 A.D. 
 [Laughs] 
 That's him. 
 [Blows] 
 If you're looking for copper, you're at the right place. 
 My prices are very fair. 
 I'm looking for some information. 
 I enjoy America... The Kardashians and such... 
 But you will ask questions and go while I must stay and deal with police. 
 All right, well, you have our word... 
 Anything that's said between us will stay here. 
 Ah. This is where I say "why should I trust you?" 
 And then you will tell me because I have no choice. 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 Hurry, then... Before the police see us. 
 You know these guys? 
 No. Why should I? 
 We know who you are and what you do, Omar, and the sooner you give us the truth, the sooner we go away. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes, that is Hank and Malik. 
 What about this guy? 
 No. 
 You sure about that? 
 Look, our community is very small, very trustful. 
 That man is not a part of it. 
 What is this all about? 
 We think someone's targeting gay men in Cairo. 
 Oh, that's nothing new. 
 So, what can you tell us about Hank and Malik? 
 They took no guff from anybody. 
 What makes you say that? 
 They got into a fight with some guy during one of our last parties. 
 I had to kick him out. 
 Who? 
 Look. We can't trust the police, so we police ourselves. 
 That man was a real homophobe. 
 So we took care of him... 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 And kept sure he never come back. 
 Safar Arabi. 
 It's Safar. Call me back. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Screaming continues] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 Who's the vic'? 
 Uh, Safar Arabi. We thought he was a suspect. 
 What did the ex-fiancée say? 
 Uh, that she was being a good friend acting as a beard for Malik. 
 Did Monty check out safar? 
 Yeah. Quite the rap sheet. 
 A lot of disturbing the peace, assaults. 
 Huh. So he's a yapper and a scrapper. 
 Jack : What aren't we seeing here? 
 We thought this was a hate crime, but by all accounts, both the first kill, Jabir, and the latest, Safar, were not of the gay community. 
 Well, something is tying these two together. 
 Question is, what? 
 Safar's bag. 
 Ah. 
 Hey, guys, take a look at this. 
 You can tell from their eyes... 
 That's Safar... 
 That's Hank... 
 I'm pretty sure that's Malik. 
 I don't see Jabir anywhere. 
 How is he connected to all this? 
 And what is that banner they're holding? 
 "Ash-sha'b yurid isqat an-nizam." 
 "The people want to take down the regime." 
 That's what the protesters chanted during the Arab Spring. 
 Safar, Hank, and Malik were protesters. 
 Which means someone is killing everyone in this picture. 
 [Grunting] 
 I need another name. 
 Who are you? 
 You work for the government? 
 Huh?! 
 Answer me! 
 Names, or you will hurt some more. 
 I gave you a name! 
 I need another! 
 [Voice breaking] 
 I can't. 
 [Nail gun fires] 
 Aaaaah! 
 [Muffled screaming] 
 You  will! 
 Three of the four people in this picture are either dead or missing. 
 There's only one person left. 
 So, why is the unsub targeting these men? 
 We now know these aren't hate crimes. 
 It could be about the subversives. 
 Which Hank and Malik definitely were, both as protesters and for being gay. 
 Well, unfortunately, safar's journal isn't much help in identifying the group's members. 
 So far, the only ones I can make out are Hank and Malik, whom he refers to fondly, like brothers. 
 Then why the blowout at the party? 
 Hank had started this pro-democracy group with protesters weeks before Egypt's Arab Spring began. 
 He called them the Khepers. 
 Egyptian name for "scarab." 
 Only, Safar was the true brains and organizer behind the protests. 
 Two young alpha males in a heightened situation. 
 Hank was ready to start fighting for better gay rights in Egypt. 
 But Safar wasn't? 
 Well, not yet. 
 He felt like the group hadn't achieved their goals from the Arab Spring, and to add yet another cause would only make it that much harder. 
 It was a disagreement over their priorities. 
 Hank and Malik fought for the basic rights of the Egyptian people when their own freedoms were still in jeopardy. 
 And he could identify the others in the picture. 
 The unsub was using Hank for information. 
 When the unsub gets it, Hank is as good as dead. 
 [Tablet chimes] 
 Hey, Monty. 
 Hey. I'm having no luck with this facial recognition of the last protester. Their face is covered, and the Egyptian government is being less than cooperative with the access to their records. 
 It's time for me to have a chat with the deputy minister. 
 ♪ 
 [Speaking Arabic] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Has your team identified the last person in the picture? 
 No. 
 But we aren't supposed to, are we? 
 Let me be blunt. 
 These are starting to feel like government-sanctioned hits. 
 You think  we're  doing this? 
 You  tell  me. 
 I can assure you that we're not behind any of this. 
 So it's just coincidence that Americans and subversives are dying on your watch. 
 Maybe you and your team have overstayed your welcome, Agent Garrett. 
 Or maybe we're just getting closer to the truth. 
 And which truth is that? 
 The one where you withhold information from us about Malik and Hank's sexuality? 
 I would have liked to have shared it, but I have concerns about your country's policies. 
 Not the ones you march out to the world, but the ones behind closed doors. 
 You can't possibly condone this kind of abnormal behavior. 
 It doesn't matter what I believe or condone. 
 It's the law in both our countries. 
 It's our job to uphold it. 
 Your government has records on everything that happened during the Arab Spring. 
 I believe you know who this last person in the picture is. 
 I can't say we do. 
 The last I checked, the U.S. is Egypt's number-one aid provider. 
 If you want it to stay that way, I suggest you get me what I'm looking for. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 Damn straight I am. 
 How'd that go? 
 Not sure. 
 What'd you say? 
 I threatened that the U.S. would pull aid to Egypt. 
 You can do that? 
 You think I can? 
 I don't know. 
 Then it's working. 
 Every other victim is accounted for except Jabir. 
 What's he have to do with everyone in this picture? 
 All those photos on Jabir's wall. 
 He was a photographer. What if he took the picture? 
 We need to go speak to his widow, Neith, again. 
 [Horns honking] 
 Neith's landlord said she left soon after we did and hasn't returned since, but look what the police found under their mattress... 
 Jabir's suicide note. 
 So he  wasn't  murdered. 
 Apparently not, but why did Neith tell us that he was? 
 Either she doesn't know or it's a countermeasure to the truth. 
 What does Jabir say in his letter? 
 Talks about how he has suffered for years from gas exposure while shooting photography during the Arab Spring for Hank and the Khepers. 
 Seems Jabir was the official cameraman for Hank and his crew. 
 [Hollow tapping] 
 And here's our modus operandi. 
 Could be Jabir's. 
 Well, he may have bought them, but he only used one on himself. 
 Look at the imprints in the dirt... 
 Shows others are missing. 
 Neith is our unsub. 
 And her husband's suicide was the trigger. 
 If she thought had her husband never been involved with the protesters, he'd still be alive. 
 But instead of going after the people who hurt him, she blames Hank and his group for putting him in harm's way. 
 And she's using the same weapon that injured her husband to go after her victims. 
 So the details are important to her. 
 The use of gas is symbolic. 
 Trauma-induced retribution seekers are rarely indifferent to the specifics of their crimes. 
 If that's the case, then maybe Neith is holding Hank in a location that was important to the group. 
 [Dialing] 
 Monty, I need you to show Malik's mother that photo. 
 She may know where it was taken. 
 We believe that's where our unsub is holding Hank. 
 Thank you for coming back. 
 You said it was important. 
 It is, Mrs. Said. I need your help. 
 My son is dead. What else do you want from me? 
 To help save someone else's son. 
 A son whose mother is a liar. 
 Look, Hank is still out there. Now, if you'll just take a look at this... 
 I won't! I won't look at anything else! 
 You know, I spoke to Brenda earlier, who told me about how Hank and Malik came out to her farm last summer and what a lovely time they had. 
 Now, you may not be able to accept Hank and Malik's relationship... 
 But you can't deny it. 
 Wait. 
 Let me look at the picture. 
 Do you know of Malik's protest in the Arab Spring? 
 Proudly. 
 Do you recognize this location in the photo? 
 That post. 
 It's an old archeological dig site near my family's home. 
 One year, Malik, his sister, and I tied a blue ribbon around that post for my father, who passed away. 
 It was his favorite color. 
 Thank you. 
 Jack, Hank is being held at an archaeological dig site 16 miles north of your current position. 
 Hopefully, the unsub is there, too. 
 I'm sending coordinates to the S.U.V.'s nav now. 
 How are Simmons and Mae doing identifying the last target? 
 Well, your bluff worked. 
 The deputy minister I.D.'d the last person in the photo. 
 We located him in a mosque. 
 Simmons and Mae are on their way now.

 Help me! 
 Somebody help me! 
 [Screaming, pounding] 
 Stop! 
 [Screaming continues] 
 Stop! 
 Neith. 
 We can help you. 
 You cannot help me. 
 Just like no one could help Jabir. 
 He was an artist, until he met Hank, who told him he could change the world with his pictures. 
 Hank was only trying to help your husband. 
 Instead, he doomed him. 
 Jabir was following Hank and his friends, when Mubarak's thugs shot, stabbed, and gassed them, like they were nothing. 
 I know. I know. 
 What they did to those protesters was horrible. 
 Jabir was never the same. 
 Always there... 
 But never here. 
 And for what? 
 Arab Spring was a failure. 
 All it brought was pain and suffering. 
 Change takes time, Neith. 
 There  is  no more time. 
 Think about your daughter. 
 [Voice breaking] 
 I am. 
 Neith! 
 [Crash] 
 ♪ 
 He was definitely held here. There's no doubt about it. 
 So where is Hank now? 
 Maybe she already gassed him, like all the others. 
 Then we'd find his body. 
 Hank wasn't just another protester. 
 It was his group. 
 He led them into danger. 
 Well, he's the one Neith sees responsible for putting her husband in the ground. 
 We know she was impatient and sadistic. 
 That gas kills within minutes. 
 Her husband suffered for years and then died. 
 There's no way she'd let Hank off that easy. 
 She'd want him to feel pain. 
 To feel lost and alone, like her husband did when he killed himself. 
 So... 
 Where do you hide something in the desert? 
 You bury it. 
 She buried Hank alive. 
 [Grunting] 
 [Thud] 
 Got it! 
 [Shouting in Arabic] 
 Hang in there, Hank! 
 Hank! 
 If you can hear me, we're almost there! 
 We've got you, son. 
 You're safe now. 
 [Coughs] 
 Let's get you home, son. 
 I appreciate your help. 
 You left me little choice. 
 I'm sorry about that. 
 Now it is  I   that don't believe you. 
 Your country is in the beginning stages of your new democracy. 
 The U.S.A. has over 200 years, and we're still ironing out some things. 
 Ohh! 
 My baby. 
 [Voice breaking] 
 Ohh.
