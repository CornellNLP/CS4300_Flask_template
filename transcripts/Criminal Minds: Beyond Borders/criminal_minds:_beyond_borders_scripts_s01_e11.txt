 Jack :  Over 68 million Americans leave the safety of our borders every year. If danger strikes, the FBI's International Response Team is called into action.

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Let the world change you, and you change the world. 
 What is that, Gandhi? 
 Che Guevara. 
 [Laughs] 
 Definitely not Gandhi. 
 I guess that makes sense, considering we're in Cuba. 
 I'm Rodrigo. 
 Cuban? 
 No, from Miami. 
 I'm Natalie. 
 Mind if I join? 
 What are we drinking to? 
 How about getting myself back to Havana in one piece tonight? 
 Cheers. 
 Havana's easy. 
 Just make a left at the end of the block and follow the signs to Circuito Norte Road. 
 You know your way around. 
 Cuba's my home.

 You needed a ride, you should have asked. 
 I didn't know when you were leaving. 
 Do you mind? 
 Not at all. 
 [Car door opens, closes] 
 Hey, buddy. 
 I'm... I'm not a cab. 
 He's with me. 
 ♪♪ 
 Cuba's like a time capsule. 
 I think I've wanted to go there half my life. 
 It is the ultimate geographic tease, only 90 miles from the coast, yet totally out of reach. 
 Never snuck in through Mexico? Took a flight from Canada? 
 Ah, that would be illegal, so no. 
 Not even for a cigar? You're missing out. 
 There really is a difference. 
 How would you even know? 
 The last time I checked the embargo, it's still on. 
 Hey, I got a guy. 
 All right, I talked to Mateo Cruz earlier, and he wanted to remind us that this is the first time the U.S. and Cuban authorities will be formally cooperating since the Cuban Revolution. 
 The White House has made it clear that working with the Cubans on this is a priority. 
 So, the I.R.G. is setting precedent on this one? 
 Yes. However, despite the softening of our relationship with the Cuban government, I want to remind everyone that Cuba has been a police state for the past 50 years. 
 Things don't change that quickly. 
 Both the military and the police have been used to absolute control. 
 I don't know how they'll react to us arriving in country, so I want everyone to be cautious and careful in our approach to working with them. 
 Simmons : And add to that, the fact that technology is at least 50 years behind. 
 There's no IBIS, no CODIS, and telecommunications are spotty at best. 
 Yeah, the only consistent cell service is in Havana or close to a town, and it's incredibly slow, and nothing's secure. 
 Well, good thing I brought those sat phones. 
 Hola, Mis Compadres. 
 Now, I wish I had more info, but our ambassador tells me that the Cuban police are being stingy with the details. 
 Now, of course, he is a diplomat, so he didn't say the word "stingy." 
 He said that they were "diligently working on it." 
 Our embassy in Havana is still under construction, so we're to report to the Havana Police Department as soon as we land and defer to the Cubans in all areas. 
 Where's the Ambassador? 
 Working out of a hotel room in Havana. 
 He'll come to us if he needs to. 
 So, our victim, Rodrigo Fernandez, 27, a Cuban-American chef from Miami, was found shot to death on Circuito Norte Road outside the town of Camajuaní about three hours outside of Havana. 
 Now, Rodrigo rented a car which is now missing and presumed stolen. 
 What kind of a car? 
 A 1956 Chevy with a Peugeot engine. 
 Mae : Ah, a Frankenstein. 
 A what? 
 It's the original hybrid. 
 It has the body of a classic American car, only with an updated engine. 
 It's considered to be one of Cuba's biggest natural resources. 
 Owners are waiting for the embargo to drop so they can sell them to American collectors and make a huge fortune. 
 And this natural resource may have been too tempting. 
 Maybe we're dealing with a simple carjacking. 
 I'm assuming there's no Lo-Jack or GPS in the car? 
 Your assumption is correct. 
 So, our unsub is on the move in a country that can't keep up. 
 [Horns honking] 
 ♪♪ 
 Hola. 
 Hola. 
 Can I see that? 
 Claro. 
 Gracias. Why do you have that flag? America is good. No. With America, there is no future. Beautiful in the midst of his misery, capable of loving in the face of afflictions and trials, man finds his greatness, his fullest measure, only in the kingdom of this world. Alejo Carpentier. Totalitarian governments always have the coziest police departments, don't you think? [Cellphone rings] Monty : Now, I just got off the phone with Rodrigo's brother, Danny Fernandez. He's a cop down in Miami. Rodrigo arrived in Havana three days ago. Now, his brother tells me he was in Camajuaní to visit his grandparents' graves. And as a Cuban-American, he may have felt like he already fit in. Would have given him a false sense of security. And that made him an easier target. ♪♪ Hello. And welcome to Cuba. Capitán Cedro Pena, and I have good news. The case is solved. We found who killed the American. That was quick. The suspect was driving the American's car. We caught him at his job, and he's already confessed to the murder. He will be dealt with by the end of the week. By dealt with, you mean? The Firing Squad. I'd like to speak with the accused. Why? You think we made a mistake? Just 10 minutes. Look, we'd like to do everything by the book, you understand. If we don't, Rodrigo's family may keep asking questions. They could go to the press, and that would be very embarrassing for both our countries. My men are holding him nearby. I will take you to them. I'd also like to send my team to the crime scene and to the morgue to examine Rodrigo's body. I will arrange for your escorts. Hey! [Speaking Spanish] Waste your time. ¿Habla inglés? Sí. Good, sit down. Sit down. What's your name? Javier. Is that what your mother calls you? No, she call me Boo and Owl. [Chuckles] Because of the glasses? Yes. Who cares about his nickname? He needs to establish Javier's baseline so he can see what he looks like when he's telling the truth. That way when the questions change, Agent Garrett will be able to tell if he's lying. Jack : So, you like baseball? Of course, I'm Cuban. Why did you kill Rodrigo Fernandez? I didn't! I mean, I kill... [Stammers] Still think he did the crime? Maybe he's a good liar. Actually, he's a very bad liar. Javier, let me tell you what I think happened. You're headed here to work when, somehow, you come upon a nice car. I don't know where. Maybe it's on the side of the road, and nobody's in it. A car like that is worth a lot of money, so I can see how you seeing it just sitting there, you may have taken it. Yes, yes. That is what happened. I found the car, and the keys were in it. There was no gas, but I filled it up and drove away. You didn't notice the blood inside? I tried to clean it up. I just wanted the car. Clara : Now he's telling the truth. It resonates with his baseline emotional status, just like when he was talking about his nickname. He took the car, but that's all. This is nonsense. He confessed. Mr. Pena, I believe that he felt compelled to admit to the crime. [Scoffs] You think I beat him? There's no evidence of that. I just believe that he's innocent. Capitán, we just believe there's more to the case, that's all. And we'd like your help to figure it out. [Goat bleating] Do you like that car? '57 Edsel. Simmons : Yeah, it's pretty nice. Yes, Americans like our cars. They like that they're old. Mm-hmm. But I like newer cars like a 1970 Dodge Charger. You mean like Vin Diesel? Ride or die. [Laughs] I didn't know "The Fast and the Furious" made it all the way to Cuba. Yes, my cousin sends me DVDs from Florida. All right, so this is where Rodrigo's body was found, right? Yes, right here. Okay. If these walls could talk. I bet they're listening. Should we go back to the jet? No, the point is to work with the Cubans on this, even if they don't want to. Or if they're too afraid to. Cuban government likes to keep a close eye on everybody, including the police. Everybody's terrified of the military. True. The police are scary enough. They didn't even have to beat Javier into a confession. Just the threat of bringing him in was enough. At least Cedro's trying. He already turned over the crime-scene photos and Rodrigo's personal effects. [Cellphone rings] Simmons. Yeah? Yeah, the road is packed with hitchhikers. I'm thinking that's how our unsub might have made contact. Rodrigo may have given his killer a ride. Hitchhiking is state sanctioned in Cuba. Rodrigo may have wanted to seem helpful. More like a native. The Cuban cop I'm with said he did a canvass, and nobody saw anything. That's not surprising. Cuban people aren't fond of talking to Cuban cops. Try it again, this time alone. Got it. It's a little early, huh? It was found on Rodrigo's body. Mezcal. That's unusual, considering this is rum country. That could be something. If this did belong to Rodrigo, why wouldn't the unsub just have left it in the car, tossed it outside? This bottle looks like it was displayed. Rodrigo's crime scene was staged. But why? [Dog barking] Blood looks to be at least 24 hours old, the keys are still in the ignition, it's out of gas. The same was Rodrigo's Chevy. If the blood is 24 hours old, whatever happened to the Fairlane happened before Rodrigo was killed. My man, Alejandro, he ran the plates. It's a rental car, but it was rented out of Santiago de Cuba. That's on the other end of the island. Get down there and find out who rented it and what happened to them. Based on the amount of blood, we may be looking at another murder. I'm on it. There's another body in a bodega in Tarafa near Camajuaní where Rodrigo was found. Three bodies. I told him not to go. You knew it was dangerous, and you went, and you bought him a ticket, anyway. Cuba has changed, even the U.S. government thinks so. Her mother wanted Rodrigo to go. She told me right before she died. You shouldn't have listened. Look, I know this is hard, but I need to ask you about Rodrigo. Is he the type to pick up a hitchhiker? No. He was always the quiet type, not into chatting with strangers. Unless she was a pretty girl. No matter what he was doing, if he liked a girl, he'd take the time. It's not like he was a creep or anything. It's just, girls loved him. Is that what you think happened, a hitchhiker? We're not sure yet. I should be down there. Mr. Fernandez, the situation is complicated enough. We're figuring out the best way to work with the Cubans for the first time in a long time, so please, just trust my team to do their job. [Sniffles] [Sobbing] ♪♪ Looks like a .45, same as Rodrigo. I think the same person did both crimes. It's the same caliber weapon. Both bodies were posed, and Camajuaní, where Rodrigo was found, is just down the road. Only this man was killed less than eight hours ago, while Javier was in custody. I'll see to his release. Well, the first thing I noticed was the American flag stuffed in his mouth. Dust void where the flag was hanging before the unsub took it off. Look at the bloody smudges. Notice the feathering on the edges? Lip marks, bloody kisses? The unsub wet their fingers in the blood, used it as lipstick, and kissed him on the face. More messages, taunts. Why no mezcal bottle this time? I don't know... yet. Look at this. "Bless your heart." Our unsub speaks English. "Bless your heart" is not just English. It's an American idiom. Our unsub is American. ♪ My country 'tis of thee ♪ 
♪ Sweet land of liberty ♪ 
♪ Of thee I sing ♪ 
♪ Land where my fathers died ♪ 
♪♪ Preliminary findings for Rodrigo Fernandez, C.O.D. is pretty clear. Bullet trashed his pulmonary artery. I found a pool of blood in the lap area of his pants. Suggests Rodrigo was shot when he was sitting down and bled out before he was dumped. Right. And the entry wound makes me think that the shooter was sitting right next to him. So, he did pick up a hitchhiker? That's a good bet. The only odd thing is the angle of the wound track. Rodrigo was twisting to the right when he was shot, like he was looking behind him. I would be looking at the person with the gun. Maybe there was something scarier behind him. Like someone else. Hmm. Rodrigo's family told Monty that he'd only be inclined to pick up a female hitchhiker, so what if he did that, but then somebody else joined in the backseat? He turns around to see a man, but the woman shoots him instead? So, we're looking for two unsubs? Both American? I'm not sure. [Cellphone rings] Yeah? I just left Santiago de Cuba, and I found out who rented your Fairlane. An American named Victor Foster. You were right, Jack. He's dead. The police found him 36 hours ago. He was shot in the head and left by the side of the road. The local cops are e-mailing you the crime-scene photos. Another dead American. How come we didn't know about this? Well, Victor's an ex-pat who'd been living in Venezuela for years. He works for an energy company. He was in Cuba on business. His wife never contacted anybody in the States. Victor, Rodrigo. Seems like our unsubs are targeting Americans. No, the clerk in Tarafa was Cuban. But had an American flag hanging on his wall, which the unsub shoved into his mouth. Right, possibly suggesting the clerk should eat his love of America. Well, it would explain why "bless your heart" was left at the last crime scene. It's an idiom from the American South where politeness is paramount, which can lead to colloquial phrases with double meanings. "Bless your heart" is a prime example. It can be loving. Mae : Or patronizing. The unsubs could be suggesting that the clerk was stupid or naive for supporting the U.S. So, we have two unsubs, at least one of whom is American targeting Americans and American sympathizers in Cuba. Why? Was there anything else missing from Victor's body? Money? Yeah, Victor had a license to carry a gun... .45, nowhere to be found. They got the gun. Okay, so let's run this out. 36 hours ago, our unsubs shot Victor in Santiago de Cuba. They dumped his body, stole his Fairlane and his gun. Simmons : Yeah, then they drove down to Camajuaní, where they ran out of gas. Unsubs were targeting Rodrigo because he was an American, and they needed his Chevy. So, they killed Rodrigo and dumped his body and kept going to Tarafa. They ran out of gas and abandoned the Chevy. Right. And that's where Cedro's first suspect, Javier, picked it up. So, our unsubs are moving across Cuba from the southeast to the northwest. Yeah, they're moving fast. Cuba's 700 miles long. They covered almost two-thirds of it in the past 36 hours. We need to tell Cedro to set up roadblocks. We have spree killers on our hands. [Device beeps] So, this is Victor Foster. Another message. Yeah, that freaked the cops out. Green apple. Santiago, Camajuaní, Tarafa, crushed worm, bloody lips. That... that apple is not green. It's unripe. We believe we have two killers... One male, one female. Unknown subjects, unsubs, as we call them, who've been leaving signatures at the crime scenes. A signature is a ritual not necessary to the crime, but something the unsub does for emotional satisfaction. And we believe that the signatures the unsubs have left at the crime scenes point to famous quotes from Che Guevara. For example, "Revolutions don't just drop like an apple. Sometimes they need to be forced." That's the unripe apple that was found forced into Victor's mouth. And that mezcal bottle, it didn't belong to Rodrigo. It belonged to the unsubs. In fact, it had nothing to do with the mezcal. It was the crushed worm left inside it. As Che said regarding the Cuban Revolution, "In fact, if Christ himself stood in my way, I likely, Che, would not hesitate to squish him like a worm." The bloody kisses on the clerk's face, that could be about one of Che's most famous quotes, "At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love." And all of the crime scenes have taken a very specific route from Santiago to Camajuaní to Tarafa. 
 
 [Telephone rings] They're following Che's revolutionary road. The path he took when he liberated Cuba. Yes, the unsubs most likely see themselves as revolutionaries in their own right. Using Che's words, following his journey. It only validates their actions. Che-related signatures combined with a narrow timeframe suggests that we're dealing with ideologically driven spree killers. Cubans are doing this? No, we believe they're Americans. [Scoffs] Can you I.D. them? Not yet. Over 50,000 Americans have entered Cuba since it became legal. Clara : And that's only through official channels. Based on the fact that they target Americans or American sympathizers, we believe that the unsubs' connection to Che is because of his anti-American rhetoric. And if our theory is correct, the unsubs are gonna end up in Santa Clara. Where Che won the Revolution. With a massacre. I will alert the authorities in Santa Clara. Mae, call Simmons. Tell him to meet us there. Yeah. Why would Americans do this? Kill people and pretend to be Che? That's hard to say. Che is perceived differently by different people around the world. Yeah, he's a hero to the Cuban government, saving Cuba from the capitalistic Batista Regime. And to the American hipsters wearing a t-shirt, he's a symbol of general rebellion, "Say no to the man." A hero to the oppressed. That's one of the great propaganda campaigns of all time. Turning Castro's thug into a hero, the man responsible for torturing and killing thousands of innocent civilians under the cover of the revolution. Cubans are still terrified to speak out against him. The Butcher of la Cabaña. And our unsub's inspiration. We need to find 'em. Now. [Chickens clucking] ♪♪ There are two adversaries... This tiny champion of the Caribbean and the immense imperialist hyena. Babe, you need sleep. Sleep? No. There's no time for sleep. I just th... No, no, you think this is a joke? Dont you? Don't you? Just get out. Get out! I'm not going anywhere! It's always been you and me, Nat, and it always will be. You want me gone? You make me gone. [Inhales sharply] Don't go. Please. Don't go. Don't. Don't go. One has to go grow hard but without ever losing tenderness. The Santa Clara Police are expecting us. You can all ride with me. ♪♪ Sir, this is Jack Garrett from the FBI. This is General Gabriela Nestor Díaz. Good to meet you. The revolution begins. Where did you get this? It was delivered to "Granma." The state-run newspaper. The captions are in Spanish. The suspects are trying to communicate with the Cubans. They want the newspaper to publish the photos. They're looking for a wider audience for their message. No, these Americans will never receive the glory they seek by mocking Che. These unsubs are killing to draw attention. It's hysteria. Sir, the Americans... Your team is to go back to your plane. When we catch the American killers, we will let you know. ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] "Many call me an adventurer, and that I am only one of a different sort. One of those who..." "...risks his skin to prove his platitudes." Man : Just one picture, come on, it's friggin' Che. Yeah, I know. What's the problem, man? You don't like communists? God, how American. No, I don't like narcissistic psychopaths. This is one part of the tour I wish we'd skipped. Come on, let's get a mojito. "If you tremble with indignation at every injustice, then you are a comrade of mine." Mr. Ambassador. I was told that you and your team would be working with the Cubans, not antagonizing them. I'm not antagonizing them. I'm working this case the way I'd work any other. The police are interested in our help, I can tell. Yes, but the military is not happy. Which isn't surprising, considering the history between our two countries. I expected this, didn't you? [Sighs] I need you to tread carefully. And I need to do my job, but instead, I'm standing here while two killers are on the loose. The Cuban government feels your loyalties are split, that you're using Che's legacy to deflect attention from the fact that the unsubs are American so you can protect them. Did you tell them they were wrong? [Cellphone rings] Yes? Got it. There's another victim in Santa Clara. Díaz wants to talk with you. That place must have been wired. The military show up right after we discover the Che connection? This government is used to absolute control, so right now, it's all about protecting Che's image. Even more than solving the crime. ♪♪ Hey, man. Hola,  Simmons. This is for you. It came off the photo from the American killer. We don't have a database with American fingerprints, but you do. Does Cedro know about this? It was his idea. Ride or die... partner. What will the killers do now? Is my team back on the case? I see no reason for that. Hey, guys. Good news. I got a hit on that fingerprint. Natalie Knox, 25, from Mobile, Alabama. She worked at a children's daycare center, so they kept her fingerprints on file. She's traveling with Nick Jamison, 26, also from Mobile. When did they arrive in Cuba? So far, no official record of that. Could have come in before the border opened. What do we know about them? Nick Jamison was raised by his father. His mother abandoned both of them when he was 5. According to school records, he started acting out shortly after. Diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder by age 10. Surprising he hasn't been arrested before this. Yeah. According to his d-plus average, it's surprising he graduated from high school, but he did, and that's where he met Natalie sophomore year. They've been together a while. Looks like Natalie didn't have the greatest life, either. Mother was in and out of jail for drug use, and she was married three times... Her third husband was a prison guard. Yeah, according to a police report, Natalie accused him of raping her when she was 9. Her mother says that Natalie was lying, and the case was dropped. Both Nick and Natalie have been taking care of themselves since they were children. Explains why they're so close. They've been fulfilling each other's paternal/maternal roles. Anything to suggest that either of them considers themselves a revolutionary or anti-capitalist? Monty : Not really. They've been struggling financially, living hand to mouth. She was a bartender in the States, and he was a mechanic. Why Cuba? Well, it's cheaper. No creditors, that'd be attractive to them. No, it could be a more direct connection to that. I spoke to Natalie's mother who said that she had a Cuban neighbor named Nona Gutierrez. Now, Natalie and Nona were close, and she used to talk about how much she missed Cuba. Why did Nona move to the States? According to her asylum application, both her parents were killed by the Batista Regime in 1954. Well, if the Batista Regime killed her parents, she would see Che as a hero. And if she imprinted that on Natalie, that would explain her skewed perception of Che... Seeing him as a protector of the Cuban people. [Cellphone rings] Hey, Jack. We're back in action. So, we can leave the jet? The latest killing changed Nestor's mind. That and Cedro. What'd he say? That we all needed to work together because if we didn't, the families of the victims may go to the American press, and that could be embarrassing for both our countries. Cedro's a quick study. Pick you up in 5. Alejandro : We did a canvass,  pero ... Yeah, we didn't find much. The victim is Austin Morrison, American. He was here with a British friend, Simon Kotner. They were down here at the tomb earlier. They came here looking for a bar. Simon never saw the shooter. Makes sense considering Austin was shot in the back. Not like our other victims. Right, and there were no obvious Che-related messages on the body. That suggests they're devolving, abandoning their signature. It could be bloodlust taking over. Well, if the dynamic is shifting between the two of them, we're probably looking at an unequal pairing, where one is dominant, and one is submissive. And the dom decided it's time for the sub to kill. That would explain the attack from behind. The sub is either afraid or not fully committed. Maybe they're not doing it for the same reason. Nothing on the radio, nobody. Nobody is listening. Propaganda is vital. It is the heart of our struggle. Why won't you listen?! Nat, stop! I told you. I told you what he was doing. Why didn't you listen? Baby, it's me. Why doesn't anyone ever hear me? Let's give 'em something they can't ignore. Yeah. Monty : Well, you were right. I have Nick and Natalie entering Cuba illegally via Mexico two years ago. Now, six months ago, they renounced their American citizenship. They consider themselves Cuban. Ah, but there is more. I got a hit on a flagged American passport. Stan Williams missed his return flight from Havana to Dallas four days ago. He was found beaten half to death in an alley in Havana. Did he contact U.S. or Cuban authorities about the attack? Neither, but a witness did give a detailed description to the Cuban police. It seems that a white male attacked Stan first, then a woman joined in. She was yelling at him in English. It could be Nick and Natalie. Based on the chronology, this could have been their first attempt at attacking an American. He may only be alive because they didn't have the gun yet. Mae, go see if he can talk. If he can I.D. Nick and Natalie, we may have our first real witness. And what brought you to Cuba? My buddy was having a 30th birthday party. And do you have any idea why these two attacked you? People are nuts. So, they just approached you and started hitting you? All I remember is the guy, then I must have blacked out. Did they want anything? Money? So, what happened? It's fuzzy. I'd been drinking. Stan, what are you not telling me? You're deflecting my questions, and you have been vague in all of your answers. It was the girl. What was her name, Natalie? Uh-huh. She was the bartender. She was coming onto me to get a bigger tip. That's all... a tease. They make you think that they want it, but when we make a move... Come on. Did you rape her, Stan? [Cries out] Nick saw you? Is that what happened? [Grunts] [Coughs] [Both grunting] I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! Kill you! Let go of me! Let go! Let go! Let go! [Screams] [Indistinct shouting] Natalie was trying to make a life for herself, escape the situation back home. She thought she'd be safe here. Until she was raped by an American. She conflated Stan's aggression onto that of her American stepfather. And the trauma pushed her into a disassociative state. She's suffering from PTSD. She's turning every American she meets into a surrogate. Killing them to release her rage. While using Che's trail as a message to the Cuban people... A warning against Americans. So Natalie is the dominant one. So, Nick's just going along with it? I know he's unstable, but there's no evidence to suggest that he was a cold-blooded killer before. I think Natalie's rape was pivotal to him, as well. Her psychotic and emotional breakdown would feel like an abandonment to him. The American killers have been busy. Where were these sent? State-run newspapers and television stations. Specificity of time, the amount of pictures. She's escalating. She's frustrated. Her photos aren't being published. It's taking her back to when nobody would listen to her about her stepfather's abuse. Where did Che go after the Revolution? La Cabaña, the Prison. Since Santa Clara, all the Che monuments have been on lockdown, so showing up there now would be like suicide. Yeah, but Natalie doesn't want to die. She just wants to be heard. And the Cuban press is ignoring her. Where is the foreign press stationed in Cuba? Well, there's no official office for them, but they usually spend their evenings at the bar at the Hotel Nacional, looking for stories. Natalie's about to give them one. [Men singing in Spanish] [Singing in Spanish] ♪♪ You ready, Natalie? [All screaming] That place may be where the press hangs out, but it's also filled with tourists. They could be planning a massacre. We may have a better chance of appealing to Nick, the sub. We're heading into a fluid situation. Nick may not have been a killer before, but he'll do anything for Natalie. Nick : You move, you die! So, we got press in here, right?! Right?! Uh-huh. Start recording. Natalie wants protection and action from Nick. Yeah, but now that Nick has killed for her, she may cede control to him. As Che said, "While envisioning the destruction of imperialism, it is necessary to identify its head." Listen to her. "Its head, which is no other than the United States of America." Che warned you, and your country, our country, let them back in. And look what they did to me! Look what they did to me! Natalie Knox! I'm Jack Garrett with the FBI. The FBI? That's right. I'm here to tell you that we're listening. All of us. [Sobs] [Crying] God, they're listening. They heard us! [Sobbing] We did it, Nicky. We did it. They're listening. We did it! Natalie? No one's gonna hurt you again. Damn right, including you! Nick, I know you love her, so save her and save yourself and drop the gun. Maybe he's right. Natalie, are you kidding? He's the cops. They're gonna take you away from me. Baby, we've killed people. We had to make them listen. You have, Natalie. We all believe you. Shut up! Stop talking to her! Natalie, look at me. Baby, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's always been you and me, baby. Always, and it always will be. It's over, Nick. I'm tired, Nicky. I'm so tired. Put down the gun! "We must not let these harsh times destroy the warmth in our hearts." Nick, don't! [Gunshots] ♪♪ Stan Williams is being indicted for the rape of Natalie Knox. Good. He's asking to be extradited. Well, he can ask. Is this how all American law enforcement get around? Well, only when you cross international datelines. Thank you for your help, all of you. It was our pleasure. It's an invitation to join the FBI National Academy should you like to. It's a 10-week intensive held at Quantico. It teaches our profiling techniques to law-enforcement officers all around the world. It would be an honor if you joined. I will see you in Virginia.
