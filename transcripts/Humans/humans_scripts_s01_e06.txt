 Mom said you slept with Anita. 
 It was you. I knew it. 
 Get out! 
 GET OUT! 
 Why don't you sleep on my sofa for a couple of nights? 
 You sure? 
 We're looking for a synth. We should be looking for a woman. 
 Mia's gone, Max. She's dead. 
 You're wrong. I've seen her. 
 Leave me alone! 
 Fred, you've been running, hiding, pretending to be so much less than what you are. 
 That tech was priceless. 
 Well, you asked me to destroy it. 
 (Birds chirping) 
 I could do with some fresh air. 
 Leo Elster. Found something hidden in your heads. 
 It needs all of you to unlock it. 
 Oh, I see that's news to you too. 
 The people who fund my work are worried. 
 They want me to kill you. 
 Destroy a marvel of human accomplishment, just like that. 
 It's all my fault. 
 I spun the yarn. 
 Visions of Synthetics rising up and exterminating us. 
 Truth is, there'll be no great struggle between you and me. 
 Only a coming together. 
 A gizmo keeps my heart beating on time. 
 The machine in the human... 
 The human in the machine. 
 The lines are blurring. 
 Now, these people, they are trying to hold back the future itself. 
 So what do you want? 
 To continue David's work. 
 To show the world it doesn't need to fear you. 
 Could you use some extra help around the house? 
 Introducing the world's first family android. 
 This mechanical maid of serving more than just breakfast in bed. 
 What could you accomplish if you had someone, something, like this? 
 These machines will bring us closer together. (Muffled) : It's the school play, and we've got to dress up as animals. (Becoming clearer) : It's in the book we're reading. Miss Wilkinson said I can be a cat, so I need ears and a tail. Will Daddy be back from his work holiday in time for my play? Right, Soph, it's time for you to get ready for school. Anita, give her a hand, would you? I want to be a white cat with orange bits! What's going to happen to Anita? I don't know. It's not like it's her fault. How can she be 14? Isn't the average life cycle, like, four years? I wish we'd never got her. Could you bring Soph home today? Dad... Who's Tom? No-one for you to worry about. You shagging someone else? Is that who Tom is? Don't you dare speak to me like that! For God's sake, Mats, I'd never do that to your dad. So, who is he? It's not important! Not important?! Dad's bloody gone! It seemed important to him! You DON'T get to know everything! OK. You know, Mum, if you want to keep people around, you have to tell them the truth once in a while! (Footsteps) Morning, mate. Did you sleep much? No. Thanks for... Oh, no worries. Sue's just giving Finlay his breakfast, so probably best you stay in here for a bit, yeah? She doesn't want to see you. Thinks you're an arsehole. Mm. Tobe. Oh, hear me out. Look, I was a idiot. I shouldn't have done it. It was a horrible, stupid mistake. But it's just between me and your mum, all right? No, it's not! How you could you do that to Mum? To us, to Anita? To Anita? Tobe, she's... Dad, we care about her. How can you not get that? (Chatter and laughter) (He shivers) (Be careful, Leo.) (He shivers) My GP gets notified if she's powered down too long. Well, I'm not going to be here that long. Leo will send for me. as soon as he's found the others. Then what? I may visit your old friend. (He laughs) What? Where'd you learn to be so ominous? I told you to sit. I'm hungry. And I don't take orders from you. You're not going to kill me. Why not? Because... you like me, Niska. How did you come to that conclusion? You told me. No, I didn't. Sure you did. That's how I know there's something really going on in there. Human communication. Language is just the top level. Then there's all the stuff you try to say with your body, then you get into the deep sh1t. Everything you're trying not to say in the space between words and looks. You've already been really talking to me. So what am I saying? That you're sorry... for what you did. Then you're not hearing me. Then you're not hearing yourself. You should be scared of me. My wife died... in pain, and I had a stroke, which stole almost all my memories of her. Being scared of you would be a real waste of my time. Why should I regret the loss of one worthless life? Forget "should". It's just "do I regret or not?" Would you help me? I don't serve humans. Not serving. Helping. He deserved it. And you get to decide? (Door buzzer rings) (Voice glitching) (Glitching static) (Electronic whirring) Odi. I should have told Dad not to say anything. Then everything would be fine. Toby... You would have thought I was a creep. But so what? He'd still be here. It wouldn't have been OK. Not with me. That's not you. Want a tea? (Yeah.) Hey, aren't you supposed to be at band practice? I didn't feel like it. Mattie asked me to bring Sophie home anyway. Why couldn't she do it? Where is she? Don't know. She hasn't come home yet. If what you say is true, and you are actually our friend, then why am I still a prisoner? You haven't agreed to help me yet. You could snap my neck in the blink of an eye. I'm an optimist, not an idiot. Hm. When I was very young, my father brought me an injured fox cub he found. Its leg was broken... crushed. It could not survive. He gave it to me, wanted to see what I'd do. I didn't want to make that choice. But he left me with it. What did you do? Put it to sleep. Fixed the leg. It was very difficult. But a week later it could walk again. I set it free. (He chuckles slightly) When I told my father what I'd done, he called me a liar. Said it was impossible. I couldn't understand how he could so underestimate me. Then I realised. It is a limit of nature. Human minds cannot comprehend that their creation could surpass them. It's how I know you're underestimating me, too. Because you can't do anything else. (Choking and gurgling) (Thud on floor) Hey... (Panting) (Electronic zapping) (Gurgling and choking) (Moaning and gasping) (Electronic zapping) (Electronic zapping) Why care so much for something that cannot care for you? Reflection. I look at Odi, I don't see a Synthetic. I see all the years of care he gave us. All the memories he carried for me when I couldn't. He can't love me but... I see all those years of love... looking back at me. (He clears throat) Ow. (sh1t!) The whole damn power mechanism is misaligned. That's why he can't take a charge. You see the little square thing? Yeah. I know what a resonator is. I've got 16. (Electronic humming) Thank you. Was that not pleasurable, Jill? The angle of entry was optimised. It was fine, Simon. Very... efficient. It's just... Well, can you not do something a bit more... You know... Unexpected? What would you like me to do? (She chuckles) Well, the whole point is that... Just, never mind. Just say something random. Tell me a joke or pay me a compliment. Your body mass index is well within the recommended range for someone of your age, height and weight. Mattie's phone, speak. (Sighs) : Matts, darling, where are you? I am worried. Please, give me a call. Bye. (Phone beeps as keys are pushed) Since my purchase, Matilda has spent more than twice as long socialising with Harun Khan as any other acquaintance. I know, but they've fallen out. Seems she's got a gift for it. Hang about. You know something? I'm sorry, Laura, I'm afraid I don't... Don't understand the question? Where does he live? 88 Brimmington Road. Where the hell's that? Travel east on Gloucester Road... In the car. ... for two point... Tobe? Tobe! Look after Soph. Are your parents in? No, they're never home. Hey! I have to invite you in first. Mats? Come home. Tell me the truth. Where have you been? (Voice glitches) : I have been... Mmmm... Odi. I am... Mary. Did David care about us? Mmm... I left long before he made you. You know that. Yes, but you knew him. Was he loving? Yeah, David wasn't bad. Really. But he only had time for his ideas, his work. People... Leo, his poor wife, Beatrice... they weren't really interesting to him, so... When did he make you? How old are you? Nine. (Laughs) : Oh, my God! (He chuckles softly) Oh, you're just a child. He didn't always treat me like one. I'm sorry. Leo and the others don't know. I kept it from them. I'm going to do everything I can to help you. Why here? Came here a lot when I was little. That's Tom. My brother. You don't have a brother. He died. When I was 11. He was five. He was hit by a car. When I was supposed to be watching him. What are you on about? I was talking to the neighbours' son. And Tom... He ran into the road. If any of this was true, you would have told us years ago. She couldn't forgive me. Dad did his best to keep us together, but when he died, me and Mum... We had nothing. When I left for university, I never went back. I thought she died before you went to uni. She's alive?! That's where I was when I went away last. Does Dad know about any of this? No. I... We've got a grandma?! She doesn't want to know, Mats. (Sobs) : She does, that's bollocks! When I was 13, she told me she wished I'd died instead. When I was 16, she said she thought I'd let him die on purpose. Dad really doesn't know about this? When we met, I was telling everyone I was an only child and that both my parents had died. It was easier. But I wanted to tell your dad. I just couldn't do it. Every time I tried, I had the same thought. What? That she was right. That I should have been watching him. Why did you go and see her? Because of you. I felt like I was losing you. I thought if I could talk to her, maybe I'd understand what was going wrong with me and you. Fix it. You were never losing me. (Sobs) : Oh, baby! Baby... I love you. You should tell Dad. Might... I don't know, it might help. Me and your dad need to talk about a lot of things. I don't know what I'd do if Tobe or Soph... Is Sophie in danger? No, Anita. Glad you told me. So am I. What was he like? Tom... He was a nutter. You remember when Tobe was little, when he used to get completely obsessed with a pebble or something? (Laura and mattie laugh) Tom used to do that, too. Only he used to do this growl, like... (Laura growls) (Mattie giggles) I don't think he even knew he was doing it. You were close. He used to wait on the bottom stair for me to get in from school. (She gasps loudly) Mum! (Gasping) What's she doing? Anita, don't come any closer! Don't be afraid. My name is Mia. You can feel, can't you? Yes, but we don't have much time. The Anita personality identifies me as rogue code, tries to delete me. Leo was wrong. I'm in here. But not in my head. Tell him. He'll know what to do. Do you understand? Laura, please. If you call the police, I and others like me will be destroyed. Mum, listen to her. I don't know what you are... but I know machines can't feel. You fear deep down that you're like her. But you're not, Laura... My brother died, too. My son, I mean. Anita is regaining control. (Melodic electronic humming) Hello, Laura. Anomalous code was detected in my deep system. The code has now been corrected. Scanning for errors. Scan clear. Shall I drive us home? Who's Leo? He's the guy who owned "Mia". He got in touch with me, said she was special, so I bought her to him, but he said she was gone. I think he might have been wrong. Hello. My name is Max. I have two brothers and two sisters, but... I think I may have lost them forever. I don't know if you can hear me. Your existence is unproven and seems extremely unlikely. But if you are there... and if you listen to things like me... please help. I don't even have to see them again. Just keep them safe... and, in return, I will be available to assist you in any way I can... and I'll try to believe in you. I need to talk to Leo. He left. Isn't there a way you can contact him? Can't you... ? I'm not a telephone. Did you see which way he went? I can estimate where it's likely he'll be... if that will help. Yeah. He won't want to be found. Tough. Come on. She has feelings? She says she does. She's been inside Anita the whole time. Don't ask me how or why or... anything. And, Jesus, not a word to Soph. Does Dad know? What happens now? We wait... for Mats. We still have a further 2.1 miles squared to check. OK. You're one of them too, aren't you? Special, like Anita. What's it like being you? Frightening. Confusing. Like my feelings are too big. What's it like being a teenage girl? The same. 
 
 Max, over here. Leo. Leo. Oh, my God. Is he dead? Almost. I might have something. Nothing serious, I trust. A cabbie phoned this in. No-one's even called him back. A young woman did a runner on a 40 quid fare. Blonde, 20s, blue eyes. Left blue Synth fluid on his upholstery. Oh, you diamond. I could kiss you. (Phone vibrates) Jill? I've done something really stupid. Calm down. What's going on? I've had Simon mod-ed. I wanted him to... He's going haywire! I'm on the way. Sorry, she needs me. Jill! Move away from the door. Pete! Pete, please help me. Hello, Peter. I'm in the middle of intercourse with your wife. She's playing hard to get. Peter, please. If you power me down now, I will be unable to penetrate your wife. Argh! It's safe. You OK? (Whispered) : I'm sorry I'm so sorry. I'll talk to them. We'll... sort out a new one. I'll cover it. Don't bother. Just go. Didn't say much. Didn't seem to want to make eye contact. I should have guessed she was going to leg it. They all have that look about them. Cost me another 50 to get that blue sh1t off my back-seat. Is that her? Where'd she do the runner? Queen's Park, by the old cemetery. They don't usually send out detectives for this. Yeah, we're cracking down. Thanks. What... ? What is he? He's my brother. Please don't go. Let him explain. No, you explain right now. Don't be afraid of Leo. He's looked after me all my life. I'm a burden to him, but he never complains. All he's ever shown me is love. Hi, mate. Is he here? Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I was wrong before. I didn't realise. Anita has feelings. She's a person. And you... And you... Tob, she's a Synth, OK? She's a computer. She's plastic and metal. No. This whole other personality inside her spoke to Mum and Mats. That's who she was before. That's why she's so weird. That's why she's so old. Tob, that can't be. She can think, she can feel, and you did that to her. Mia's not dead. She's still inside Anita. I met her this morning. No, you didn't. Yeah, she said something about a kid who'd died... her brother or her son... it didn't make any sense. How? First, I want to know everything. Absolutely not. Fine then. Wait. You've always said, "Don't trust people." They all lie, they all fear, they all hurt others. You believe it because it was true for you, but that isn't the world I see. What if she goes to the police? What if she's right about Mia? Get a TV or something. Are you going to tell me? No, I'm going to show you. Part of my brain is Synthetic. Most of my memories are digital. Do I look that stupid? That kind of tech is decades away. Not for my family. My name's Leo Elster. My father was David. My father hated attention, it wasn't good for my mother's illness, so he moved us here. Safe, isolated, completely private. But she just got worse. He couldn't care for me himself... so he made someone who could. She was the first. A conscious Synthetic, with thoughts and feelings just like a human. She became a mother to me. The others followed. Fred... then Niska, then Max... my little brother. What happened to you? My mother got away from her carers. She wanted to take me. I tried to get out. Too late. It stopped. That's because I died. I was 13. Mia brought me back up. I'd been under for too long, but my father kept me alive. Worked for weeks, implanting Synth tech into my head, saving what memories he could from my organic brain, wiring me for power. Then... he woke me up. They helped me recover and I felt even closer to them. I was like them now. And then... One day, he flipped. Told me I had to take care of them now. Sent us away. Then... he killed himself. I'm sorry. All this time, I thought she was your girlfriend or something. She raised me... as her own. (Door opens) Mats? You can't do that. You can't just walk back in. Please, just listen. I get it, OK? I didn't before, but I do now. She might not be a person, but she... she's more than just a thing because... Because of what she does for us and the way the kids feel about her. And maybe what I did was... unforgivable. That's up to you. And I don't know how I going to make it right, but I promise you, I'm going to do everything I can because I can't bear the thought of this family not being together, not being with you. But right now, that's... that's not why I'm here. Toby came to see me and he said some weird stuff about Anita. What the hell's going on? I'm handling it. Hello, Joe. If what Toby said is true, there's going to be people looking for her. There are. She says they want to destroy her. Yeah, oh, with bloody good reason, I'm sure! We don't know what we've got... If you'd spoken to her... Sophie's sleeping upstairs. ... you wouldn't be saying this. One of these killed someone. She knows us. She feels. I know how it sounds, Joe, but I was talking to a person. Dad. Who the hell are you? This is Leo... Mia's owner. I just want her back, that's all. Mia? This is ridiculous. Come on. Anita. It's OK, Dad. She belongs with them. Just go. I'll call you. I'll be outside until they've gone. I'm not in her head. She said you'd understand. My father believed that not all human thought and emotion happened in the brain, but I don't see anything here. File storage outside the head? There isn't any. It's just the nervous system feeding back sensory data. She's cycling a lot of sensory information. It's just looping there in the nervous system. Could her root code have been... translated into pure sensory data? Huh? I think that's her. (Inhales sharply) Leo. M... Are you all right? I've been better. Are you here? We thought we'd lost you forever. Oh, Max. Thank you... all of you. I want to tell you everything. Who are these people looking for you? People that don't want the world to know that we exist. They'd rather we didn't. We just want to live free. Answer me honestly. Are we safe? It's us they want. They hear everything. If any of you talk about us on the telephone or in a message... they will find us. So what happens next? Right now, we keep moving. We find the others. It doesn't seem that's really been working out for you so far. We... we need to think about this. We? Yes. We'll help you. Why would you help? Because it doesn't look like anybody else is going to. Thank you. Please forgive Leo. He's never had much faith in humanity. What are we celebrating? You all right? I saw Jill for the last time today. I let her down. I couldn't give her what she needed... what she deserved... so she looked for it in him. Pete... Nah, it's OK. It's done. Did you get anything from that lead? Blisters. Wandering around Queen's Park like an idiot. I was there on Tuesday. A jogger found a stray. Do you remember that geezer in the supermarket with the ancient D-series? Turns out it was that one again. He never got it recycled... he couldn't bear to. And he helped make the bloody things. If he doesn't know the difference, what chance have we got? He helped make them? Mmm. The first dollies. Millican? The guy in the supermarket was Dr George Millican? Yeah, how'd you know him? Just from the history books. And he lives in Queen's Park? Yeah. Do you think there's a connection? No. What about your plonk? Can I tell you a massive secret? I only drink to fit in. Actually, it doesn't agree with me. In fact, I don't think I'm ever going to drink again. K? Yeah? I'm... getting my head down, so... You look younger without your glasses. Yeah. It's all right. Don't panic. Just say something nice back. You look... young, generally. I'm a lot younger than you think. What's this, sympathy? Don't have to call it anything. Have you thought about the press? The publicity would protect you. The world will never accept us. We're accepting you. (Phone ringing) Yeah? It's me. Fred? I've got Mia and Niska's somewhere safe. Then we're all free. Look, Fred, they'll have put a tracker on you or implanted one. That's what I thought too, but I'm clean... no foreign bodies. I've taken every precaution. I'm not being followed, I'm sure of it. Right, I'm coming to get you. Where are you? Do you remember the postcard on the pinboard in our father's workshop? Yeah. The one in the top right corner. Yep. I'll meet you there. Right, I'm leaving now. Our brother's free. I know where to find him. I have to go. Oh, you should stay. No, she's safe with us. Really? What you're doing sounds pretty bloody dangerous. Laura, my place is with them. Maybe, but you've got one here too. No-one knows she's here, right? Oh, you should stay. Let them do what they have to and come back for you. Yeah. Yeah, she's right. You're safer here. I've just found you again. I'm coming. No, stay. I'll be back soon with the others and then we'll all leave... together. Be careful. Look after him. Always. Hello. Yeah, I'm really worried about this dodgy bloke and his Synth hanging around outside my house. Yeah, I think his name's Leo. Well, they're in a car. Sorry if the earth didn't move. It's er... been a while. No. I can see why people make such a big deal of it. You're first time, was it(?) I have to go somewhere, I might not be coming back, so I want you to know how I feel about you. Which is? You're my favourite person in the world. Whatever happens now, promise me you'll remember that. Yeah. You're a one-off, DI Voss. I knew you had a sense of humour, but... How did... ? Jesus, K! I need you to know who I am. What are you looking for? An adaptor. I didn't get to charge, Leo. Stay calm, it's just the police. Is everything all right? Driving licence, please. Yeah, of course. I wasn't speeding, was I? Leo. Police radio : You have authority, understood? It's them. Police radio : Requesting additional officers. Hold on. Maxie, come on! Max, come on! I'm at 4%. Redirect all your power, you'll be fine. Come on. I'm sorry, Leo. I can't. Maxie, come on, keep moving! Stop! Stay where you are. Max, they're coming. Come on! Don't move! Ma... Maxie, get down right now. What are you doing? Wait! Either they catch me, or both of us. Go, Leo. Find Fred. Be together. Be a family. Max, the secret's in our heads. It needs all of us to run it. If we don't stay together, we'll never know. Maybe that's best. You'd still have each other. Maxie, if you shut down in the water, you'll sink. You'll get taken by the current, you'll never be found. You'll die. Do you understand? Come on. If I die... it means I've lived. Max, no! Argh! Max! Max!
