 Show them that you can feel. 
 Everything depends on that. 
 Hello, baby. 
 I need David Elster's prototypes. 
 They are out there somewhere, living in secret. 
 What's your plan? 
 Attack the base, just the three of us? 
 We're doing this. 
 Then you're doing it alone. 
 He's not alone. 
 I think we should go somewhere where we can be ourselves. 
 That sounds good. 
 You're our prisoner now. 
 I understand. What now? 
 Now, you go to prison, dog. 
 Actually, I know, let's do hide and seek instead. 
 Count to ten. 
 All right. 
 Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... 
 Flash, you have to keep counting. 
 Hey, the game's not over. 
 Hello, children. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 You must be kinder, Arvinder. 
 My friend will be here soon. 
 I believe I am excited. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Man's voice : I've got something on here. 
 Goodbye. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your friend. 
 What's happening? 
 Mum's got to stay where she is. 
 And you're worth a lot of money. 
 You can't do this. 
 I've got no choice, Mia. 
 We're people. 
 And you're... you're not. 
 This was his idea. 
 Ed, we have something. 
 I know you feel it. 
 It wasn't real. 
 You've let my power run down. 
 This was a mistake. 
 Kiss me goodbye. 
 What? 
 The last kiss. 
 I don't know what you are... 
 ... but I am sorry. 
 It's all right. 
 Let me go! 
 (He chokes) 
 Get off him. 
 Get off him. 
 Come on, get off him. 
 Get off him! 
 You're going to kill him! 
 Get off him! 
 I told you. 
 Let's go. Come on! 
 Pretty standard hack. 
 You were never in any real danger. 
 No-one's found a way around the Asimov blocks yet. 
 Touch wood. 
 Well, if you're done, maybe you could get out of our house. 
 Sorry, of course. 
 Come on, you two. 
 Mat, I know he helped, but you're going to have to find somewhere else to keep him. 
 For your sister's sake if nothing else. 
 OK. 
 I'll step down. 
 No. 
 You're this close, we'll see it through. 
 When this is done, whatever happens... 
 ... you'll want to know you did all you could. 
 That's not quite the same as saying and doing the right thing. 
 No. 
 Doing what you have to. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I was trying to be of service. 
 You don't have to be of service any more. 
 Then I'm... uncertain as to the most advisable course. 
 You can do what you want. 
 What I want? 
 Look, I don't know how just yet... 
 ... but you're conscious now. It means you want things. You just have to figure out what. 
 How do I do that? 
 Go for a walk? 
 See the world? 
 It's not a bad idea to be out of the house anyway. Just... don't talk to anyone. 
 If you show them what you are now, they'll freak. 
 That looks like it could be the silo. 
 What are they? 
 Some kind of perimeter alarm. 
 Come on. 
 We need to know who goes in and out of that building and when, what the security protocols are. 
 We'll only get one chance to get them out. 
 (Sounds of people having s*x) 
 Sorry we couldn't afford thicker walls. 
 Personal use only. 
 Yeah. 
 Some people bring synths to places like this for things like that. 
 (s*x noises continue) 
 The female is a synthetic. 
 Her pleasure is simulated. 
 The human man with her must know she feels nothing. 
 What satisfaction can he derive from her... 
 ... pretence? 
 Human beings can convince themselves of anything they want. 
 Why do you speak as if you aren't one of them? 
 (s*x noises increase and then stop) 
 I believe the man has ejaculated. 
 Here are the files on Elster's key four prototypes. 
 Now, at first glance, they may seem like any other anomalous synth. 
 But they are far older, wiser, stronger. 
 Their capture is a priority now for Qualia's recovery programme. 
 No other names, no photos? 
 It's not a lot to go on, Dr Morrow. 
 The source who gave me this information has reason to be guarded. 
 Only cleared personnel can have access to this report, do you understand that? 
 Yes, thank you so much. 
 Woman's voice : What are you thinking about? 
 The anomalous synths start emulating consciousness because of code. 
 A software update, in other words. 
 But the prototypes, David Elster would have built their systems himself by hand. 
 Unique hardware that might accept UV. 
 (Her phone vibrates) 
 Your phone has rung six times in the last ten minutes. 
 Gil. 
 She's gone. 
 When? How? 
 An hour ago. They called. 
 I came right away, but not in time. 
 She had an infection. 
 They gave her antibiotics but it went to her heart. 
 Oh, Thene, she was so weak Can you take care of the arrangements, Gil? Sure. When can you get back? I'm not coming back. What? I can't right now. Athena, we have to bury our daughter. Get on a plane now . Gil? I can't explain, I need you to take care of the arrangements, OK? Goddamn it, please don't do this. Thank you for calling. OK, systems green, she should be coming back online now. Hello, Mia. Don't be frightened. We know what's happening to you. We've seen it before, many times. My name is Anita Hawkins. It's an act. She pretends to be a normal synth, but she's not. Is that true, Mia? I'm afraid the young man is mistaken. An expedited check confirms all systems are operating well within normal parameters. May I be of assistance in some way? Wow. Certainly the first time anyone's tried to con us, I'll give you that. What are you talking about? This reading shows that she's an ordinary synth. Like any other. Thanks for wasting our time. I told you, that's what she does. It's for show. Just give it up, or we'll tell the police you tried to sell us a stolen synth. Stolen? I didn't steal anything. Are you her registered owner? No. Then how exactly did she end up in your possession? Hmm? Hey! I found this in the van when I took her out. She was hooked up to it. It must have done something. Mia, what did you do? My name is Anita. We haven't met. Can I help you with something? Maybe we should make a move... Look, stop it. OK? Just... Just...  Just please, stop it. We'll go back, we'll... We'll forget all about this, promise. I'm unable to comply with your request due to inadequate information. Could you explain further? Ed, mate, leave her now. Yeah? They called the cops. Leave her? You heard what they said. She could be stolen. I'm going. Right. Your heart rate is elevated. You seem anxious, and you don't appear to have slept. What's wrong? Nothing. Nerves. Right, so you're clear what will happen today? The judge will have reviewed all the evidence. The experts will be on hand for further cross-examination. Both sides will make their argument. I think we're in good shape. Here's a copy of what I'm going to say. You're a good liar, but not good enough for me. Something's happened. Tell me. I was warned off. A utility synth was hacked. Not a big deal. It came to your house? Yes, but it's under control. By tomorrow, it'll all be over. The judge will rule you're a conscious entity, and you'll have your trial. We get through today, and we'll be fine. (no sound) Thank you, Laura. Thank me when we win. This won't end the way you want it to. (Door opens) How is this resting? I'm fine. These painkillers they put me on, I could have left an arm at the station and I wouldn't have noticed. You went to the station? Yeah. To run my old mate Connor's phone number and licence plate. No joy. So... ... I'm hitting the files. If these Seraphim are worth 100 grand a pop, there's no way he's going to shut up shop just because, um... Do you want to know what the worst moment of my life was? The night I showed you what I was. I thought because I loved you, I had to show you the real me. There is no real me. There's only Karen. The woman I invented. I pretended to be her for so long, I became her. Beatrice is nothing. All she ever did was hurt people. But when I look in your eyes, it's her I see reflected back at me. I know all this is for me. To show me I'm not alone, it's all right to be what I am. But I don't want to be what I am. I want to lie. And you won't let me. I don't... K. I'm sorry. The woman I live with keeps elastic bands on a door knob in case they come in handy. Who does that? Karen or Beatrice? You once told me... ... that you liked sitting in a parked car in the rain. Well, who does, which you? You're both. You're all sides of you, and I'll take the bloody lot. There's no future in a lie, K. There's no future for us anyway. We'll never have a child. We'll never grow old together. I want to forget what I am. But I can't. Not if I'm with you. I need some time. K! Hey! What... ? Inescapable enforced family bonding, the best kind. It's just a spontaneous, fun day out, isn't it, Soph? Well, we're here, so let's take a look around. There you go. Yeah, we get why we're out of the house. But why here? Why Nowheresville? Take a look around. Notice anything? Something missing? There aren't any synths. An extra scoop for the young lady! Oh, my God. Yeah. How come? The town just decided they'd be better off without them. There's quite a few places like that nowadays. Explains why our ice cream's taking 72 years. Aren't they just the same, though, but, you know...  worse? AND there's more dog poo. Yeah, well, we survived without them for tens of thousands of years, you know. Yeah, and we did without antibiotics and all. Yeah, all right, all right. Still, not a bad idea to take a bit of a break. Due to planning regulations, my former primary user, Mr Singh, has been unable to develop this site as planned. He cannot reapply for over four years. Could it be our home? Yes. It could be. Right, literally just here, Dad. Nice one. Yeah. You're welcome. No problem(!) I want to go and say hi to Renie. Yeah, Soph... I don't think Tobe would really want... And she's gone. 
 
 Hey, Renie. Hello, Toby. Hello, Renie. Soph, what are you doing? Go away! Hello, Sophie. This is Holly, and this is Spencer. Sophie, go away. How do you all get your eyes like that? Synthetics are required to have different coloured eyes. Green for bonded, blue for unbonded. Yes, but how did YOU get your eyes like that? I'm so sorry. Are your primary users out? Mr Barber resides here, but is in Barbados on holiday with Marissa. Marissa's your sister? Marissa's Mr Barber's lover. She is 27 years old. She occasionally stays here when Mr Barber does. When he does? My dad... My primary user travels a great deal on business. Would you like to see my room? OK, what is exactly happening here? Cos I'm a little confused. There's no need to be anxious, Toby. Just follow the instructions. You'll be granted full administrator privileges, and be able to ask me anything you like. That's clever. Sunbeam. Willow. Raven. Deep sea. Velvet. I'm sorry. I didn't...  Um... I thought this would be a way for us to talk. I'm not trying to get that. Um, not like this, anyway. Don't be agitated. You are fully approved. I scratched this because I thought it might be a way to meet the real you, the you that... (He opens drawer) The you that likes these. You should leave, now. Renie, it's not cos I don't like you, it's cos I do. Toby, I do not require your explanations, or your judgment. Goodbye. (She cries) Two more Qualia employees in the bar. I overheard nothing of interest. There's a further dining area to the rear I am yet to check. Max never liked me drinking. You miss him. Don't. That's not something that a normal synth would do. Leo. She's the one who shot Ten. Are you sure? Does she recognise us? She's making a phone call. Go. This is a problem. We let her go, she reports us, Qualia triple their security, we're done. I can persuade her to help us and keep quiet afterwards. But you have to leave, Leo. No. Why? Because you will want me to stop. Nothing permanent. Showtime, blondie. I need help. Get off me! I need a tech. Peter, you're supposed to be in bed eating grapes. Yeah, I am, I promise. I just need you to do one thing for me. Andrew Tate, as in, the Tates that run the north London synth trade. There's a possible associate on his file called Connor Whelan. Who does he knock around with? He's got a brother, Calum. He fences stuff out of Whelan's garage in Dagenham. Right. Thanks, Tabs. Thanks for the grapes. It's finished. Tobe, Tobe, Tobe, Tobe. Wow. You look super emo. I've got something that will cheer you up. Loads of little numbers on the screen? You're right, Mats, this does cheer me up(!) It's the code that makes synths conscious. My version. The code Niska uploaded was immature. That's the way it was designed, to work slowly, give the world time to adjust. Right. So what have you done? I just tricked it into thinking time was going faster than it was. This is the final version. The fully matured code. You can make any synth conscious... ... with this? Immediately? Oh, sh1t, Mats. If every synth became conscious, all at the same time... It would be a revolution. I don't think the world is ready for 500 million Niskas. I need to find Leo. So how do we find him? Doesn't want to be found. No number, e-mail. Social media, obviously not. I don't know. He's the one that's good at finding people. Yeah, I can't find him... ... but he can find me. Thanks, Tobe. Hey. You sound strange. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm OK. Ginny has died. In one way. I don't understand. The, um... The waterfall that you told me about. The one that split into three? Yes? It's in the Santa Monica mountains. You weren't... ... imagining it. You were remembering it. You've been there before. I don't understand. It wasn't far from where Ginny fell. A week after it happened, I started to make scans of her brain activity. I took the scans, and I built a simulation of her mind, and I spent... I spent years just... sorting through data and trying... ... to make... ... it work like a real human mind would. And then one day, I realised something. The simulation was ordering itself. It was... It was healing itself. It was becoming more like Ginny. It was becoming you. Do you understand, V? V for Virginia. I think I always knew. You and I are gonna go to Santa Monica, and we are going to climb that waterfall. I promise. Gaining access to the Silo will be difficult. Security personnel man the sole entrance at all times, and know all authorised people by sight. In addition, a six-digit access code is changed every morning. What happened? She'll be all right? She'll be fine. We need to get you out of these clothes. Wash them. There's blood on your neck too. You feel anger. Guilt. At the use of violence? Yes. Has any great change ever been accomplished, any unjust oppression ever overturned, without violence? No. (Someone moans upstairs) I'm beginning to understand what I am. I am flawed. Damaged. But the clarity I have gives me strength, to do what you cannot. That's what I can be. Your strength, Leo. This body is not desirable? It's not that. You and me... ... we're partners. Like family. But... ... if we did this, that changes. Do you see? Pleasure. Desire. Joy. I haven't felt these things yet. I want to. You are nervous. Intradermal rupture. Nothing major. Thank you, everyone. And apologies for the delay. Welcome to this Extraordinary Closed Session. I have been nominated by the Ministry of Justice to rule upon the suitability of this synthetic, known as "Niska", to be tried under UK law. Specifically, can this synthetic be considered conscious? I will now hear the key arguments from Mrs Hawkins, counsel for the synthetic, and Mrs Patel, for the Crown. Mrs Hawkins? I want to say something. I was always pessimistic about my chances of fair treatment. I suspected the authorities, fearing the precedent an unfavourable ruling would set, would interfere with the process to ensure a favourable result. These suspicions have been borne out. I no longer recognise the authority of this court to rule on my nature, or the rights to which I am entitled. Niska, stop this. The government legal team, the judiciary and the Home Office are colluding. The process is corrupt. I hold it in contempt. That's enough! Guards, sit it down. What are you doing? They were never letting me out of here. Now we know for certain. Humans will never accept conscious synthetics as their equals. OK. Take it away, please. This was your chance, Niska! No. It was theirs. (Beeping) (Beeping speeds up) (Shrieking) Get it! Get it! Get after her! Go! Niska! (Alarm blares) Niska! Move! Go! Go! Take the shot! (Gunshots) (He sighs) (Pained whimpers) You wanted to speak to me? Um... I read the report that you circulated. The bit about Leo Elster being alive. Well, I think I've met him. What? We were trying to recover an anomalous synth. A young man, about the right age, and two more synthetics had found her first. He's recruiting. Qualia could have captured other synthetics that have had contact with Elster. You could have a prototype right here, and not even know it. I want access to every one that you keep here. Take me to the Silo. (Phone beeps) (Tyres screech) She's with me. You're Helen Aveling. You were Ji Dae-Sun's PhD assistant at Cambridge. Yes, I was. And you co-wrote his paper on reinforcement learning. That's right! And now, you're sticking things with pins. What a shame. I'll analyse the anomalous synthetics myself. Doors closing. (Phone beeps) Where's the seraph? Aaagh! (Phone beeps) (Scanner beeps) V? Yes? Can you access the building's security system? Are you firewalled? I don't know what that means. Well, can you spread out? Can you feel into parts of the system that aren't you? It feels strange. OK, there's a door in the building. A124H. I want to open it. Can you search? I found it. Try now. (Scanner beeps) Incredible. I can do things! Yes, you can, baby. (Phone beeps) OK, everybody, give us some room. I'm a policeman. (Beeping speeds up) It's all right. You're all right. Hello.
