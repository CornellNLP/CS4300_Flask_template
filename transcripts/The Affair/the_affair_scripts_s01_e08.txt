 Previously on The Affair... 
 You guys are clearly having some serious issues. 
 No marriage is perfect. 
 I could tell your wife. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 How about ten grand to make sure Helen never finds out? 
 Can't help you out unless you tell me what it's for. 
 It's money. 
 Okay, how much? 
 Do you think he's anemic? 
 No, the blood work was normal. 
 It seems like it was just a panic attack. 
 Helen, I can't keep it from you. 
 I had a fling this summer. 
 It is a destructive thing for a waitress! 
 You just see me as potential unfulfilled. 
 It was stuck to the bottom of the pie box. 
 Can I see it? 
 They're screwing around. 
 Cherry, please? 
 After everything he's done for you. 
 You ever ask her how she found out, huh? 
 Who told her to call the cops? 
 Let's go. 
 She saw you call the cops. 
 Cole, come on. 
 No, she wasn't even there. 
 You know who was there? The guy she's f*cking. 
 [Grunts] 
 Do I know him? 
 No. 
 It's your problem. You deal with it. 
 Well, grandma's not doing well at all. 
 I could feel it. 
 Do you know a place called "The End"? 
 No, what is it? 
 So you've never been? 
 Never. 
 Let's make a baby. 
 I want to start this part over again.

 [School bell ringing] 
 So what are the names of the two families  in Romeo and Juliet? 
 Anybody? Anyone? 
 The Montagues and Capulets? 
 Montague and Capulet. Okay, great. 
 Why do they have to die? 
 Uh, it's in the script, Mr. Solloway. 
 I know it is, Cherise, but until the morning  after their wedding, Romeo and Juliet is a comedy  in the classic sense of the form. 
 So why do you think Shakespeare chose to change it up? 
 'Cause he's soft. [Laughter] 
 Okay. Anybody else? 
 Keisha? 
 Maybe they're just too happy. 
 Okay, I'm interested. Tell me more. 
 Well, like, the sh1t's not their fault, he was all like, "meet me 'hereth,'" and she's like, "I'll be 'thereth,'" and then, like, her grandma... 
 Yeah, the nurse. 
 Yeah, and that freaky dude... 
 The friar. 
 They the ones who f*ck it up. 
 [Laughter] 
 Right. Absolutely right. 
 Why do they f*ck it up? 
 [Laughter] 
 Wow. 
 'Cause they're old. 
 They're old. 
 Right, they're old, like me, they're adults, and adults are imperfect. 
 Romeo and Juliet are children. They're innocents. 
 They never hurt anybody, they never betrayed anybody, so because they're innocents, their love is pure. 
 But when the adults interfere, even though they're trying to help, which both the nurse and the friar are, they end up corrupting this perfect love. 
 So what Shakespeare's trying to say is that pure love cannot sustain in an imperfect world. 
 Okay, Act III, Scene 4. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry. 
 That's okay. They seated me. 
 Mr. Solloway. 
 Hey, Jed, how are you? 
 Good, teach. Nice to see you again. 
 Good to see you. 
 Wish he'd go to college. 
 I thought he was in a band. 
 Yeah, he is. 
 Are they any good? 
 No, they're terrible. 
 I have news. 
 Yeah? 
 Thanks. 
 About the store. 
 They want to feature us on the front page of the Sunday Style section. 
 You're kidding. 
 Nope. 
 Baby, that's huge. 
 I know. 
 How did that happen? 
 I don't know. 
 I... Word of mouth, we had a few celebrities in recently. 
 We should celebrate. 
 I know. 
 I just wish I'd brought a gift or something. 
 Oh, wait a second. 
 What's that? 
 It's for you. Open it. 
 Did you know? 
 No, of course not. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Wow, what's that for? 
 I don't know. Sticking it out? 
 I don't think we can't afford this. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 No, I know we can't afford it. 
 Helen. 
 We haven't paid off the Amex bill this month. 
 Will you put it on? 
 I think you should return it. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You serious? 
 Really, yeah. 
 I don't need anymore jewelry. I have plenty. 
 Please. 
 Nope. 
 What are you in the mood for? 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 You busy? 
 Just doing homework. 
 That was my favorite book when I was your age. 
 I know. You've told me many times. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So mom showed me your report card. 
 Fantastic. 
 You want to tell me what happened this semester? 
 It got harder. 
 Come on, you got a... you got a B-minus in algebra. 
 You used to do algebra for fun two years ago. 
 I can't hear in class. 
 It's too crowded. Everyone's talking at once. 
 So... move nearer the front of the class. 
 I can't do that. All the girls sit up there. 
 [Sighs] Okay, well... why don't you go find Mr. Reiner after school, and ask him for some extra help? 
 Okay, sure. 
 Will you do that? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Because I'll get the sh1t kicked out of me, Dad. 
 If they find out that I went in for extra help... 
 Who's "they?" 
 M-Maybe I should just go to private school next semester, with Whitney. 
 Do you really want to do that? 
 I don't know. 
 I thought you wanted to go to Science and Tech. 
 Isn't that what you told me? 
 Yeah. 
 So you changing your mind now? 
 Look, I-I know it gets a little tough, okay, but... you're getting a real life education there, not some private school fish bowl bullshit. 
 Just give it one more semester, okay? 
 If you still hate it at the end of the year, then... 
 I'll go have a conversation with your grandfather. 
 Well, I won't even have to. Your mother will, she's dying to. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 [Knocking at the door] 
 What's wrong? 
 [Gagging in the bathroom] 
 You hear that? 
 [Retching] 
 What's that sound? 
 She's throwing up. 
 Why, is she ill? 
 I think she's bulimic. 
 What? 
 [Retching] 
 Come on. 
 Think about it. Look at how thin she's gotten, and she barely eats anything. 
 Well, then what's she got to throw up? 
 What should we do? 
 Let's go in there and talk to her. 
 No. 
 [Toilet flushing] 
 Did you not read any of the child psychology... 
 [Door opening] 
 What are you doing here? 
 Nothing. 
 Are you bulimic? 
 Yes, Mom. Take me back to therapy. 
 [Door slams] 
 I really f*cked that one up, didn't I? 
 It wasn't your finest hour. 
 Yeah. 
 But we do need to nip it in the bud. 
 You have no idea how dangerous eating disorders are, trust me. The longer she goes on, the harder it's gonna be for her to stop. 
 Is it my fault? 
 Did I somehow... make her think she had to be thin? 
 No. 
 Probably spending the summer with your f*cking mother. 
 Oh, don't call her that. 
 You're right, I'm sorry. 
 No, you're right, it probably was my f*cking mother. 
 I hope she's happy paying for Whitney's f*cking therapy, and I just found out she's not even coming this weekend. 
 To the benefit? 
 Mm-hmm, she's going to a spa with my aunt. 
 Well, why do we have to go? 
 Because somebody has to be there for my dad. 
 It's a big deal, because it's a lifetime achievement award, and now I'm afraid to leave Whitney, because she... 
 Don't you think you may be overreacting? 
 No, I don't think I'm overreacting, I don't! 
 And you have lost the right to say that to me. 
 You know, we used to be a team. 
 We still are. 
 No, now we're just two idiots that don't know how to handle anything. 
 I don't know what to do, because my daughter needs me. 
 And I feel like I have to talk to her about what's going on, and I think I could help her, I just need some time,  and the store needs me because the f*cking New York Times  is coming on Monday, and it... the place is a mess, I need to clean and restock, and I can't do any of that if I have to go to Montauk. 
 So don't go. 
 I can't leave my father alone. I mean, it's a big deal, what's happening there, and if my mom isn't gonna go... 
 You're not responsible for the problems in your parents' marriage, Helen. 
 I understand that, Dr. Gunderson, it's just that... somebody needs to be there if my mom's not gonna go. 
 I'll go. 
 What? 
 I'll go and support your father and represent our family. 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Why not? 
 Mm. 
 Helen, nothing is gonna happen. 
 I'm not gonna contact her. I won't see her. 
 Why should I believe you? 
 Have I spoken to her since this summer? 
 I don't know. 
 No. 
 How would I know? 
 No, not at all, never. 
 Okay, fine, but that... it's crazy for you to go back to that place without me, isn't it? 
 No, not necessarily. 
 Do you know why... [Sighs] 
 Do you know why I married you? 
 Because you loved me? 
 I thought you were safe. 
 Safe. 
 Do you remember how quiet you used to be? 
 You got paralyzed if there were more than three people in the conversation. I mean, you only spoke to me. 
 Everyone else thought you were mute. 
 And I... 
 I could have had anyone... when I was young. 
 I'm sorry if that sounds crass, but it's true. 
 [Sighs] And I chose you. 
 And I knew you were never gonna be president or famous or rich, but I didn't care about that, because I had a rich, famous father and he was such a f*cking asshole, and you adored me. 
 I knew you would never cheat. 
 You wouldn't leave, and you would be a good father, and we would have a nice life, and we would grow old and die together, and everyone would talk about how lucky we are, and what a smart choice I made. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Do you think any of this is news to me? 
 Helen, I have been going over and over this in my mind for four months now. 
 Why did I do it? What was I thinking? 
 I'm married to the perfect woman. 
 I have a perfect life. I'm... I'm f*cking tired of it. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's so hard living up to your goddamn standards all the time. 
 I don't want to be the... envy of our friends. 
 I feel like a fraud. 
 I don't own our house. I don't even clothe our kids. 
 Of course you clothe our kids. You're not unemployed. 
 You send Stacey's clothes to the dry cleaners. 
 The French ones, yeah. 
 I think I wanted to make a mistake. 
 I've never made a single f*cking mistake in my whole goddamn life. A person can't live like that. 
 Well, congratulations, you did it. 
 Yeah, and now I'm sorry. I am so f*cking sorry. 
 And it had nothing to do with her, it's not about her. 
 She could have been anyone. 
 You know, that doesn't make me feel better! 
 Please. 
 You have to forgive me. 
 I love you. 
 We've been coming here for four months. 
 I've taken all your fury. 
 I walk out of here every Friday with my f*cking underwear on my head. 
 All I want is move on. 
 Just let me go to Montauk for the weekend. 
 Let me f*cking stand next to your... jackass father. 
 Let me do this for you. 
 Please. 
 Have a lovely evening. 
 Thanks. 
 The recipient of this year's lifetime achievement award, Bruce Butler. 
 [Applause] 
 Well, it's not the Pulitzer, but I suppose it's something. 
 [Laughter] 
 Thank you. 
 [Light jazz music and chatter] 
 ♪ 
 More wine, sir? 
 Fancy meeting you here. 
 What are the chances? 
 I-I can't. 
 I know. 
 Hey, Bruce. 
 So how'd I do? 
 You did great. 
 They loved you. 
 How's that knee? 
 Oh. 
 It always bothers me more in winter. 
 Good of you to come. 
 Helen really wishes she was here. 
 She just, uh... We're having a bit of a crisis with Whitney, and she's the more effective parent, so. 
 Want to get some air? 
 Not really. It's freezing outside. 
 Ah, come on, it'll put hair on your chest. 
 So, was that her? 
 I'm sorry? 
 The one you were f*cking this summer? 
 Was that her? 
 Helen told you? 
 No, of course not. 
 Helen told her mother, Margaret told Miranda, Miranda told her sister in Ecuador, and I speak Spanish. 
 So... was that her? 
 Well, it's been invigorating talking to you, Bruce, as usual. 
 How's your book coming? 
 It's fine. 
 That's not what I hear. 
 Harry tells me you've been quiet as a church mouse since you got home. 
 I've been focused on other things. 
 Like what? 
 Saving my marriage. 
 Seems to me this girl might have been your muse, and now that she's gone, you're afraid of the page. 
 You got to harness that disappointment, son. 
 If you know how to use it, you might actually produce something worth reading this time. 
 Why do you have to be such a dick all the time, Bruce? 
 Years ago, when Helen was young, before I was famous, I was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan and I met this girl, a student of mine. 
 She wasn't the prettiest girl I'd ever seen, but there was something about her. 
 She... lit me up. 
 I felt like I'd been sleepwalking my whole life, then suddenly, I was wide awake. 
 So what happened? 
 The semester ended. I went home for the holidays. 
 We were living in Greenwich at the time, and Margaret had erected this tree. 
 And I looked up at the tree, and I thought about what my tree would be like with this girl. 
 I imagined some sad, little potted thing in her tiny apartment. 
 I thought about my little Helen coming to visit, sleeping in the closet without any of her toys, and I knew right then, I would never go through with it. 
 So that was it? You just broke it off with her? 
 Instead, I channeled it all into my next book. 
 First time I was short-listed for the Pulitzer. 
 The only time. 
 Send me something, anything. 
 Might be a while. 
 Good ones always take time. 
 Harry will drive me home. We need to talk business. 
 Besides, I can't be seen in that shitty car of yours. 
 Understood. I'll be right behind you. 
 I think I left my ticket. 
 Which hospital? Is she okay? 
 Oh. Okay, when? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 [Sighs] sh1t. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Come on, tell me. 
 My grandmother had a heart attack. 
 Oh, God. 
 I have to be there, but I-I don't have a car and I can't get ahold of a taxi. 
 I'll give you a lift. 
 No, that's okay, I'll just... I'll just keep calling. 
 It's fine. 
 Come on. 
 I need to get my coat. 
 [Brakes squealing] 
 [Car door opening] 
 Will you come in with me? 
 Won't your husband be there? 
 No, I haven't told him. 
 It's not my place. 
 Well, thanks for the lift. 
 It's great seeing you again. 
 [Car door closing] 
 
 
 
 [Grunting] 
 [Wincing] 
 Bruce? 
 Jesus! 
 You f*cking scared me, Noah. 
 Sorry. Can I give you a hand? 
 [Sighs] 
 We got this goddamn chair re-stuffed. 
 Now it sucks you in like a whirlpool. 
 [Grunts] 
 You took the long way home, didn't you? 
 You need help going up the stairs? 
 No, I've been sleeping in my office. 
 I'm fine. 
 Bruce? 
 That woman, the student in Michigan... 
 Do you ever think about her? 
 Every f*cking day. 
 [Groaning] 
 Alison. Alison? 
 Mm. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I think she's about to go. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. My... What do I do? 
 Just go to her and hold her. 
 What do I say? 
 Say you love her. 
 Say everything's gonna be all right. 
 You'll see her again. 
 No, I can't, I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 Grams. 
 Mm. 
 Grams. 
 There you are. Um... we're late. How fast can you drive? 
 Pretty fast. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to present  to you tonight, author of the best-selling novel Descent,  which will soon to be made into a major motion picture... 
 Please welcome Noah Solloway. 
 [Applause] 
 Thank you, it's an honor to be reading here tonight. 
 As I used to say as a teenager, I can't promise this will be any good, but it will be quick. 
 [Laughter] 
 "They were driving fast. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw an old boat painted blue, resting on the side of the road, dilapidated. Rotting, as if the air itself were corrosive. Tall, pale grass grew wild in its belly..." 
 [Voice fades out] 
 [Bell dings] 
 Come on. 
 You can't say "nothing." You must want something. 
 You can all do the Secret Santa thing again and just leave me out of it. 
 Scrooge Lockhart! 
 Fine. 
 I want Christmas dinner here, with all of you. 
 Is it Christmas already? 
 Oh, it's you. 
 We're celebrating. You're finally off crutches. 
 [Laughs] Wow. Thanks, Mom. 
 Dad's old records. 
 Garbage. 
 Your old records. 
 Garbage. [Laughter] 
 We should get one of those stagers to come in and make it look good to rich people. 
 And bury a St. Joseph statue in the yard. 
 Guaranteed bidding war. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, that's baking powder. You want baking soda, this one. 
 How can you tell? 
 Ali? 
 I want to hang onto that. Just stick it in my bedroom. 
 Thank you. 
 Of course, honey. 
 Hal and I are planning on traveling once the sale goes through. 
 Where? 
 Paris. 
 Well, she... you know, she wants to open a tattoo parlor. 
 No kidding, where? 
 I don't know, somewhere in the Hamptons. 
 She's gonna ink the stars. 
 [Laughter] 
 Well, I'm thinking about going in on a club in the city. 
 What a surprise. 
 Yeah, what's that supposed to mean? 
 You've been going to the city a lot these days. 
 Yeah, because this place is f*cking claustrophobic in the winter. 
 I wouldn't cut the checks just yet. 
 We haven't even put it on the market. 
 Still got a ton of work to do here. 
 We don't have to do anything, Cole. 
 We could sell the place tomorrow, as is. 
 But we're not gonna do that. 
 And why not? 
 I don't want the new owner to come in and tear it down, and if it looks like a dump... 
 Dump? 
 You've been in their houses. You see how those people live. 
 There's an appraiser coming tomorrow. 
 He'll let us know where we stand. After that, we can start interviewing real estate agents. 
 [Laughs] 
 "Interviewing agents." Jesus. 
 We need somebody who understands the property, somebody who can market it. 
 This isn't a summer home. It's a working ranch. 
 So on the market when? 
 I don't know, sometime early spring? 
 No, absolutely not. Bullshit, overruled, done. 
 Hey, Cole. Cole, look. 
 Oh, my God, I forgot. 
 The bath upstairs, I forgot to turn it off. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Oh, ma. Ma, I got it. 
 I got it, I got it. 
 Need me to go get a bucket? 
 Here. 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, boy. 
 I know. 
 [Groans] 
 You can't be serious. She's in her 50s, miles away from senile. You know, people forget things. 
 Mm-mmm. She doesn't. 
 Last week, she left a window open in the rain, and that blue rug is completely ruined. 
 Before that, she backed herself into a fencepost. 
 And what the f*ck was she even doing, running a bath before dinner? 
 I don't know. 
 I want to take her to see a doctor. 
 Why? 
 Alzheimer's, early onset. 
 [Scoffs] No. 
 There's no way. 
 [Sighs] I'm just saying, I... 
 Look, I think she's trying to slow down the sale of the ranch. 
 Why would she do that, Alison? 
 I don't know. Just a feeling I had when she said she left the tub running. 
 It was weird. 
 Well, that's exactly what I'm saying, something's wrong. 
 [Sighs] Ugh. 
 God, it's so f*cking cold in here. 
 Get in here. 
 Ooh! 
 Ugh. 
 You want me to stoke the fire? 
 No. You're like a human furnace. 
 [Laughs] 
 Were you okay? At dinner? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I was fine. 
 [Laughing] Don't look at me like that. 
 That's your "I need to have a discussion" face. 
 I have nightmares about that face. 
 What are you gonna do with your share of the money? 
 I'm gonna burn it, for fuel. 
 [Scoffs] That's a bad idea. 
 I want you to buy something you always wanted. 
 I have everything I always wanted... right here. 
 [Both giggle] 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh. 
 Thanks, babe. 
 Hmm. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hi, Athena. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 What do you mean? When? 
 Were you with her? 
 Which hospital? 
 Is she okay... Okay, calm down, I'm on my way. 
 What happened? 
 Gramma's had a heart attack. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 She's in the I.C.U. Look, I have to go. 
 I'll drive you. 
 No, it's okay. 
 My mother is there. 
 They called your mother first? 
 Yeah, I don't know why. 
 You sure you don't want me to come? 
 No, you have the appraiser coming. 
 I can reschedule it. 
 No, it's okay! 
 Oh, thank God you're here. 
 I've been peppered with questions. 
 Why did they call you? 
 Joan told them to call her daughter. 
 She meant me. And what's this? 
 Dennis, my daughter Alison. Alison, my friend Dennis. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you, Alison. 
 It's a real honor to be in the presence of such a powerful female lineage. 
 Please, let me know if I can be of any service. 
 Can you give us some privacy, please? 
 I'll be in the cafeteria. 
 Thank you, sweetie. 
 What did her E.K.G. show when she was admitted? 
 I haven't had a... 
 I'll come back in a few minutes. 
 That'd be great. Thank you. 
 [Door opening and closing] 
 What was that about? 
 You need to consent to a D.N.R. order. 
 Excuse me? She's... 
 Okay, come with me. 
 Okay, she's been in decline for a while now. 
 She's stable. 
 Yes, yes, at the moment, but you mustn't cling to the illusion of health, sweetie. 
 Her heart is an old heart, and we need to honor what is happening here, and make this part of her journey as peaceful as possible. 
 Do you know what it means if anything happens? 
 Anything? They'll let her die! 
 If she chokes on a grape, they won't save her. 
 She's not gonna choke on a grape because she eats baby food. 
 Look, I know nothing would make you happier than to be rid of her so you can sail off to some chakra sunset, guilt-free, but she's my grandm... 
 Please, stop. 
 At times like these, we need to act from our higher selves. 
 I'm getting a cup of f*cking tea. 
 I'm looking for it. 
 Well, you're the appraiser. Can't you tell? 
 No, the roof on the stable is 11 years old. 
 Yeah, I know, I know, I know, receipts. 
 What can I tell you? 
 My mother didn't keep very good records. 
 She was a little busy raising a family on her own. 
 Yeah. Yeah, no, I get it, I get it. 
 Just give me a couple days. Bye. 
 Sorry about that. It's the appraiser. 
 How's your granny? 
 She's okay. I-I think she's okay. 
 You know, she knows what's going on. 
 Well, that's a good sign, right? 
 Mm. 
 Athena wants me to consent to a D.N.R. 
 Do not resuscitate. 
 Do you think I should do it? 
 I don't know, Ali. Do you want to? 
 No. 
 Then don't do it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Appraiser's f*cking useless. 
 He told me he can't give me an estimate because he doesn't have comps, but there are no other 200-year old working ranches out in Montauk, which is kind of the point. f*cking idiot. 
 Do you need the car later? 
 Yeah, I got to run down to the hardware store with Caleb and get some tile. 
 Why? 
 I have a catering job. 
 Where? 
 Boden Hall. 
 Can you drop me? 
 Yeah, of course I can. 
 What's the event? 
 Don't know. 
 Don't care. 
 [Shivers] 
 God. I just can't get warm. 
 What's happening tonight? 
 A literary society, I think. Some sort of award. 
 For who? 
 Oh, he's famous. 
 He wrote Castle of Man. 
 Bruce Butler? 
 I think so. 
 Whole kitchen's gluten-free, I need you to make sure there's no... 
 Nadine? 
 Yes? 
 Can I go home? 
 W... No, why? 
 I-I just... 
 I'm not feeling well. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I'm really understaffed tonight, Ali. 
 Can you take an Advil and power through? 
 I'll put you on coat check. 
 That way, you don't have to move around very much. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Listen, did you get that? Gluten-free. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah, the man of the hour. 
 I suppose so. 
 Have a good night, Mr. Butler. 
 Miss? 
 Miss? 
 Sorry. 
 Have a good night. 
 Traitor. 
 It's the only thing I could find. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Good to see you. 
 You too. 
 I haven't smoked since this summer. 
 No, really, I haven't. 
 Okay. 
 So your family didn't come? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Can we not talk about my family? 
 Sure. 
 You look so beautiful. 
 You know, things have been good between Cole and me lately. 
 Really good. 
 You know, we're trying to get pregnant, actually. [Chuckles] 
 That's wonderful. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Well, I guess I should go back inside before my absence is felt. 
 Yeah. Probably a good idea. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? What? 
 Oh, okay, when? 
 Oh. Yeah, okay, um... 
 I appreciate the ride. 
 I can stay and drive you home later. 
 Take care, Noah. 
 Do you know what it looks like to see a pit crew of Western medical professionals trying to jumpstart a heart that's done? 
 Ribs were cracked! Electricity... 
 Stop, please. 
 Her lungs, done. 
 Her kidneys, done. Suddenly, everything is done. 
 It c... 
 Maybe you'd like to go into the family room? 
 No, we wouldn't. 
 Talk to the doctor, tell him he can write the D.N.R. order, and get those machines off her. 
 Why don't you do it? 
 I'm not the f*cking proxy. 
 Well, I'll sign it over to you right now. 
 Then you can do the dirty work. Go ahead. 
 Go in there and pull the plug. 
 Lucky you. Here comes the calvary. 
 [Exhales] 
 Cafeteria's closed. Vending machine. 
 I should be with her. I should be in her room. 
 Well, a few minutes here won't hurt. 
 If it's any comfort, I remember how this feels. 
 My mother died in a hospital just like this. 
 You... 
 No, maybe I need to get another doctor. 
 I-I-I could move her to the city. 
 Or I could call a doctor I... used to know. 
 What if... what if someone made a mistake? 
 You know, people die because someone... should have known better... 
 Look, maybe I'm out of line here, but... 
 I know this pain... Feels familiar. 
 But it's different. She's not a child. 
 I just... 
 I... 
 I need to know that I'm... I'm not making a mistake. 
 You're not. You're not. 
 I know every cell in your body wants to keep her alive, but... holding on to her is not gonna bring him back. 
 Letting her go is an act of compassion. 
 Feels like hell, but... it's compassion. 
 Did she have friends? 
 Yes. Lots. 
 If you want to plan a funeral, I understand. 
 You know, she'd want a service at her church, but if you want something casual after lunch... 
 Well, we're headed up to Rhinebeck in the morning. 
 You can't wait a few days? 
 The pathways out here are too muddled for me. 
 I need to be someplace I feel supported in order to even start the healing process. 
 Losing one's mother... Whew. 
 It's such an archetypal wound. 
 Yes. It is. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Have a great trip. 
 Yeah. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 [Car engine starts] 
 I'm all-in, f*ck it. 
 All-in? 
 See, that's what I was trying to... I was trying to instigate. 
 I got a made-up card. 
 Yeah. Stop throwing sh1t. 
 [Laughter] 
 Seriously. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Bringing me luck. All right, turn 'em. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sniffs] 
 As you know, we had to delay this memorial service longer than we would have liked, but today, we are here and we will not dwell on tragedy. 
 Instead, we will remember the life of our son, Scott Lockhart. 
 And if this crowd is any indication, he was greatly loved. 
 Let us pray. 
 Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. 
 Where there is hatred, let me sow love. 
 Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt... 
 Can you look something else up for me? 
 Labor Day. 
 He didn't stay with us. 
 I know, I know. Try under cancellations. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, wow, you're right. 
 There was a reservation under "Solloway." 
 It was canceled at 11:22 P.M. 
 Thank you. 
 Have a good night. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Say, I got into a little fender bender. 
 Do you know someone local who can look at my car? 
 Yeah, there's somebody out here that everybody uses. 
 Let me get his number.
