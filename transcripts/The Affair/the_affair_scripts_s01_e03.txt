 Previously on The Affair... 
 I had no idea she was married when I first met her. 
 She seemed like the loneliest girl in the world. 
 I was wondering if you... you still needed a hand. 
 I'm Noah. 
 Cole. 
 Which dress? 
 That one. 
 I think I'm gonna wear this one. 
 This is Harry, my agent. 
 So Bruce tells me that you're working on something new this summer? 
 Well, I haven't really gotten too far with it. 
 Excuse me, sir. You ordered whiskey? 
 Was she flirting with you? 
 You know, you really shouldn't smoke that here. 
 Okay. Where should we go? 
 How is any of this relevant to what happened? 
 Trying to figure out if anyone might have had a motive to kill this fellow. 
 I thought it was an accident. 
 How much longer is this gonna take? 
 I just have a few more questions. 
 I was sure I'd never see him again. 
 I remember you. 
 I was wondering when we'd run into each other again. 
 I'd like to keep talking with you. 
 Got a call about a catering job tonight if anyone wants it. 
 You're that poor little girl who lost her baby, aren't you? 
 Do you wanna get out of here? 
 There's this hypothesis in theoretical physics. 
 Your true life continues as is, unchanged. 
 But at the moment of decision, a new life splits off into a parallel universe. 
 I really doubt it was anyone at the party that ran him down. 
 So you think I'm barking up the wrong tree? 
 I'll do anything to find out what happened to him. 
 I can't believe he's gone.

 Noah, is that you? 
 Come on in for a second. 
 Sit down. Relax. 
 So. How's the writing coming? 
 It's fine. 
 It's a nice place to work, isn't it? 
 So quiet, so much peace. 
 I noticed you out there swimming. 
 And it reminded me of something I used to do when I wanted to avoid the page. 
 I didn't swim, but I'd go play tennis. 
 Four hours a day. I had a tennis partner, a little Jewish fellow named Arnold. 
 And I'd beat him roundly every set. 
 And I'd come home feeling so good about myself. 
 And too tired to write a word. 
 Finally, Margaret said to me, "Bruce, why don't you write ten pages and then go play tennis?" 
 Well, I took her up on it. 
 And the next time I saw Arnold, it was a year later. 
 He whooped my ass. 
 But I had a New York Times bestseller. 
 Well, Bruce, I'm gonna go and... gonna get some clothes on. 
 Good. 
 Noah? 
 I'm glad we talked. 
 Don't wake up. 
 Good morning. 
 What do you think of this one? 
 I like it. 
 Better than... this one? 
 What's the difference? 
 The first one's from Kenya. 
 This one's from Brazil. 
 And the Kenyan one is made by a woman's collective, and the proceeds go to their daughters' education. 
 But the Brazilian one is made from recycled cardboard pulp, which is kind of amazing. 
 Price differential? 
 Negligible. 
 Um, I have to skype this morning with Leslie, so we can do inventory. Can you take the kids? 
 Well, I'm supposed to have a breakfast meeting with Harry. 
 Oh, good, he called you. 
 Actually, I called him. 
 I told him to call you. 
 He didn't. 
 Whitney, can you watch Trevor and Stacey for a couple hours? 
 I can't, grandma got me an interview to be an au pair. 
 What? 
 I'll call you right back. 
 Yes, it's a woman on the board. 
 Her grandchildren are visiting from London, and it's just too much for her to handle. 
 So you thought Whitney could handle it? 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Well, you realize this is a real responsibility? 
 You're gonna have to go there every day and these people will be relying on you. 
 Mom, can you not talk to me like I'm some sort of delinquent? 
 Honestly, Helen? 
 I thought you wanted her to have something to do this summer so she didn't get into trouble having S-E-X. 
 They can spell, Mom. They can all spell. 
 I'll reschedule the meeting with Harry. 
 No, don't, it's important. I want you to go. 
 Dad, you're on childcare this morning. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry I'm late. There was a bit of chaos in the house this morning. 
 No, please. It's not a problem. 
 Four kids... how do you find time to do anything? 
 Never mind write. 
 Yeah, I tend to get up early. 
 How early do you get up? 
 Uh, 5:00, sometimes 4:00. 
 Write for a few hours before the kids get up. 
 Is that a little tip you learned from your father-in-law? 
 Right, yeah, I guess... I guess he does that too. 
 Hey, can I get some coffee? 
 So thanks for meeting with me. 
 Oh, oh, no, it's my pleasure. 
 I never get the chance to meet serious young writers anymore. 
 These days, it's all fantasy or memoir or cheap detective sh1t. 
 Or everyone is self publishing online and wasting their talent. 
 Every year I tell myself, you know what, I'm gonna finally... 
 I'm gonna get out of this business and then, somehow, I don't. God knows why. 
 It's not the money. 
 It might be inertia or... fear. 
 My wife just went back to get her master's and we got two kids in private schools. 
 I'm sorry, I have no idea why I'm telling you this. 
 That's okay. I-I'm interested. 
 You got an honest face. 
 Anyone ever tell you that? 
 Uh, yeah. I guess I heard it before. 
 Well, you know what? We can save my life story for another time. 
 Why don't you tell me about this book of yours? 
 Well, uh... I'm not sure there's much to tell yet. 
 It's kinda why I wanted to meet with you. 
 So you, okay, you said it was set out here? 
 Right. 
 So what is it about? 
 Well, I think it's about the death of the American Pastoral. 
 How, uh, the authenticity of a small tourist town gets co-opted and commercialized until it becomes a parody of itself. 
 And...? 
 Uh, that's all I got so far. 
 Are there any characters? 
 Sure, sure, yeah. No, um... There's a... Yeah. 
 Small town girl, city guy. They meet, fall in love. 
 But...? 
 But he's already married. 
 And...? 
 And so she... 
 Oh. 
 Well, I've read it before. 
 Right. 
 So how is it different? 
 He kills her. 
 In the end. 
 Okay. Now I'm interested. 
 How does he do it? 
 I don't know. 
 Why does he do it? 
 I don't know that either. 
 To save himself and protect the life that he's got? 
 Right. 
 So this publishing house that you're with. 
 Wind Chime Press. 
 You sign a contract? 
 No, no. Handshake deal. 
 Good. Well, I tell you what. 
 When you got some pages, I want you to show them to me first. 
 Okay, great. I'll do that. 
 Good. 
 Thanks. 
 I remember you. Four kids, right? 
 Uh, yeah, yeah, that's me. 
 Left them at home today? 
 Table for one? 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 No, actually, no, I'm just here to, um... 
 I-I gotta... buy a couple T-shirts for my kids. 
 Oh, great. Come with me. 
 Thanks. 
 So I've got a child's small, child's medium, and two adult smalls. 
 That'll be an even 100. 
 Dollars? 
 Yeah, sorry. They are not cheap. 
 So, um, there was this girl working here last time we came. 
 What's she look like? 
 She had long brown hair. 
 She... pretty. 
 Alison? 
 Yeah, she's not in right now. 
 Okay. 
 Were you looking for her? 
 No, no, no. 
 She's just, um... I just wanted to thank her for something. 
 Oh, I'll let her know you stopped by. 
 Great, thanks, man. 
 You got it. 
 Say, is there a library in town? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I heard you were looking for me. 
 Yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm doing some research for my book. 
 Oh, how about a tour of the island? 
 Uh, actually, can we talk for a second? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thanks. 
 So, uh... 
 Look, how do I... 
 I really like you. But... 
 You're married. 
 Right. 
 And you have a family. 
 I do. 
 And you love them. 
 Of course. 
 And you don't want to do anything to jeopardize that. 
 You just made that pretty easy for me. 
 I get it. Of course I do. 
 [Relieved sigh] Thank you. 
 Let's just be friends. How does that sound? 
 That sounds great. 
 Okay. 
 So if you need help with your book or you need someone to talk to, feel free to call me. 
 But I promise, I won't call you. 
 Hey, where ya headed, friend? 
 Hey, Will. 
 Hey, Alison. 
 This is my friend, Noah. He wants to buy some fish. 
 Hi. 
 Great. 
 We hit a round of porgies last night, man. 
 Does that interest you? 
 Sure. 
 Uh, well, I don't know what they are exactly. 
 But... 
 They're good. 
 And rare for these parts. Buy 'em. 
 Okay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Mr. Solloway. It's good to see you again. 
 Scotty Lockhart. 
 Hi, Scotty. 
 I see you discovered the best kept secret in Montauk. 
 Will is like the Pied Piper of Fish. 
 We keep him on something of a monthly retainer at the ranch. 
 Isn't that right, Alison? 
 That's right, Scotty. 
 Well, it was good to bump into you both. 
 Don't let my sister-in-law monopolize too much of your time, Mr. Solloway. She's a talker. 
 [Forced chuckle] 
 Oh, I invited myself over for dinner tonight after the Town Hall. So I hope that's okay. 
 Cole says he's making ribs. 
 Great. 
 See you then. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Fine. 
 You still want those fish, man? 
 Oh, uh, uh... no, thanks. 
 Maybe next time. 
 So there's a town hall tonight. 
 Yep. 
 What's on the agenda? 
 Mostly bullshit. 
 Can I come see it? 
 I mean, is it open to the public? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 No, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 Stop. Didn't we talk about this? 
 Come on. Remember what I said. 
 You didn't say it, I did. 
 Sure, whatever. 
 Point is, I... 
 Okay. 
 I get it. 
 See you around. 
 [Silverware clinks] 
 That was delicious, Miranda. 
 Thank you, I want to get the recipe before we go. 
 Trevor? 
 Yes, Grandma? 
 Those peas are dead. 
 I know. 
 Well, it's not necessary to stab them with the cutlery. 
 Why don't you try using your knife to encourage them upon the fork and then lift them all gracefully to your mouth? 
 Mom? 
 You can ignore her. 
 It's okay. Just finish your soup, honey. 
 So how'd it go today, Whit? 
 Awful. The kids are spoiled brats. 
 Really? What's that like? 
 They don't do anything I ask them to, and the mother doesn't trust me anyway. 
 She was hovering the whole time, correcting everything I did. 
 Oh, and the father's a lech. 
 A lech? 
 Yeah. 
 I caught him staring at my butt, like, five times. 
 Okay, that's it. She's not going back there. 
 Well, let's talk about it later. 
 What's to talk about? You heard what she said. 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 And? 
 And I think Whitney has a tendency to exaggerate when she wants to be persuasive. 
 Oh, great, so you're calling me a liar now? 
 Sounds to me like the fellow has taste. 
 You can't fault him for that. 
 Grandpa! 
 Yeah, Dad, stay out of this, please. 
 May I be excused? 
 No. 
 May I be excused? 
 Children, please. 
 How do you think it makes Miranda feel when you ask to leave the table in the middle of the second course after all the work she's done? 
 Miranda doesn't give a sh1t 'cause she's getting paid either way. 
 Excuse me? 
 I heard, I heard what he said. 
 He said Miranda doesn't give a... Ow! 
 Just because daddy curses doesn't mean you can. 
 Daddy's a grown-up. 
 Quite right. 
 [Chuckles] 
 When your mother and father got engaged, I was mildly alarmed. 
 Trevor, open your eyes. The obvious move is the bishop. 
 I never thought they'd actually go through with it. 
 She was thinking I'd come to my senses and marry Alex Jamison. 
 I was lighting candles day and night. 
 Like that? 
 No, not like that. 
 That's check, or I could take your queen like that. 
 Alex Jamison was gay. 
 Everybody knew it except you. 
 No, I knew it, I just didn't think it was a deal breaker. 
 Anyway, the day of the wedding, I broke out in hives. 
 That's so not true. 
 I did. 
 Dr. Laemmle had to come to the church to give me a steroid shot. 
 It's true. He did. 
 Why'd you break into hives, Grandma? 
 I was stressed, my love. 
 I thought, my darling daughter, 21 years old, knows nothing about life, about to wed her fate to this... this idealist. 
 Oh, no, that does sound like a nightmare... idealist? 
 Idealism is fine when you're young. 
 Just don't forget the need to find a man who can evolve. 
 Evolve to what? 
 To pragmatism. 
 Which looks like exactly what, Margaret? 
 Please don't take the bait. 
 No, no, no. 
 Pragmatism equals money, doesn't it? 
 That's the way the world works, Noah, like it or not. 
 I know this doesn't make a lot of sense to you, but Helen and I are trying to raise decent human beings, good citizens, not just happy idiots with nothing in their heads but how to get more, spend more, make more. 
 Is that what you really think about us, Noah? 
 As you accept our money for private school tuitions, the down payment on... 
 Oh, we're very grateful for everything you've given us. 
 You have an odd way of showing it. 
 Mom, stop trying to pick a fight with my husband. 
 We'll talk about it later, just the two of us. 
 Can't change her. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I'm gonna go out for a little bit. 
 Now? 
 Yeah, there's a town hall meeting. 
 I just want to, uh, get a little background for my book. 
 Okay. 
 See you later. 
 Bye. 
 Hey, man. What are you doing here? 
 Oh, hey. I don't know, I thought it might be interesting. 
 Missed it, I guess. 
 You didn't miss anything, really. 
 Lockharts f*cking pissed all over everything, as usual. 
 Then everyone else got drunk. Now we're all going home. 
 Oh, your girl's here, by the way. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 My girl? 
 Yeah, weren't you looking for Alison earlier? 
 No. 
 No? 
 No, no, I think you must have misunderstood. 
 I'm sure I did. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Nice to see you again, buddy. Have a good night. 
 Night. 
 You made it. 
 Are you all right? 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 Can we go somewhere and talk? Alone? 
 Is there anywhere private on this whole f*cking island? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Hey, follow me. 
 Won't your husband wonder where you are? 
 Probably not. We're pretty independent. 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 You want to talk about it? 
 I can't stop thinking about you. 
 That's sweet. 
 It's not sweet. 
 It's... it's a f*cking problem. 
 Okay. 
 I can't sleep. 
 If I do, when I wake up, I'm thinking about you. 
 I'm talking to my kids, I'm thinking about you. 
 I'm f*cking my wife, I'm thinking about you. 
 If it makes you feel any better, I think about you all the time too. 
 It doesn't make me feel any better, no. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 You could just f*ck me. 
 Get it out of your system. 
 No. 
 Just a thought. 
 Stop. Stop, stop it. 
 I said stop it. 
 Okay. 
 I thought you wanted this. 
 Listen. 
 You can't rush me. 
 [Belt clinking] 
 We have to do this at my speed, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I know I sound like an asshole. 
 But I want to be in charge, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay, good. 
 Kiss me. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Thudding on TV] 
 I am so sick of this sh1t. 
 I can't stand him, and I hate this goddamn car. 
 Who do you love? Who do you love? 
 You love a car. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 [Thudding on TV continues] 
 Good. 
 My father will come home. He'll see what I did. 
 I can't hide this. 
 He'll come home. He'll see what I did. 
 He'll have to deal with me. 
 I don't care, I really don't. 
 I'm just tired of being afraid. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How'd it go? 
 It was okay. 
 You get good stuff? 
 Yeah. 
 Mom, you're missing the best part. 
 I can't wait to see the look on the b*st*rd's face. 
 [Tires screech on TV] 
 [Laughter] 
 What'd I do? 
 [Laughter continues] 
 If I were you, I'd be talking to Oscar Hodges. 
 Interesting. Tell me why. 
 Did you know during prohibition, Montauk was a major center for moonshine production? 
 No, I didn't. 
 It's true... they sold to all of Long Island, half the city, and there was never a bust out here. 
 Too far out, I suppose. 
 Too unassuming. 
 Hmm, what are you trying to tell me, Mr. Solloway? 
 I'm just trying to give you a little context for this town, Detective. 
 There are feuds out here that have been going on for almost a century. 
 Between the Hodges and the Lockharts? 
 Do yourself a favor. Read my book. 
 Okay, I will. 
 [Clears throat] So we done here? 
 I told my wife I'd be home for dinner. 
 Eh, almost, Mr. Solloway. 
 Just stay with me a little longer. 
 Of course. 
 This is Long Island's public radio at 88.3 FM.

 [Chuckles] 
 Think I missed my calling. 
 There's still time. 
 [Distant hammering] 
 [Distant chatter] 
 You know, that's gotta be illegal. 
 What are they building over there, anyway? 
 Some kind of observatory? 
 Maybe they're amateur astrologers. 
 I don't care if it's NASA's new f*cking headquarters. 
 They're already at max height. They can't go any higher. 
 And they're blocking everybody's view of the ocean. 
 Not ours. 
 That's not the point. 
 Those people are parasites. 
 No respect for private property, no sense of community, no appreciation for natural beauty. 
 They're gonna build that f*cking thing, and they'll be here for three months max, and we'll be stuck looking at that eyesore for the rest of the year. 
 How do I look? 
 You look like you need a new dress. 
 I mean, you look incredible. 
 But this thing, I mean, seriously, how old is that? 
 I know, but I like it. [Laughs] 
 I wanna buy you some new clothes. 
 No, we can't afford it. 
 Sure, we can. 
 The summer people are back. 
 A couple weeks, we'll all be flush. 
 Please? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 My pleasure. 
 Wish me luck. 
 What? 
 Nothing, I... Nothing. 
 I got used to having you around. 
 It's been nice. 
 I can't keep working for Oscar. 
 I know. 
 I'm gonna miss you, that's it. 
 I'll be back in time for Town Hall tonight. 
 Does it need gas? 
 No. 
 Oh, I love this song.

 Can we talk a little about Cole? 
 Okay. 
 Did he know you were having an affair at this point? 
 I wasn't having an affair at this point, Detective. 
 I had kissed a stranger on the beach. 
 Hi. Oh, my God. 
 Hey. How are you? 
 Oh! 
 What a nice surprise. Good to see you. 
 Welcome back. 
 It's been a long time. 
 I was thinking I could maybe start back a couple of shifts a week. 
 Some overnights, maybe, when it's quieter. 
 I don't mind taking the shifts that nobody else wanted. 
 And you would like to return to Pediatrics? 
 Well, could I be reassigned to something like Surgical maybe? 
 Or Neuro? 
 You're not trained for Surgical, are you? 
 I could go back and take a few extra classes first. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, um... 
 I don't see an opening in Surgical or Neuro at the moment, but I know there's a spot they're looking to fill on the float pool. 
 But that would include Pediatrics. 
 Yeah, I'll take it. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm sure. 
 Hmm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay, why don't we go take a look around? 
 And I'll show you some things that have changed since you left. 
 So we're supposed to redo this area soon. 
 Thank God. 
 Cassandra? 
 These live reports just came up. 
 Let's see. 
 Did you notice that one? 
 Okay. 
 One second, hon. 
 Mama, I'm gonna be sick. 
 Oh, dear. 
 Here, come here. Come with me. 
 Yeah. This your room? 
 Okay, let's get you cleaned up and check your fluids. 
 Lie back for me. 
 There you go. 
 Does that hurt? 
 All right, I'll be right back. Yeah. 
 Why don't you meet me in the cafeteria in about 20 minutes? 
 Yeah, put it on my card. You remember how to get there? 
 Okay, sweetie. 
 Let's take a look. 
 What's he had to eat today? 
 [Beep] 
 Do you have a secret, Detective? 
 What kind of secret? 
 Something you don't want to even tell yourself. 
 How would I know if I did? 
 I think you do. 
 I think everybody does. 
 [Sighs] 
 Every single person in the world. 
 [Country music] 
 ♪ 
 Oh, nice of you to show up for work, Bailey. 
 Lay off, Oscar. I'm not in the mood. 
 Oh, really? 
 Maybe I'm not in the mood to pay you. 
 How's that? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Okay. 
 That was so good. 
 [Mutters] 
 [Register beeps] 
 That's 15 and 20. Thanks so much. 
 Some guy came around here looking for you. 
 Who? 
 I don't know who he was. 
 Waited for a while and then put a note on the board. 
 Aren't you gonna read it? 
 Later. 
 Whoa. 
 [Sighs] 
 What is it? 
 My plan. 
 For the plot next door. 
 Is that a bowling alley? 
 Yes, it is. 
 What do you think? 
 You're out of your mind. 
 They'll never approve this. 
 Well, they have to. 
 My financing just came through, and I want to break ground before winter. 
 Oscar, nobody wants a bowling alley here. 
 Untrue... many, many people whom I've already talked to would love to have somewhere to bowl because it's enjoyable. 
 "Enjoyment," which is a word I know you're not very familiar with, is the noun version of the verb "to enjoy," which means to have fun, to smile. 
 Wait, wait. Here, I'll use it in a sentence. 
 Bowling is enjoyable. s*x is enjoyable. 
 Seeing you naked would be, for me, enjoyable. 
 You realize that constitutes sexual harassment, right? 
 Yeah, so sue me. 
 My section's almost clear. 
 Can I go? 
 You just got here. 
 I know. 
 I'm just... I'm just having a tough day. 
 Okay, Bailey. Get out of here. 
 Go wash your hair or something. 
 Thank you. 
 Go. 
 You can give Jane my tips today. 
 Okay, and, uh, as long as you're in a generous mood, how about a promise you'll have my back at the Town Hall tonight? 
 [Sighs] Why would I do that? 
 Because you care about me, Bailey, because we go way back, and because, unlike your husband, you understand that people need to change in order to survive. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 That was quick. I just got your text. 
 Well, I was coming from work, so I just thought I'd stop by. 
 So what I'm thinking is maybe he's a fisherman and she's a waitress. 
 A waitress? 
 Yeah, but she's nothing like you. 
 Oh, no? 
 No, no, she's... 
 Well, she's blonde, for starters, and her breasts are much bigger. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Ah, here it is. 
 That's him. 
 Your grandfather? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Wow. 
 How old is he there? 
 I'm not sure, like, 25, 26? 
 Great fisherman, huh? 
 Well, we don't think he actually caught that fish. 
 He said he did, but my grandmother always thought that he found it on the docks and then asked someone to take his picture next to it. 
 He was like that. 
 You couldn't quite believe anything he said. 
 Sounds like you were close. 
 They raised me. 
 Your grandparents? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, he was a little like you, I guess. 
 Like me? 
 A storyteller. 
 [Seagulls calling] 
 It used to feel like Grand Central down here. 
 At the height of the industry, there was something like 8,000 licensed Baymen on the South Fork. 
 And now? 
 A couple hundred, maybe. 
 How come? 
 Well, there's nothing left. 
 These commercial fishing boats came in with huge nets, these dragger nets. 
 And they dragged them along the floor of the ocean and took everything with it. 
 The fish, yes, but also the coral, the kelp. 
 All of it. 
 It was rape. 
 If you're gonna write about a fisherman, you should probably spend as much time down here as possible. 
 You know, I could introduce you to some real guys. 
 They might take you out on a run with them. 
 That would be amazing. 
 It's hard, though, you know. 
 It's not like charter fishing. 
 You go out in the evening. 
 You're not back till the morning. 
 You sleep on the boat in shifts. 
 It's cold. It's wet. 
 The ocean is mean. 
 You don't think I could handle it? 
 I think you're a summer person. 
 [Chuckles] What's that mean? 
 Well, I think you have a fantasy of what life is out here. 
 It's a small town. It's idyllic. 
 We're simple, humble people who love the sea, right? 
 So what's it really like? 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Wait, stop. 
 You know him? 
 No. 
 [Sighs] I can't... 
 I don't know what I'm doing. We can't do this. 
 You're right, you're right. 
 I live here. 
 You can leave whenever you want to, but this is my home, and... 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. 
 But it's just, something about you drives me f*cking insane. 
 I don't think we should see each other anymore, okay? 
 I just... 
 Oh, come on. 
 Look, I need your help with the book. 
 You're my insider. 
 Okay, from now on, this is just a strictly professional relationship, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 If your hand just happens to find its way into my pants, then I will remove it promptly and admonish you for your vulgarity. 
 You don't believe me? 
 No. 
 Well, go ahead, try it. See what happens. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, good-bye, friend. 
 Thanks for the tour. 
 There's a town board meeting tonight, if you want to get a sense of the local politics. 
 What time? 
 6:30 at the firehouse. 
 I may stop by for a bit before dinner. 
 My husband will be there. 
 Got it. 
 I'll keep my distance. 
 What did I miss? 
 Well, let's see. 
 Well, the deer are eating Mrs. Ruhl's vegetable garden. 
 Sunflowers will not work, and if we don't do anything about it, she's just gonna shoot them, and we'll all have to get used to it. 
 Oh, and you missed Alec Baldwin. 
 He was here defending his right to privacy. 
 Oh, again? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And Richard Dunne drafted a gathering law. 
 Saying what? 
 You can't, basically. 
 Right. 
 And then the Shellfish Hatchery gave their annual report. 
 And Judy Burke wants the board to repair her stairs down at Point Beach. 
 Hey, all. 
 Great. 
 I think that's it. 
 Oh, wow, so, as some of you know... 
 Thanks. 
 You're welcome. 
 My blueprints have been finalized, and my financing is in place. 
 All we need are the permits, and we can break ground on it at the end of the summer. 
 I laid out my business plan, my vision, and the economic benefit to our town in packets by the door. 
 But I came here tonight to answer any additional questions you may have. 
 I really think this is a win-win for the community. 
 Thank you, Oscar. 
 As all of the relevant agencies have weighed in, we are now ready to hear public comment on this project. 
 I just want to voice my support. 
 I've been going to the Lobster Roll for my whole life. 
 It's an institution. 
 And if this is what Oscar feels he needs to do to grow his business, I support that. 
 100%. 
 [Applause] 
 Thanks, man. 
 Anyone else? 
 When are you hoping to start? 
 Uh, right after Labor Day, soon as the season's over. 
 'Cause traffic's bad enough at that intersection without trucks and heavy equipment and such. 
 Mm-hmm, we're taking that into account, Virginia. 
 Are you? 
 Is it true this new bar of yours is gonna have a bowling alley? 
 It's not a bar. It's an entertainment center. 
 If you bothered to check the packet, you'd see that. 
 Look, those of you who know me know that I derive no joy from speaking publicly. 
 I'd far rather let Scotty talk at these meetings. 
 He can sell tea to the Chinese. 
 [Scattered chuckles] 
 When I was a child, my father would take me riding right down Montauk Highway, back in the days when we used to know everybody in town, including the summer people, 'cause they used to come back year after year after year. 
 And there were surfers, families with small children, artists. 
 And they came out here looking for a quiet, tranquil community where they could escape the pressures of their city life, and that's what we gave them. 
 We lived in a kind of harmony with them, and they respected the services that we provided, and when they left at the end of August, we wished them a good year, and we meant it. 
 But nowadays, when I drive around this town in the summer, I don't even know where I am. 
 I mean, the people who come out here, they think they're in East Hampton, and that's because of places like the end and Navy Beach and this fiasco that Oscar is proposing. 
 I'm creating jobs. 
 Who the hell have you hired lately? 
 I grew up here. 
 So did I. 
 So then, I'm asking you, as a local, as a fellow native son, don't turn this place into the Jersey Shore. 
 People want to bowl, let them go to Riverhead. 
 Cole, what's hap... what's happening out here is called progress. 
 No, it's called greed. 
 It's the pursuit of the almighty dollar, and it's gonna be the downfall of all of us. 
 My family's been in Montauk for seven generations. 
 My wife was born here, and my son is buried here. 
 This is sacred ground to me, and I don't want too much from life, but I want my wife, and I want my family, and I want this land. 
 And I know I'm not the only one because this is our town, these are our schools, our churches, our beaches, our docks, our sunrise, our little piece of heaven under God. 
 And I am never leaving this place, because I am gonna be buried right there next to my boy, and I will fight like hell to my last breath to keep Montauk local. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 People. People! All right. 
 Perhaps we ought to entertain a motion for further study before a vote on whether to issue permits for this project. 
 [Gasps] 
 Ahh. 
 My hero. You were amazing. 
 Yeah, your father would be very proud. 
 Yeah. 
 Very proud, Cole. 
 Yeah, I'm sure he would. 
 Good job, bro. 
 Gave me chills. 
 Thanks, bro. 
 How about you, you proud of me too? 
 We'll talk about it later. 
 What did I do now? 
 "My son is buried in this ground"? 
 He is. 
 You can't do that. 
 You can't use his memory to make some kind of statement. 
 Is that what you... 
 Lockhart! 
 Hey, shithead. Hey! 
 You ruined me, m*therf*cker. 
 Why don't you do something for the community? 
 You know, build a day care center or a walk-in clinic. 
 Who the f*ck died and made you King of the Community, huh? 
 Hey, Oscar, I know that you're upset right now, but we just want what's best for this town. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, sweetheart. 
 Mind your own f*cking business. 
 Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Back off! 
 [Shouting fades out] 
 Sounds like Oscar had a temper on him. 
 The worst. 
 And there was no love lost between him and the Lockharts? 
 That's an understatement. 
 So why was he invited to the wedding? 
 You don't understand this town, Detective. 
 We're like family here. 
 We may fight, we may hurt each other, but when it really counts, we show up... weddings, funerals, no matter what. 
 I suppose that explains why you were there. 
 Is there anything else you need me for, Detective? 
 I really have to get going. 
 I'm almost done. 
 Just... humor me a little longer. 
 Okay, but I need to call my sitter. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 Don't wake up.
