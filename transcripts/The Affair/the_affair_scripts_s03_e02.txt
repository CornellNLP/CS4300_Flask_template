 Helen :  Previously on  The Affair... 
 Hey. Do I know you? 
 I operated on your son. 
 God. Dr. Ullah. 
 You're not going to, like, ask me out on a date or anything, are you? 
 Vik :  I was thinking about it. 
 [heavy breathing] 
 Cole :  Luisa, I promise I will be faithful to you with my body and with my heart. 
 She can't have kids. I think I always thought I was going to get to be a father again. Alison :  I had a son. He drowned. Noah :  How old was he? Alison :  Four. Oh, God. [sobbing] Dr. Henry : This wasn't your fault. There's no way you could have known. Alison :  But if I had taken him to the hospital, would he be alive now? Joan :  Is that your first? No. Scotty : Is this your daughter? Alison : This is Joanie. Scotty :  Did you tell Cole yet? Someone is going to tell him, Ali, and it's either you or me. Joanie's not your daughter.

That's really the worst. I like it. I want to revive it. That's new. Vik : Yeah, that's Rex, my new roommate. He's great. A little prickly, but... [sighs] Bye. Bye. You want me to get you an Uber? No. I can walk. Trevor : Six minutes, I'm out of here. You'd better be ready. Stacey : I'm eating. Tech rehearsal starts Wednesday and the whole cabana set's collapsing. I'm meeting Atticus early and Stacey won't move her ass. Good morning. Trevor : Are you still buttering? How's that possible? It's not humanly possible. Trevor, why don't you just go and get your stuff together? Trevor : Look at her. She's purposely trying to make me late. Go. You know I can walk myself. Well, we've discussed this, and no, you can't. Stacey : I can actually. both : Mia walks herself. And Eve. Well, Eve lives across the street. Stacey : And Beatrice. Beatrice goes alone and she's, like, 15 blocks away. Well, Beatrice also has a mom that let her watch  Shameless  in second grade and a dickhead banker dad that voted for Trump. Martin : Which dad is worse? Dickhead banker... or convicted felon? Stacey : Mom! Just go brush your teeth, okay, Stace? Your chem test is tomorrow, right? Been studying? No, I thought I'd just wing it. Yeah, I'm studying. Trevor : 20... 19... Yes, well, you know, Vik majored in chemistry. I'm sure he could help. Trevor : 17... Yeah, you said that. Trevor : 16... 15... 14. Okay then. Mozzarella? Yes. And salami. What's the problem? Good morning, Sollamanders. I'll buy a bagel. Five, four, three. Stacey : I'm coming! Wait! For f*ck's sake. [phone ringing] Hello? Oh, hey, you. How's it going? Trevor : Later, Stacey. Stacey : Wait! [door opens] Vik : Yeah, right. Here you go, sweetheart. Thanks, Mom. Hey, listen. Promise me something. What? Don't go full teenage on me. Tween I can handle. Okay, go catch up to him. Go ahead. Thanks. Oh. Hey, Stace, did you finish that card you were working on? Are you going today? Gonna try to. It's on my desk. Okay, bye, sweetie. Stacey : Bye. Wait! Wait! Dickhead! [door closes] Vik : No, no, no. It's okay, it's fine. Okay, let's check in later then. That might work. [chuckles] Uh-oh, now I'm scared. No, no, me too. See you soon.

[sighs] How many is that, 11? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [soft crashing] Do you want me to be honest? Yes, please. You're never going to sell this place unless we go ahead and stage it. Not at the number you're looking for. Astrid, stop. Don't... don't do that. People, they want orderly. Astrid : Please, Mommy. They want sleek. Everything in their life isn't. You don't think the paint job helped? I think if you shove all this stuff in storage, we can transform this place completely in two days. Make that 24 hours. I mean, look at the stats. You can see. Long Island City, Greenpoint, Williamsburg. Staged apartments sold on average 12% above asking. And when Trish is the one that's doing it, that jumps to almost 20%. I'm gonna go take some measurements in the restroom. Let me tell you something. Trish's husband left in August. He had an affair with the dog walker. She has chronic insomnia. She's also the sole caretaker of her mother, who has Alzheimer's, and her son, Jedediah, who's six. And autistic. And so...? So the woman is a master of illusion. I mean, she's hanging by a thread, but you don't see that when you look at her. When you look at her, you see calm. You see sophistication. You see... Sleek? Helen : Yes. And this place is aching for that. I love the penny tiles. So what are we thinking? Are we gonna do this? They'll be back in an hour. Trish : Poor Ma. Might have to put her in a home soon. [phone keys clacking] Nice touch with the son. Jedediah. Like I'd ever name a kid that. Stop. I feel bad now. Don't you ever feel bad? [chuckles] No. Not when it gets me the job. Look at this view. I want this view. [sighs] I tell you about that job I did for Jocelyn last week? Windsor Terrace ground floor apartment. They did an open house on Sunday. 750K. Wow. Crap. I need to triple Vik's rent. Well, you could do that. Or you could... ...get him to move in with you and find someone else to pay full freight. Mm-mmm. That is not happening. What? What? I'm just wondering where this relationship is going. Well, it's not going anywhere if I can help it. I think it's kind of perfect right where it is. He has his space, I have my space. Great s*x one flight away. No headache, no strings. I don't know why I ever got married in the first place. I should have been doing this from the very beginning. Trish : So you're happy? Yes, I am. I've never been happier. [blinker clicking] [indistinct P. A. announcement] [indistinct chatter] [door buzzes] [chatter, baby crying] Noah : You're alone again? Hi. Jesus Christ, what is that? What, this? Yes. Oh, my God. Can you even see? Noah : I can see. I slipped in the lunch line. Bullshit. Noah : No, I did. Some idiot spilled the juice. That's it. I'm getting you moved. You tried that. It didn't work. Well, it's going to now. I mean, this is just outrageous. Uh, your wrist three weeks ago and then before that your hand... Keep your voice down. Why? So fatty over there won't hear me? He's letting this happen to you if he's not doing it to you. I mean it. Shut your mouth. I don't want your help, Helen. I told you that. I've got nine months left here. I can make it nine months. Yes, but I read an article in some journal. People can actually sue prisons. I can't, but you can. And there's this guy in Delaware, I think. I don't know what he's in for. Drugs maybe, but... You found the earrings. What? Didn't we buy those in Mexico? I thought you lost them. Yeah, well, I... ...I found them. Lo and behold. Look, I'm sorry, Noah. It's just I can't stand to see you like this. Where are the kids? It's Tuesday. They're in school. Last time was Saturday. You didn't bring them then either. Well, I don't... was it a Saturday? I don't... I don't know. It's just that the kids, they have these lives all of a sudden. Trevor's in a play. Did I tell you that? They're doing  The Tempest  set in Cuba, so it's half in Spanish with samba music. Can you imagine sitting through that? You're lucky you're in here. [clears throat] I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. I'm very nervous. I don't... ...I don't know why. I'm... ...um... I'm going to see Whitney tonight. Meet the boyfriend. She really hasn't said anything about him except for, um, he's some sort of artist. And he has a loft in, uh, Greenpoint, which I don't know how he affords that, except maybe his parents... I need to see my kids, Helen. Look around you. Look... look at all these kids. Over there and over there. A lot of them come twice a week. I know that, Noah. Noah : They drive for hours. The mothers get them here. I know. It's not that difficult. They hate coming here. They saw the bruises and your wrist. It's upsetting. They told you this? They... they're refusing to come? What do you think I've been talking about? We have to f*cking do something. You can't stay here. Jesus Christ. I mean, you want them to see you like this right now? You're beaten and angry. I-I don't know how to fix it. I don't want you coming back here. What? I don't want to be moved. I don't need you to "fix" things. [♪ solemn music ♪] ♪ ♪ You don't want me to come and see you?

Like the pet, just with a "K." [chuckles] Is that Turkish or Russian or... I'm sorry, Whitney didn't really tell us much. No, none of the above. [chuckles] He made it up. Twenty-five years ago.

For example, I got my last girlfriend a job at  das  Neue Galerie, so... ♪ ♪ Can we talk alone? Fine. But maybe first you can tell me how what you're doing is any different. How what I'm doing? You know, Vik living in your basement, paying you rent, while also f*cking you. Ahem. Ha! Is that true? Yes. It's totally insane. But whatever. I'm not the one judging. First of all, Vik is my tenant. He doesn't work for me. Second of all, we are grown-ups that made a grown-up decision to protect your three siblings. Really? For my siblings? Helen : Yes. They have been through a lot. Honestly, you'd have to bring your own waterboard to f*ck them up more than my dad did. Helen : Stop. That's it. I can't sit here and listen to that. I thought... I was hoping maybe you'd grown up. I know you think you have, but I... Vik : Helen. I can't... how long have we been here? A half hour? That's how long it takes you to start attacking your father? I wasn't attacking him. Your level of hate is insane. He... he made some mistakes. Some mistakes? He's a murderer. Just because he was convicted doesn't mean he's guilty. Mom, for God sakes, the only person who doesn't think he did it is you. He treated you like sh1t. He cheated and he lied... Someone's hurting him. I saw him today. His eye's swollen shut. He has a gash on his cheek. He... Uh, I'm confused. You were up at the prison today? Whitney : Why are you still visiting him? Because he's your father. Because he'll always be your father. Because you can't just erase him from your life. No, sure she can. I haven't spoken to my father since I was 14, and look how well I turned out. Shut up. I know you think you know everything, but you don't. You don't. There are things that happened that night... That night? What happened that night that I don't know about? He was drinking. Quelle surprise. He offered to drive me home. He did? I thought you took a cab. I said no. But then I let him drive away. So? So, I should have stopped him. Don't do that. Do not roll your eyes. Somebody died because I let him drive away. How would you have stopped him? I don't know, I don't know, but I know I could have prevented it. If you want to hate someone, Whitney, hate me. Mom, what happened to Scotty was in no way your fault. I ca... I have a really bad headache. I have to go. Wait, what? Helen, I think you should stay. I can't. I ha... um, nice to meet you, Furkat. Um... ...how much for that one? Helen, can you hold this for a sec? [sighs] [sighs] Thank you. Okay, then. You two have a good night. 
 
 What are you mad about, Helen? That I bought the dumb photograph? How was your sandwich? What? Trevor's sandwich. You took it to work today. I don't... what... And then you texted me, "Loved our lunch, be in touch soon," with a smiley face. I sent that to you? Was that not meant for me? Oops. I mean, please just tell me who she is. Who did you have lunch with, Vik? She's the daughter of a friend of mine. [scoffs] Vik : She's a med student. I f*cking knew it. She's applying for a residency, and he asked if I would meet with her. We were supposed to have coffee. My schedule shifted, we had lunch instead. And...? And we're running off together. We had a quick bite at Panera and now we're eloping to Tahiti. Did I not mention that? I'm going up. I don't want to f*ck her, Helen, if that's what you're worried about. Hold it. Hold on. We need to talk about this, Helen. I don't mention one lunch and that's a problem? Some big betrayal? What about you driving two hours to see your ex without telling me? Yeah, I never should have told you. Fine, but don't come after me like I'm the one sneaking around like I'm the one who's lying. You're the one hiding things. We both are. What are we doing? This isn't a relationship. This is an arrangement. We don't even trust each other. I don't know if I'd call it... You live in a f*cking basement, and you come up when you feel like it, you stay down when you feel like it. And so do you. Yes, that's my point. We live completely separate lives. My place, your place, my bed, your bed, my kids, your... your... your cactus.

I don't know quite how to describe it, but I... ...started seeing flashes of things that could happen to her. ♪ ♪ Like things that weren't real. Yeah, that sounds bad. Yeah, it was. And one night, she'd been sick for ten days maybe. She wouldn't eat. She would barely drink. And I knew that it was my fault. I was convinced that if she stayed with me, she would die. ♪ ♪ And so I bundled her up and I... ...I took her to Cole in the middle of the night and I told him that I would be back in a few days. Oscar : Then you went to that institute? ♪ ♪ Yeah. I took all the money that I had from Lobster Roll and I asked them to help me. Did they? Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. It was kind of a miracle. They did. ♪ ♪ Oscar : So now, what happened with Cole? ♪ ♪ Ugh. I gave him custody of her. Why? I don't know. It was so stupid, but I was in such a bad way, Oscar. You know, I was afraid that I was... it wasn't gonna end. I was afraid that I would be in that place forever, and I just... I... ...I was worried about what would happen to Joanie if that was the case, and so I... God, it was only supposed to be temporary. Just until I got out. I never thought in a million years that he would try and keep her from me. ♪ ♪ Okay, look. ♪ ♪ I've known you both for a long time. You're both good people. But you're both stubborn as f*ck. And you both kicked the sh1t out of me, at different times, in different ways. So, I'm telling you this as a friend, someone who cares about you, and who is also a little afraid of you, and very afraid of your ex-husband. All you need... ...is a good lawyer. [both chuckle] Right? [both chuckle softly] Yeah. ♪ ♪ [chuckles] Cheers. I gonna have that one actually. [laughs] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [knocking] [knocking] [gasps] Oh, my God, sweetheart. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, I've missed you so much. Mm. Hey. Oh. [sighs] I'm sorry I've been gone so long. [chuckles] Do you want to see your room? Is it this way? Yeah, go. ♪ ♪ Thank you. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for her. You got one hour. ♪ ♪ [Joanie laughing] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
