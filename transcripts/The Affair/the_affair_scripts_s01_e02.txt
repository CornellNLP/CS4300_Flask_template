 Previously on The Affair... 
 Mr. Solloway, thanks for coming in. 
 Well, like I had much of a choice. 
 Where's Martin? 
 I hate grandpa. 
 I know. So do I. 
 At least you stand to inherit some of his money when he dies. 
 So I read your book. 
 Everyone has one book in them. 
 Almost nobody has two. 
 Why're you laughing? 
 It's... 
 What? What are you laughing at? 
 Your face is a little funny. 
 That's all. [Giggles] 
 Welcome to the end of the world. 
 Do you remember the first time you saw her? 
 Like it was yesterday. 
 Ms. Lockhart, do you remember seeing him for the first time? 
 Turn her over. 
 Hit her hard! 
 I remember he was holding his daughter. 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 [Thwack] 
 [Coughs] 
 You saved her life. I'm Noah, by the way. 
 Why don't you tell me how it began? 
 How many times do you think we've had s*x? 
 10,000? 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 Let's try to have a good day today. 
 I wake up every morning with his face in my mind too. 
 It just hurts. Make it stop. 
 Alison? 
 You found me! 
 I found you. 
 Oh, hi. 
 You live around here? 
 Walk me home then? 
 I think you want to see this. 
 I got to go. 
 Thanks for the walk. 
 Oh, no. 
 So go. 
 Leave me alone! 
 Stop it! 
 How much longer is this gonna take? 
 I just have a few more questions.

 Listen, I had no idea she was married when I first met her. 
 I mean, how would I have known? She never mentioned it. 
 She seemed like the loneliest girl in the world. 
 I just thought she was bad news. 
 So, after that first night I went out of my way to avoid her. 
 I had my second book on my mind. 
 I was under a lot of pressure to get it done, make it good. 
 [Boat horns honking, gulls crying] 
 [Background chatter] 
 I just picked up a copy of that book. 
 I'm looking forward to reading it. 
 Oh, good for you, man. 
 I hope you enjoy it. 
 Anyway, the point is I wasn't thinking about her at all. 
 [Groaning] 
 Oh, go... 
 [No audible dialogue] 
 [Shower running] 
 [Door opens] 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Want some company? 
 Uh... not really. 
 Gee, thanks. 
 I'm just taking some me time. 
 You know, you're not as much fun as you used to be. 
 I was never fun. I think you've become more fun. 
 I think that's the problem. 
 I'm gonna go find a pool boy that lets me shower with him. 
 Can we have breakfast together before you do? 
 Ready? Whoops, that's a big one. 
 [Sizzling sound] Go for it. 
 They're in the cabinet next to the fridge. 
 Advil, right? 
 I could have sworn they were there last summer. 
 They were. 
 Mother had an efficiency expert re-do the kitchen. 
 That's right, and she was worth every penny. 
 I got years of my life back. 
 Coffee! 
 Miranda, make sure the caterers know we increased the guest count to 200 people. 
 Good morning, Mr. Solloway. 
 Hello, Ruby. 
 Checkmate! 
 No, it isn't. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Trevor, it's highly unlikely you're gonna win this game. 
 I'm older and I'm smarter... 
 Well, you could let him win, Dad. 
 Why would I do that? 
 Because he's ten. 
 So we're gonna let him think he's better than he is? 
 How will real life feel? 
 He'll be an adult in real life, so it will feel fine. 
 Checkmate. 
 Daddy, please make me a cappuccino. 
 I would, Whit, if I could work out how to use this... 
 Don't touch that! 
 It's a very temperamental machine. 
 We've had such headaches with well-intentioned visitors inadvertently reprogramming it. 
 Miranda, would you please... 
 Cappuccino or espresso? 
 Macchiato, please. Thank you. 
 Oh, my God! Miranda, the flowers! 
 We completely, utterly, entirely forgot to order flowers. 
 Oh, no. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Calm down. Just relax. It's okay. 
 Noah and I will go to the farmer's market today. 
 I'll get you some flowers, and I'll arrange them for you. 
 Noah shouldn't have to spend his Saturday like that. 
 He doesn't mind. 
 Do you? 
 Not at all. 
 [Laughs] Great! 
 How come Ruby's hanging out with us again? 
 I thought you guys said she was a bad influence. 
 'Cause she's a friend of your sister's, and I think that she's grown up a lot this year. 
 I heard she got expelled. 
 Is that true? 
 No. 
 She spent a little time in rehab. 
 Horsies! Stop! 
 I want to pet the horsie! 
 Uh, we can't stop now, honey, but on the way back we can. 
 But I want to pet the horsie! 
 You will. I promise. On the way back. 
 I used to ride there when I was a little girl. 
 Do you know how many times you've told me that? 
 Well, you repeat things too, you know. 
 There's a really nice woman that ran that ranch. 
 She had four boys. 
 They must be all grown up by now. 
 Mm. I knew that. 
 [Pop music on radio] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I spy with my little eye something white. 
 Something white? 
 Her dress. 
 Yes. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I spy with my little eyes... 
 What? What do you see? 
 Disaster. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Would you like to try a sample? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 This one is strawberry-peach. 
 How do you like it? Better than the blueberry? 
 Hm. 
 And this one... 
 How are you? 
 I'm fine. 
 How do you like it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I've been, uh... a bit worried about you, uh... 
 Do you two know each other? 
 Not really. 
 Apples? 
 Yes, it has apples in it, but there's also a secret ingredient. 
 Cinnamon? 
 Yes. 
 What a smart girl you are. 
 So you want one? 
 Daddy, can we have it? 
 Sure, honey. Yeah. 
 It's 12 bucks, please. 
 I've only got a 20, so, uh, keep the change. 
 No, thanks. 
 Hey. Here you are. 
 Mama! 
 Hey! 
 [Helen and Stacey chattering] 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. Everything's fine. 
 Horsies! Horsies! 
 [Laughs] Uh, I promised... 
 All right. 
 [Bell ringing] 
 [Ding] 
 All right. 
 I think, really, they heard it. Nice work. 
 Howdy. 
 Hi, I'm Helen Butler. 
 I used to ride here when I was a kid. 
 But you were very young, so you probably don't remember. 
 [Chuckling] Isn't that something? 
 It's good to see you again, Helen. 
 Is this your daughter? 
 Yes. 
 We would like to sign her up for some lessons. 
 I'm sure that can be arranged. 
 Hey! 
 This is my brother, Hal. 
 He can help you pick out a horse. 
 What's your name? 
 Stacey. 
 Come with me, Stacey. 
 In the meantime, I'll give the rest of you folks a tour of the place? 
 Great. 
 Now, when she gets good enough, we'll take her riding on that trail up there, up over the ridge and all the way down to the sea. 
 Are... are you Cole? 
 Uh, no, I'm Scotty. 
 Cole's another brother. 
 Oh. 
 Are you looking for him? 
 'Cause there he is, right there. 
 Hey, Cole! 
 Hey. 
 Hey, folks. Whoa. 
 Hey, uh, this young fellow had a question for you. 
 Uh, I was wondering if you, uh, you still need a hand? 
 Well, you're a little younger than I was expecting. 
 You ever ridden a horse before? 
 No. 
 You ever worked on a ranch? 
 No. 
 A farm? 
 I, uh, water my dad's planter boxes every other day. 
 Um, I'm Noah. 
 Cole. 
 This is Helen. 
 Ma'am. 
 Well, you're not qualified, but you are first, and that does count for something. 
 So I'll tell you what. 
 Why don't you spend a couple more hours here with us today, if it's all right with your folks. 
 I'll teach you how to brush a horse, polish a saddle. 
 See if you got the stuff. 
 Can I? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 No, I don't know, I don't... 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 What about your parents' party? 
 We'll just pick him up later. 
 He's excited. It's like a miracle. 
 Please? 
 Yeah. Great. Thanks. 
 It's my pleasure, sir. 
 I like your boy. 
 All right. First lesson. 
 Take those into the barn. 
 You folks want to head up? 
 Everyone says to you when you're young, "Who do you love? 
 Love is all you need," and it sends you into a panic. 
 At least it did for me. 
 My mother had just died, and my father was drinking himself to death. 
 My sister had taken off for Nepal with some Sherpa, and I thought, "Who do I love? Who do I even have?" 
 I had Helen. 
 I popped the question the night we graduated college. 
 None of my family had come, but Helen's parents took us both out to the nicest restaurant in town, and her dad bought a $200 bottle of wine... and afterwards all our friends were so excited. 
 She felt like some sort of princess, and I felt like... such a man. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Why are you laughing? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 Just for some reason that strikes me as funny, thinking about that now. 
 I made you some lunch. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 How's it going? 
 Badly. 
 Oh. What's wrong? 
 Uh, I'm not inspired, Helen, I'm... 
 I'm bored. 
 Oh... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'll try not to take that personally. 
 This is delicious. What is it? 
 Turkey, local cheddar, and some of that jam you got at the farmer's market. 
 Which dress? 
 Um... that one. 
 I think I'm gonna wear this one. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 Whitney? 
 Hey. 
 Whitney! 
 What? 
 Come here. 
 Where is the rest of your dress? 
 Dad. 
 Go change. 
 I don't have anything else to wear. 
 Then stay in your room. 
 Thanks a lot, Dad. 
 Ruby, you can't drink. You're 16. 
 It's apple juice. 
 Something totally f*cked up is happening. 
 What? What is it? 
 Something totally f*cked up is going on, that's what. 
 All right. See that lady with the witchy hair and the long dre... Don't look! 
 Well, how am I supposed to see... 
 That's her. 
 Who? 
 The piano teacher. 
 Who? The one your dad had the affair with? 
 Yeah. 
 What was the name, Maria? 
 Theresa. 
 Theresa. I knew it was something Catholic. 
 What is she doing here? 
 Do you think he invited her? 
 Why would he do that? 
 'Cause he's a dick, or hadn't you noticed? 
 Yeah. 
 That's a rhetorical question. 
 Don't answer it. 
 What am I gonna do? I don't want my mom to see her. 
 Did your mom know? 
 Yeah, she knew. 
 I mean, she didn't know, but she knew. 
 It... she knew. 
 It's... Oh, f*ck. 
 I can't believe she came. It's so unfair. 
 My mother worked so f*cking hard to make everything perfect for the party, and then he just comes in and he sh1ts all over everything. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 [Mellow dinner music playing] 
 First he was a writer, then he was a blogger, and now he's waiting on tables in Astoria. 
 I sh1t you not. 
 Hey, Harry! 
 Harry, this is my son-in-law, Noah. 
 This is Harry, my agent. 
 You're never gonna believe this, but he read your book. 
 Really? 
 I told him to. I said you weren't bad. 
 You did? 
 Surprised, aren't you? 
 You thought I didn't like it. 
 That's part of your problem, Noah. 
 You've got no faith in people. 
 Well, not everyone is as magnanimous as you, Bruce. 
 [Men chuckling] 
 So Bruce tells me that you're working on something new this summer? 
 That's right. 
 So what's it about? 
 Uh, well, I haven't really gotten too far with it yet. 
 It's, uh, it's sort of in the research phase. 
 Well, I'm thinking of setting it out here on the island. 
 Come on, Noah. Harry here's a big deal. 
 You're gonna have to sell yourself a little harder than that. 
 What are we talking about? 
 Noah's new book. 
 Wow. Great. 
 I didn't know there was enough to talk about yet. 
 There isn't really. 
 I'm trying to convince Harry here to take him on. 
 That would be incredible. 
 But the kid isn't giving us much to work with. 
 Well, Noah doesn't like to talk about his work before he starts writing. 
 That's understandable. 
 But I'm getting the sense that this next book... if it's okay to say... is, um, gonna be a little bit more commercial. 
 You know? If that's not a bad word. 
 Still incredibly smart. Just a little more accessible. 
 He liked the first book, Helen. 
 Yeah, well, because it was brilliant, but, um, this house just publishes bigger feeling bo... books. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 You order whiskey? 
 Thank you. 
 I think that's the girl from the Lobster Roll. 
 Hm? 
 The waitress. 
 The day Stacey choked. 
 Oh, was it? 
 Is she flirting with you? 
 Of course she was flirting with him. 
 [Chuckles] 
 If I had an ass like hers, I'd do exactly the same thing... wear a tight dress to a nice party, try to find some poor schmuck to take me home. 
 [Men laughing] 
 Did you just call me a schmuck, Bruce? 
 Did I? I didn't mean to. 
 But you did call the waitress a whore though, right? 
 Noah. 
 I need to get a, uh, refill. 
 Can I get anyone anything? No? Excuse me. 
 [Muted background chatter] 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How are you? 
 I'm good. 
 How are you? 
 [Hoarsely] Yeah. I'm better now. 
 You know, you really shouldn't smoke that here. 
 They'll smell it in the kitchen. 
 Okay. Where should we go? 
 [Muted background chatter] 
 Forgot the code? 
 I hope not. 
 It's my wife's birthday. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh... 
 [Distant laughter] 
 [Laughing] No. 
 [Click] 
 Wrong year. 
 [Surf crashing] 
 [Noah laughs] 
 [Faintly under surf] Join me! 
 What? 
 It's beautiful! 
 So you're having trouble with your new book? 
 A little. 
 Because you wrote about everything that ever happened in the first book, and now you have nothing else to write about. 
 Is it that obvious? 
 You know what I think you should do? 
 What? 
 Forget about the book for a while. 
 You came out here to take a vacation, right? 
 No, I came out here to finish my book. 
 Well, maybe you should try living a little... and then you'll have something to write about. 
 When I saw you this morning, you didn't want to have anything to do with me. 
 You were with your daughter. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm married. 
 [Laughs] Okay. 
 You know what that means? 
 Well, marriage means different things to different people. 
 No, no. Not to me. To me it means... nothing can happen between us. 
 You're serious? 
 I'm very serious. 
 Okay. 
 In that case, it was nice meeting you, Noah Solloway. 
 You too, Alison... 
 Lockhart. 
 Like the ranch? 
 Yeah. It belongs to my husband. 
 You're married too? 
 [Laughs] That's right. 
 Surprise. 
 What the f*ck was that? 
 What happened later that night? 
 Nothing, man. I, uh... apologized to my father-in-law and... went to sleep with my wife. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Of course. 
 How is any of this relevant to what happened? 
 It may not be, Mr. Solloway. I'm just gathering a little background on the people who knew the victim and how they're connected to each other. 
 Why? 
 Trying to figure out if anyone might have had a motive to kill this fella. 
 I thought it was an accident. 
 I'm sorry, I... I didn't know your wife's birthday. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Will. 
 How was the night? 
 I'm f*cking beat, Ali. 
 Yeah. I bet. 
 One second. 
 [Groans] 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, wow. They're beautiful. 
 Thanks. 
 I thought so. 
 How you doing these days? 
 I'm all right. 
 You know what? 
 You look better. 
 Do I? Well, must be the weather. 
 [Giggles] 
 My mother sends her love. 
 Says she's been praying for you and Cole. 
 Say thank you. You take care, you hear? 
 Go home and get yourself some sleep. 
 [Voice over radio] 
 [Static] 
 Need a medium pick up at 57 Fairview Avenue, headed to train station. 
 Say... hold on. Whoa, whoa, wait one second. 
 I'm almost done with this chapter. 
 Caleb. 
 Ohh... 
 [Over radio] I can give 'em a quick call. 
 I've been sitting out here for five minutes... 
 I don't like this guy. 
 You're in the minority. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Give 'em a call, tell 'em I'm here. 
 Oof... 
 [Chatter continues over radio] 
 Nice looking fish. 
 What? 
 Didn't Cole ask you to keep that door locked? 
 It's early. 
 Who's stopping by? 
 [Bell ringing] 
 [Train horn] 
 Rise and shine. It's go-time. 
 You know, they do that on, uh, text message now. 
 Leave me alone, Bailey. I'm very happy. 
 [Bell dinging] 
 [Sound fades] 
 I was sure I'd never see him again. 
 The summer people, they come in. 
 They leave. 
 They barely even notice us, the ones who wait their tables or bait their lines. 
 We might as well be traffic lights to them. 
 Stop signs. Lamp posts. 
 We blend in with the scenery. 
 I thought it'd be the same with him. 
 For all I knew, he was already gone. 
 Hey. 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 Check his office. 
 Oh. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Oscar? You in there? 
 Oscar! 
 Are you sleeping here now? 
 What's it to you? 
 Elaine kick you out again? 
 She might have. 
 Oh, what did you do? 
 How come I got to be the one that did something? 
 Maybe she's just being a dick. 
 Hm. 
 You consider that? 
 Why are you here? You're not even on today. 
 I want my check. 
 It's on the board. 
 No, it's not. 
 A m*therf*cker. 
 Hold on. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 Is he here? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Fantastic. You've multiplied. 
 Ooh. 
 I suppose you want your check too, hmm? 
 Oh, no. I just came here to blow you. 
 Ooh... 
 What are you doing right now? 
 Wanna... split a coffee? 
 Nah, I got to get to the farmers market. 
 Sorry. 
 Got a call about a catering job tonight, if anyone wants it. 
 Where? 
 Bruce Butler's. 
 Hell, yes. I'll take it. 
 I've always wanted to see the inside of that place. 
 What about you? 
 Pass. 
 Ha. Really? You're too good for Bruce Butler now? 
 No. I got plans. 
 What kind of plans you got? 
 Well, I was thinking maybe I'll go home and f*ck my husband. 
 Oh, for a change? 
 You wish. 
 [Laughs] Fine. 
 Jane, they want you there by 5:00. 
 Look hot. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Yeah. 
 No problem. You want some? 
 Oh, no. No. It's too early for me. 
 I'll be asleep by noon. 
 So Hal asked me if I wanted to have a threesome with him last night. 
 What? 
 [Laughs] With who? 
 Some au pair he met. 
 What did you say? 
 I told him I'd think about it. 
 Have you ever had one? 
 M-Me? No. God no. 
 No, no. 
 What? Not even when you were away at school? 
 No. All I did at school was study. 
 My problem is I got no role models. 
 Cole and I had a**l s*x once. 
 And? 
 [Shudders] Ooh... 
 [Laughs] 
 Awesome. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Thank you for the pep talk. 
 Sometimes I kind of take a giant step back into myself and watch everyone else go by, like from a window high above. 
 I felt like I could see so clearly from up there... the way a crowd of people swelled and thinned, ebbed one way then changed direction, like the tide. 
 It made me feel better being so far away from everyone else. 
 I was alone. I was safe. 
 I remember you. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 I was wondering when we'd run into each other again. 
 How are you? 
 I'm... I'm good. 
 I'm... I'm... I'm fine. 
 I'm, just, uh, selling jam, you know? 
 I see that. 
 Yeah. 
 We'd like to buy some. 
 Uh, okay. Do you have a flavor in mind, or... 
 Uh, which flavor would you recommend? 
 Uh, strawberry or, um, blueberry or, uh... 
 Raspberry. 
 Yeah, raspberry. 
 Or a raspberry-apple, or a pumpkin butter. 
 Okay. We'll get, uh, one of each. 
 Should we, Stacey? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah? One of each, please. 
 Rad. 
 I'll go check the inventory. 
 Thanks. 
 I'd really like to see you again. 
 I'd like to keep talking with you. 
 We're, uh, out of the blueberry, so I gave you some tomato chutney instead. 
 Wonderful. Thank you. 
 Great. 
 Do you want to ring him up? 
 Uh, sure. Yeah. 
 Uh, that will be $30, please. 
 40, actually. 
 40. 40. 
 Five jars, $8.00 a jar. 
 40. 
 Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm Mary Kate. This is Alison. 
 Are you sisters? 
 In-law. 
 We're married to brothers. 
 Well, thanks for this. See you around. 
 Come on, Stacey. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 He wants to f*ck one of us, but I don't think he can decide which one. 
 Oh, come on. He's married. 
 Right. 
 Like that ever stopped anyone. 
 Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome, miss. 
 How'd you guys make out? 
 Oh, like thieves. 
 That true? 
 Yeah, we did pretty well. 
 What are you guys charging these days? 
 $8.00 a jar. 
 [Women laughing] 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Summer people. God bless 'em. 
 I love to see that smile. 
 [Car honking] 
 [Thumping dance music] 
 ♪ 
 [Music stops] 
 [Honk honk] 
 Yoo-hoo! Martin! 
 Whoa. 
 Hey. I'm looking for my little brother. 
 Name's Martin. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 What are you doing here? 
 They sent me to get you. 
 You have to come home and get cleaned up for the party. 
 [Sighs] Is it okay if I leave? 
 Yeah. Of course it is, man. 
 That was an excellent first day. 
 We're happy to have you here. 
 So what is it you boys do here? 
 Whitney... 
 Well, miss, we, uh... we board horses, lead trail rides... 
 I've never been on a horse. 
 Never? 
 No. Something tells me I'd love it. 
 Whitney, come on! Let's go! 
 I'm a dancer, so I've got really loose hips. 
 Well, it'd be my pleasure to teach you how to ride. 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Car door closes] 
 Dude, what the f*ck? 
 She's 16. If that. 
 I'm just trying to drum up some business for us. 
 We're a little strapped for cash these days, in case you hadn't noticed. 
 [Car motor receding] 
 How was the pick-up this morning? 
 Oh, it was fine. 
 No incidents? 
 No. 
 Oh. [Laughs] 
 Sorry, love. I didn't mean to frighten you. 
 No. That's all right. 
 I'm just glad to have caught you alone for a minute. 
 I've been hoping for some time with you. 
 Okay. 
 How are you? 
 I'm fine. 
 Is Cole being good to you? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. Always, Cherry. 
 I'm so proud of the way you two have gotten through this together. 
 Such a testament to your love. 
 I always knew you two were right for each other. 
 Even when you were little and you hated each other. 
 I've wanted to tell you, dear, your strength allows us all to be strong. 
 There have been so many nights where I've woken up just sobbing. 
 Then I think of you... and of Cole, and I think of how blessed I am to have such remarkable children. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, no. 
 This is not how I intended this conversation to go. 
 Don't cry. Please. 
 It's okay. 
 I was thinking, this fall, I'm gonna finally go through the boys' old rooms. 
 I'm gonna clear 'em out. 
 I'm gonna have a huge tag sale. 
 What do you think of that? 
 I think you'll be rich. 
 There's so much up there. 
 I know, and then there will be room if you and Cole have another baby, and you decide to move back in for a while. 
 What, move back here? 
 Only if you want to, dear. 
 I just thought it might be nice for you to have some help next time around. 
 I didn't have many friends left by that summer. 
 I only really had Cole and his family. 
 I felt like I had to be so strong for them because if they knew what I was really thinking, they'd be terrified of me. 
 Hey. 
 Uh, you still doing that catering job tonight? 
 No, no. I'll bike over. 
 Yeah, can I, uh, can I borrow a dress? 
 Mine are all dirty. 
 Thanks. Okay. 
 [Background chatter] 
 [Jazz music] 
 ♪ 
 Jesus, you're thin. 
 [Both snicker] 
 Do I look like a prostitute in this? 
 I don't think prostitutes wear black. 
 Oh, expensive ones do. 
 Oh, terrific. 
 I thought he was cute. 
 No? [Giggles] 
 Give me one of those. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 See that woman over there? 
 Do you think she's attractive? 
 She's not my type. 
 [Laughing] I like you. 
 Where do I know you from? 
 I'm a waitress at the Lobster Roll. Perhaps... 
 Oh, my God. 
 You're that poor little girl who lost her baby, aren't you? 
 I recognize you from your picture in the paper. 
 I wondered what happened to you ever since I read that article. 
 Well, I'm still here. 
 You taking care of yourself? 
 Trying. 
 Good. 
 You make sure you eat well, exercise. 
 If you need a Valium, let me know. 
 See that fellow? 
 The balding, squinty, pretentious one? 
 Yes. 
 If I promised you a grand, would you spill a drink on him? 
 Is that for me? Thank you. 
 Excuse me, could you get me a glass of water? 
 Uh, and a very thin sliver of cake, please. Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 Oh, wait. 
 Come here, dear. Come here. 
 Let me fix that for you. 
 Hm. 
 This couldn't be any tighter, could it? 
 There you go. No ice in the water. 
 Want to have a look upstairs? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 I would love to see upstairs. 
 Okay, then follow me. 
 [Giggling] 
 Scotty? 
 Oh, hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I came with Ed. 
 You know him? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 We're old pals. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Can you get me his autograph? 
 [Both chuckling] 
 What's going on here? 
 Nothing, Dad. 
 Can I help you? 
 Oh, I was just looking for the bathroom. 
 Oh, there's one on this level. 
 Just, uh, past the kitchen. 
 Great. Thanks, man. 
 You want to get out of here? 
 Wow. I've never been on one of these beaches. 
 You want to go in the water? 
 No. Uh, I can't swim. 
 You live at the beach and you can't swim? 
 That's a travesty. 
 Well... not really. 
 Well, I'm a swimmer. I'll teach you. 
 [Chuckles] Right. 
 So it's nice to see you again. 
 Alone. 
 Clothed. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 You're married? 
 I am. 
 You're not wearing a ring. 
 Well, I-I take it off when I work. 
 Why? 
 Better tips. 
 So that guy in the driveway, he's... he's your husband? 
 I don't believe you. 
 Married people don't f*ck like that. 
 Marriage means different things to different people. 
 What does it mean to you? 
 Well, I-I used to think it meant there was this one person I would put above anyone else. 
 Above myself. 
 And now? 
 Now I just hope I don't kill him. 
 I got married young. 
 Straight out of college. 
 I had a great girlfriend. She was beautiful. 
 She was rich. 
 She was kind of artsy, and I wanted to be beautiful, rich, and artsy, so I married her. 
 And I loved her. I should mention that. 
 I did love her. 
 And now? 
 I still love her. 
 But if I had to do it again I... 
 I'd have waited just a little bit longer... given myself a little more time to... see who I might become. 
 There's this hypothesis in theoretical physics that I used to love back at school, about time travel. 
 About what would happen if you could travel back in time and make a different choice in your past, how that would affect your life in the future. 
 So the theory goes that, um, your true life, your first life, continues as is, unchanged, but at the moment of decision, a new life splits off along a tangent into a parallel universe. 
 So you could, in a way... live both lives. 
 I've been thinking about you all week. 
 Have you been thinking about me? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 Well, what do you want to do now? 
 I want you to kiss me, but I don't think... 
 So you're talking to everyone who was there that night? 
 That's right. 
 The thing is, Detective, I... 
 I really doubt it was anyone at the party that ran him down. 
 And what makes you say that? 
 Well, everyone at the party was a local, but the road where he died, that leads to one of those new fancy clubs that tourists like to go to. 
 I don't know why anyone from the party would be headed that way. 
 He was. 
 Yeah. I suppose that's true. 
 Where were you staying that night? 
 I told you. 
 You drove back to the city. 
 Yeah. That's right. 
 So you think I'm barking up the wrong tree? 
 I don't know. I just want to help you do your job. I'll do anything to find out what happened to him. I... I can't believe he's gone. 
 [Tires screeching] 
 Whoo-hoo!
