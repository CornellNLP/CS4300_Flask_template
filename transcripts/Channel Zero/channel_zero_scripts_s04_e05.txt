 (SCREAMING) Jill, Jill, look at me. 
 You gotta do everything I tell you to. 
 Three, two, one. 
 (COUNT ECHOING) 
 It's not Tom's. 
 No, he just wanted it to be. 
 What matters is that he lied. 
 IAN: You tamed it. Your stuff, all of it. 
 JILLIAN: But I can control him. 
 Well, that would take some training. 
 I know the perfect place. 
 Tom, this is Bill Hope, Jillian's father. 
 I just have something very important to tell her about our family. 
 Great, thank you. 
 Have a good night. 
 IAN: Dad? 
 You leave your sister alone. 
 BILL: Stop it! (BABBLING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (CHOKING) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (LOON CALLING) 
 (WIND CHIMES TINKLING) 
 IAN: All right. Here we go. 
 One more time, yeah? 
 Baby steps. Nothing too hard. 
 Let's, uh... Let's start with something simple. 
 A rabbit. 
 Just a cute little bunny rabbit. 
 Everybody likes bunnies, right? 
 That's an easy one. 
 Now... 
 Remember, picture it in your mind. 
 Attach a feeling. 
 Comfort. 
 Gratitude. 
 Love. 
 Imagine all of its parts. 
 Imagine its... its whiskers, its eyes, its ears, nose. 
 (HEART BEATING LOUDLY, GASPS) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 (PANTING) 
 (GROANS, PANTING) 
 Something feels different. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Something is different. 
 You lost part of yourself yesterday, right? 
 I remember when I lost my first creation. 
 It was intense. 
 I made him here, you know, this house... the first time. after drawing him a million times. 
 Oh, I used to love to draw with my crayons. 
 My first creation, Tall Boy, he did some... not-so-great things before I learned how to control him. 
 But with practice, you can learn not only to control them, but to... to operate them, even. 
 What do you mean? Well, he can become sort of like your, uh, puppet. 
 It's... it's a special thing that only you can do. 
 You and me. 
 It's cool. It's awesome! 
 You know? (SCOFFS) 
 You're allowed to enjoy it. 
 It's a superpower, right? 
 You're just making a bunny rabbit. 
 Okay. 
 This is the one. You got this. 
 Deep breath. (DEEP BREATHING) 
 Begin. 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Yeah, that's good. That's great. 
 (PANTING, GROANING) Really good. Really good. 
 Yeah. 
 Picture all its parts. Its eyes. 
 Picture its ears, its whiskers. 
 (PANTING) There you go, come on. 
 (HEART BEATING RAPIDLY) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Almost, almost. 
 Physical contact helps. You ready? 
 One, two, three. Here we go. 
 (GROANING, PANTING) 
 (HEART BEATING RAPIDLY) 
 (HEARTBEAT RISING) 
 (HEART BEAT SLOWS) 
 That was all you. 
 I knew you could. 
 Go on. 
 Come on, let's see that rabbit. 
 (SHAKY BREATHING) 
 (CREATURE SNARLING) 
 Oh... Don't run away. 
 Don't run away. 
 (CREATURE SNARLING)

 (CREATURE CROAKS) 
 (IAN GRUNTS) 
 (JILLIAN GROANS) 
 Well, they can't all be winners. 
 Like your dog, you know. 
 It took me a bunch of tries to get that one right. 
 My dog? 
 You made my dog? 
 Yeah. 
 You were moving in, and I thought I'd send you a little present. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hey. . 
 I thought I left my phone in my purse. 
 sh1t. 
 (EGGS SIZZLING) 
 It's dead. 
 I've never broken a phone before in my life. 
 Well, if only a cracked screen were your biggest problem right now. 
 (LAUGHS) Right? 
 I think I need some air. Yeah. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 (LINE RINGING) 
 (LINE CONTINUES RINGING) 
 Hey, this is Jill. Leave a message. 
 (VOICEMAIL BEEPS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 TOM: Hey, um... it's me. 
 I don't know where you are. 
 Or if you're with... him. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 I just don't know, Jill. 
 (TOM SIGHS) 
 Please come home. 
 (CHIMES RINGING) 
 (DOG PANTING) Hey. 
 (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) 
 (BECKONING NOISES) 
 Yes. Yes. 
 (GROANS) I need you right now. 
 You miss her, too. 
 (DOG SNEEZES) 
 Oh. 
 Yep. 
 (DOG PANTING) 
 (CHIMES RINGING) 
 (LOW GROWLING) 
 (LOW GROWL) 
 (LOW GROWLING)

 (DISTANT BARKING) 
 (LOON CALLS) 
 (WIND CHIMES RINGING) 
 TOM: (QUIETLY) Hey. 
 Hey, where you going? 
 Oh. 
 You want to go into lan's house, huh? 
 (SIGHS) Okay. 
 (DOOR CLICKS OPEN) 
 lan? 
 lan? 
 lan? 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
 (WIND CHIMES RINGING) 
 (LOW GROWLING) 
 (SCREEN DOOR CREAKS)

 (LOW PANTING) 
 (DOG WHINES, PANTS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (RELIEVED CHUCKLE) 
 IAN: Breakfast is ready. 
 Hey, Jill? 
 Hey, Jill? 
 Hey. 
 Smells delicious. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 What the f*ck? 
 (BOXES CLATTERING) 
 JILLIAN: I have a question. 
 Mmm-hmm? You said you made the dog. 
 Why did you choose that particular dog? 
 Um... 
 Well, you know, I... I don't know. 
 (NERVOUS LAUGH) 
 It's just, um... it's just so funny, I had a stuffed animal that looked just like that when I was really little. 
 Weird. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 What was your mom like? 
 My mom? 
 Why? 
 Just... curious to know more about you. 
 IAN: She passed away. 
 I'm so sorry. Yeah, yeah. 
 Earlier this year. 
 She was, um... she was very trusting. 
 That was her weakness, probably. 
 She was too trusting. 
 She saw the world the way she wanted to see it. 
 Well... the way her husband told her to see it. 
 I think she chose not to see certain things. 
 You can do that, you know... 
 Make your own reality. 
 But she really loved me, you know? 
 Like... like, whoa. 
 She never understood me, but she... but she... she kept trying. 
 She never stopped, and she really... deserved... better than she got. 
 (SMACKING, CRUNCHING) 
 (SWALLOWS LOUDLY) 
 You okay? 
 I think I need to go home. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 We don't have to go back now, you know. 
 I mean it might not even... might not be the best thing for your training, you know? 
 Doing really good. 
 Did you see that? Someone's in my house. 
 IAN: Hey, Tom. 
 You, uh... 
 You looking for something, man? 
 Why were you at the motel last night? 
 What? 
 I saw you at the motel. 
 I wasn't at any motel last night, man. was... I was with Jillian. 
 All night. JILLIAN: What motel? 
 What time? IAN: I was with you. 
 I was asleep. 
 Your dad called me. 
 What? He said he needed to talk to you about something urgent. 
 About your family. 
 That he couldn't reach you. 
 So I went to go meet him at that motel off of 270, and when I got there this guy, he was leaving and your dad was nowhere to be found. 
 So where is her dad? 
 Why were you at that motel? 
 Why you got all these pictures of her? 
 IAN: Man, I... look, I... I mean, I don't even know where to start. 
 This is... is f*cking insane, man. 
 (MUFFLED SPEECH) 
 (INAUDIBLE SPEECH) 
 What? 
 I know who you are. 
 Yeah. (LAUGHS) 
 Okay, what are y'all talking about? 
 He must have bought the place later on, right? 
 He took me and my mom there a few times as well. 
 Weekends at the lake. 
 I was almost too young to even remember it. 
 I was wondering if you would. 
 I left that little stuffed dog there, as well. 
 Didn't I? 
 TOM: What are you talking about? 
 He's my brother. 
 Half-brother. 
 IAN: Hey, I know. I know. 
 What you have to understand is, I didn't know about you until recently. 
 When I was a kid, my... my dad was always... away traveling on business. 
 My mom was the other woman, and I didn't even know. 
 1 didn't know you existed. 
 But when I found out, it all made sense. 
 We both have this thing. 
 We both have it. 
 We didn't ask for it, and we got it from the same man who couldn't love us. 
 Nobody will ever understand you the way that I understand you. 
 This isn't how I wanted you to find out. 
 I just didn't want you to think I was part of Dad's... 
 You lied to me. 
 I have done everything for you. 
 I did something big. I did something really big... 
 And I want you to see it. 
 It's in the garage. 
 Please. 
 (DOOR CLATTERING) 
 Oh, sh1t. You got out of your cages! 
 (DOGS SNORTING, PANTING) 
 (FLESH SQUELCHING) 
 (BONES CRUNCHING) 
 (DOOR RATTLING) 
 (DOGS GROWLING, PANTING) 
 Jill. 
 Stay away from me. IAN: Okay, okay. 
 Hey... 
 Hey... 
 Hey. (LAUGHS) 
 Here we are. 
 We're on the edge of something. 
 You know who I am, I know who you are. 
 We can move forward with our eyes open. 
 But it's up to you. 
 You tell me what happens next. 
 (LINE RINGING) 
 Detective Fraser, please. 
 It's an emergency. 
 Detective Fraser. 
 Hi. 
 There's been a murder. 
 We're at 48 Brahms Bay Caldecott Street. 
 Yes, I'll hold. 
 (GARAGE DOOR CLATTERING) 
 (DOGS SNORTING AND PANTING) 
 FRASER: We got a 10-54. 
 Probable 187, and you're gonna need to send Animal Services. 
 You could have mentioned there's 20 f*cking dogs in there eating him. IAN: They're not eating him. 
 They're just chewing on him. McPHILLIPS: Isn't there anything that you want to say about why there's a dead guy in your garage? I put him there last night. 
 Did you kill him? 
 1 did. 
 I killed them all. 
 Who is "all"? 
 1 did it for her. 
 She didn't know anything about it. 
 Killed who all? 
 Oh, I killed my dad. 
 He's in the garage. 
 I killed their friend Jason and the sensory deprivation tank lady. 
 Oh, I almost forgot, if you move some bags of fertilizer at the back of the garage, you'll find the O'Connells. 
 They used to live here. 
 I killed them because I needed to live in their house. 
 But between you and me, they were pretty much on their last legs, anyways, so... 
 Put your hands behind your back, lan. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 You have the right to an attorney. 
 BOTH: If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. 
 You're an asshole. 
 Let's go. 
 (CHATTER ON RADIO) 
 This is my fault. 
 Don't say that. 
 You know, when I was little... 
 
 
 
 I just thought he left. 
 It wasn't till I got older that my mom told me about the other family. 
 I want a family with you. 
 What? 
 That's what I've always wanted. 
 I'm scared. 
 Soaml. 
 No, I mean of myself. 
 I'm f*cked up. 
 I'm off-balance. 
 When I feel like this, that's... that's when things happen. 
 Well, what can I do? 
 (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 (MOANING) 
 Yeah, kiss me. 
 (BOTH PANTING, MOANING) 
 (CRIES OUT) 
 Don't stop, don't stop. 
 (BOTH MOANING) 
 (MOANING) 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 (GASPS, MOANS) 
 (BOTH PANTING) 
 (CREATURE WHEEZING) 
 TOM: What's behind that door? 
 JILLIAN: I don't know. I wasn't concentrating on anything. 
 TOM: Okay, so maybe there's nothing there. 
 Wait.

 TOM: Is this... 
 (CREATURE WHIMPERING) 
 Did we... 
 We did. 
 Here, do you want to hold it? 
 (SHAKY BREATHING) 
 (GASPS) 
 What... what is that? 
 It's our baby. It's part of me. 
 (CREATURE PURRS) 
 (CREATURE CHITTERING) 
 (GASPING) 
 I think it's dying. 
 (CREATURE CRIES, WHIMPERS) (JILLIAN HUSHES) 
 McPHILLIPS: He's not a serial killer. 
 FRASER: Bullshit. Five murders that we know of at different times, in different locations. 
 Textbook. 
 McPHILLIPS: Hmm. 
 Except he's not. 
 Oh, for God's sake. Ugh. 
 Pass the bus. Pass the bus. 
 FRASER: Oh, man, I'm not passing the bus. It's illegal. 
 TIMMY: I don't want to go to school! 
 MAN: Come on. TIMMY: No! 
 FRASER: So if he's not a serial killer, what is he? 
 TIMMY: I don't want to go, the kids are means and so are you. I hate you! 
 Just a regular mass-murderer. 
 Is that what you are, my man? 
 Just a regular mass-murderer? 
 Spree-killer. 
 Come again? 
 Oh, boy. 
 Check out this circus-looking fella. He's grotesque. 
 FRASER: Ugh, that is one ugly man. Oh, man. 
 TIMMY: No! 
 If I was that ugly, I would kill myself for sure. 
 Who wears socks and sandals together? 
 FRASER: He looks like a '90s boy-band reject. 
 McPHILLIPS: Must have smoked a lot of dope in high school. 
 Look at this kid. 
 Get on the bus, kid. Just put him on the bus. 
 MAN: Listen, Timmy. Timmy, get on the bus. 
 The kid wants to stay home. TIMMY: I don't want to get on the bus! 
 Let the kid stay home. 
 McPHILLIPS: What the f*ck? (SAW WHIRRING) 
 No, no, no, no! 
 (CHILDREN SCREAMING) 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 Oh, God! (SCREAMING) 
 (ALL SCREAMING)

 No, no. No!

 I don't know what to do. 
 (CREATURE WHEEZING) 
 Just go. (SNIFFLES)

 I don't want to leave you. 
 (CREATURE WHIMPERS) 
 Tom, please. 
 (CREATURE WHEEZING) 
 (CREATURE WHEEZING) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (SIGHS) 
 You gotta be f*cking kidding me, man. 
 I can literally make doors with my mind that monsters come out of. 
 You really think they could just haul me away in the back of a cop car? 
 Why don't you learn to take "no" for an answer? 
 Come on, Tom. Let's go inside. 
 You're not coming inside my house. 
 You're not welcome. 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 Don't doit, Tom. 
 I don't want to kill anybody else today. 
 Hey, officer! COP: Go back inside. 
 This is the guy you're looking for, right here. 
 (INDISTINCT SPEECH) 
 Do not move! Whoa! 
 Not me! Not me! 
 Shoot him! 
 COP: Hey! Get on the ground! 
 On the ground! 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 No, no, no! Stay back! 
 Did you... Drop the saw! 
 Did you create that? 
 OFFICER: I said "drop it." 
 I warned you, Tom. Do it! 
 Whatever happens next... All units, get back here! 
 ...is your fault. They're way too aggressive! 
 Stay back! Stay back! 
 Stay back! (SAW WHIRS, MAN SCREAMS)

 I'm not gonna go anywhere. 
 (LIQUID SQUISHES) 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 Tom? 
 Spent my lifetime caring No one ever wanted me Loving you 
 Looking through the broken glass See your picture tell the story Déja vu 
 Shadows turn to haunt me Through the deepest hurt of life What can Ido? 
 Always wanted your love Always wanted your love Always wanted your love I always wanted your love
