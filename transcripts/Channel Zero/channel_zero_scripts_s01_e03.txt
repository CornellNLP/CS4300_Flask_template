 You guys remember "Candle Cove"? 
 In 1988, five kids went missing. 
 The Iron Hill Murders. Never solved. 
 Look who's back in the middle of things. 
 A lot of folks just like you and your mom lost people. 
 How are you holding up having him home? 
 It's so strange. I barely know him. 
 Pay the toll. 
 Shove it up your ass. 
 Get him, Gene! 
 [screams] 
 It did something to my brother. 
 It can make people do things. 
 Hi, Daddy. 
 What is it, Lily? 
 You have to go inside. 
 Eddie. I did it. 
 Did what? 
 I killed him. 
 Mike, I need you to come down to the station with me. 
 It's something that your mom told me. 
 You missed the turn. 
 Where are you taking me? 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 Okay. 
 Ahh. 
 11 years old. 
 Okay, make a wish. Both of you. 
 Why don't you trade? Make each other's wish? 
 Better do something good for me, Eddie. 
 We share. 
 Whatever you have, I have, too. 
 Ready? 
 One... 
 Two, three. 
 Yay. 
 Yeah, there you got it. 
 Good job. 
 Did you wish for something good? 
 I did. 
 Don't tell her what it was. 
 It won't come true. 
 Yeah, you're not too good at keeping secrets.

 Gosh, a treasure chest. 
 Careful now, Percy. 
 That box might be locked for a reason. 
 And once you let bad things out, you can never put them back. 
 Blow away, Mr. Cloud. 
 It's a treasure chest. 
 Pirates love treasure. 
 [laughing] 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh, Marla, you scared me. 
 I-I'd like to talk to Mike. 
 Why would Mike be here? 
 Well, Gary, he, um, brought him in just a little while ago. 
 No, I, uh, I haven't seen Gary all night. 
 Well, if Gary didn't bring him here, where did he take him? 
 Are you saying Gary took Mike into custody?

 Gary, I don't know what my mother told you, but my intention here is to help Katie and Dane and... 
 You remember the old Iverson place? 
 Jess was the listing agent. 
 The house needed a lot of work, but it had good bones. 
 So we decided that we gonna grab it for ourselves. 
 We had all these plans to fix it up. 
 Never got a chance. 
 Some rich guy from Cleveland bought it out from under us. 
 Paid all cash. 
 And gutted the place. 
 You know how these guys are. 
 Gets bored, never finishes. 
 So now the house is on the market again. 
 Jess is the listing agent. 
 But it'll never be ours. 
 The price is too high. 
 He's not answering. 
 Went to voicemail. 
 Any idea where Gary would have taken him?

 What's going on right now? 
 [car doors closing] 
 Hi, Mike. 
 Daphne. 
 Tim. 
 What are we doing here? 
 I don't like my phone ringing at the break of dawn, but Gary here says, "Wake up. 
 "Get on out here because it looks like all that Friday night talk over the years, you know, hey, you think that, uh, maybe given certain details, the Painter family knew more about the murders than they're letting on? Looks like they were true because Mike Painter just confessed to one of them." 
 Well, Mike, we're gonna have a little chat that's long overdue because, I'll be honest, I always thought your family had something to do with it. 
 Daphne : We just want to talk, Mike. 
 Okay. I'm happy to talk. 
 Just untie me. 
 You can talk like that. 
 Just tell the truth, Mike. 
 Okay, this is the truth. 
 28 years ago, somebody made a TV show called "Candle Cove" and broadcast it on a dead channel. 
 It influenced the kids who saw it, and before it was over five of those kids were dead. 
 You killed your brother Eddie. 
 You killed your brother, Mike, then you left Iron Hill. 
 The murders stopped. The disappearances stopped. 
 Then 28 years later, you come back, everything starts again, right away. 
 You're looking in the right direction, but you're making the wrong connection. 
 So are you telling me that my kids wouldn't be in the hospital if you hadn't come back? 
 I want to show you something. 
 Jacob Booth. 
 Mrs. Booth's only son. 
 Sadie Williams. 
 My cousin. 
 She taught me how to kiss. 
 Carl Cutter. The cut-up. 
 My brother Gene. 
 Tim. 
 That's what we're doing here, Mike. 
 Me and Tim are not cops right now. 
 We're all just people who lost people, and before you go into the system, we want to know exactly what you did and why you did it. 
 Where's your brother, Fainter? 
 Where's yours? 
 Go home, dickless wonder. 
 Want me to break your fingers, too? 
 Want to see something cool? 
 Me and Eddie found it. 
 Figured you would know what to do. 
 Bullshit. 
 It's worth money, but okay. 
 Where you going, Mike? 
 The Crow's Nest. 
 [tense music] 
 Gary, are you home? 
 [door shuts] 
 Are you here? Gary? 
 I'm gonna drive over to Tim's. 
 Gary? 
 Why don't you two stay here in case Gary comes back? 
 Tim : I still have dreams about my brother. 
 And the look on my parents' faces when we heard that he was dead. 
 I stopped eating. 
 Got so thin I almost died. 
 That's the worst thing about losing someone, Mike. 
 It's not knowing how or why. 
 They wouldn't even tell me what really happened to Gene, but I found out, Mike. 
 Sure, he was a bully, and we were redneck idiots, but he looked out for me. 
 He didn't deserve to die with his neck broke and his teeth gone. 
 I just dream about "Candle Cove." 
 That's because it's still there, all the time, working on us. 
 What about you, Gary? Tim? 
 You guys dream about it? 
 Because I do. 
 For 30 years, I've been dreaming about it. 
 Always there, behind everything. 
 We all saw it. It did something to us. 
 "Candle Cove" was on TV the same time as the murders. 
 That's the only connection. 
 I'm telling you, you're wrong. 
 The bottom line is, you killed my brother. 
 You killed Eddie, and you killed Sadie. 
 No, I didn't. 
 You killed Jacob. You killed Carl. 
 Come on. 
 And now you're back in town here. 
 Mike, what are you gonna do? 
 We shouldn't have done this. 
 You gonna kill some more children? 
 Come on, Mike, it felt pretty good to tell you mom about Eddie, right? 
 You know what? 
 Now that I think about it, I think that we've had just about enough talk. 
 Maybe it's time for some justice instead of talk! 
 No, no, no, no, Tim! 
 I didn't have a choice! 
 How are those fingers feeling? 
 You like "Candle Cove," Gene? 
 I don't watch that retard show. 
 Don't lie. I know you do. 
 You can't lie to the Skin-Taker.

 Stop.

 H-hey, get back here! 
 What? 
 Marla. 
 Why did Gary arrest Mike? 
 Mike... did something unforgivable. 
 You mean you can't forgive him? 
 The last couple of years, Mike and I started emailing. 
 Texts. 
 Like that. 
 At first, it was once in a while. 
 Then more. 
 And then every day. 
 It became... important to me. 
 Did Gary know? 
 I didn't think so. 
 Then Mike went quiet on me. 
 Like he dropped off the face of the Earth. 
 So I deleted everything. 
 Every last email. 
 It's been hard this year. 
 Gary had his hopes set on this... this property in the countryside. 
 And when that fell apart, he just got so... 
 It's not here. 
 What? 
 I know where Gary took Mike. 
 Gary : TV shows don't kill people, Mike. 
 Gary, think about your daughter. 
 She saw the show and one day later she tries to kill Dane... 
 No, she talked to you. 
 No. No. No. 
 You got it... no.

 Just tell them. 
 Cut the therapy sh1t. 
 He's right. 
 We knew it was connected somehow. 
 No. No, we don't know anything like that at all. 
 Gary, we have to find whoever made that show. 
 I saw it that day at the Crow's Nest. 
 Listen, Daphne, in the dreams, what do you see? 
 A face that's just a skull? 
 The white eyes? You remember? 
 In the show. They called it Jawbone. 
 But in the dreams... 
 Okay. In the dreams? 
 It has a different name. 
 Well, I saw it that day. 
 A person dressed as Jawbone. 
 And whoever this person is, he's still out there right now. 
 Okay, even if there is some person out there, Mike... 
 What the hell is wrong with you, huh? 
 Tim... 
 This all points back to him. 
 This is not about a goddamn puppet show. 
 It was just a show that aired on TV then. 
 His mom sends him away and the murders stop. 
 He killed those kids. 
 I didn't. 
 Tim. 
 He killed Gene, and maybe, just maybe, his mother helped cover it up. 
 Okay, look, even if he's lying... 
 Tim. we need to look at this, we need to look in the woods and just see what's going on with what he's talking about. 
 What are you doing, Tim? 
 No, no, no. Tim, what are you doing? 
 This is going a little too far, Tim. 
 We're done here, all right? 
 Tim, Tim. 
 We're done. 
 I'm gonna take him in. Give him a trial by jury. 
 This is it. 
 He can have a trial by jury right now. 
 Okay, Tim.
