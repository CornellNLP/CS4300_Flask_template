 You put him in the goddamn swamp?! 
 He can't hurt anyone from in there. 
 You lied, Jesse. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You still lied. 
 Well, you lied, too. 
 When? 
 "When?" You want a list? 
 How about, as a for instance, when you got married? 
 You said you understood about that! 
 I do understand, but now I need you to understand me.

 Hoover. 
 Flufferman. 
 It's featherstone, sir. 
 He and his girlfriend are driving back from the swamps now. 
 Having her find the weapons was a good idea. 
 So, she saw the empty truck and she was...? 
 Very unhappy. 
 Good. 
 That's a start. 
 Question, sir? 
 All this seems like a lot of trouble. 
 Can't we just kill custer? 
 I'm not a homosexual. 
 Oh. 
 No. 
 Of course not, sir. 
 You're the pinnacle of masculinity. 
 No one would ever question... 
 What did you do this time? 
 I apologize. 
 Sir, I assumed that  when you requested prostitutes, that... 
 Should I get you a refund? 
 You're missing the point, hoover. 
 The tarp, then, sir? 
 Yes, as much as I would enjoy  seeing your insides spread out before me  like a buffet breakfast in a five-star hotel,  my time with those rough-handed hooligans  gave me a new... 
 Perspective on things. 
 The tarp will have to wait. 
 For what's to come, I need you both alive. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 What's to come, sir? 
 The Messiah is a moron. 
 I understand you may find this disappointing  since you've devoted your entire lives to serving him,  but I've seen monkeys in heat with more grace and dignity. 
 But not to worry. 
 I'm plotting a coup. 
 My plan is to replace the moron with Jesse custer  and bring real order and control to the world. 
 I'd like you both to join me. 
 What do you say? 
 The Messiah is a moron? 
 Uh, brilliant, sir. 
 I like it a lot. 
 And no doubt, custer has excellent qualifications,  but may I ask, has he agreed to this plan? 
 Not yet, but he will. 
 He doesn't know it yet, but I have what he wants. 
 So considering the alternative is summary execution,  I assume you both are with me. 
 Absolutely, sir. 
 Good. 
 Go. 
 Yes? 
 I'm sorry about the... 
 the... 
 T-the men. 
 I'll have to live with that memory  for the rest of my life. 
 About my new assignment, sir, I have some trepidations. 
 Go on. 
 Well, maybe I'm being tough on myself,  but I'm just not, uh...
