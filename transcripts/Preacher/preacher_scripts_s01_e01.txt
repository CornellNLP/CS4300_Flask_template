 But for Coach Tom Landry... [Clears throat] He looked down at that player and he looked up, into one other's eyes, and he frowned. He said... "Get off... Get off your backside." [Chuckles] Stand up and run." And that player looked at him, and he did.

What's the matter with you, shooting a gun at church? Ted : I had to figure out a whole new TV schedule, you know, for supper. [Clears throat] You know, 'cause I like to eat, and, I mean, this is the time that she gave me for dinner, right? When I was growing up, 6:00 is dinnertime, and she knows that. She knows. So... Why not just open your heart? Be honest with her. Tell your mom to call you back after you've eaten. I mean, what does it matter to her what kind of cheese I have on my sandwich? It's up to me what I like. Yeah, I... I make the choices... I'm sorry to cut this short, Ted. I need a word with him. I like Swiss cheese. Read my mind, kid. Don't tell me you're here to bitch about the air-conditionin'. Broken-down piece of junk. It's about my dad. I don't like him. Why don't you like him? 'Cause he's mean. Not to me. I mean... he is, but you know, mostly... [Indistinct conversation] He's mean to your mom. So you want me to talk to someone? Talkin' won't help. Well, you're hangin' there like a shirt on a hook, so you got somethin' in mind. Words, kid. What do you want? I want you to hurt him. You know, it's a sin just to ask me that. I know, but he sins, too. He sins worse, and he's got it comin'. [Laughs] Well, in that case... Don't laugh. People said before you came back here... before you were a preacher... you did things. ♪ ♪ So, bring me a beer and maybe I'll do some of those things to your daddy. ♪ ♪ How hurt you want him? How far do I go? One punch? Two? Problem is, your daddy's a big fella. Imagine a couple punches just gonna make him mad. He's gonna fight back. Then his buddies are gonna want to help out. I'll need to defend myself. Things will escalate. That's what these things do. They escalate. And violence... makes violence. It makes nothing much at all. Is that what you want, kid?

Unveiling is tonight, so come on down to City Hall and give Annville's adorable, politically correct new mascot a big ol' West Texas hello.

Miles got punched by a girl! You punched me! You punched me! Can't do it. [Grunts] I told them. You cannot just expunge a beloved cultural figure like that and not expect it to go over like sh1t on cold biscuit. I imagine there's worse things that could happen. Hmm. Considerin' I just read the Japanese let a fellow marry his own pillow, I tend to agree with you. Much worse is on its way. Pillows? That's a slippery slope. Indeed it is. Indeed. Eugene told me that h-he left you some messages? Yep. Yep, I owe him a call. Look, I don't... I don't give a damn one way or the other. He was askin' about you, so I was wonderin' if you could find the time to swing by? Tomorrow night? That work? Tomorrow. [Indistinct shouting] Man : Get him! You got him, Donnie? [Laughter] Hold him down! Sheriff? I can't say how... but I heard Donnie there... might be layin' hands on his wife. I figured you might want to talk to her. I'll listen to a formal complaint should the victim come forward. Well, that's unlikely, ain't it? These kinds of situations? She's probably scared to. I will listen to a formal complaint. 'Course. You don't want to lose the wife-beatin', squirrel-murderin' redneck vote. I imagine that's a key demographic for you. You know, Preacher, when I heard that you was comin' back here to your daddy's... I must confess to a portion of unease on it. But you've been real quiet, haven't you? I mean, some folks say too quiet, but not me. No siree bob. I say let's just let that continue.

Look, Dave. Listen to me now. To know what I'm talkin' about, you've had to have the kind of night that lands you in the hospital tryin' to figure out what the Spanish word is for "ass hamster," for goodness' sake. [Laughter] I'm serious. Where's the bath? Is it down there, is it? Through the door. Time to make a manky, gentlemen. Listen... hamster del culo. Write it down. I'm serious. He's serious. [Laughter] [Sighs] ♪ ♪ [Laughter] [Laughter] [Chatter] I'd steer clear of the head a day or three there, gents. I just lost an argument with some kobe sliders. Where's that giggle gun? I'm starting to feel me toes again here. Come on, then. [Laughter] Isn't that funny there? I really thought that T.J. was south of Vegas. So, I might be wonderin' why we're headin' toward the sun there, boy. ♪ ♪ Yeah, but what do I know? I'm just another shit-faced Irishman, am I not? Am I not just that?

I-I... Like, it's the same old story. It's always my fault, like I'm making her wear a colostomy bag. Oh, my God. I'm trying to eat here. Be honest with her, Ted. Open your heart, tell her everything you're tellin' me. Okay. I'll try that. But I will call you later. Okay. Great. So, I just seated two eight tops. I got eyes, Gary. I'm just finishin' up. Okay? Walter called in sick. Again. Maybe I should go check on him. It's kind of your job, ain't it? [Laughs] Look at this church! Look at this. A Starbucks in the lobby? Since when did people require Frappuccinos to come to church? How are our collection numbers? You know, good. Same as last week. Mm. Maybe a little less. Mayor. Preacher. Emily. Some meetin', huh?

Why are you like that to him? Three years since Kevin passed. No shame in makin' yourself available. [Chuckles] I'm completely available. Not completely like a... you know.

So, what is it you wanted to see me about? I don't know about that. If you want to be there, you should be. Why do you say that? What you did was wrong. But are you sorry about it? Then He forgives you. No. No matter what you've done... if you need Him, He has to be there for you. That's the whole point. God doesn't hold grudges.

What's the matter with you? Just one big joke with a darkened hat and some stickers. [Laughs] So, where am I then, eh? A bar. No, I know it's a bar. I meant to say what's the location? You know, the state, county, or town or somethin'? Or maybe there's a phone box handy, down by the loo, perhaps? I'm tryin' to understand a word you're sayin', pal. Never mind, Padre. As you were. [Rock music playing] Preacher! Lieutenant! How'd it go? We win this time? Nice try. And it's General. [Patrons gasping] Talk to my wife without talkin' to me first?

I had to jump out of a plane 30,000 feet. Man : I'll look into it. Meantime, stay out of trouble. Get rid of your credit cards, hold up, and lay low. Oh, I'm layin' low, all right. Now, listen, I need you to wire me some... [Dial tone] Oh, come on. You... Donnie : The moral of this sad-ass story is don't believe what you hear. [Laughs] Hey. I know the little snitch who told you, too. Looks like I got another whoopin' to attend to. Don't touch him. What did you say? The boy. Don't touch him. [Chuckles] Or... what would happen? Donnie... don't do this. No, no, no, no, no, no. You... You... You got me curious now. Let's just say, for the sake of argument, that, uh, that I don't listen. What then, huh? You'd hear a noise. Oh. Ooh, golly gee. Oh, a noise? A high-pitched, kind of... bunny-in-a-bear-trap sound. You'll know it when it comes. 'Cause you're the one who will be making it. That's some scary stuff right there.

I can't even afford to fix the damn air-conditionin'. Sounds like the first verse of the worst country song ever written, man. [Chuckles] She was right about one thing. I never should have come back here. She was right about that. Of course she was right about that. It's bloody Annville, Texas. What's a guy like you doing back in a place like this, huh? Finally figured out where you are, huh? Well, I'm not great with directions, actually. Yeah, I'm sensin' that. Well, yeah, but we're not talkin' about me, are we? We're wonderin' about you. Tell me about yourself. Come on, now. I came back to... [Scoffs] Years ago, I made a promise. I broke it. I broke it 1,000 times. Yeah, well, you know, promises... they're very nasty little things. I try to steer clear of 'em as best that I can. No, no. That's wrong. Why? Promises matter. It's the currency of faith. Oh, look... no offense, Padre, but in my view, the world would be a much better place if all you "faith" types just called it a day and maybe... Without faith, we'd still be hitting each other with dinosaur bones. The bloody hell do dinosaur... Have you even seen the news lately? 'Cause we're hitting each other with a lot worse things than bones, boyo. No, seriously. Listen to me now. Misery loves company, does it not? It's the hope that sets men at one another's throats here. Take me for example, right? I have zero hope in this world, mate. And I'm bloody fantastic. Really, I am.

You... [Clears throat] You deserve... You deserve a good preacher. You deserve a good preacher, and... and that's what you're gonna get. As of today... as of right now, I'm going to fight. I'm going to do what all good preachers have done since the Serpent and Man's Fall... pray for the sinner. Offer peace to the restless. Avenge the innocent. Please, guys. Please, stop! Ow! Cool the wrathful. Welcome those who are lost. And last but not least... speak forth the Word of God. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. Be brave. Tell her the truth. Open your heart. [Sighs] Tell her the truth. [Inhales deeply] Ted! What are you doing here? Mom... I would really appreciate if you would stop calling me at all hours to criticize me. I'm not perfect. I know at times I've been a disappointment to you, but I am your only son, and if you would treat me with some kindness and consideration, it would make me so happy. What are you talking about? Well, now, I have to... open my heart to you. Aah! [Groaning] Aah! Aaah! [Gasps] [Crowd gasping] Aaah! [Crying] For all this, I am responsible. I am that preacher. This is my answer. This is why I've come home. To save you. [Birds chirping] ♪ ♪ It's here. [Son of Dave's "Voodoo Doll" plays] ♪ You made my life a living hell ♪
