 announcer : Previously, on "Preacher..." 
 Donnie, want did you do? 
 We have a job for you. 
 (gun firing) 
 We want you to kill the preacher. 
 I'm gonna bring God to this church. 
 Cassidy : It's a direct line to Heaven's throne. 
 I need angel hands, otherwise it won't work. 
 All right, Carlos... 
 This is justice. 
 (snarling) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Where's Eugene? 
 Wanna see you Sunday.

Why don't you come down to the All Saints' Church this Sunday, and see for yourself what's what? In not unrelated news, local freak Eugene Root remains missing, and Preacher Custer continues to be sought by law enforcement. Hey, Mabel!

Where's Jesse? [Door opens] Hey, Tulip. What are you doing here? Door was open, idiot. Shut up. Cassidy : It's like, one look and you're done, she's burned herself into your brain, that fast. Those eyes, that smile. Man : For me, it's a big, fluffy ass. Ah. Yeah, well, whatever floats your boat. All right, Larry. Prairie Dog dropped the charges. You're good to go. Hey. Listen. I know you're hurting, but maybe you and Pedro just take a break, leave it up on Brokeback Mountain for now. All right? Off you go. [Keys rattle] Where is he? Like I told your guys, I have no idea. Past few days, me and Padre been laying low, hanging out at the whorehouse, where you got me and... Not Custer. Come Sunday, I know where to find him. I meant Eugene. What'd Preacher do with him? Sheriff... you're gonna have to trust me on this one. You don't want to know. Don't I, though? I see that you are no stranger to our criminal-justice system. Uh-oh. Manila folder time. Mm-hmm. Assault and battery in Las Vegas. Let... let me just say I... I... do you know what? I told 'em right from the get go, I don't... I don't like magicians, okay. Drunk and disorderly in Denver. Lewd and lascivious in Nashville. [Laughs] New York City, attempted murder. Oh, right. I sort of lost my head a bit there. Crime of passion. Judging from this, you're a very passionate man, Mr. Cassidy. What catches my eye, though, are the dates of your arrests. 1961. 1950. 1940. 1922. And so on and so forth. [Toilet lid slams] And yet, I look so young. [Unzips] Everybody says that. [Urinating] But thank you. Yeah. I noticed the sunglasses. I noticed the... goofy hats. I just wrote it down to you being an asshole. [Chuckles] Ha. No, Sheriff. I'm not an asshole. [Zips] I'm the asshole. [Screams] [Gunshot rings out] [Groaning] [Groaning continues] This is medicine for you. At least, that's... that's what I read on the Internet. Come on, vampire. It's gonna be a long night. Donnie : I've been washed clean. I had Preacher dead-to-rights in that church. Could've killed him and been a hero for it, too. But I stopped myself. I remembered he'd been merciful with me before. You remember when... when we was in the men's room together that night? Uh-huh. He could've killed me that night, but he didn't do it. Preacher was merciful. Yeah, so I was merciful, too. So then when I heard he was on the run, I told him he could hide out here. 'Cause Preacher saved me. He showed me that I... I'm not a murderer. He showed me that I'm not the bad guy. [Tulip clears throat] And, um, he showed you all this in a gas station men's room, huh? Lose the attitude, okay? It takes a real man to let God in his heart. We're gonna go grab a smoke, okay? I come back to the whole town going crazy over God showing up, now Donnie Schenck, droolin' and acting like you're the Dalai Lama? What the hell's going on, Jesse? I'll bring you up to speed. First, you came back for me. Yeah, well, after that phone message, how could I resist? [Deep voice] "Hi, Tulip, um, I... I just ate pancakes." [Sighs] I'm sorry, Tulip. You should be. Do something for me, Jesse? Anything. Yeah? 'Cause, um... I mean, it's bad. Like, really bad. Mmm. I mean, nasty. [Laughs] Mm-hmm. Anything, right? Whatever you want. [Unlocks trunk] Kill him. Well, I had to step to him and say, "Listen, my ma drives me crazy sometimes, too, but that's your madre, brah. You got to respect her like you gots to respect all women." It's so nice to hear a man talk like that. I mean, I'm not... I'm not trying to be like... I'm just saying, in the end, you, me, our moms, we're all just people. Well, I better get back to work. Yeah, yeah, me, too. You know, uh, I'll bring those in for you. Okay. Thanks, Carlos. Yeah. Hey, Jennifer? You like Chinese food? Not... really. Puta. Jesse :  We like Chinese food. [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. 'Sup? Poor Carlos. Poor Carlos. Chinese food would be good, though. Yep. And a nice, cold beer. Unh-unh. You can't have beer. Says who? I'm not having beer, and neither are you. All right. Whiskey it is. Asswipe. Oh, my God. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What is it, Jesse? Show me. I'll show you. I'll show you, big time. What the he...? No. Oh, yeah. That is... that's wrong. Uh-huh. Come on. It's like "Lady and the Tramp," except with our butts. Jesse Custer, do not come near me with that thing. I swear to God. [Laughs] Oh, you know you want it. You know. Come on. Put it away! [Chuckles] Come on, just... Real professional, you two. Oh, give us a break. Hey, Carlos. I mean, we are just people. [Laughter] Real smooth, Carlos. Bite me. How long to the vault? I'd say... eight, nine minutes. [Bags zipping] These are ready to go. Fun's over, Custer. Now the pain begins... [Keys jingle] [Unlocks trunk] [Keys jingle] [Splash] Aw, come on. [Squish] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Sighs] Tulip :  [Laughs] So help me God, I will beat you with this camera. Jesse : Don't be such a baby. Just try it. You might like it. I mean it. It's not funny. Then why are you laughing? I'm laughing at what an asshole you are. Asshole? [Speaking indistinctly] I said stop... [Whimpering] Ow! Ah-ha. See? You bit me. That's cheating. [Indistinct conversation continues] [Whimpers] Let's see if there's Chinese food in prison. ♪ ♪ [Gunshot rings out] [Alarm sounding] [Tires screeching] No! [Gasping] What? What is it? [Sirens wailing] The baby. The baby. [Alarm, sirens continue] Why? Why? You were happy. I... [Breathing shakily] ♪ ♪ 
♪ Honey, won't you listen, why don't you... ♪ Man : French vanilla, I remember. I don't need to write it down, 'cause it's been your blessed favorite in all the 39 years we've been married. But, uh, maybe after your bubble bath, we could... get a little frisky? No, I didn't say dirty, I said frisky. You know, like that time that you wore that... No? All right, okay. Never mind. Uh, it... it was just a thought. [Sighs] Uh, hush, now. No, I'm happy no matter what we do. As long as it's together. Yeah, a movie sounds great. Okay. Yeah. I can see you there, yeah? [Grunting] [Sighs] [Bullet clatters] [Paper cup crinkles] You about a tough son of a bitch. Well, you get used to it. Thanks. [Bullet rattles] Where is Eugene? Okay. All right, I... I can tell you this. The good news is he's alive. Well, maybe. Mind you, that may also be the bad news, as well. Honestly, it was an accident. You know, Jesse wouldn't... he wouldn't hurt a kid, not on purpose, he wouldn't. Oh, high praise, indeed. [Gun clicks] This world... vampires... government agents... psychopathic preachers... it's all an unmitigated monster swamp. That's true. Plonkers and gobshites. As far as the eye can see. [Sniffs] Still, nobody's perfect, you know? I mean, you know [laughs] I'm a dark-hearted piece of shite. That's true. The manila folder never lies. And what about you... Sheriff? All this. Last I checked, this kinda questioning was illegal. Not in Texas. [Gun cocks] Not when a man's looking for his son. Are you really looking for him, though, is what I'm wondering? Just come on, be honest with me now, right. Could there not be... like a teeny-tiny part of you that'd be happy if he was just gone? Eugene's a good boy. I know. I know that. But he's sort of annoyingly good, though. Am I right? Always talking, asking his bloody questions, and that face, I just... I honestly... I don't know how you do it. Having to wake up to that giant, puckered arseface staring at you across the breakfast table day after day... [Gunshots ring out] [Groaning] You'll see. This just proves my point exactly. Nobody's perfect. [Door unlocks] You can go. Ahh. Good. I got to be someplace. We will burn in Hell. You know what Hell is to me? Someone screwing us and us not screwing 'em back. No, no, no, that is not Hell. It will not... [muffled] make a difference, you understand? We have to lead him to God. Oh, yeah, great idea. [Sighs] They're gonna wake up Chris. Hmm? [Muffled indistinct conversation] [Sighs] Never mind. Jesse : It won't make a difference! We have to lead him to God! Tulip : Yeah, much better plan. Let's use some guy's hand to call down heaven on a phone and let some beardy white guy decide. We don't know he's white. Well, he'd better be, or else he'll have even more explaining to do! Oh, so God's a racist, too, now, as well? Is that what you're saying? I'm saying Carlos took everything from us, Jesse! 'Cause he was jealous! Out of spite! Eye for an eye! And you know what that means?! That means we get to kill him! No matter what we do, that baby ain't never coming back! I know! And someone's got to pay! [Rustling, door closes] [Thud] [Rattling] What are you doing, Jesse? I'm going to Hell anyway. [Keys rattle] [Whimpering] [Muttering] No, no, no, please. Please don't. That's it, scoot you over there. [Whimpering] [Gun cocks] No! No! [Crying] What are you doing? What's it look like? Jesse. [Crying] What's wrong? That is the most beautiful thing anyone's ever done for me. An eye for an eye. You were right. No. You were right. It wouldn't make a difference. Probably not. [Carlos crying continues] It'll feel good, though. St-Stop. Jesse. You're gonna mess my car. No, I'm not. Trash bag will collect the brains. Yeah, but there's... there's still gonna be splatter, and the... the bullet's gonna crack my axle. No, no, no, it won't, not if I aim here. [Screams] I said no, Jesse. Are you changing your mind? It was the thought, okay? That's what counts. [Whimpering continues] Huh. So what are we gonna do with him?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks for coming out, y'all. Ooh, boy, what a turnout. Yeah, well, it is a big day. Today, we answer mankind's most pressing question, namely... what the hell's going on? Now, Preacher Custer here argues, not only is there a God, he's going to call him down right into this room and we're all gonna talk to him. Ain't that right, Preacher Custer? Something like that. What I say, my position in all of this is, that Preacher Custer, like every single preacher, priest, and holy man since the dawn of time, is full of sh1t. The only true God... the only real God... is the God of Meat. Well, anyway, whoever's right, you know, gets the church, so, uh, enough with all the preamble-lizing. Let's get started, shall we? Uh, Preacher Custer? Show us God. ♪♪ [Plastic crinkles] Angel hands. Yeah? [Whirring, beep] [Whirring] [Buzzer, click] [Whirring] [Indistinct murmuring] [Buzzer] [Buzzer] [Buzzer] [Whirring, beep] Man : Just shoot its dick off.

Jesse : It's all right. Don't panic. It's okay. Everyone relax. It's all right. [Murmuring stops] Nothing to be afraid of. [Bang] [Crowd screaming] [Indistinct murmuring] God : [Echoing] Look upon me! I am the Alpha and the Omega and the bright morning star. I am the Lord, your God. My children, why have you called me? [Indistinct murmuring] Um... God, forgive us. We... I called you 'cause we all have questions. Questions... for me? Respectfully... we would like to know... How dare you question your God! [Rumbling] How dare you! [Baby crying] No! How dare you! You can't shout at us like that! We're the ones should be screaming, you sick, stuck-up... Tulip! [Crying continues] And you made a baby cry. I told you he was a white guy. [Chuckles] "I am," is the only answer you need! No, that is not good enough! Look at us down here. Hearts full of greed, hate and doubt. Sin is winning and you're losing! So, if we are your children, why don't you act like a father? Take some time out of your busy schedule and answer some goddamn questions. [Laughing hysterically] [Clapping hands] Balls. Very well. What are your questions? [Indistinct murmuring] Why do bad things happen to good people? Ah, yes. You see, when I created humanity, I wanted you to have everything. Joy, hope, love, but also pain... everything that makes you a person. Do you understand? Yeah. Good. But why? You had your turn! My turn! Sit down! Man : What did you do to the dinosaurs?! Man #2 : What's Heaven like? [All yelling questions] You know one time, I took quite a bit of angel dust and then I drank an eight-pack of Red Bull, and went to a Bieber concert. Children, my children. Honestly, this is crazier than that. [Laughs] Hey! Hey, you! My family, my baby girl, my little Lucy Loo! What about her? Is she there... with you? Yes. She is here. [Indistinct murmuring] What about you, Preacher? You must have a question. I guess I got lots of 'em. But if I had just one... I've been wondering for a long time now... what's your plan for me? To be a shepherd to your flock. To tend to them and the church. But I failed at that. So why did you give me this power if... if I can't use it to save them? You have not failed, my son. You brought them to me and so they are saved. [Indistinct murmuring] Really? Even Eugene? Yes. Even him. You are all saved! [Cheers and applause] It's amazing, Jesse. You did it. [Cheers and applause continue] But I sent him to Hell! [Cheers and applause stop] And... how did you do that, my son? With the power. With Genesis. Uhh... uhh... Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Of course. And who else has a question? Can I get my dick back on?! [Laughter] [Laughing] [Laughter stops] Excuse me. [Chuckles] I have one last question. You're not God, are you? I am the Alpha and the Omega. No, you're not. I am the bright morning star. I just saw you picking your nose. No, my son, I was scratching it. You're an imposter. I am the Lord, your God! You're not God. Yes, I am! Jesus. Where is God? [Rumbling] I am the Resurrection! [Wind howling] I am the way and the truth! [Echoing] Where is God?! I... Uh, oh. I don't know. Where is he?
