 announcer : Previously on “Preacher…” 
 You have to go. Two days. Three at most. 
 The Preacher comes to us, we remove what's inside of him and take it back with us. 
 You should meet them. 
 It'd be a hell of a partnership. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I thought you were this other guy. 
 I'm so sorry! 
 Tried to kill himself. 
 Shotgun. 
 If they find out that we're down here without permission? 
 Serve God. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Horse neighs in distance] 
 It's just near the bank on the left. 
 You can't miss it. 
 They got some good ice cream there, too, son. 
 [Chuckles] Much obliged, sir. 
 [Bell dings] 
 Have it ready for you tomorrow. 
 Tonight. 
 Morning, first thing... It's the best I can do.

 $100 for a brave, $50 for a squaw, and $10 for a child. 
 Comanche warrior. 
 This ain't Injun. This is Mexican. 
 Injun scalps ain't near so greasy. 
 Mexican's half-price. 
 Hey! Take it to the back. 
 I need a room. 
 Whore room or sleep room? 
 Sleep room. 
 Only got whore rooms. 
 Or a free chair. 
 Comes with a $5 bottle of whiskey. 
 [Music continues] 
 Macready : This one's for you since you wasn't in church on Sunday, all right? 
 So Noah, now, left that ark after 40 days and 40 nights. 
 We all know that. 
 And God asked unto him, he said, "Noah, now, why is it you release all the other animals, but yet you refuse to release that rooster from your grasp?" 
 And Noah said unto God, "After 40 long nights on that ark, forgive me, O Lord, but I cannot stop stroking my cock." 
 [Laughter] 
 Amen? Can I get an "amen," boys? 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Billy : Mom, no. 
 [Laughter] 
 Man : Make the kid watch. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Woman screams] 
 [Laughter continues] 
 Macready : I know you. 
 I do. 
 Where was it again? 
 Woman : Come on, Preacher. 
 Man #2 : Down some Red Eye with us. We're still drinking. 
 All right.

I knew that was a bad idea. He'll be fine. [Sighs] I'm worried about the van, not Cassidy. Why worry at all? Jesse, what's going on? What do you mean? Quincannon on Sunday... What was that? Well, you were there. What'd it look like? I don't know what it looked like. Preacher, powerful service the other day. We're all talkin' about it. Thank you. See? Hmm. The people have spoken. Did you know Quincannon was gonna be there? Well, I didn't know... but I guessed. Odin Quincannon in church? How could you guess that? [Sighs] I made him a bet. [Bell dings] What? I bet him if he wasn't a Christian by the end of the service, he could have the church. Are you insane?! You bet your father's church? It's my church now. Besides, you said so yourself... I have a gift. How could I lose? Woman : Sorry to bother you, Preacher, but we're ranking the gospels. Some of us say Mark is the best by far. I say, "No way. Gotta be John." Help us out and break the tie? Well, that's a little like asking me to choose my favorite ice cream. [Laughter] Come. Sit with us. Can we finish this later? Jesse. This doesn't feel like you. It's not me. It's God. I think the gospel you like really depends on the mood you're in. To me, you can't go wrong with John. [Birds chirping] [Gulps] All right. Well, go on, then. Ask me. Fangs? No. Turn into a bat? No. Sleep in a coffin? Not if I can help it. Afraid of the cross? It's a 2,000-year-old symbol of hypocrisy, slavery, and oppression. But it won't burn me face off. Silver bullets? That's a werewolf. Sunshine. Oh, yeah. That's legit. You'd die? The invention of sunscreen... that was a nice bonus. But I just... I've got to be careful. I can't just go wandering out. Got to bundle up... sleeves, hat, shades, and that. Otherwise, it's trouble. You kill people? Not if they don't deserve it. But you drink blood? Yeah. Helps me heal. All things bein' equal, I'd rather have single malt. So, you never, like, crave human blood. No. Not really. Hmm. Hmm. You can leave now. [Door opens, closes] [Snoring] Uh, listen, before I go, a couple of things... One, I'm lookin' for some drugs, possibly something in the opiate family. Is there a direction you might point me in? That's a "no." That's all right. All right, question two... Don't know where there's a hardware store nearby, do you... Any chance? There's one just outta town. Take Main to Route 14. Opposite the strip club. I'll find that. Yeah. This is a nice place you got yourself here. I see Linoleum's hip again. [Clattering] As a bonus, there's an old feller passed out in the back. [Chuckles] So, the other night, huh? Crazy, eh? It's quite the moment for... There was no moment. Well, you kissed me. I thought you were dying. Yeah, all right. Maybe so. Look, I don't know exactly what's happenin' here, I don't know what to call it,  but I do know that I'm too old to be playing games, so... I-I've fallen for yeh, Tulip. [Laughs] I have. I've fallen hard. Really? Yep. I have a boyfriend. What, the old feller passed out in the back? That's my uncle! Well, I'm just getting up to speed. So, where's this boyfriend, then, eh? He's at his job. At the whorehouse? [Clatters] He doesn't work at the whorehouse. Does he know you work at the whorehouse? I don't work at the whorehouse. And I don't give a sh1t what he thinks. Yeah, right. Who cares? So, you and this boyfriend, you gonna get married... white picket fence? Is he coming home soon? I'd love to meet him. He doesn't live here. I don't live here. I sleep here sometimes. I hang at the whorehouse. And I'm just waiting for this asshole to ditch his job so we can both get outta this shithole. So when are you and this asshole going to leave? I don't know. God, you ask a lot of questions. So, hang on a minute. Wait. You're waiting on him to leave, only you don't know when it's gonna be? Soon, okay?! When he gets sick of his stupid job, we're leaving town, and we're gonna go get someone. Get who? This guy. He screwed us. Carlos. [Screams] [Tires screech] We lost everything 'cause of him. Took two years to track him down. Now I have. Now I found him. Alls that's left to do is go over there and get him, tie him to a table, cut his freakin' balls off, and, over and over, stab him in the face with a screwdriver. And your boyfriend said "no" to this? Do not wind me up, asshole. No, no, no. I'm not takin' the piss. This feller, this Carlos, he took everything you ever had, he betrayed you, he wronged you, stole your entire future, and you, you finally found him and he still won't go? He's still here? I don't know. Maybe this boyfriend isn't the man you thought he was. ♪ ♪ [Electricity crackling, bell dings] ♪ ♪ Betsy : Feeling better? It's moved into my chest. One more day? Yeah, one more day. [Pills rattling] Hon... you got to go to work. You're Odin Quincannon's right-hand man. He relies on you. You've won a lot of bar fights in your time. Sooner or later, we all get a whuppin'... no shame in it. The South will rise again. All them years I was a knocker, watchin' those cows wind their way through the maze, turnin', turnin', marchin' into the kill floor. But just at the last second, at the very last second, 'fore they get the bolt and drop, they get a look in their eyes, 'cause they know what's comin' and they're realizin'... all the "don't wanna" in the world is not gonna change this, 'cause they're "gonna." [Sighs] Ugh. Do you remember Russell in accounting, always givin' me the eye? [Sighs] If you don't get outta bed right this second, I'm gonna go in there, take him into a bathroom stall, and screw his brains out. [Door slams] [Telephone ringing] ♪ ♪ [Ringing continues] "Hello. It's me." The "Hello" is crucial, remember? Sets the tone. Again. [Ringing continues] "Hello. It's me... Fiore. Just wanted to let everyone know we're on top of the situation. There was a slight..." "A massive security breach." "A slight massive security breach..." Just "massive." "Just massive security breach, but everything's under control, and we'll be back very soon, so... [Ringing continues] don't worry." I messed up the middle bit. [Sighs] We get this wrong, it'll be the end of us, both of us. I know. Remember, you're the sweet one. They love you up there. Try again. [Ringing continues] "Hello. It's me... Fiore." [Ringing continues] [Door opens] [Keys jingling] [Bag unzips] [Humming] Huh... [Pants unzip] [Toilet seat clanks] [Urinating] [Footsteps approaching] [Urinating stops] ♪ ♪ Where is he? Flavour Station. [Urinating resumes] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Man : Shut up. [Laughter] [Indistinct talking] [Slurps] Cut up my food? Why? [Utensils scraping] It's fine, Eugene. [Scraping continues] Stop it! If you really want to help, maybe you should do like they said and go ahead and finish the goddamn job! [Dramatic music plays] [Chair scrapes, floorboards creaking] [Clattering] Quincannon : I've been up all night thinking about the mistakes I've made in my life. Right? I've been selfish. I've been shortsighted. Long time ago, I slipped into despair and I lost my way. Since then, I haven't been my best self. But, now, that's no excuse, because now it's high time to make amends. I'm happy to hear it. And you, Mr. Mayor, you really raked me over the coals. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. But... But you were right. This town is in trouble. It needs help. Now, I-I'm sorry I wasn't able to hear that at the time. I got defensive, I pulled my pants down, and... I reacted. No, I-it's fine. I need a new briefcase anyway. It was childish. I meant to reach out after church Sunday, but with the crowds and all, I... Busiest I've seen it in a long time. You went to church, sir? Yep. Jesse Custer's church? Yes, I did. Now, your, uh... your Green Acre people, you think they'll meet with me? Absolutely. I've asked around, and, you're right, they're highly regarded. You know, there comes a time when we all need to move into the future, and, uh... now it's my time. [Distorted voices, music stops] [Dramatic music plays] What'd he say?! Who? Preacher. What'd he say? [Song resumes] What'd he say? What'd he say to you?! He said to serve God, Donnie, which I will from this day on. That okay? Any more questions you care to shout at me in front of the mayor? Sorry. So, I can come to them, they can come to me, whichever's easiest. I-I'll give them a call today. Thank you. To a new beginning, Mr. Mayor... for me and this town. Oh, how the sun shines when you take time to look at it. Yep. [Smacks lips, sighs] Jesse : So, you feel that she's intruding? Exactly, yeah. She's intruding. I mean, just because I made what I now realize was the terrible mistake of marrying her daughter, doesn't give her the right to tell me how to bring up my kid... When to put him to bed, how to dress him... I think the key here is [Echoing] be patient. [Sighs] You're right. Just be patient. [Bell dings] Thanks, Preacher. [Normal voice] Anytime. Who's next? How can I help you? Excuse me. Excuse me. I got a real problem could use some help. Well, let's hear it. My problem is I like bad boys, one in particular. For instance... Me and this bad boy, we used to run these weird-ass reptiles for a Mexican cartel down in Miami... rare collector items. And one day we deliver a Komodo dragon to the buyer, this Rasta guy who keeps lookin' me up and down. I mean, who can blame him? But Bad Boy doesn't like it. So he puts his 9 millimeter right to the head of the Komodo dragon, and he warns Rasta, "You keep checkin' out my girl's ass, I'mma shoot the lizard in the face." But Rasta's got some balls, and he says, "Hey, man, she don't want me lookin', she shouldn't put that booty on in the morning." So my Bad Boy, he pets the Komodo dragon one time and then... Blam!... [Gasps] Blows his brains out. They were gonna eat that dragon anyways. You don't know that! They were setting up a barbecue spit. That's not the point. Point is, this guy shot a Komodo dragon in the head. This guy is bad... B-A-D... and now he's acting like he's not. He's denying who he is, and that's my problem. No, wait. It's okay. I've done worse than that. Uh, yeah, much worse. If you guys had any idea... But look at me now, Tulip. Really look... and be honest. I have changed. You see that, right? Which means you can change, too. I know you can. We don't have to be what we've been. ♪ ♪ You can be good. That's what we want, right? We... We all want to be good. [Bell dings] Something outside wants to talk to you. Excuse me? I told it it can't come in. Oh. Wait. You're... coming back, though, right? I'm not going anywhere. ♪ ♪ [Bell dings] Keep it away from the windows. People are eating. [Bell dings] [Sighs] Hey, Eugene. What's up? What's going on? That's not true. I don't hate you. [Dramatic music plays] We'll think of something. [Knock on door] Hey. I was hoping to talk to you about something. Of course. But could you pray with Tracy first? We do every day, but you're the only one who made such wonderful progress. You know, I guess my thing can wait a couple minutes, so... sure. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Son of a bitch! [Wood scrapes] I told you you come back here, I'd kill you! [Glass shattering] You murderer! Eugene, get outta that car! Get outta that car! [Grunts] Calm down! I brought him here! Never come back! Murderer! [Echoing] Drop it. [Panting] I'll kill you! I'll kill you, you murderer! Murderer! Step away from the car. [Normal voice] Come on, Eugene. Murderer! Come on. Murderer! It's okay. I promise. Murderer! How dare you show your face here? Now, this has gone on too long. I told you never come back. This boy has made a terrible mistake... You're sick! But he's suffered. You murderer! You're suffering, too. [Echoing] Forgive him. [Birds chirping] [Ominous music plays] Betsy : A 66? Last time I checked, that's a "pass." That's a good pass. That teacher's always picking on Chris. I don't know why or what her problem is other than her husband's disgustingly fat. It's good to be back, right? Yeah. Weere working on some new deal. I don't... I don't really know what... Did you know Mr. Quincannon was at church on Sunday? Yeah, I heard. [Chips crunching] You're moping, Donnie. What is it? Baby, what's going on? [Sighs] [Car starts in distance] Speak. Preacher's got a power. What? A power. He made me do things, and... and... Linus t-the bus driver, and, um, I think Mr. Quincannon, too. I-I don't know how he does it, but there's... there's nothing I can do, Bets. There's n-nothing. He made me put a gun in my mouth, and I couldn't stop him. [Voice breaking] I was just a puppet. I was just a... a c-c-cow in a maze. Wait, Preacher put a gun in your mouth? No, no, no. I put the gun in my mouth, and... and he made me do it. I... I cocked the trigger, and I-I was gonna pull it, but his power... it made me in my mind! [Sobbing] Shh. It's okay. [Car starts in distance] It's okay. [Sighs] Please don't screw Russell in accounting. I won't, baby. [Sighs, sobbing] Don't you worry about Preacher. Sooner or later, your moment will come, and he'll get what he deserves. [Whistling] [Whistling stops] Well, your dad's been suffering, right? Worrying over you? Well, now you can tell him not to worry anymore. You're welcome. [Whistling resumes] [Exhales sharply] [Eating Chinese food] [Train horn blows in distance] [Dramatic music plays] [Telephone rings] "On top of the situation. Don't worry. We'll be back soon."

And my point is if he gets the homework done quickly, he gets extra screen time. I like the carrot, not the stick. What would you advise? [Bell dings] [Echoing] Just use your best judgment. Preacher, these gentlemen from the government need to speak with you. Cathy. Bill. Thank you. Thank you. You can go now. [Bell dings] [Normal voice] This about Dallas? You know what it's about.
