 Previously on "Heroes Reborn"... 
 They're gonna kill me! 
 I know I saw you on June 13th. 
 You are the only one who can tell me what really happened. 
 Molly! 
 [screaming] 
 No! 
 [screaming] 
 With our processor now online, EPIC can locate every enhanced human on this planet. 
 It's a trap! They found us! 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunfire, grunting] 
 [groaning] God! 
 Why is this happening to me? 
 [screaming] 
 [groaning] 
 How long you been following us? 
 Who is that man you were talking to? 
 We have to go, Tommy. 
 How do we find our true purpose? 
 Is it something we're born with, written into our genetic code? 
 Or is it something we must learn over time, a growing awareness derived from life's joys and sorrows? Mom? [groans] From our loves... [groans loudly] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Our losses, our achievements, and our suffering. [whimpers] Mom, Mom, it's okay. I'm here. [grunts] I just wanted some more time with you. Mom, it's fine, I'm gonna get you to a hospital, okay? [whimpers] No. It's too dangerous. Go. No, no, no. Go. [sirens approaching] [fire truck horn blaring] Mom? [fire truck horn blaring] [sirens approaching] [elevator bell dings] Nursing supervisor to the O.R. She's feeling better. - Any available nursing... [gasps] [indistinct chatter] Hey there. What can I do for you? Alexander French? Yeah, that's right. Whoo-hoo! My God, that was a pretty shot. Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead? Luke, I asked you a question. Yeah, honey, that was a really pretty shot. But this man, he had a family. This man was a monster. With a wife and a kid. Who are safer now that we acted. Or maybe we're just making assumptions because his name was on some list. We don't know anything about these people. He could've been a teacher, a doctor, I mean-- [clatter] [approaching steps] [dog whimpers] [sighs] Come on. Assalamu'alaikum wabarakatuh. Assalamu'alaikum wabarakatuh. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [high-pitched hum] It's time to head south, isn't it? Good. I'm ready. Watch yourself, child. I know grown men who would shake in their boots if they knew the fate of the world was in their hands. Good thing I'm not a grown man. [ethereal wind blowing] [honks horn] Fellow Evernow champions, I'm here with the daughter of the great Hachiro Otomo, the real-life Katana Girl! We are on our way to America, but we can't fulfill our quest without your help. So if you love Evernow as much as I do, dress up as your favorite character and meet us tomorrow morning at the gates of Renautas in Midian. Gamers of the world unite. [bicycle bell dings] Look at these people. They're digital sheep peddling their free bikes, eating their precious free sushi, completely blind to everything that's going on around them. You worked here for almost a year before you said anything. It's really good sushi. Come on, we got to find a way inside the research lab. Easier said than done. Who said anything about easy? You saw what they did with that device. With EPIC online, no one is safe. If they're really sucking out Molly's power, they're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe, turning her into some kind of-- like, a shadow blaster or something. What? It's a thing. It could be a thing. Okay. All right, all right. You don't know. Look, just keep your head low, and do exactly as I say, all right? If your sister's here, we'll find her. What you doing? [wrench clattering] Nothing. Don't look like nothing. What happened to your face? Fell down some stairs. Don't change the subject. It was Abuelito's. Don't think it's seen the road in about 20 years though. Dad promised we'd fix it...together. It's up to me now. You did all this? All it needed was a little upgrade. Little upgrade? It's what he would have wanted. Come here, mijo. What is it? Uncle Carlos? I need to get to school. Uncle Carlos? We're gonna need bulletproof glass... and Kevlar, lots of Kevlar. [humming] Gotta try this spicy tuna. Do I know you? No, Taylor, but you do know a friend of ours. What friend is that? Molly Walker. You're gonna help us break her out. Yeah, you are. What do you know about your mother's research division? What do you think you're doing? What kind of security does she have? Noah Bennet. The original bag and tagger. Careful, Taylor. What kind of mother puts her own daughter into this line of work? One who trusts me to get the job done. Or maybe one who doesn't care if you take a bullet. You know, I almost met your mom once. June 13th. Right after the bombing. All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her face-to-face what happened to my sister. Security was too tight. I couldn't get near her, but now, I can get all my answers. What do you think you'll find out? She's kidnapping innocent people. You have no idea what she's trying to accomplish. And you do? What is it you think she's trying to accomplish, Taylor? Locking up human beings? Torturing them? You don't know that. But they are human beings, Taylor. You must have seen that. Believe me, all parents will lie to their kids to protect them from the truth. I am not asking you to betray your mother. I'm just asking you to question her. [eerie humming] What happened to Francis? You know, every time I doubt the path I'm on, I think about you, Taylor. Mom, can we not drudge up the past for once? Look, I'm not mad at you for sleeping around. What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them. You act like this is just some fling. With an Evo. With a great guy who I care about a lot. When did you become such a bigot? You have no idea what I am or what I'm trying to accomplish here. Then tell me, Mom. Bring me in for once. Why are we rounding these people up? Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest, most valuable metals in the world? I asked you a simple question. In the courts of Napoleon III, French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold while only the Emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum. That's how hard it was to come by, and of course a few decades later, a chemist by the name of Charles Martin Hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost, and just like that, it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants, all because of one person's creative spark. This isn't a TED talk, Mom. Just tell me the truth. What are you really after? Abundance, Taylor. A world of infinite supply so that you never have to suffer through war, hunger, pollution, terrorism, greed. I mean, all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded, selfish, doomed planet. But you still haven't answered my question. Why are we rounding up Evos? To save our species. Do you trust me? Dr. Susan Morris to ICU. Dr. Susan Morris to ICU. Tommy! I'm so glad you're okay. Dude. Uh, what are you guys doing here? A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver, we're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our-- He gets the point, Brad. We were worried about you. Oh. Wow. Thomas Clark? Is my mom okay? She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage. But now she's fine, right? She's stable, but we're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion. Okay, great. Let's do it. What's wrong? We don't have any O-negative blood on supply. It's quite rare, and ever since the Evos came out, blood donations aren't what they used to be. What about mine? You can give her mine, right? Well, blood relatives are more likely to be a match, but-- Then test it. Tommy. She's the only family I have. [chuckles] I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat. Isn't it weirdly refreshing? The Sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat. We glow so that God may see us better. Of course you do. Why are we stopping? The signs were there just like she said they'd be. We don't have time to just stop. Time? What do you know about time? I'm not a child anymore, Farah. Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the Arctic? They've been hunting you, Malina. Ever since your first birthday, our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind-- death, which is why we must fight them back with life. [speaking in Urdu] Calm down. Calm down, sir. We pose you no threat. I need help out here now! Yeah, there are these two-- Training is over. What's the matter with you? It's gorgeous out. I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so-- no, no, it just--it just-- it feels better in the dark. Take a bloody aspirin. No, I'll be fine. Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and... I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment. Maybe you should too. Maybe we both should. We could--I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be. Normal? It's not too late. Oh. Feels like the surface of the sun. Yeah, like I said, my head-- No wonder you're not yourself. Here. Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back. We used to be a part of something special, weren't we? Things always look better in the rear view. No, we were happy. I know we were. Things change, Luke. You gotta keep changing with them. Joanne. What? I still love you. 
 
 [eerie music] [eerie humming] [labored breathing] It's beautiful, isn't it, when nature's so unpredictable? Do they have any idea what's really coming? I hope not, for their sake. But I'm just one person. What if I can't save them all by myself? You're not alone, Malina. You'll have help, even if the others don't know it yet. [indistinct PA announcements] [footsteps approaching] What did you do to the suit? Meet version 2.0. You might want to stand back. [hydraulic gears working] So you made yourself a fancy costume. Am I supposed to be impressed? Yeah, a little. Become a man who's fit to wear it, then I'll be impressed. I'm not doing this for you, Father... or for Oscar. Then why don the mask? 'Cause for once, I want to believe in something bigger than me. Captain Dearing will be looking for you. I have a feeling he might be onto me as well. I will just have to get to him first. Mom, don't get mad, but... I had my blood tested to see if we were a match. I know what you're thinking. How could I risk exposing who I am? But I had no choice. [door opening] The test results came back. And? You weren't a match. How could I not be? It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members. So what do we do? Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in South Bend, Indiana. I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours. Tommy, is there something you want to tell me? About what? What happened in there? She still needs blood. Tommy, where are you going? Indiana. Want to come? Sorry, cleared employees only. But you do know who I am? Yes, Ms. Kravid. Good, then you should've seen this coming. [both groan] Now let's find Molly. [beeping] [door opening] We're close. Molly's in here somewhere. We don't want to shoot you, but we will if necessary. "We"? That's the guy that took my sister, or at least one of them is. Hit the ground on the count of three. Wait, what? One... What if they know where she is? Two... I hate your face, Bennet. Three. How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this? You just saw that, right? Right? Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt? Welcome to my world. I'm telling you, this list of Evos has been a godsend. Remember the first one we killed? Of course. Afterward, you were so content. You were so blissfully satisfied. I have...never seen anyone sleep so soundly. I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet. Why are you saying this now? We lost our son, Joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you too, and the truth is I have lost you. I have lost myself. We have lost each other. What the hell? [tires screeching] If you want to do it, do it. [breathing unsteadily] I really did love you. [car alert beeping] [eerie humming] [PA system chatter] You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary? [laughs] I work at an ice cream parlor in Carbondale, Illinois. An extraordinary ice cream parlor. [laughs] Look, the thing is, Emily, I-I do get that feeling, all the time, and it sucks. There's, like, 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down, reminding me that I'm different. Good. Good? You are different, Tommy. You'll always be different, but trust me, the moment you accept that, you're gonna start having way more fun. Now... let's go save your mom. Oh, my gosh. We totally just-- I am so never flying commercial again. We have the blood! You have to run! What? Your blood test went straight to a federal database. They know what you are. I'll take care of your mom, but you have to run. Now! Let's go. You know what you have to do. There are people watching. Tommy, don't worry about them for once. Just be you. Be extraordinary. I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Clark, not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver. Uncle Carlos. I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads. [engine starts] You did it! It sounds great. Hey, can I come with you? Ah, too dangerous. I want to push it up to 100. Nothing's gonna happen. I'll be fine. I know, mijo, but... I need you here holding down the fort. [tires screeching and engine revving] [metal part ricochets] You're not going to believe this. My dad, El Vengador. Just slow down. I used to be so afraid to show him what I could do, but this whole time, we could've been a team. Jose! Well, look who we got here. Two for one special. Run, Jose! Go! Find your uncle! Come here! I got the kid! Holy-- [people yelling] There she is. It's Katana Girl! [all screaming] Phoebe? Phoebe? Are these all-- Evos. They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on June 13th, but they still couldn't hide from your mother. Oh, my God, Francis. What did she do to him? Plotting bitch. I once knew a man... who could harvest people's powers through their brains. He collected them, used them for his own ends, but I think your mother has found another way. Noah? Noah. Molly. Molly. You're gonna be okay. It's all gonna be all right. There's no stopping it. Every machine has an off switch. Not this one. I swear I didn't know what she was doing. I'm so sorry. What? What is it? You should've never found me. Molly. I'm just here to help. People have been telling me that my entire life, but all they want to do is use me for my powers. You should understand that better than anyone. I'm not proud of my past. You know if I could change it-- Forget about the past, Noah. This is about so much more than you and me and June 13th. I was there in the hospital when your daughter died. What happened? We all knew what was at stake, and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe. No--no! What are you doing? Erica tried to take everything from me, but I was strong. [crying] I was really strong, and I didn't give her the location. Of what? If I tell you, you won't go back, and then we're all dead anyway. You're not making any sense. I can't stop Erica, but I will not help her kill 7 billion people. What? Molly, put the gun down, and let's talk, okay? You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th. Forget the past, Noah. Save the future. Molly, just-- [gunshot] [sobbing] [alarm blaring] We can't leave her like this. If we don't, we're gonna end up just like her. Come on, man. We got to go. Find them. They can't be far. We just lost Molly Walker, gunshot wound, self-inflicted. How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun? Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and... well, there's no way to put this delicately. He was with your daughter. Bring them to me. What about EPIC? Local tracking still functions properly. As long as you're within 100 feet of an Evo, they'll all register on the device. But remote locations? Not without the girl. At least tell me we found it before she died. [scoffs] Lovely. It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance. Before global tracking went down, EPIC did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential. It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris. I need you to find me that child, and when you do, I need you to kill it. I'll put my usual team on it. No. This is too important. This time, you're taking the Shadow. We all have a unique purpose, and try as we might, we cannot run from it. Will we be able to stay true to who we are, or will we succumb to the pressure of destiny and become something else entirely? Something inhuman?
