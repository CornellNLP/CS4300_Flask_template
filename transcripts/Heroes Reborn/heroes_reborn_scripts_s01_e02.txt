 [wings fluttering] 
 [line trilling] 
 Hey, this is Claire. 
 Leave me a message and I'll call you back. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Hey, it's your dad. 
 I know it's been a few years since we've talked, and... I don't know if you're still mad or... 
 I don't really know anything. 
 I just know... 
 I miss you. 
 I'm sure there's plenty of apologies to go around, but to be honest with you, I'm not interested in who was right or wrong anymore. 
 So much has changed since I saw you last. 
 I don't know whether those changes are good or bad, but I really think it has a chance to all work out. 
 And knowing how important you've been to all of this, to so many people out there, it's made me proud. 
 And I just wanted to call and tell you how excited I am that we might be seeing each other. 
 When you look back at the things you've done, the decisions you've made... Whoa. The last thing you want to feel is regret, am I right? I'll see you soon, Claire-bear. ...on little Odessa, Texas. Headquarters of Primatech, the global leaders of evo research. [speaking Spanish] [speaking foreign language] [indistinct chatter] [high-pitched whine] [explosion] The dream for peace between humans and evos has shattered in seconds. - Massive evidence... [droning high-pitched tone] Odessa... - [speaking foreign language] A once thriving city in central Texas... Why did this have to happen? It was a despicable and cowardly act-- Reduced to a wasteland-- The are the seeds of hate that we cannot let take root in our heart. This horrific attacks are a grim reminder of the hatred and contempt-- Bigotry that says another person is less than my equal, less than human. The local hospital here in Odessa is overwhelmed... Listen, I wanted to trust those evos. I wanted the summit to work. This kind of thing happening in our United States. We can't just let them get away with this. Who did this, and why? We have got to go and attack the enemy. We face bullies and tyrants and terrorists with strength. And so we are newly reminded that serious threats to our way of life remain. Make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this... Claire! To bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice. June 13th will certainly go down in history as one of the worst terrorist attacks-- Will hunt down and punish... Claire! - Those responsible. - Will be brought to justice. Hunt them down and kill them. Kill 'em all! Claire!

That's what you said about people in Denver. What is it? They're swabbing. Hold it right there! [Taser buzzing] [yelps] What do we do? ♪ ♪ [engine revs] [car crashes] [tires screeching] [distant sirens wailing] Coach Lewis? Aw, jeez. You got to be kidding me. Odessa, a once-thriving city reduced to a desolate wasteland by a cowardly act... Password. Of evil terrorism. Cockroach? Why Odessa? It was the headquarters of Primatech, a company steeped in secrecy. Primatech opened its doors on June 13th for what was to be a three-day summit. People gathered from all around the world, hoping to build a better future where humans and evos could coexist in peace. Within hours, an evil supremacist named Mohinder Suresh claimed full responsibility for the attacks. Lies. All of it. This is pathetic. How the hell are we supposed to fight back if we can't even organize? We just got to get creative. There's a guy in Los Angeles fighting back, calls himself "El Vengador." That dude in the Mexican wrestler costume-- that's a joke, right? Is it? At least he's doing something. I hear he's got a whole underground railroad out there, fake IDs, fake blood samples-- it's a way to disappear. One guy, so what? Pretty soon, they'll send drones after us. June 13th changed everything. The public's scared to death of us. Most of these incidents are isolated-- Tulsa, Cedar Rapids-- the vigilantes, a few bad apples--that's all. If it was just vigilantes, the government wouldn't be forcing us to register. People don't get it. It's not the government or the vigilantes we should be worried about. The ones really hunting us, they're in the shadows. There's something else going on here. And they're everywhere. Oh, that's just great. So what are we supposed to do with that, chase ghosts? My mom sleeps with a gun under her pillow, when she sleeps at all. And we use fake names most of the time. I'm calling myself "Tommy" now. No names, for God's sakes. Now we're wanted in three states, all because I can't control my power. I came here tonight because I thought maybe someone could give me a few tips, help me out a little. You came to the wrong place, my friend. [cell phone chimes] I-I got to go. My mom-- Sorry. Hey, look out! [grunts] I'm so sorry. Come on. I'm really sorry. [intense music] ♪ ♪ It's lies, just lies. - You believe everything. You can't have a revolution without casualties. Resistance is our only answer, by any means possible. Exactly. We need to stop acting like victims here. We're the ones with powers. Suresh was right. We are the future. [chuckling] The future... That's a good one. On June 13th, my wife and I, we brought our nine-year-old son Dennis to Odessa to watch history being made. It was a beautiful day. Sun was shining. Summer heat was rising up off the ground. Like everyone there, we believed in the cause. We believed that the change could come from that spot right then and there. And then when I watched my--my boy die in my arms, I realized that that just wasn't gonna happen. You all seem like really nice folks. You can't change who you are, what you are. But these powers-- they're not natural. They're not safe, and they cannot be trusted. So as far as I'm concerned, there's only one solution for that. And what solution is that? Run! They found us! [gunshot] [gunshots] [grunts] [screams] [groans] [groans] [grunts] [light fixture creaking] One of 'em got away. Dropped this. Moe's Ice Cream Parlor. Carbondale, Illinois. One more, and we got free ice cream. For Dennis. [tense exotic music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic exotic music] ♪ ♪ Memories are funny things. The good ones fill your life with meaning, with context, with clarity, while other memories can deceive. The ones that make you believe you know the truth, they're the dangerous ones, the ones that hold you hostage. When you look back on all the decisions you've made in your life, the one thing you don't want to feel... is regret. Am I right? It's why this car makes so much sense. Gas mileage, style, safety-- It's got it all, not to mention that new-car smell. [chuckles] What do you think, young lady? [chuckles] Okay. Let's head back into my office. Leasing office, pick up line 3, please. Leasing office, line 3. So can I get started on the paperwork? I'd like to check the safety stats on the car first. You've probably got kids, right, Mr. Barnes? [indistinct chatter] [both breathing heavily] Linda, you're amazing. Oh, it's Lisa. Lisa, yeah, right. [school bell rings] We got to stop. Why? Why? What's wrong? Lunchtime, you're on in five. [door opening] All I know about being a hero is it's not something you're born with. And if you had told me when I was your age that I'd be getting a medal of valor for saving three soldiers from an ambush in Afghanistan, I'd have said you were nuts. Uh... Here I am. I'd like to thank Principal Marks and Miss--Miss, uh-- Carpenter. Right. Uh, for giving me such a warm welcome today. I'll leave you with this last thought. It doesn't matter how ordinary you think you are or how much of a screwup you think you've been. We all have the potential to be heroes. Thank you. [applause] [laughter] You want to? Yes. Okay. Hey! Brad... [gentle music] ♪ ♪ Hey. You like my girlfriend? What? You're staring at my girlfriend. No, I wasn't staring. [grunts] [whirs] Wuss. [crying] They said his wife didn't even know he was in Chicago. Did something happen? Coach Lewis died in a fire last night with six other people. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ I've been here an hour now. The other guy told me to wait. Mm. Waiting. Too many people go through life waiting for things to happen instead of making them happen. Ah. Now, let's talk about what you saw. I'm riding my bike down H Street with my delivery when this little prick runs right into me. 28 bucks worth of food on the ground. He came running out of that church right before it caught fire, so I'm guessing he killed all those people. Could you identify this "prick" if you saw him again? Is there a reward? [gentle foreboding music] ♪ ♪ Go ahead. ♪ ♪ [curious music] ♪ ♪ I don't understand. What's this for? Penny for your thoughts. ♪ ♪ All right. So let's see if we can get a description of that kid you saw. Kid? Sorry, I don't remember anything about a kid. ♪ ♪ Excuse me, miss. Can I help you? That depends. Okay. Now for your favorite subject. This week, if we knock off the cake tasting, the band audition, and the gift registration, we are way ahead of schedule. And I've got my heart set on red velvet. I know you're a coconut man, but... [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ And for the registry, I thought we should start with the china. ♪ ♪ I think I just want to go white, all white. Yep, white-- white's good.

Well, you're at Moe's all the time. Oh, yeah, I guess I like ice cream. [laughs] So it's not because of me. I'm just messing with you. I'm the one who drew the happy face on your punch card. Oh, I know. Hey, we need a new scooper. You should come in. They're letting me do the interviews. Okay. Yeah. Maybe. Um, hey, I heard about what Brad did to you. I'm sorry. Brad acts like a tough guy, but he's not. He's just... A total narcissistic jerk? [laughs] Sometimes. Yeah. Hey, did you hear what they're saying about Coach Lewis, that he might have been an evo? Uh... An evo? Evolved, had powers. [school bell rings] Really? Well, I got to get to a French Club meeting. But seriously, you should come in for that job. Brad. Hi. Hey. [cell phone buzzes, pings] Want me to pick you up? Sure. Come on. Hurry up. Let's go. Why don't you ever stay with us when you're in town? It's complicated. If you came back, you could work at the shop. I don't know. I think your dad's still pretty sore at me. He's probably over it now that you're a hero. Hero. But you're like El Vengador. What, the guy in the Mexican wrestling mask? Ah... You comparing me to an evo? They say anyone could turn out to be an evo. They were just born that way. There's this website called "HeroTruther." And they're tracking how all these evos are starting to disappear. Someone's taking them, maybe even killing them. [power tools whirring] El Vengador's the only one taking care of this neighborhood, the only one the gangbangers are scared of. All right, I've heard enough about El Vengador. I've seen enough too. Is that yours, Jose? Yes. But people need to know he's not in hiding like the rest of them. People need to come to a garage without graffiti on the wall. Now clean it up. So the kid's got a hero, someone to look up to. What's the problem? El Vengador isn't everybody's hero. The tag is bad for business. And what's Jose need a caped crusader to idolize when he's got Tío Carlos? Hey, Oscar! I think she's a lost cause. Transmission's shot. [engine revving] I don't know. You hear that? What? I can hear an air lift there. Just need to replace the vacuum lines to the modulator valve. She should be good to go. Hey, I told Pop to paint the "S" off the word "sons" years ago. Yeah, he figured after you came back from the army, you'd change your mind. Look, war hero or not, you broke his heart. I hope you know that. [car engine rumbling] Like it was ever gonna be 50/50 anyway. That's it. Walk away. You're real good at that, hero man! See you later, okay? I don't know. If this thing gets to be over 75 people, we might need to rent a tent. Sure it's not too late to elope? Sorry. You have been roped and tied, my friend. You hold that thought. What? I'll be right back. What is it? [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ [clattering] [grunts] First rule of tailing somebody: know how to tail someone. Who are you? What do you want? Answers. Answers to what?

Well, I-I-I worked at Renautas, but not for Renautas. And I know that you worked for Primatech. [coughs] [gags] [coughs] I sold paper.

You know something about June 13th that nobody else does. Let me guess. You're a truther, an apologist for Mohinder Suresh. Man... Suresh had nothing to do with Odessa. He was a patsy. How do you not know that, man? What did they do to you? Get a life, and stay out of mine. Wait, I have the manuscript Suresh was just about to publish. How the hell do you have that? It's all in here-- how the number of evos is higher on the planet than ever before. These powers-- their numbers are increasing, escalating. Why? Is it evolutionary? Is it because they want to take over, like, the media, like, the government, like, wants us to think? No. They're here to save us... Save us? From whatever it is that Renautas is planning. If that's true, then where are they? Huh? You see any people with powers around here? They are all gone. They are hiding or dead. Believe me. If they were here to save us, I would know. Listen to me, man. [police siren wailing] Aw, you called the cops? That's him. That's the guy. On the ground! Hands above your head! Oh, you got-- Man! I said down now!
