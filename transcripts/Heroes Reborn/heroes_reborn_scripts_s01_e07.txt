 Previously on  "Heroes Reborn"... 
 You wiped my memory. 
 You need to forget. 
 What did I need to forget? 
 Not what. Who. 
 You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th. 
 Save the future. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gasps] 
 It's not working. I can't use my powers. 
 Phoebe? What are you doing? 
 [gasps] 
 [tires screech] 
 If you want to do it, do it. 
 None of this would have happened if you hadn't convinced me to take Dennis. 
 Erica Kravid slaughtered thousands on June 13th, the day my daughter died. 
 I will take you back, Noah. 
 So you have a plan? 
 You know I do. 
 With the magnetic poles reversing,  we are going to be defenseless against solar radiation. 
 Starting over is never pretty. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Claire never made it to the summit. 
 I know she died at St. Jude Hospital here in Odessa, but I don't know what time she-- 
 I don't know how long I have. 
 Then we must work quickly. 
 How do we stop the explosion? 
 Well, based on the size and the trajectory of the explosions, there were at least six separate bombs, maybe more, all detonated simultaneously, and we have to find them. 
 And what time was the explosion? 
 11:14, which means all these people are going to die. 
 Maybe we don't find the bombs. 
 Maybe we call in a bomb threat and warn them. 
 No, I told you. 
 We must try not to step on butterflies. 
 We must find the smallest thread to pull, the one that unravels the least. 
 The smallest thread. 
 We only have three hours. 
 And I've got to get to the hospital before Claire-- 
 Noah. 
 Stevens. 
 Hey. 
 Nice threads. 
 Have you seen Claire? 
 What? 
 Well, she got in early at the east gate. 
 She's here? 
 She wanted to keep a low profile, so she didn't check in, but you're gonna want to see her. 
 I've gotta find her. 
 [sighs] 
 Hello, Mohinder. 
 What is it you couldn't tell me on the phone, Angela? 
 We have made a terrible mistake getting into bed with Erica Kravid and Renautas. 
 Maybe you have. Renautas has been funding my research for four years. 
 Something Primatech never did. 
 Primatech is Renautas and vice versa. 
 I sold her my company because she had a visionary plan to save the world from a catastrophic event. 
 You know about the H.E.L.E.? 
 The Human Extinction Level Event. 
 The earth's magnetic poles reversing, solar flares radiating the earth. 
 Gruesome stuff you've discovered up there in the Arctic. 
 This is my research. This is classified. 
 Where did you get this? 
 I've gone to great lengths to make Erica believe we're still partners, but I am telling you, her plan such as it is is to let the H.E.L.E. come. 
 That's absurd. 
 She hired me to find a solution, and I did. 
 It's the Evos-- otherwise, everyone on the planet would die. 
 Not everyone. 
 And Erica will choose who survives. 
 She's been planning it for years. 
 You're telling me that she knew all this before she hired me? 
 Yes, because I told her. 
 [scoffs] 
 I had one of my visions. 
 And as you know, my visions always come true. 
 Fire from the sky, boiling oceans,  land incinerated, earth destroyed, toxic. 
 Dead. Game over. For all of us. But my vision also showed me  the Evos who can save us. And you told her that too. I thought if I did, we could revise the plan and save everyone, but she... she used me, Mohinder. You have to believe me. Why would I? You have been a snake in the grass since I've known you. You have no proof of any of this. Your team in the Arctic was murdered this morning. They were gunned down, their bodies buried in the snow, and all evidence of your research erased. I don't know what you have to gain by telling these lies, Angela. Come to the press with me. We need to warn the world. I am warning the world. I'm giving a speech today as Erica's personal guest at the summit. There will be a last-minute change in schedule. She will apologize politely, and you will be escorted out and shot. I'm warning you, Mohinder! If she gets to them first, Erica will kill the Evos who can save us. [phone ringing] [sighs] Claire? Wait, who is this? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Wait here. Well? She's nervous. She should be. The fate of the entire world depends on us getting this right today. I'm thinking maybe a little more carrot than stick might be in order. Or not. [grunting] It's almost time, Phoebe. [grunting] I've never made this much darkness before. It has to cover the entire summit. What if I don't have the strength? Then I suggest you find it. Or that brother that's been looking for you? Quentin? When the world ends, he's going to burn right along with it. Do we understand each other? [grunting] Keep going. [grunting] [dramatic exotic music] [winces] Ow! Dennis, what's happened? Come here. [sighs] Are you all right? Let me see. Hey. I was playing. I didn't know my hand was in the light. Sorry. I just want to be normal. Mm, it's okay. Doesn't look too bad. I'll go and get the medicine. Buddy, buddy. Come on, you know the deal. Sunlight is dangerous for you. You have to be more careful. How many times have we talked about this, a hundred? I'm Super Dennis! [laughs] You're getting too big, and I'm getting too old. All right, come on, Super Dennis. Let's get you fixed up. Spray. Oh, that's not too bad. We've seen worse than that, haven't we? Trade you. Thanks. You know, you guys should come and see all of these incredible Evos. They are everywhere. It is amazing. Some of 'em can fly. Ooh. Some of 'em can teleport, just like... [snaps fingers, pops lips] Pfft, they're somewhere else. Some of 'em can read minds. Some of them can regenerate skin. No joke. They can-- they can-- they can grow back limbs. Okay. They can heal themselves. There you go. All better. So what? We're just gonna pay them? We're gonna beg them? It's not like someone with a power can just inject him with a vaccine, Luke. We don't know that. [sighs] I'm just worried that we're giving him false hope. Isn't some hope better than no hope at all? This is happening. These people have real powers. And they're right in front of us right now, and I do have hope. I have hope that at least one of these people can do something to help him live a better life. He only identifies with Evos because you keep telling him he's special. He is special. He's not, Luke. Solar urticaria isn't just-- just like a power you can turn on and off. I hear you guys arguing. We're not arguing, honey, we're just having a discussion. Same difference. ♪ Now I'm the kind of gal that don't want to stick around ♪ 
♪ Just 'cause you're famous ♪ Stevens? How's our head count? Uh, it's good. Check-in's almost complete. All the delegates have arrived. Well, we're still waiting on a few keynote speakers. Claire? Are you having a senior moment? I just told you, she's here. She's here? Where? Like I said before, she's keeping a low profile. Oh, that's great. Did you change? What about, uh, Hiro Nakamura? What, did you lose him? He was just here. Hey, um, Stevens, when I checked, there was no security detail in the garage. What's going on? We pulled them. We put all the guards on the west entrance. Who the hell gave that order? Erica Kravid. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [horns honk] [phone vibrating] [speaking Japanese] [zapping] ♪ ♪ [phone vibrating] This is the only place left Claire could be. She used to come here sometimes after school and do her homework. Don't worry, Noah. We'll find her. Let's get to work. My security briefing for the summit. The explosion was centered in the underground garage. Whoever placed the bombs bypassed security and then set the charges here, here, and here, which took out the support beams. If we could get to these three-- [door opens] .. over there right away. Over here. Oh, like "Harry Potter." Give us a moment. Shh. Have you touched base with Claire? Why did you go behind my back and rearrange security? Noah, you're overthinking. You left half the building unguarded. I ran a dozen scenarios. I covered every entry point. Have you even read my briefing? We're covered. Our security is the best there is. Stop worrying and enjoy this. You should be out there celebrating with your daughter, who I look forward to meeting. You seem very interested in my daughter. Well, she is the one who started this whole thing when she jumped off that Ferris wheel in New York. Humanity has taken a backseat to Evos ever since. Evos are humanity, Erica. That's the whole point of this summit, isn't it? To remind us that evolved humans are still human. Evolution is great when it's controlled. Random evolution, not so much. I thought you of all people would understand that, living with one of them under your own roof for so many years. You sound like a bigot, Erica. I'm a businesswoman and a pragmatist. Renautas has plans, big plans that are going to change the world. Big plans, huh? I want you by my side because you're smart. So I'm going to pull you off the field for a beat, put you on the bench. The bench? Yes. Please escort Mr. Bennet downstairs, where I think he'll be more comfortable. Oh, you've got to be kidding. [grunts] [thuds] Don't worry. When I see Claire, I'll tell her you've been detained. You'll never get your hands on her. Noah, don't! You are not thinking clearly. We don't know what happens to him--me. The other Noah will be fine. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, right? Oh, Noah, thank God. Angela? It's Claire. What? Where--where is she? A nurse from St. Jude's Hospital called. She had Claire's phone and-- And what? Is she alive? All they'd tell me is that she was rushed from here to the ER. She's in surgery. This time, you save the cheerleader. I will stop the bomb. [indistinct PA announcement] I'm looking for my daughter, Claire Bennet. Mr. Bennet. Please tell me we got here in time. What's happened? Where is she? I'm sorry. We tried everything that we could. We were able to save the children. Children? [sighs] Your daughter died in childbirth. [exotic music] [crowd shouting] Ned, it's me again. Listen, give me a call when you can. I just want to make sure you and the team are okay. Haven't heard back from you. I'm getting a little worried. Anyway, just call me. Mohinder, you ready? Excited for the big speech? What's wrong? I'm trying to reach my research team, but they won't answer. Do me a favor. Take this. "'Escalating Evolution' by Mohinder Suresh." First copy. Just keep that, okay? In case anything should, um... I'm sure it's nothing. Dr. Suresh, we've been looking for you. Miss Kravid would like a moment. I should, uh... Don't worry about it. I'll see you after the speech. Okay. Hello, Erica. Mohinder, dear. How are you? Well, I think. A little nervous about my speech but anxious to let the world know about the H.E.L.E. Yes, about that, I'm afraid there's been a change in the schedule. You won't be speaking today after all. You're going to bury my research, and you've had my team murdered. Is that all true? You allow this H.E.L.E. to happen, and the only thing you'll be creating is man's extinction. No. I have a plan. Sad to say, it does not include you. [grunts] Get him to the garage. 
 
 I've watched Claire die half a dozen times and always regenerate. There has to be a way. Noah, the babies, they're important. I had a vision about them, a prophecy. Mr. Bennet? Dr. Roberts. Yes, the nurse said you wanted to speak with me. Yeah, it's my daughter, Claire Bennet. I need to see her. We're still assessing the... I'm afraid that's not protocol. Please, please, there's a spot right behind her head here. If it's blocked, it'll interrupt her power. Cause of death was cardiac arrest due to a traumatic seizure during childbirth. You don't understand, I need to see her. Mr. Bennet, would you like to see your grandchildren? They have their mother's eyes. They're perfect. Where are you going, Noah? I have to see her. I have to see for myself. When this place blows up, they'll never find you. [grunting] Don't bother trying to use your power. You can't. Nakamura. What? Surprised to see me? You're supposed to be in the Eternal Fortress. Plans changed. [yelling] Never bring your fists to a sword fight. Think again. Careful, Hiro, he has a bomb. [grunts] Yata! [sighs] Hiro. [breathing heavily] [sighing] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ You got those two? Of course, go! Great Scott. How many of you are there? As many as are necessary. [yelling] You can't stop us on your own, Nakamura. Actually, I can. But I must know what happens if I do. Too many butterflies. [both grunt] Come on, Dad. Okay, all right, all right. There's a guy doing tricks with ice. Sorry, sorry. Excuse us. Excuse us. Sorry. Here we got something special for you too, my man, all right? Check it out here. Ready? Keep your eyes on it. [applause] That's awesome. [mutters] Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, babe. Maybe we should go. No, baby, those people are idiots, okay? Look, stop worrying and enjoy yourself. This is good. All right. I'm gonna do one more, a little something here to cool down. [crowd gasps] Whoa. [applause] Thank you, thank you. Really? She got to you too? You know, I always wondered why no one ever really thought through this whole "one of us, one of them" thing. I mean, think about it. Any Evo who turns on his own, can you ever really trust them? I trusted you. And I liked you, Noah. I still do. That's why I convinced Erica that you can still be an asset. But you're gonna have to forget a few things first. Either way, it's copper. You decide if it's a penny or a bullet. I saved your life in Tulsa the night that fire starter burned down the whole neighborhood. I was there with you when Gladys left you. I spent four years at your side-- Noah, please, please. I spent four years at your side-- Remember what happened in San Francisco? San Francisco? Yeah. Caspar, you don't have to do this. You b*st*rd. I know. Ah. ♪ ♪ Hey, Clairebear. I thought I'd have time. I thought we'd have time to say all the things that we never said. [sniffles] All this time wasted fighting. For what? [crying] I'm sorry, Claire. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. Your children, Claire, twins... They're perfect. And I'm gonna keep them safe. I'm sorry we couldn't save her, Noah. That we couldn't save any of them. What do you mean? You were there. You didn't stop it? I tried, but there were too many bombs, too many butterflies. No matter what I did to save the summit, the consequences were just always worse. I'm sorry. It's time for us to go home. [sighs] Good-bye, Claire. [exhales sharply] What the... It doesn't hurt anymore. Keep going, Phoebe. Be the hero I know you can be. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [both grunting] This is a load-bearing wall. From here, I can take out 1/4 of the stadium. And there are many of us, all wearing the same vest. My God. Yes. You'll make history, Dr. Suresh. Just not the kind you intended. Hey, buddy, how's it going? You want me to freeze something? Freeze this. Okay, buddy. One more for you, all right? All right. My balloon! I'm telling you, she's up to something bad. I never trusted Erica. Too much faith in analytics. Not enough in humanity. What is that? Some kind of eclipse? Not a natural one. [gunshot] [inaudible] [gunshot] [gunshot] [crowd screaming] Where's Dennis? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis! Dennis! [panicked chatter] [sirens wailing] Mohinder? Mohinder? Mohinder! Noah. [groans] Noah! Molly. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. [grunting] [coughs] We gotta find Claire. We need to get him to a hospital. [indistinct PA announcement] Let's go back again. We can save Claire. We can save everybody. No, fate is fate. That's been proven once again. We have already risked too much meddling with the forces of time. We have to try. No, he's right, Noah. There's no changing this. Our only hope now is to save what remains of the future. What have you seen, Angela? A year from now, there'll be an event. An extinction. Erica knows about this. That's why she's sending things to the future. And she knows that Claire's child is the only one capable of stopping it. Child? Which one? I don't know. Maybe both. [door opens] Sorry, the whole hospital is in chaos. They pulled me from the nursery. They must be hungry. There you go. There you go. Just, uh, you just put it in your hand like that, and you just-- just like this. That's perfect. I'll be back when I can. This is it. This is what I made myself forget. What are you talking about? I hid Claire's children from Erica. That's what I had to forget. That's why Molly Walker... Oh, my God. You came back from the future. Dennis! Dennis! Dennis! I'm here, buddy! I'm here, buddy! Listen to my voice! It's me! Help! Please! Hey! Hey! I see you. I see you. I see you. Where are you hurt? Where are you hurt? I don't know. It all... Here we go, here we go. Up, up, up, up. [grunting] It's okay. You're gonna be okay. [both grunting] My son, hey. My son, Dennis, he was with you. Did you see where he went? [gasping] No. Not when it happened. I don't know what happened. Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry, I don't know. It's okay, it's okay. Come on, here we go. Up, up. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Dennis! A year from now, Erica's still looking for Claire's baby, so I must have done something right. Your plan was sound. We have to hide them. And I know the perfect place. The safest place. A year from now, Erica will be looking for a one-year-old baby. And how old was Claire when she manifested? 15. They'll have time to mature. They'll be more capable of stopping this thing. No, no, no, absolutely not. It is very dangerous. Nothing we have done has worked so far. Well, maybe we should try to do something else. Maybe there's a way to take Erica out of the equation. It is about fate. You do not mess with it. If it is fated, yes. Otherwise-- You want fate's permission? My visions are fate. They're one and the same. These children will save the world. I'll go back with them to take care of them, but I'm gonna need a ride. You are crazy. Okay, hang on, baby. We're going to party like it's 1999. Hiro, wait. Claire never got a chance to name them. Nathan, after the son I lost. And Malina, after my mother. Keep them safe. I'll erase all the security footage. No one will ever know they were here. I'll be right back, but remember, do not tempt fate. No more butterflies. [horns honk] [siren wails] This is ridiculous. I'm fine. We're getting you looked at. I need to find Claire. Where is she? You see her? [sighs] I'm sorry. I don't know. Well, check and see if they brought her here. I will. I will. Come on. Okay. I'm here at the St. Jude of Galilee emergency room with Erica Kravid from Renautas, who fought so long and hard to bring the world together for this summit. Tell us, Erica, after today's tragedy, what future do you see for human-Evo relations? Janice, people say there is no such thing as absolute evil, that villainy always has a point of view, but I look around at the pain and the destruction caused by this horrific act, and I don't agree. There is evil. There is villainy. And there must be justice. Fate. Hey, hey, hey. Listen, listen, listen, listen. I talked to the EMTs, okay? They're still searching for survivors, and they will be all night long. He could be out there, Luke. Hurt, alone, afraid. I know, I know, and I would be out there, too, right now if I could, but they said it's too dangerous. I'm not allowed to be out there anymore, okay? We cannot leave here without him. I know, I know. We're not. Okay. Okay. Okay. [door closes] I should be back in an hour. Thanks. Sorry I'm late, hon, but I-I told you it was gonna be a madhouse at the hospital. I just came home to shower and change. I, uh, wasn't sure you wanted to celebrate, today of all days, but... okay. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Thanks, Mom. [chuckles] I can't believe how fast time flies. That it's starting. It'll be all right. I'm ready. I promise. Dad taught me everything he knows. Yes. He did. I love you, Nathan. I'm heading back to Primatech for photo ops. You stay and look for any sign of Claire Bennet. Where's the car? Level one. Only moments ago, our station received a part of a dramatic video apparently made by... Do me a favor. Can you get me some water? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪
