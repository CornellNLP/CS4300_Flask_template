 Oh, hell, yeah. 
 Ugh! 
 You junkie whore.

 You're fired. 
 Get out.

 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Room 1112, please. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 What? 
 Man : What room are you in? 
 1112. 
 Get out of there. 
 A guest is coming back. 
 How much time do I have? 
 You might not have any. I got tied up giving directions to that older couple. 
 [door lock chirps] 
 Drink? 
 Scotch, if they have it. 
 Sit down, Chase. 
 I understand you have a son. 
 Tyler. 
 He's eleven. 
 From a previous... 
 You will go out with your son tomorrow morning at 10:00. 
 Buy some gas with a credit card. Go to Starbucks. 
 Flirt with the barista. 
 Buy a hot chocolate for Tyler, peppermint mocha for yourself. 
 Well, th-they only have peppermint mochas during the holidays. S-So... 
 I don't care if it's a peppermint mocha, Chase... just something memorable. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Establish a record of you not being in your house between 10:00 and noon. 
 Okay. Then what? 
 Where does your wife usually shower? 
 In our bathroom upstairs. 
 As you step out of the shower, is there a sink right there? 
 Yeah, a few feet away, maybe three feet. 
 Okay. 
 You're going to find Daphne on the floor beside the sink, neck broken like she slipped getting out of the shower. 
 It happens all the time. 
 Um, I think this is everything you asked for. 
 You think? 
 Uh, th-the money, photograph, address, and the key to the house. 
 And a floor plan. 
 Yes, the floor plan, of course. 
 So... [sighs] are we good? 
 Are we good? 
 I-I just mean, is that all? 
 I haven't told you how you will help me. 
 Help you? No, no, no, I can't help. 
 I need you to distract your wife so I can get inside. 
 You will call her at exactly 10:15 AM and tell her you can't find your wallet. 
 Do you have a bedside table? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 You say you think you might have left your wallet there, would she please go check. 
 That would get her upstairs, and I'll have time to get in. 
 I should write this down. 
 Don't write it down. 
 Right. 
 No, don't write. 
 No, no, no, right, like I-I... I understand. 
 Chase... after you walk out that door, there is no going back. 
 I understand. 
 Okay.

 sh1t. 
 Man : How's the job hunt going? 
 I have a job. 
 You know that. 
 Diner in Statesville? 
 Yeah. 
 You got fired. 
 How'd you know that? 
 I went there to check on you. 
 Wow. That's really sad. 
 I'm your parole officer. 
 It's almost two hours away. 
 You have to get a job, Letty, either that or I sign you up for some super fun community service. 
 Hard pass. Are we done? 
 No. 
 I've answered all the questions. 
 It's almost 7:30. 
 Don't you have to be home for dinner or something? 
 I'm divorced. 
 So, you like to work late to fill the void? 
 And it helps with the whole sober thing. 
 How's that going for you? 
 One week. 
 That's great! 
 Celebration-worthy. 
 Right? We should totally go get wasted. 
 Do you have plans tonight? 
 Are you asking me out? 
 No. I'm asking if you have plans tonight. 
 You're the weirdest P.O. I've ever had. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you like this with Gary? 
 How do you know Gary? 
 I met him outside. 
 He was peeing next to the front door. 
 No, I'm not like this with Gary. 
 Gary is an idiot. 
 All Gary has to do is not host cockfights. That's all he ever does. 
 He will spend most of his life in jail because of this. 
 I see people like Gary all day long, people who deserve to be in this building. 
 But you're smart. 
 You're young. You're... 
 Why are you here? 
 Why are you? 
 I'm not young and beautiful. 
 You were a professor. 
 Yeah. 
 So, you screwed something up. 
 For sure. 
 What's that called? 
 "Wonder Above the Sea of Fog." You like it? 
 I like how scared shitless that guy is. 
 How do you know he's scared? You can't even see his face. 
 If you saw somebody on the side of the road, broke down or in an accident or whatever, would you pull over and help? 
 Did you see somebody who needed help? 
 Maybe. 
 Did you help them? 
 No. 
 Do you feel guilty about it? 
 Not really. 
 I don't see the world like you do, Christian. 
 How do you see it? 
 Like that asshole. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 It's me. 
 No, I'm not drunk. 
 Will you just try to listen to what I have to say? 
 No! 
 Could you try to be a human being for just a second? 
 I'm not trying to... 
 No! 
 No, Mom, I... 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Oh, I... 
 [sobbing] 
 And if you open another one, you're gonna pour that down the drain, you stupid... 
 Woman : I am the best me I can be. 
 Where are you, Nate? 
 Nate? I left something in one of the rooms, and I lost the master key card. 
 Call me as soon as you get this. It's an emergency. 
 You will go out with your son tomorrow morning at 10:00.

♪ Ohh ♪ I have a confession to make. What? You'll think I'm awful. Maybe I already think you're awful. I came here for a blind date. ♪ Baby, it'll be all right ♪ What did you do, ditch the guy? No. I'm chickenin' out. I don't want to go through with it. Where were supposed to meet him? Back here. He was supposed to get us a table. I got scared, saw a place open up beside you at the bar, decided to-to get a drink and re-evaluate my options. I know. I'm a terrible person. How do you know I'm not the guy? What? What if I am the guy? Oh, you're not the guy. So, you want to hide out with me... is that it? You want to... use me? Well, if it's not too much trouble. I can't promise to be witty and engaging, but I will get the next round. I don't think we should. No? No. If we are really going to throw this guy off your trail, I think you should probably... have dinner with me. So, I get up at 4:00 every morning so I have time to write my book. I'm almost at 500 pages, single-spaced. What's it about? Well, I can't tell you that. You might steal my idea. I'm not gonna sit down and write a book. Well, it's about this guy named Lance. Mm-hmm. Short for "Lancelot." Lancelot? Like the... Like Sir Lancelot. No. My Lance is 35 and he still lives above his parents' garage and he works at a White Castle. World-class loser, right? But the thing about Lance is he has a million-dollar face. Mm-hmm. He looks exactly like Ryan Gosling. Like who? Ryan Gosling. He's an actor. He's a famous actor. He's very famous. Okay. So, Lance has been mistaken for Ryan Gosling 28 times. He counts the times? He counts... 28 times. And for the last two years, Lance has studied Ryan Gosling's films and interviews, the way he moves and walks and everything he does. Uh-huh. So, when Lance gets fired from White Castle, he says to himself... he says, "Lance, this is your moment. You're going after your dream." So, then it's all about how he uses his resemblance to storm the Broadway scene and Hollywood. And then what? Then you have to read it to find out. Love to. But the ending's gonna be tragic and funny at the same time. Does Lance get caught? Eventually, of course. Writing is very lonely, yes? I like being alone. You do? Well, your students must be very impressed that you are a writer. No. They just think I'm a boring high-school English teacher. 
 
 Mmm! Yes, please. Thank you. Tell me more about you. I have a sister. Older? Younger? Older. When was the first time you got drunk? I was in Italy with my sister. She got me drunk on Jack Daniel's. You don't say. The smell and... and the taste... I can't. I hate it. I hate it. But I drink everything else. Mmm. Ooh. ♪ To be alone with you ♪ Oh, I finished that one very quickly. I like to look at you. I love your accent. That went down good. Wait. One more. Cheers. Bioinformatics and how they can apply to cancer treatment. Bio what? Informatics. Advanced computer systems that can read biological data. It's a... it's a think tank. What do you do for them? Well, nothing, actually. I work for a philanthropist in Tampa. He is considering funding them. I'm here to check out the C.E.O. Philanthropy. Mm-hmm. Damn, Javier. You are doing good in this world. I have another confession. Yeah? What is that? I'm not a blonde.

I have a meeting this morning. With the think tank? Right. On a Sunday? I wanted to have breakfast with you. I'll have dinner. Are you staying here tonight? [turns off shower] I'd stay if you want to see me again. I'll have dinner with you tonight, definitely. You're dressed. Almost. Thank you. I'm gonna go back to my apartment, get a shower there. You can stay here while I'm gone. I need to let my dog out, get some papers graded. Okay. I'll see you tonight. Yeah. I need a car. Your car is waiting right here, ma'am, right here, right here.

Do we know each other? No, but there's a man coming here to kill you. I'm sorry... Look, I know this sounds crazy. A little bit. Who are you? Doesn't matter. His name is Javier. Your husband hired him. You should go. Chase. What? Your husband's name is Chase, right? Chase gave Javier a floor plan, a key to your house, a photo of you, and $50,000 to kill you. Look, I am trying to help you. Can you think of any reason your husband might want you dead, or is this a total shock? In two minutes, your husband is going to call you. He'll tell you he can't find his wallet. He'll ask you to go upstairs and check his bedside table. Can we take the car in the driveway? I-I'm not leaving with you. By the time your husband calls, it'll be too late. The point of the phone call is to get you upstairs so that Javier can break in and kill you. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop. No, but I thought... He's here. Is there a gun in the house? Yeah. Show me. [mobile phone vibrating] Answer it. Hi, baby. No. It's fine. Your wallet. Sure. I can check. I-I'm up here anyway. Your wallet's not up here. Do you want me to check downstairs or anywhere? Loaded? Okay. You and Tyler have fun. Call 911 now. Why are you running the shower? Did you call the police? Yes. Get in the closet. Hide behind your clothes, turn off your phone, and don't even breathe. Are you sure... Javier's here. The police aren't. We have to deal with this. [cocks gun] You have a shotgun pointed at your back. Don't turn around. Don't move. Drop the gun. Don't make the mistake thinking I'll tell you again. Kick it away. [gun slides across floor] Now put your hands above your head and turn around, slowly. So, you're not an English teacher. No. You're a cop. No. I was in your room yesterday when you and Chase came in. My room? I was in the closet, heard everything you said. You're a thief. Well then, we can work this out. How's that? May I get something out of my pocket? Slowly. The 4Runner in the driveway is new. There is a bag with fif... $50,000 in cash and all the info you need to kill Daphne. Take the car. Take the money. What, and you just kill Daphne anyway? Yes. Letty, go. Ever feel like you crossed a line you didn't see? Did my husband pay you to kill me? Daphne... Why? I've no idea. But I am sure you do. G-Give it to me. I could kill you right this second. Daphne, Daphne, calm down. Drop the keys on the floor. Take them. Get out of here. What are you talking about? The police are coming. They'll arrest you, too. Take his car and the money. I'm not leaving you alone. I'll be fine. Daphne, Daphne. You saved my life. Go! [car alarm chirps] [sirens approaching] ♪♪ Pathetic. Hi, Mom. I want to see Jacob. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Is he inside? You're violating your restraining order just standing there. I've got something for him. You want to give him something? Let it be your absence from his life. I mean, sh1t, at least give the kid a chance. You're so mean. I signed him up for baseball. Please, Mom, I haven't seen him in two years. I'll call the cops if that's what it takes to get you off my property. Five minutes. I'd say you've got about three. Please!

I'm sorry I've been dodging your calls. I'm sorry I'm getting back to you so late. I'm just... I'm sorry. Things went to hell in Asheville. So I took a little road trip that didn't turn out so great.
