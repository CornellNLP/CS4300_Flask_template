 You will go out with your son tomorrow morning at 10:00. 
 Buy some gas with a credit card. Go to Starbucks. 
 Establish a record of you not being in your house between 10:00 and noon. 
 You're going to find Daphne on the floor beside the sink, neck broken like she slipped. 
 There's a man coming here to kill you. 
 You're not an English teacher. 
 When I was young, watching movies, I always thought it was so stupid when they dump a body in the river. 
 I thought, "Why don't they make a friend at a funeral home and cremate the body?" 
 I got a call from your brother David last week. 
 He left a message. 
 All he said was he was returning your call. 
 I called him five years ago. 
 So he's called three times? 
 Yeah. 
 You think Ava knows what's up? 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Uncle Jav! 
 Daniela : Has he cooked for you? 
 Not yet. 
 You're a private chef, Uncle Jav. 
 A private chef? 
 I'm starving. 
 You just had a Big Mac an hour ago. 
 Gross. No, I didn't. 
 Yes, you did. 
 I had a double cheeseburger. There's a difference. 
 Well, the point is you ate food. 
 Now I want to eat again. 
 There's something wrong with you. 
 Would you please just find a place? 
 I have to concentrate. 
 I found a place. 
 This is a shopping mall. 
 This is a shopping mall. 
 I don't need clothes. I need food Well, at shopping malls, you can get both of those things. 
 Here. 
 What is happening? 
 You're going shopping. 
 Why? 
 Because you like going shopping. 
 Because we're going to my family dinner, and maybe you want something new to wear. 
 I have something new to wear. 
 Yeah, something you stole. 
 How would you know that? 
 Why do you care? 
 Because when you are with my family, I want you to wear something you bought, not something you stole from an innocent person. 
 There is a difference. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Do we need to keep arguing, or do you want to take this and go buy things with it? 
 [Sighs] 
 You're not coming with me. 
 Didn't say I was coming with you. 
 You don't get wardrobe approval.

 So, if you've been following my instructions, they will not find out.

 No thanks. I can kind of tell what'll work on me.

 Yeah. Get excited. 
 I hope you work on commission.

 What is this? "Pretty Woman?" 
 I told you go to Starbucks with your son. 
 I know. 
 You didn't go to Starbucks with your son? 
 He wanted to skateboard. I took him to the park. 
 There's these curbs that he likes. 
 He does trick on the curbs.

 I know! I know!

 You will not that, or you will die, too.

 No. 
 No one would find me.

 Why aren't you wearing your wig? 
 Why would I be wearing a wig? 
 The long blond one. You were wearing it when you met Ava. 
 No, I wasn't. 
 Yes, you were. 
 You're thinking of the selfie. 
 All week she's been asking if I was bringing my girlfriend Marilyn, so... 
 Marilyn Monroe? So she thinks I'm fat? 
 No. She thinks you're blond. 
 Ava knows I wear wigs. 
 "Marilyn" is only a compliment if you're already curvy. 
 If you're skinny, it means you need to lose weight. 
 Every woman knows this. 
 Well, she's from Argentina. 
 She doesn't have the same references. 
 Yes, she does. This sh1t is international. 
 Besides, if I wear the blond wig, I have to do the Southern accent, and Ava already knows I don't have a Southern accent. 
 So do your nieces. 
 Why would you have to do a Southern accent? 
 Because that's just the way it works. 
 What? 
 I'm not explaining it. 
 Fine. 
 Can you please make me a Negroni? 
 Okay, just help me to understand why we're here. 
 When Ava invited me to your family dinner, I thought it would be you, Ava, and the girls. 
 I didn't realize it would also be your parents who you haven't spoken to in like 20 years. 
 [Sighs] 
 My father paid for my sister to build this restaurant. 
 Tonight is a celebration of this achievement. 
 So they invited you? After all this time? 
 Yes. 
 Why? 
 Because my father had a heart attack, like I've also told you 64 times. 
 Yes, but you still haven't told me why you haven't spoken to anyone in your family since you were 16. 
 'Cause I don't talk about that to anyone. 
 Oh, that's healthy. 
 [Knife slams] 
 Is it okay that you not know something?! 
 Huh? 
 What? Why? When? Who? 
 You harass me with all the questions all the time. 
 But some people just don't like to talk about every single thing that has ever happened to them in their life. 
 I would think you would understand. 
 Have I ever asked you for all the details? 
 All the horrible sh1t you've been through? 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Now, do you think you can make me a Negroni without drinking all the gin behind the bar? 
 Possibly.

 Last guy I seriously dated... His family was from Delaware. 
 And? 
 That's it. That's the whole story.

 He just got back from a thing in Nassau. 
 For what?

 Jav, tell them the story about the... 
 I don't want to. 
 [Sighs] Fine. 
 So, okay. So, they wanted oysters flown in from Maine. 
 Five years ago, they're living on a farm in the Dominican Republic, and now they need oysters flown in from Maine? 
 Look, I need to get everything done before everyone arrives, so... 
 He found this world-famous oyster supplier, but what's so crazy is that she randomly only does the oyster thing as a hobby. 
 She's actually a lawyer. 
 Anyway, he had them flown in the cargo of some guy's private jet. 
 Which, uh, players were they, again? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Sports. [Laughing] Who cares? 
 Upton was one of them, right? 
 Upton and a couple of shortstops? 
 Okay, stop!

 Well, there are no lies in my family. 
 They know I'm a thief. 
 Does your family know what you do? 
 Oh, and, P.S., if you can cook, why bother with all that horrendous philanthropy sh1t? 
 Because. 
 Because? 
 Because when you tell different lies to different people, when something comes back to me through a third party, I know who's talking to who. 
 A third party? 
 Yes. 
 Seriously? 
 Yes. 
 You don't do that? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Because that would require time and energy better spent doing literally anything else.

 Someone is going to ask you what the book is called.

 "Any life, no matter how long and complex it may be, is made out of a single moment. 
 A moment when a man finds out once and for all who he really is." 
 Argentina's greatest writer said that. 
 Who was it? 
 Do you care, Carlos? 
 I guess not. No. 
 Carlos, can I borrow your son? 
 For what? 
 Tomasito, come. 
 Come here. 
 When Javier was 16 years old, he was a wild kid... motorcycles, hunting, girls. 
 But he always had a temper with his two brothers David and Carlos. 
 The only time that Javier was affectionate was with little Santino. 
 Here we go. 
 [Sighs] 
 Who's Santino? 
 Papa, please. 
 When the family's all together, it's important to recognize the ones who are not. 
 Okay. 
 Little Santino was the youngest, the baby, and Javier loved him very, very much. 
 He taught him how to fish, how to cook. 
 On little Santino's 7th birthday, Javier wanted to take him for a camping trip to Gran Chaco. 
 So they found one of the old Jeeps laying around the property, and off they went. 
 They were supposed to stay up until midnight for his birthday, but little Santino never made it to midnight. 
 How did it start again? 
 I was teaching Santino how to start a fire. 
 Teach him how to start a fire. 
 To a 7-year-old. 
 Well, little Santino might not have adhered very closely to Javier's instruction... because something that he did caused Javier to throw a rock at his head. 
 It was not a rock. 
 It was a small stone. Almost a pebble. 
 Santino was dancing around with a torch near the dry brush. 
 He almost started a forest fire for miles. 
 So to save his precious forest, Javier threw a rock at his little brother's head. 
 [Thump, woman gasps] 
 Just like that. 
 Santino said he was fine. 
 I'm sure he said he was fine. 
 But then he got tired, didn't he? 
 He wanted to lie down. 
 And what do you do with a head injury? 
 I didn't know. 
 Javier said, "You go lay down. 
 I'll wake you up at midnight for your birthday." 
 So little Santino went right to sleep. 
 When your brain starts to lose blood, you get drowsy first. 
 Always keep someone with a head injury awake, because the next morning, on his 7th birthday, little Santino did not wake up. 
 Javier went to sleep and forgot to wake him up at midnight. 
 He let him sleep all night long. 
 And before checking on him again, he went fishing. 
 He made a pot of coffee while Santino lay dead inside of a sleeping bag. 
 [Crying] It wasn't his fault. 
 He was only 16 years old. 
 He knew better. 
 He couldn't have saved him. 
 Yes, he could have saved him. You know this. 
 I spoke to a doctor. He was very clear. 
 They would detected the brain injury with a CAT scan. 
 They could have preformed surgery. 
 How many doctors did you ask before you found one that told you that? 
 He would be alive today if it weren't for you. 
 I'm certain of that. 
 I am sorry. 
 Of course you're sorry. You killed your little brother. 
 It makes sense to be sorry. 
 Are you done? 
 Yes. 
 I think I am, now that we have remembered little Santino.

 Ah, this guy died of natural causes. 
 Perhaps not so natural, huh? 
 Who are these people? What's happening? 
 Maybe Papa didn't have a heart attack, Ma. 
 I think it was a stroke. 
 Be a man and tell the truth! 
 Tell your mother and your sister and your brothers and little girlfriend! 
 Tell them so I don't have to listen to them begging me to let you back into the family. 
 I always knew, and now they all know. 
 You were a killer at 16, and you're a killer now. 
 You're evil. 
 And if you don't tell the truth, Silk will! 
 Tell them! 
 I have nothing to say. 
 Sure, you do. 
 Leave him alone. 
 Come on, tell them. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Ava : David! 
 Oh! 
 David! 
 Talk. 
 David, put down the gun! 
 [Gasps] 
 Put it down! 
 What is going on? 
 [Crying] 
 I will tell the truth... after you put down the gun. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 David, put down the gun! 
 Javier, what is this? 
 How many people did  you  kill? 
 Unh-unh. This is not about me. 
 That's what all of this is about. 
 You sit there accusing me of murder, when you are responsible for killing thousands of innocent people! 
 Aah! 
 Conchita : Stop! 
 What are you doing? 
 Javier's about to kill another one of your sons. 
 [Bullet thuds] 
 You forced me out of my family. 
 You left me with no one. 
 I was invisible. 
 Because of you, I've been totally alone since I was a kid. 
 Not because of me. 
 Because of you. 
 If it weren't for Ava... 
 I am here tonight because Ava told me that I could have my family back. 
 All of the beautiful people in this room. 
 And I thought if there was a chance that you would let me back in... 
 [Voice breaking] if you would really forgive me... 
 ...then I would forgive you. 
 I don't need forgiveness for anything. 
 [Breathes sharply] 
 I will never see you again. 
 Well, finally, we agree on one thing. 
 [Gasping] 
 Well... is everybody ready to go? 
 Yes? 
 My ice cream has melted. 
 So? 
 I'll go get the little ones. 
 Stay, Mama. I'll go get them. 
 Find the girls. 
 Why isn't everybody standing up?! 
 Ava. 
 Are you coming with your family? 
 Or are you staying with Javier? 
 Poor Javier. Like always. 
 I'm not going anywhere with you. 
 Well, as one of your investors, I recommend switching chefs, because the meat was overdone and the peaches were burnt. 
 Other than that, it's a beautiful restaurant. 
 You're welcome. 
 What is going on? 
 Someone will explain it to you. 
 Or I will explain it to you... one day. 
 I'll be in the kitchen. 
 Is it true? 
 You're not a private chef? 
 No. 
 Look, I got into this life because... 
 What life?! 
 A life of ending other people's lives? 
 Yeah, but these people, they're not... 
 Not what? Innocent? 
 You kill people? 
 No, you don't. 
 I know you don't do this. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sighs] 
 You believed him when he said you were a killer when you were 16. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Ava... 
 And he turned you into this. 
 Ay. [Breathes deeply] 
 Oh. [Sniffles] 
 No. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Ava. 
 Ava. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Go. Please... go. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Here. [Sniffles] 
 Take the car. I don't need it. 
 Okay. 
 I will. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 And I'll take you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sobs]
