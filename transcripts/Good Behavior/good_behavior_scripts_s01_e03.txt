 I'm Letty. 
 Javier. 
 There's a man coming here to kill you. 
 You're not an English teacher. 
 No. 
 You work for me now. 
 I'm not your... prisoner! 
 I need you to be my wife. 
 Is that your husband? 
 Uh-huh. 
 He's talking to my husband. 
 You don't have to kill him. 
 I do. 
 Right now. Let's get out of here. 
 Bill? 
 Robin, wait. 
 Aah! 
 Javier : We have to put the bodies in the trunk. 
 [Trunk closes] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Woman on recording :  I know that it's okay to ask for help. 
 I am calm in the face of conflict. 
 I know that my path has been unique, and I am grateful for that. [Scoffs] Javier : Is this a friend of yours? Who? I am right where I need to be right now. This woman who talks to you. In a way. She's an app. I am the creator of my own reality. How does she know you so well? I don't blame others for where I am. I had nothing to do with this. You are riding in a car with three people, and two of them are in the trunk. I didn't kill them. I choose to be the type of person... I only killed one of them. She was your fault, and you helped me put both of them in the trunk, so you will help me take them out of the trunk. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not smoking in this car. Then let me out of this car. You don't need me here! You don't need my help! Why can't you let me leave, and we're done? [Tires screech] To be crystal clear, I do need you here. I need your silence. I need you in my sight until it's done. Do you understand? Do you understand? Sure. So, what? You're gonna just dump them in a river or something? Or something. Something where? Charleston. Charleston. Charleston's very far away. 6 hours. 5 1/2 if we make good time. We'll need to find a charging station. We  will  find a charging station. I think that the touchscreen has a program that tells you where they are. Great. Oh, sh1t. We can't use it. They disabled the nav system so that they cannot track the car. Awesome. It's fine. There are apps. Like your friend, but for charging stations. We'll download an app. ♪ ♪ What's in Charles... Never mind. I don't even want to know. Good. I wasn't gonna tell you. And then I can go? Yes. ♪ Hard time forgiving ♪ 
♪ Even harder forgetting ♪ 
♪ Before you do something ♪ 
♪ You might regret, friend ♪ 
♪ Bricks are caving in ♪ 
♪ Oh, how sweet this sin ♪ 
♪ I left you the keys ♪ 
♪ You won't let me in ♪ 
♪ Hard time forgiving ♪ 
♪ Even harder forgetting ♪ 
♪ Before you do something ♪ 
♪ You might regret, friend ♪ Okay, so in standard mode, an 80% charge gets us 216 miles. How many miles do we have left? 153. And it's 322 miles to Charleston, so... Oh, this is like an SAT thing. Did you take the SATs? Yeah. I thought you dropped out of high school. I did. I did the SATs later. Like four years ago. A practice one at a Barnes & Noble one day. I did pretty well. But not at math. No, asshole. Not in math. In English. So if you ever want lessons, let me know. Did you find a charging station? No. I was downloading the app, and I just lost service. Holy sh1t. What? There's a thing called Ludicrous Mode. You are not touching anything in this car. Can I... No. Have you hosted or gambled on cock fights at any point this week? [Sighs] Simple, Gary... All you have to do to stay out of jail for the rest of your life is not go near cock fights. Yes. Yes, you understand, or yes, you've gambled on cock fights? What? Get out of here, Gary. [Sighs] [Door opens] [Christian sighs] [Door closes] [Dialing] [Ringing] Hi, Letty... Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. [Sighs] Christian. Yes, Todd. Hi. Hi. Your office is so great. [Sighs] Thank you. Every time. Been this way for six years. Except for Jacinda in accounting, you've been here the longest. A lot of turnover. Hope that changes. I'm trying to make that change. Yeah. I got your manifesto. Oh, good. It's around here somewhere. Still, you deserve the biggest office. You could run laps in here. What can I do for you, Todd? Nothing. Nothing. I was just, um... [Clears throat] Aren't you supposed to be in a check-in right now? No. It says at 11:30, you've got a check-in with Leticia Raines. I saw Letty this morning. She came in early at 7:00. Letty? What she goes by. Huh. What? Hmm? Nothing. It's nice to have that familiarity with your parolees, but don't get too close, right? Because I know why I wanted this career, which I'm sure is the same for you. You seem sure. I have to make some phone calls. Good. Love this office. Every time. Letty : How long before we run out of juice? Javier : 122 miles. 121. ♪ ♪ You know they're already looking for this car. No, not yet. Check-out is at 11:00. [Object clacks] Javier : Do you have service? No. [Sighs] Javier : Switch it to Airplane Mode and off. Letty : You say that like you didn't say it five minutes ago, like I haven't tried that five times. Try again. [Sighs] Oh. Okay. What? I have three bars. It's downloading. Good. It's taking forever. Woman :  Welcome to Carolina Fish Fry. Can I take your order? Yeah. I'm gonna have the flounder and shrimp combo platter with hush puppies and a Dr Pepper. What do you want? I'm sorry, I just need to... [Grunts] So many things. How am I gonna choose? I wouldn't take you for indecisive. I'm not except with food. Okay. Fried deviled crab? That could either way. Okay, I'm gonna have the flounder and shrime combo platter, also, but I want mine with fries and a Diet Coke. Since you're getting the same thing, do you want to do the family bucket? How much is it? $28.99. $28.99? Does it come with a lottery ticket? We'll just stick with our separate orders. Please drive around to the first window. [Cellphone chimes] Letty : Okay, there's a charging station in 31 miles. Javier : Good. But it takes us 10 miles out of our way. Of course it does. [Sighs] You're near-sighted. What? You need glasses to see far away. Oh. Not really. Here. Try these. Wow. What does that sign say? "Try the new anus pounder." [Both laugh] [Clears throat] Yeah. [Clears throat] There you go. Have a good day. Oh, I can't eat this. You have to eat. It smells. It's the food. It's the bodies. ♪ ♪ [Thud] sh1t. You okay? Yeah. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I... My kids are just driving me... They're not driving, obviously. Oh, my gosh. I think we should exchange insurance cards and information. No. I definitely think we should, 'cause you never know. It's not necessary. Well... You stopped pretty abruptly. What are you talking about? At the light. You came to a screeching halt. You're joking. It was very out of the blue. I was already stopped. Oh, I don't think so. Okay. It doesn't matter what you think 'cause you were behind me. So it's your responsibility. I think that maybe we should call the cops, actually. It would be much better for you if we don't call the cops. No, no. My husband would want me to. Yeah, well, it was your fault. Then I'll just call them. Your car is fine, right? [Scoffs] I don't know. Yes, your car is fine. Yeah, but yours isn't. I mean, look at your trunk. It doesn't even... I'll fix it. You don't need to. Okay, look. I think that we should exchange information and get a policeman to write up a little thing. That way, there is no disagreements and then no one's coming after each other later because this happened to me once before. I'm sure it did. And I didn't get any insurance information or anything, and my husband just... This is supposed to recognize your thumbprint, but... Are you gonna sue them, Mom? Stay in the car, Bryce. Your trunk is broken. Mommy is handling this! Stay in the car. I need to take a picture of your license plate. Excuse me. You don't need to. Excuse me. Babe, I think we need to head to the hospital. Oh, God. Yeah. Something doesn't feel right. I think I might be... She was kicking, but now she's not. Oh, my God. Uh... Go. You need to go to the hospital. I'm Melanie, by the way. Do you want me to call you somebody? An ambulance, or...? No, I think we'll get there faster if we just... Right. If you just go. Now. But if there was damage to your car... I don't think that there was any damage. Mom! Shut the hell up, Bryce! I'm so sorry. Go. Go. There's no damage. Great. Thanks. Oh. Javier : There. Go. What did you just push? Go. Whoa! Holy sh1t! [Tires squeal] Wow. Wow! [Sighs] [Trunk lid clacking] You got to tie that thing down or something. It's bouncing. When we get to the charging station. How much further? 6 miles on the right in a gas station. [Bag rustling] How can we be down to 19? We were at 51 at the fish place. Well, I'm sure it had something to do with your Ludicrous Mode. My Ludicrous Mode? Yeah. It probably ate up the battery. Are you saying I shouldn't have pushed that button? I'm just saying it's why the battery ran out faster. That bitch was trying to take a picture of our plates when we drove off. We would have been totally screwed as soon as they put out an APB on this thing. We should have just driven away normally. To a hospital to save your wife's baby? Yeah, that was good. You did good with that. Yeah, I did good with that. And I still haven't heard a thank you, have I? I guess not. You were trying to convince that insane woman not to call the cops, which no one without two bodies in the trunk would do. They'd be like, "No sh1t we're calling the cops because you rear-ended my... Tesla." Shut up. Don't tell me to shut up. Don't  ever  tell me to shut up. You sound like my mother. Thank you. For what you did back there. ♪ ♪ [Sighs] Okay. Here we go. He's not coming for us. You don't know that. Say it out loud, and it might come true. But he'll definitely pull us over if you don't start driving faster. I am going the limit. You have to go five over if you don't want to look like a pussy fugitive. [Siren wails] [Sighs] What's going to happen? Just let me do the talking. [Keys clack] [Sighs] [Sobbing] What's wrong? You've been to prison, right? No, I haven't. Okay. So, that's what's wrong. ♪ ♪ I can't go back there. I can't. If I go back... You will never see your son. [Sobbing continues] ♪ ♪ 
 
 [Bell dings] Where are you going? Throwing away the food. And where are you going now? To pee. Is that okay? No. Last time I let you use the bathroom at a gas station, you tried to jump out the window. Then you don't trust me. I don't. Then how about you let me go pee all by myself, and when I come right back here, you can trust me a little bit more? Get in the car. If I get in the car, I will pee on the seat. It's by the left light at the back. [Doorbell jingles] Man : You need a key. For the bathroom. Thanks. How much weed do you have? [Massive Attack's "Dissolved Girl" plays] [Console beeps] [Console beeps] ♪ Shame ♪

♪ I need a little love to ease the pain ♪ [Knock on door] Man : Ma'am? Just a minute. ♪ ♪ Sorry. I just unlocked the next level on "Mister Jump." Congrats. Thanks. I've never played that one before. It's addictive. Well, your boyfriend or whatever is out there, and I wanted to go put this sign on the charging station, but I couldn't leave you in here alone. I'm the only one here, so I can't walk outside if there's a customer. You know, just in case of, like, shoplifting or whatever. So the charger doesn't work? It's a real piece of sh1t. It likes to work, I don't know, once every two weeks or so. Tried to tell the jackass who installed it, but he was just like, "What?" Do you know if the next station is close by? Um, there's one in Greenville. And I think it's actually a supercharger station. Like, the one that's meant for your car. Should give you a full charge in like... An hour. I know. How far is it? To Greenville? Mm, like 40 miles. Like 40, 50 miles. We only have 13 miles left. Do you have a regular outlet? It takes forever. Do you have a 240-volt? Yeah. Still takes forever. If we charge it for an hour-and-a-half, it'll get us to Greenville. [High-pitched whine] [Muffled] You got the cord in your trunk? What? The cord should be in your trunk. Is there a charging cord in the trunk? Where the hell have you been? Figuring this sh1t out. We can charge the car in an outlet at the side of the building right there. Is there a cord in the trunk? Yes. But I just fixed the trunk. Okay. The trunk is closed. I hope not permanently. No, with duct tape. Where'd you get duct tape? I always have duct tape. Trick of the trade? It's not a trick. It's just tape. [Door opens] [Tesla chimes] There. That's it, right there. Okay. [Bag rustles] I'm out. Don't... Don't smoke at a gas station. Why not? Why not let the place go up in flames? Make this a lot easier. [Sighs] [Lighter clicks] Just tell me if someone's looking. I'm looking. If someone else is looking. Nobody's looking. No one cares about you. [Grunts] [Trunk lid closes] Oh. Christian. Yes? You're the man I'm looking for. It seems that way. Ha! You're always so funny. Remember how you said you had a check-in with that woman this morning at 7:00? Letty? Right. Letty. But as I was doing the time sheets, I realized you weren't in at 7:00 a.m. I don't do time sheets. Of course not. I know. But I was looking at everybody else's time sheets, and I was checking on something with Rashida, and Rashida said you rode the elevator with her this morning. Okay. Meaning you and Rashida got here at the same time. At 8:00 A.M. [Laughs] You're checking up on me? No, I just couldn't read Rashida's handwriting on her time sheet, so I asked her, and she said [Imitating Rashida] "I got here at 8:00 A.M. And you can ask Christian 'cause we rode up the elevator together." Are you doing a black voice? I'm gonna use the bathroom now. Okay. [Door opens] ♪ ♪ Javier : He looks like you. Don't be a dick. You have the same eyebrows. Yeah. I want to get him back. I know. I think you can. You do? Yeah. If you stop screwing up. I'm trying. Try harder. Well, I'm trying real hard to get away from you. I think that would be a step in the right direction, don't you? Young man : [Groans] Young man #2 : Come on. Come on! We leave now. We can't. It's only been charging for 15 minutes. The police will be here. It needs to charge for at least an hour. What you got? Hey. I've already called the cops. ♪ ♪ [Young men grunting, shouting indistinctly] Letty : So, what's the plan? The charging station is 40 miles away. 40 or 50. We'll stop at the next gas station and charge it in a regular outlet. But if they don't have a 240-volt, if it's just a regular plug, we only get 3 to 4 miles per hour of charging. Then we will stop many times. Can you just please let me go? No. [Sighs] There. [Keyboard clacking] Ah, come on. How'd you get so good at this? I'm not so good. You're just so bad. [Laughs] [Telephone rings] [Telephone beeps] Hello? Is this Estelle Raines? Yes, it is. Who's this? I'm your daughter's parole officer. Okay. I can't seem to track her down. Um, it doesn't mean anything is terribly wrong. Sure it does. I'm sorry? How well do you know my daughter? Any idea where she might be? [Sighs] Not a clue. Thank you. [Telephone beeps] ♪ ♪ Give me my money! ♪ ♪ [Thunder rumbles] This doesn't look good. It said gas and food in five miles. You saw the same sign I did. Maybe it was five miles to the exit but then the station was further. I know as much as you do. [Sighs] [Inhales, exhales deeply] [Cellphone rings] [Cellphone beeps] Hello? Hi, there. I'm looking for Letty. Letty. Yes. Letty Raines? Yes. [Scoffs] I haven't seen her in years. [Chuckles] She still alive? Hope so. Anyway, sorry to bother you... Whoa. Who the hell is this? [Dial tone] Woman : [In distance] I thought you were meditating! I mean, I talked to her a few weeks ago. She seemed good, like she was getting back on her feet. Is she okay? Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. You're Christian, right? I mean, not like in the Jesus way. Like, your name is Christian? Yes. Letty told me about you. She, uh... She really likes you. That's nice to hear. If you talk to her, will you please tell her to call me? For sure. Yeah. Thank you. [Receiver clacks] ♪ ♪ Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. [Door closes] [Sighs] There. Get your phone charger to see if there's power. Whoa. Smart. Thank you. [Thunder rumbles] No juice. Oh, my gosh. Can we just bury the bodies out here somewhere? We? No. You. Obviously, you. No one will see... I can't believe I'm saying this. Yeah, me neither. Stop talking. What is in Charleston? No, if I'm here with you, if I'm part of this, I want to know why we have to go all the way to Charleston when this could have been over. Tell me. [Sighs] When I was young, watching movies, I always thought it was so stupid when they dump a body in the river or a lake or dug a hole in the ground. The body still exists. It will be found. The killer will be found eventually. A body must disappear completely. I thought... Why don't they make a friend at a funeral home... ...and cremate the body? ♪ ♪ Because you have to trust that person. Yes. You do. [Sighs] [Console chimes] There's no way we're going to make it, so what is your plan? [Console chimes] I think we're stopping here. [Thunder rumbles] [Insects chirping] Do you have service? No. You? No. So, that was it? You watched movies as a kid and thought you'd do a better job at killing people and getting away with it? No. [Thunder rumbles] So, how did you get into this esteemed profession? Maybe I'll tell you one day. One day? This is the one day you got. There might be more days. I really hope not. This is what I'm good at. [Scoffs] Yeah. You're doing just great. [Chuckles] Everything would have been just fine if you hadn't messed it all up. You must be joking. Not at all. Letty : I didn't want to mess it all up. I didn't want to be involved in this at all. You got involved when you decided to steal from my hotel room, when you hid in my closet, when you followed me, when you slept with me, when you lied, when you took my money! Bullshit! You didn't have to kidnap me from a hotel room and force me to be your accomplice! I saved your life! Why? I don't know. Well, thank you, my prince. I'm so glad to be alive right now. All alone in the middle of nowhere with a murderer, two dead bodies, and no way out. I can't thank you enough for rescuing me. I am sorry. What? But this... This is what is happening. Let me out. You're not going anywhere. Let me out. Let me go. Let me out! ♪ ♪ Help! I need help! Man : Need a lift? Yes. No, we're fine. We're fine. We already called for help. No, we didn't. We don't have service. He's always trying to be so macho. "I can fix it myself," you know? How about I give you a ride into town for a tow truck while he stays out here with the car, hmm? You wouldn't want to leave a Tesla out here by itself, broke down or not. That's perfect. Thank you. Be right back. [Thunder rumbles] ♪ ♪ So, what's your name? Annie. Annie. I like that name. [Chuckles] Annie. [Chuckles] Does your husband like it? He says he does, but people lie. Not me. Good. So, you'll drop me off at the tow truck place in town like you said? What else did you have in mind? All kinds of things. Me, too. I know what you have in mind. You a psychic? [Chuckles] No. Don't have to be. Okay. You're thinking about pulling off onto one of these little exits, pretending it's the exit for the town, but really, it's just a dark road like the one we broke down on. And you're thinking about how you're gonna park the car in a field and tell me how pretty I am. And I'm going to smile and beg you to... me. In the mouth and everywhere else. I'm gonna tell you to cum on my tits. And I'm going to love it. ♪ ♪ You're goddamn right. It's not going to happen. [Exhales sharply] You're going to keep your promise. Yes, ma'am.

Christian. He seems cool. Is he hot? He sounded hot. Anyway, he's looking for you, which you probably already know. I hope you're okay. P.S.... I am on the planning committee for the 15-year high school reunion. Can you believe it? It's on Saturday. We're old. Call me. [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] You really are a stalker. You know that. You're alive. Sort of. Now I've covered for you twice. I knew you would. Stop... around! Are you drunk? No, are you? Not yet. Listen to me. I don't know where you are, but you will be in my office tomorrow. I'm not in Asheville. Letty, I'm drilling this into your head. I'm not covering for you again. Okay. I will be fired, which isn't as bad as what will happen to you. You'll mean they'll send me back to prison? [Sighs] Yes. That's exactly what I mean. Great. Don't say that. You'll have no chance of getting your son back. Well, prison is a hell of a lot easier than it is out here. There's a schedule, a job, no drugs, no booze. Well, some drugs and booze if you have the right friends like I did. You still have those kind of friends? What, you mean bad influences? I've got one right now. Who is it? He's a parole officer. He used to be a professor, but he got caught buying drugs from a student. Why are you throwing that in my face? So you know how it feels. I  know  how it feels. I'm sorry. How is he a bad influence?
