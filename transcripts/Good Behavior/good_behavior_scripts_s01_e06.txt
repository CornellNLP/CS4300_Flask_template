 What's this? 
 Heroin. 
 Tiffany found your fine china. 
 It is against the law for you to be with your son. 
 You really think it's a good idea for you to be seen with him in public? 
 If you don't find her and send her back to jail in the next 24 hours, you're fired. 
 When I want to get high, the only thing to replace that need is doing other crazy sh1t. 
 Like stealing. 
 Javier : Someone stole $200,000. 
 No sh1t. 
 $211,000, to be exact. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Yeah, it's fine. You go over there. 
 I am going over here. 
 No. It's all good. Just stay there. 
 And think about what you did to my sister. 
 Oh, my God. 
 And about your lies after. 
 And when you see her at our family dinner, which she generously invited you to, you can continue lying. 
 For the millionth time, I did not take the money! 
 What would you think if you were me? 
 I would think about getting some really expensive therapy to address my trust issues. 
 Can you see me in therapy? 
 Maybe I will leave you here and will go back to ask your friend Christian. 
 You mean my parole officer? 
 If he knew I took that money, I'd be in jail. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 He's your ex-parole officer. He quit. 
 You encouraged him to quit. 
 Is he as good a liar as you? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Is your story safe with him when someone like me demands the truth? 
 Here, just take it. 
 Take it. Come on. 
 Don't be gentle. Turn it inside out. 
 Rip out the lining if you want to. 
 Nothing is gonna make that money appear. 
 If I stole $211,000, I would have Jacob. 
 [Car door opens] 
 It might be enough money to buy him off my mother for good. 
 Start a life with him somewhere else. 
 So,  that's  why I'm taking you home. 
 No, because I don't have the money. 
 So why am I taking you home? 
 Because I have $1,000, which gets me one day, which is better than nothing. 
 And what is different from last time? 
 What? 
 From the last time you went home. 
 It did not go well. You called me to come get you. 
 Just because I can't make a life in that town doesn't mean I don't want Jacob. 
 Okay, so how will you make sure it doesn't get all... up again? 
 Hmm? What will you do differently? 
 I thought you would help. 
 But you really don't have to. 
 I know.

 Wait. Wait. 
 One more time.

 I'm a private chef. 
 One of my clients asked me to cater an event for her. 
 You were hired as a waiter at that event. 
 You dropped a tray. Your manager yelled at you. 
 I defended you. 
 We stayed and ate all the leftover dessert together until the sun came up. 
 No, we didn't. 
 We did not stay and eat all the leftover dessert together until the sun came up. 
 I thought you wanted details. 
 I want good details. 
 What kind of event was it? 
 I don't know. 
 This is my mother. You have to take this seriously. 
 Like you did with my nieces? 
 Exactly. 
 You told them you deleted vaginas from Instagram. 
 Right. That's a good detail. 
 But you made it up on the spot. We didn't agree to that detail. 
 I would  never  agree to that detail. 
 Great. And I'm asking you to agree with me on details, because clearly you can't come up with them on the spot like I can. 
 You have to know your story. 
 I always know my story. 
 This is different. 
 People ask follow-up questions when you don't kill them in the first five minutes. 
 What kind of event was it? 
 I don't know. [Sighs] 
 The Raleigh-Durham Philanthropic Society. 
 I donated my services. 
 Stop trying to fit in that philanthropy bullshit. 
 People like it. 
 My mother will see through it. It's completely unrealistic. 
 Fine. Then you decide what is realistic. 
 Please, Letty, what is realistic? 
 We met at a bar mitzvah. 
 We met at a bar mitzvah. 
 Perfect. That's all you say.

 Where's Estelle? 
 Her and Rob went to the lake. 
 What time will they be back? 
 She said 6:00. 
 Where's Jacob? 
 He's in the kitchen. 
 Jacob? 
 He has his earphones in. 
 How much are you getting paid? 
 40 bucks. 
 I'll give you $60 and you'll get the day off. 
 For what? 
 To let a mother spend a day with her son. 
 Aren't you a meth head? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Letty : I bet you have a boyfriend, right? 
 Right. 
 What do you think your boyfriend's doing while you're busy here? 
 Playing "Madden." 
 He told you that? 
 I made that mistake once. 
 Know where he was? 
 Dick deep in my bestie. 
 Xander wouldn't do that. 
 Yeah, but would your bestie? 
 I can't just leave. 
 I'm supposed to take Jacob to baseball. 
 I'll take him to baseball. 
 You're not allowed to be around him. 
 Look, I'm sure Estelle told you that. 
 But I'm his mom, and I love him. 
 And Estelle made up that meth-head bullshit. 
 I mean, do I look like a meth head? 
 No. 
 So you tell me, what's it gonna take to get you back on Xander's dick before that skank gets there first? 
 $80? 
 Are those Jimmy Choos?

 Jacob : No. Up!

 Um, good. 
 Here. 
 Never let me take your phone again, okay? 
 Why did you take the watch? 
 I would have bought you anything you wanted. 
 Tell her. 
 I took it for you. 
 I thought you would think it would be cool. 
 A watch from this place? 
 No. 
 That I stole it. 
 He knows about your rap sheet. 
 He almost started one of his own. 
 Don't worry. They're not gonna press charges.

 You can take him home. 
 Okay. 
 Woman on P.A. :  Attention all shoppers, don't forget to open your ShopMaxx credit card today. 
 I don't get it, Tiff. 
 After... Why are you being so nice to me? 
 Can we talk? 
 Letty : Where is Kyle now? 
 I don't know. 
 He's been sleeping in his office, I think. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Shirley brings him food. 
 So are you guys official? 
 I don't know what that means. 
 Like exclusive. 
 I don't know what we are. 
 Tiffany : He is hot. 
 I know. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, um, I need to ask you a question and I need you to be real with me. 
 What do you think the chances are that Kyle gets better? 
 I mean, no one starts out doing drugs thinking they'll end up sucking dick under a bridge. 
 Jesus. You think that's what he's doing? 
 No, not yet. But eventually maybe. 
 [Crying] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, stop. 
 I have no idea what the hell's going to happen. 
 Look, let's just talk to Kyle. 
 Let's talk to Kyle and we'll figure it out. 
 Okay? 
 All right. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Let me go first. Please stay here. 
 [Moaning] 
 Jesus. Get off me, dude. 
 [Groans] Get the hell off me. 
 What? Dude, why'd we even bother with a safe word? 
 Wait. Wait. Letty, wait! 
 Your business is your business, dude. 
 I don't care. I didn't see anything. 
 Don't. Tiffany is outside. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 She wanted to talk. 
 Jesus. 
 Look, if you don't want her to see you right now, you have to get away from the door. 
 But if you don't tell her in like the next five days, I will. 
 Don't, please. Just listen to me. Okay? 
 What do you think she's doing in there? 
 Do you know all of the stuff she's done? 
 Your mom? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Do you still like her? 
 I do. 
 Why? 
 When she wants something, she... she takes it. 
 Nah, not like that. 
 Well, obviously, yes, also like that, but... 
 No, I mean... she doesn't settle. 
 She's always striving for something... for more. 
 To have more. To... To be more. 
 To love more. 
 [Exhales sharply] And that is not easy. 
 You know, all the other grown-ups, we... we pretend we're stuck. 
 What did he say? 
 He wasn't there. He's in court. 
 Then what took so long? 
 Jacob : Mom. 
 What is it, sweetie? 
 Nana just texted that she and Rob just left the lake. 
 sh1t. What time is it? 
 How far is the lake from the house? 
 Like 25 minutes. 
 How far away are we? 
 About the same. 
 Let's go. 
 [Horn honks, tires screech] 
 Faster. 
 I can't. 
 Faster! 
 I can't. 
 You went faster for soccer balls. 
 It doesn't... The babysitter is gone. 
 Your mother will know you were with him. 
 She'll know I took him away from the house. 
 She can't know that. You hear me? 
 We never left the house. 
 Jacob : Yeah. 
 That's why I didn't have the security guy call Nana. 
 You rock big-time. Thank you. 
 It was fun. 
 The stealing. I get it now. 
 It's only fun if you don't get caught. 
 Fine. Correction... Stealing is not fun under any circumstances. 
 Oh, sh1t. Is that Rob's truck up there? 
 Yep.
