 Previously on AMC's  Hell On Wheels... 
 Need you to come with me to New York. 
 Word came back to us that you didn't survive the winter. 
 Word was wrong. 
 Here. We start hitting real Indian country hard. Some friendly, some not. 
 You ever been in Indian territory? 
 The United States Calvalry was not built for waiting. 
 Major new commercial hub. 
 The most important railroad city in the United States. 
 Weren't you in jail just a month ago? 
 You're an evil son of a bitch. 
 Whoa! 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Come on. 
 Y'all want to be out here after dark with the Indians about? 
 I sure as hell don't. 
 Two knots on either side of the wire. 
 Loop the ends around the glass. 
 I know! 
 Aah! 
 Get down, Dutch. 
 Throw me the hammer. 
 [Hammer pounding] 
 Ow! 
[Shouts] 
 [Groans] Damn redskin savages. 
 I find the ones who done this, I'll pike their heads to every pole between here and Omaha. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Over there! 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Somebody's coming in! 
 Something coming down the line. 
 Spyglass. 
 Who the hell is that? 
 We need some more men down there! 
 Heads up. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 [Metal groaning] 
 Indians killed us, rustled our cattle. 
 I played possum while they done this to me. 
 How many dead? 
 Five. 
 Six if I die. 
 Think they can sew my hair back on? 
 Think you ought to stop talking and put your hat back on. 
 Throw up a hook. 
 Get him back to Hell On Wheels, gentle but fast. 
 Come on. 
 Wire's hot. 
 Send this to the fort. 
 Go. 
 "Indian attack U.P. cattle pens," stop. 
 "Five dead, 300 head rustled, pursue and kill Indians," stop. 
 "No mercy," stop. 
 "C. Bohannon." 
Got that? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Send it. 
 We'll pick up the trail at the cattle pens. 
 Best we wait for the soldiers. 
 No guarantee Major Bendix ain't out on patrol. 
 Them Indians made off with all the beef we got for a month. 
 Let's ride wish there were more of us. 
 Wish he hadn't smashed hisself with that damn hammer.

Range War 
Originally Aired August 17, 2013 
 Bury 'em proper. 
 Tell Sean to put the crews on half rations. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Cut crews ain't gonna like that especially. 
 Next step down's boiled leather. 
 Ain't gonna like that neither, less'n I find these damn cattle. 
 You and me going after a raiding party that just killed five men and stole 300 head? 
 Any luck, we'll run into Bendix, drive his cattle home. 
 You're the Chief of Railroad Police, ain't you? 
 Well, this here is rustling and murder. 
 Let's go. 
 Tell Eva I'm out riding for another day or so, all right? 
 Come on. 
 [Train horn blows] 
 Mr. McGinnes. 
 Ruth. 
 You weathered the winter well? 
 Yes. 
 I'm working for Mr. Bohannon now. 
 I'm his new Administrator of Accounts. 
 That's wonderful. 
 I've been praying you'd find your way. 
 I myself was never lost, Ruth. 
 I was on a wrong path. 
 The butcher is a charitable man. 
 Gave me some trimmings for stew. 
 Well... Good day to you, then. 
 Ruth. 
 Save your prayers for someone who may need them. 
 Yourself perhaps. 
 [Coin clinks] 
 Had to be 20 to 30. 
 Fierce, death in their eyes. 
 Shot at least... 
 Seven myself. 
 Earlier you said you were asleep when they attacked. 
 Well, the arrow in my back woke me. 
 Your gun only carries six rounds, but you shot seven braves? 
 I told you it was dark. 
 Did you pay your nickel, lady? 
 Yes, against my journalistic principles, I've paid you three times for three different versions of your story. 
 Good, then. Hey, where you going? 
 Hey, story's here. 
 I got it, thanks. 
 I like your hair. 
 [Screaming] 
 Do something. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Hushing] 
 Hey, hey. Shh. 
 Get back to work. 
 All right. 
 [Sobbing] Oh! 
 Do something for her. 
 Why don't you go to the bar, have a drink? 
 Go on. 
 [Continues sobbing] 
 [Clears throat] What is it? 
 Old whore sickness. 
 Can you give her something for the screaming? 
 I got customers next door. 
 [Cap pops] 
 Easy, Sara. Here we go. 
 Here. Shh. 
 I don't mean to be ugly... 
 I know. 
 But I'm trying to run a business. 
 I know, you been good letting her stay for free, giving her boyfriend free handouts. 
 How long, Eva? 
 I don't know. 
 I can't have her... 
 I can't have her pass on here. 
 It's a whorehouse. It's not a hospital. 
 Yes, and you're a pimp, not a physician. 
 There's a big difference. 
 Young lady, you have no understanding of our world here. 
 Things are becoming much clearer to me every day. 
 I take care of my girls, I do. 
 Mickey, thank you. 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 [Spits] 
 That ain't dye. 
 It's paint. 
 This ain't no war pony. 
 Cattle weren't rustled by the Indians. 
 We ain't got us an Indian problem. 
 Got us a white man problem. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 That's them. 
 Wonder where they put the cattle. 
 One of 'em's gonna tell us. 
 Just gonna walk up and ask? 
 Mm, couple are asleep. 
 Couple of 'em's full drunk. 
 One's naked in the river. 
 I'm counting on the rest of 'em to be bad shots. 
 Which ones you want? 
 Ow! 
 Reckon I'll take the drunks. 
 And that dumbass in the river. 
 Yep, don't kill 'em all. 
 Hoping they don't kill all of us.

 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Screams] 
 Over there! 
 Aah! 
 [Grunts] 
 Nope. 
 Uh-uh. 
 Where the cattle at? 
 Upriver. We passed 'em off. 
 To who? 
 [Cocks pistol] 
 You best tell him who you're working for. 
 Chet Achison put the gang together. 
 Take me to him. 
 That's him. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 So... 
 What was the plan, son? 
 We's to ride into Omaha, get paid out at the restaurant there. 
 Who in Omaha? 
 It's Durant. 
 He's behind this. I know he is. 
 I'm taking you into the sheriff in Omaha. 
 You try to run, I will kill you. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Yeah, it'll work. 
 [Grunts] 
 Damn it, Elam. 
 [Bell clanging, train horn blows] 
 Sir! 
 I believe this is yours. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Can I help you, sir? 
 My name's Declan Toole. 
 I received word of my brother Gregory's death. 
 I believe he'd have been familiar in saloons. 
 Did you by chance know him? 
 My friend, I was honored to give the eulogy at your brother's funeral. 
 Thank you. 
 I don't drink the whiskey. 
 And you are? 
 Mickey McGinnes. 
 This is my place. 
 Pleased. 
 If it's not too much trouble, could you tell me a little about the circumstances of my brother's death? 
 Let's sit. 
 [Groans] 
Shh. 
 It's the only thing I know to stop the bleeding... 
 Pack her with hot rags sprinkled with wheat dust. 
 Is that an Indian remedy? 
 No. 
 It's my German aunt. 
 It's only temporary, though. 
 [Sighs] 
 One day, it'll come on, and I won't be able to stop it. 
 What causes it? 
 [Grunts] A whore's life. 
 She had a good run, though. It's almost two years. 
 How old is she? 
 19, I think she said. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Sighs] Is she still working? 
 No. Jack takes care of her. 
 He's in love with her. 
 They're both touched in the head. 
 [People shouting] 
 Ugh! 
 Mr. Bohannon, your, uh, your companion looks unwell. 
 Yeah, I told him not to run. 
 Whiskey! 
 Time for a little talk. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 Now, I got 3,000 workers to feed. 
 You got my cattle. I want it back. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 You hired some men to kill my pen crew and rustle my cattle. 
 Those are very serious accusations in a place like this, Bohannon. 
 See, 'cause I figure you canceled the railroad's beef contracts, and then you did this. 
 You're trying to starve us out. 
 I canceled the railroad contracts because I am no longer in a position to sell beef to the railroad. 
 Although, through some new acquaintances, I can broker a price of $28 a head. 
 [Scoffs] 
 sh1t, I wouldn't buy from you for a nickel a head. 
 Mr. Durant. 
 Sheriff. 
 Who shot Bubba Wade? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Mm, Durant hired him and some others to kill a U.P. crew and rustle my cattle, and I want 'em back. 
 You got proof? 
 This one here, he's a witness. 
 The judge of this town prefers his witnesses to be of the breathing kind. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Sheriff, this... this is Mr. Cullen Bohannon. 
 He is the new head of the Union Pacific Railroad. 
 He seems to have lost his cattle and is under the mistaken impression that I am somehow responsible. 
 He did the rustling. He did the hiring. 
 Mr. Durant ain't left town in three days. 
 Now, Bubba here was wanted for rustling, and rustling's a hanging crime. 
 Come see me if you want your reward. 
 Now clean up this mess. 
 Then clear out. 
 Thank you, sheriff. 
 
 
 
 How dare you come in here and make these accusations? 
 I had nothing to do with these purported murders and thievery. 
 Who do you think I am? 
 You're capable. 
 You overestimate me, Bohannon. 
 [Chuckles] What... 
 All right, what the hell are you doing out here, then? 
 I am a businessman building a railroad hub out here on the prairie. 
 Now get this corpse away from my table. 
 This ain't over. 
 Indeed it is not. 
 Ah, thank you. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Got to telegraph the fort, call off Bendix. 
 Like putting a mad dog back on a chain. 
 Mr. Bohannon. 
 Maggie Palmer. 
 I own the Circle P Ranch. 
 Quite a spectacle in there. 
 Sorry to ruin your supper, ma'am. 
 Mm, that was the most entertainment we've had around here for weeks. 
 I like your style. 
 Obliged. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 I can offer you all the cattle you need for your railroad, $25 a head. 
 No offense, ma'am, but I know what market prime is. 
 Kind of volume I'm looking for, you ought to offer me a quarter over prime, fixed rate, for three years. 
 75¢ over prime, two years. 
 50¢ over prime, three years, or end of project, whichever comes first. 
 Done. 
 Why, uh, why are you offering me a deal that might cost you later? 
 Oh, I've made the better deal, Mr. Bohannon. 
 There's a range war coming, and your railroad is about to drive right through it. 
 Good day. 
 You saved that girl's life. 
 Yeah. 
 Here. 
[Baby coos] 
 Mm. Maybe for the time being. 
 How did you survive the life of a prostitute? 
 [Sighs] I was lucky. 
 The whoring business wasn't too good for me. 
 You know, white men thought I was dirty 'cause I'd lived with the Indians, so I could only charge cut rate. 
 [Chuckles] 
I mean, don't get me wrong. 
 If you wanted me, I would give you a big ride. 
 But just not that many wanted me. 
 Except for Mr. Ferguson. 
 [Baby whimpers] 
 And your late husband? 
 Yeah. 
 I've heard the story. 
 I reckon between the two of them, it's how come I survived it. 
 Well, they both loved you. 
 They say never fall in love with a whore. 
 It always ends bad. 
 Like Mr. Toole. 
 You know, I... 
 I'm the reason he's dead. 
 Ain't no two ways about it. 
 I've put a curse on everything. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Knock at door] [Baby crying] 
 Who is it? 
 Declan Toole. 
 Gregory's brother. 
 What do you want? 
 A word, ma'am. 
 So the curse has come calling. 
 Now ain't a good time. 
 I've come a long way. 
 Did you not get my letter stating my intentions? 
 It was read to me, but... 
 I can't marry somebody I ain't ever met before. 
 It's our custom to marry my brother's widow, become a father to his child. 
 It's not my custom. 
 May I at least see my niece? 
 She-she’s sleeping. 
 [Baby crying] 
 And I don't open the door to strangers after dark. 
 I'm not a stranger. 
 I'm your brother-in-law. 
 [Crying continues] 
 Please go away, Mr. Toole. 
 Don't be coming around here no more. 
 [Birds calling] 
 How bad is it, Mr. Anderson? 
 Oh, axle's nearly sheared in two. 
 Can you repair it? 
 Yeah. 
 We'll have to remove everything from the wagon to lighten it, eh? 
 Then I can cut the sapling and replace the axle until we get to the outpost. 
 You can fix it out here? 
 Yeah. 
[Chuckles] 
 I can fix most things, son. 
 You know, in Milwaukee, I worked in a granary. 
 I was in charge of maintenance. 
 All my dad does is read. 
 Books are important. 
 You'd be wise to learn that. 
 Hmm. 
 How long, Mr. Anderson? 
 Oh, a few hours. 
 Thank the Lord we came upon you. 
 No, no, no. 
 It is I who must thank you. 
 When the Indians attacked my family, I lost my wife, my child, and I did not... 
 Did not think I could carry on. 
 But... 
 God sent me you good people, and you have gave me food and shelter. 
 I can't imagine what it must be like to lose your family. 
 [Voice shaking] 
I loved them s-so much. 
 I miss them, especially my boy. 
 Your family is with God now. 
 Ah, yeah, yeah. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Yeah. 
 They are angels now, eh? Yeah. 
 As someday we all will be. 
 So... 
 Young sapling. Ezra, eh? 
 Can you cut a tree down for our, uh, our axle, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 [Laughing] 
 [Bell clanging, train horn blows] 
 The cut crews have posted strike notices about the half rations. 
 Take it down and send 'em back to work. 
 Wire 2,500 shares of U.P. stock to this address. 
 "Maggie Palmer." 
 Cattle broker? 
 She's a rancher. 
 Ran into your old friend Durant in Omaha. 
 Durant's in Omaha? 
 Sends his regards. 
 Why would he do that? 
 [Horses whinnying] Yah! 
 Yah! 
 Yah! 
 [Horses whinnying, men whooping] 
 Dr. Major Bendix reporting from the field, sir, reporting success per your dire telegram for assistance. 
 I sent you a second telegram. 
 Wasn't Indians that did this. It was white men. 
 You should see these specimens I got. 
 Something really wrong with you. 
 Maybe you didn't understand what I was saying. 
 I understood perfectly, sir. 
 I carried out your original orders to the letter. 
 "Pursue and kill the Indians, no mercy." 
 I redacted them orders. 
 However, your original request conformed to standing orders from my superiors, Generals Grant and Sherman. 
 We are at war with the heathens, just as we were at war with the southerners. 
 As soon as Sherman is finished reconstructing the South, he will join us out here. 
 Together, we will exterminate the heathens... 
 On the pretense of protecting the Union Pacific. 
 I won't never join up with no Sherman. 
 My friend, you already have. 
 [Grunts] 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 Buy you a drink? 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 That woman put up much of a fight? 
 I honestly can't recall. 
 It's marked up Arapaho. 
 They'll come at us now. 
 Pick off my outlying crews, maybe full-on attack. 
 And we'll reprise. 
 But this is why we'll prevail. 
 The foreshortened cerebellum... 
 And the deep subcranial ridge... 
 Runs all the way around. 
 No foresight or intellect. 
 Just the faintest hints of humanity. 
 Barely human, you mean. 
 Show me the savage Plato, and I will read him. 
 Tell you what. 
 You fight your war. 
 I'll build my railroad. 
 Crazy son of a bitch. 
 Bohannon, do you want to know why you lost the war? 
 The typical southerner lacks the ability to look beyond his own parochial interests. 
 It's a malformed brain plate, perhaps. 
 Oh, yeah? 
[Pistol barrel clicks] 
 Don't look so mortified. 
 These are exciting times. 
 You and I are opening the way for the greatest nation the world has ever seen. 
 [Thunder] 
 And you thought you were just building a railroad. 
 [Heavy rain falling] 
 Good day, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Mr. Bohannon! 
 What? 
 Indians attacked a survey party 5 Miles north of the cut. 
 Anybody else know about this? 
 No, sir. Drove straight here. 
 Want me to sound the alarm? 
 Hell, no. 
 That's the last thing we need. 
 Well, what are we going to do? 
 Me and Mr. Ferguson are going to bury these men quiet, and you're gonna telegraph the fort, asking for more soldiers. 
 More soldiers? 
 To help Bendix finish what I started. 
 Hup! 
 [Thunder] 
 [Crows cawing] 
 Mostly old folks' heads in that bag. 
 Eva say the worst thing you can do to an Indian is cut his head off. 
 [Grunts] 
Spend eternity looking for it, never make it to the great white way. 
 Long time to live, not to get to see where you're going. 
 [Grunts] 
 Some church folk say Indians go to hell when they die 'cause they ain't accepted Christ. 
 Far as I know, Indians don't believe in hell. 
 Then it don't matter, then. Let's go get a drink. 
 [Bell clanging, thunder] 
 Tell ya, it was the most brutal engagement since Shiloh, and I was there! 
 Give it a rest, Wallace, for crying out loud. 
 This should be interesting. 
 That's Declan Toole. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Gregory Toole was my brother. 
 I came out here to take his child and the mother back to New York. 
 She my woman. 
 And that's my baby. 
 I can't judge my brother's choice of wife, be it whore or Saint. 
 But that baby is my brother's. 
 She mine. 
 By law, she's my responsibility. 
 By blood, she mine. 
 I understand there's some doubt to that. 
 Nah, ain't no doubt in my mind. 
 You stay away from my family. 
 My brother's Irish blood runs through that baby's veins. 
 Your blood gonna be on this floor before you know it. 
 All right. 
 Y'all both done said your piece. 
 Stay away from each other. 
 You must be Mr. Bohannon. 
 I am. 
 My brother considered you the only upright man he'd ever met in America. 
 Well... 
 Remember what I said about my family. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Elder Dutson, would you do me the honor of allowing me to say the Grace? 
 Of course, Mr. Anderson. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you, Lord, for this bounty you have placed before us. 
 And thank you for bringing this blessed family into my life and for all they have done to removing me from my... my sorrow and my grief. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Amen. 
 [Knock at door] 
 You mind sharing a picnic with me? 
 No. Please come in. 
 I was about to have lunch. 
 Looks like you was about to have yourself a nice bowl of dishwater. 
 I made it myself. 
 Yeah, and I'm sure it was wonderful. 
 I know it probably doesn't compete with rib steak and beans and... a hot sheaf of cornbread. 
 But I reckon you can choke it down, don't you? 
 We are butchering a new herd of cattle today. 
 Thought you might have a taste for some meat. 
 [Sighs] 
 Mm. 
 Mmm. 
 Lot of innocent people died 'cause of this. 
 Lot more to follow. 
 Killing is a sin, Mr. Bohannon. 
 There goes any appetite I had. 
 Well, besides the Indians, weren't there others who died at your hand? 
 Thems was rustlers and such. 
 And you killed them. 
 You're damn straight I did. 
 Damn it. 
 Ruth, it's my job. 
 I understand that. 
 But killing them should make you lose your appetite as well. 
 I don't take joy from it. 
 A man who hates his sin can be redeemed from it, even if he can't turn away from it. 
 Do you hate your sin, Mr. Bohannon? 
 Cornbread's dry. 
 Then there is hope for you. 
 Eat. 
 The railroad headquarters will be here. 
 My office will be on the second floor, overseeing the largest rail yards on the planet. 
 Everyone and everything that travels by rail, east, west, north, south, will pass through here. 
 And stay at my hotel... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Which will be right there. 
 Don't you think that's a little close to the bank? 
 I choose the location of my hotel and its design. 
 It's going to have a cascading staircase. 
 Perhaps it would be better over there, by the merchant square. 
 No. 
 It will be exactly where I'm indicating, according to the terms of my sale to you. 
 You should read those documents carefully. 
 Of course. 
 I've only read about cascading staircases, but I understand that the ladies like to come down them in their ball gowns. 
 Is that true, Thomas? 
 Well, it does lend a lady a certain ethereal charm to descend such a staircase on the arm of a handsome man. 
 At least, that has been my experience. 
 Hmm, well, then you will have to build a ballroom. 
 And I will have to learn to dance something other than the Horny Toad Stomp. 
 [Laughs] Yes, indeed, Maggie. 
 Although I suspect the Horny Toad Stomp is not without its charms. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Bird chirping]
