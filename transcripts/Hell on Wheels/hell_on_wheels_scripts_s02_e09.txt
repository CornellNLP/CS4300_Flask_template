 Look out! 
 Previously, on AMC's  Hell On Wheels ... 
 There's something stuck. 
 It's a norwegian penny. 
 Mr. Swede. 
 I'm Mr. Durant's wife. You're dangerously behind schedule. 
 It ain't my fault that you oversold our mileage. 
 How does Bohannon know? Did you lay with him? 
 Mickey saw you together! 
 Sean, you're scaring me. 
 Why do you hide your breeding, Mr. Bohannon? 
 You can't just push me out. 
 Mr. Durant offered me a new job you ain't gonna like at all. 
 The White Spirit will prevail. 
 My office received this ledger, along with a letter from Mrs. Lillian Bell several days ago. 
 "Dear senator Howard and members of the Senate Committee on Railroads." 
 [People yelling and screaming] 
 "This is an attempt to bring those responsible to justice." 
 [People yelling] 
 Sir? Can you hear me? 
 We're trying to establish the connection between the corruption of this railroad and its near total decimation. 
 Sir, we're just trying to understand what happened here. 
 The white spirit. 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Chatter] 
 Oh, there she is. 
 Gettin' round, Eva. 
 Girls and me runnin' bets on godmother. 
 Any one a you girls sets foot in a church, your whore ass liable to catch fire. 
 If yours don't burn first, hussy. 
 How're ya, Eva? Baby's doin' well, is he? 
 He's restless. 
 He's runnin' me ragged already. 
 Just like his father, so... 
 [Smashing and yelling] 
 Pig get in there? 
 Pl-please. 
 Pl-please. 
 Mr. Durant, let's get you out of here. 
 I've run out of medicine! 
 I've got some here in my purse. 
 Huh? It's gonna be all right. 
 Laudanum? 
 No. Straight opium. 
 Ok? 
 [Panting, groaning] 
 It's all right, it's all right. 
 Oh, God. 
 I was just trying to steal medicine from a cripple. 
 The pain must be awful. 
 You'll feel better. 
 Yes, I'll feel better... 
 Then I won't care what happens. 
 This whole enterprise will collapse on our heads. 
 Don't say that. 
 Everything's been a blur since I was shot. 
 It's all going to end in disaster. 
 There you are. 
 I'm gonna drive a train across the bridge tomorrow you helped build... 
 Come out and watch. 
 I'm a freight clerk now. 
 [Sighs] It's humiliating. 
 I know. 
 Stick it out. 
 I don't intend on leaving. 
 Those things you told the Durants at dinner... 
 You could've trusted me with that. 
 The past ain't the past if it don't exist. 
 Did you go to university, too? 
 Some. 
 Did you like me better when I was stupid? 
 I liked you better when I thought I knew you. 
 Lily, all I got right now is this job and you. 
 Your doctor in Chicago gave them to me in case of hard birthing. 
 I'll order you some more. 
 Uh, Mrs. Durant, he... he was a little out of his head. 
 Was there a scene? 
 He isn't well, ma'am. 
 Well... 
 Thank you for bringing him home. 
 Your husband, Mr. Toole... 
 I'll make sure he gets a nice raise. 
 Ohh. Thank you, ma'am. 
 [Train whistle blowing in background] 
 This business with the laudanum. 
 I feel like I'm dying. 
 Then we have to get you back to that hospital in Chicago. 
 We are in trouble, Hannah. 
 When the board comes, they'll see I've oversold the mileage. 
 When are they coming? 
 Soon. And if I'm not here to explain our position, they'll replace me. 
 It's not a matter of explanation. 
 They are going to need convincing. 
 Cullen Bohannon can do that... 
 Especially if you make him a partner. 
 He won't do it. 
 He will... when you tell him the fortune he'll make. 
 Bohannon only thrives on narrow escapes from his own recklessness. 
 It's just like you, dear. 
 Thank you. 
 Wonderful to see you. 
 Thank you. Thank you so much. 
 [Chuckles] 
 May the lord be with you. 
[Chuckles] 
 I need to talk to you. 
 I don't think there's anything to talk about. 
 I'm sorry for my behavior. 
 You were drunk. 
 I've decided I... 
 Forgive you for your relations with Joseph. 
 You've decided to forgive me. 
 Yes. 
 Because you were right. 
 I want you. 
 Are you talking about marriage? 
 Yes, of course. 
 You're catholic, Sean. 
 I'm a congregationalist minister. 
 I can't marry a papist. 
 [Hammering] 
 The other mornin', I woke up... 
 There was someone standin' at the door. 
 Yeah. Some old drunk. 
 We'll put a cross bolt on there, you don't have to worry. 
 It was a man... 
 Red... like he'd been dipped in blood. 
 You was dreaming. 
 He stood there looking in, like he was putting a curse on this house. 
 You stop that talk now. 
 I got to kill somebody for Mr. Durant. 
 You done it before. 
 It was always somebody that needed killing. 
 This is different. 
 I worry about if I do it, I'll be putting a curse on this house and everybody that live in it. 
 Don't do it then. 
 Durant says it's the only way he'll let me have this place. 
 Here. 
 You put the last one in. 
 For luck. 
 Mrs. Toole doesn't care a stitch that I'm out here. 
 She barely tolerates me touch. 
 I'd give anything to have her look at me the way that Mrs. Bell looks at you. 
 Well... 
 You're a... 
 You're a good worker. 
 Woman ought to appreciate that. 
 I thought once she saw me true self, she'd like me better. 
 What a fool I am. 
 Well... 
 My worry is that, uh... 
 Once Mrs. Bell gets to know my true self... 
 She ain't gonna like it. 
 Funny part... 
 The more I get to know her... the more... 
 You know. 
 [Sighs] A lesser woman would've run off a long time ago, I guess. 
 What I've learned, Mr. Bohannon... 
 Is that anything that springs up between you and your woman... 
 You should rip it out by the root. 
 [Hooting in background] 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 You hear that? 
 What? 
 Just past that rise... 
 There's Indian ponies with riders. 
 What are they doing? 
 Watching. 
 They're always out here lately at night. 
 They could slip up and slit our throats any minute. 
 So why don't they then? 
 I don't know. 
 But I aim to find out. 
 I should have known what they was doin'. 
 [Fly buzzing] 
 There's always a reconnoitering before a battle. 
 Why didn't you send someone out yourself? 
 Anybody I would've sent out there wouldn't have come back alive. 
 I couldn't spare the men, the bridge was almost built. 
 Do you think you were being shortsighted? 
 Them some nice shoes. 
 Clean. 
 Think you would've volunteered to go out and scout a thousand Sioux? 
 [Chatter] 
 You riding out to the bridge? 
 I am. 
 It's quite a milestone for you. 
 It's a milestone for all of us. 
 Which makes it an ideal time to talk about your plans for the future. 
 Shall we? 
 [Chatter in background] 
 Don't you like New York? 
 I have found it's filled with women like you. 
 Ohh. 
 You think I'm cruel. Hmm? 
 Tell me... what would you do in my place? 
 Thomas will write you a check and a letter of introduction to a family that's desperate for a governess. 
 A governess? 
 Please try and see this in a positive light. 
 It's a respectable family... 
 With plenty of marriageable young men. 
 I'm putting a very bright future in your hands. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you for being the first one to take her over, Mr. Bohannon. 
 There were no other volunteers, skipper. 
 Well, most folks ain't interested in being crushed, boiled, or drowned. 
 Good luck, sir. 
 [Sizzle] Ow. 
 [Chatter] 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 Ah! 
 [Metal creaking] 
 It's all right, Mr. Durant. 
 It's just the wheels bearing to the track. 
 [Metal creaking] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Wheels screeching] 
 [Men laughing and cheering] 
 You did it, ya b*st*rd! 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 She's not here, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Good job on the bridge, Mr. Toole. 
 All right. 
 Hey, y'all, listen up! 
 Still got about a day's work ahead of us. 
 But there's a round of drinks on Mr. Durant waiting for you at the starlight tonight! 
 Yeah! All right! 
 Come on, lads! Back to work! 
 You're welcome. 
 Don't get cocky. 
 We are still nowhere near where we need to be. 
 How far did you tell the board we were? 
 [Sighs] 
 Leave the men to their work. 
 Whoa. Easy, easy, easy. 
 We need to talk. 
 You all right, Mrs. Bell? 
 Mr. Ferguson. 
 Yes. I'm just closing the office. 
 Mr. Durant is down at the bridge site. 
 Can I help you with something? 
 No, ma'am. 
 You have a good day. 
 You, too. 
 It'd be nice to have some real walls, keep out the cold, keep you warm. 
 If your looking for my husband, he's at work. 
 I know where he at. 
 Want to have that talk we was going to have before you left. 
 I've been back a while now, how come this is the first time you showed up? 
 I got a surprise for you. 
 Surprises ain't been good in my experience. 
 This one is good. 
 For you and the baby. 
 You don't got to worry about the baby no more. 
 Why you say that? 
 Because it's between me and my husband now. 
 He's got a future on this railroad. 
 I heard you quit. 
 I'm on my own now. 
 I built us a house down by the river. 
 Fresh water, land... 
 Place where the baby can grow up. 
 A good solid floor and freedom... 
 A fireplace that ain't that smoky. 
 Stop it. 
 All our love can live there. 
 Can you stop it? 
 That ain't real. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 No, it ain't. 
 And I got to pretend that that don't exist. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 No, I got mending to do. 
 Mr. Toole would be real angry if he knew you were here. 
 You should probably go. 
 How would you like to be a very rich man? 
 Seen a lot of rich men end up in shallow graves. 
 When the board arrives, they will see that I have misled the government on their behalf. [Sighs] 
 They will move against me. 
 They may even try to have me imprisoned. 
 The railroad will likely fail and, well, you'll be out of a job. 
 I've been in worse spots. 
 I am offering you a full partnership... 
 If you will help me convince them that everything we have done has been necessary. 
 Now, why would they believe me? 
 You are an interesting anomaly, Mr. Bohannon. 
 A gunslinger and an aristocrat. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, wouldn't go that far in either direction. 
 Look, I am unwell. 
 I simply need you to back me up. 
 What if they don't believe me? 
 Well, there's a good chance that you will share in the blame. 
 And a jail cell. 
 From the moment you accept my offer, all your debts owing to me will be forgiven. 
 All my debts to you were buried with Doc Whitehead. 
 Sign the check. 
 [Sighs] I know her. 
 She will not leave the railroad. 
 This is the best way for us to be rid of her. 
 Is it? 
 Have you done something you haven't told me about? 
 I will do this my way if your way fails. 
 Your way. 
 As long as there's no mess. Do you assure me? 
 I'll sign the check... 
 And then her fate will be briefly in her hands... 
 Before it's in mine. 
 [Sighs] 
 Mr. Durant has offered me a permanent place with the railroad. 
 [Chuckles] He, uh... 
 He offered me a partnership. 
 Then it must be your job he's offering me. 
 [Horses approaching] 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 It's one of our horses. sh1t. 
 It's too dangerous for you to be out here now. 
 I've been thinking about what you said. 
 About all you have is your job... and me. 
 All I have is this railroad and you. 
 We can build it together. 
 We already are. 
 Everything... 
 Everything to remove the Durants is in this ledger. 
 False mileage, skimming profits, the whole lot. 
 We can do this. 
 Hey, no! 
 Wait! 
 Burning it before Durant finds out and has you killed. 
 I guaran-damn-tee he's already thought about it. 
 How do you know? 
 Like he said, me and him's different sides of the same coin. 
 Mr. Bohannon! 
 [Grunts] 
 [Horses neighing] 
 What is it? 
 [Horses neighing] 
 It's just an Indian. 
 I don't know, sir... 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Mr. Bohannon! 
 Bring the lantern. 
 Up there? 
 Shine that light over here. 
 Nicked him. 
 Go on back to camp with Toole. 
 Lily... burn that book. 
 Would you keep this for me, and ship it back east... 
 Ship it back east if something happens? 
 What kind of happen? 
 In case I am killed, Mr. Ferguson. 
 Why not? 
 If a white woman dies and a black man in the stew, who gonna hang? 
 I'm just asking you to keep it. 
 And I'm just saying no. 
 What have I done to offend you? 
 Please? Please? 
 Get on from here. You on my property. 
 This is for Eva. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Give me the damn package. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 What's it mean when an Indian paints hisself white? 
 Where did you see the white spirit? 
 Down at the gorge. What's it mean? 
 The Sioux nation wants everyone here to die. 
 When? 
 Soon. 
 It'll be a blood bath. 
 I don't care what happens to anyone here... but Ruth. 
 No offense taken. 
 You've changed, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Yeah? I'd say it's you. Take me out there. 
 If they catch us... They'll kill you. 
 Take me out there right now. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 It's your take from the saloon. 
 You were holding out on me. 
 That's for your own good. 
 Against the church... Woman. 
 Word is you've separated from her, yeah? 
 Actually, we're closer than ever. 
 She'll never convert to the faith. 
 I'm going to convert to hers. 
 Would you listen to yourself? 
 She's infected your mind. 
 I thought it through. 
 That'd kill mum. 
 You'll burn in hell, Sean. 
 You're forever cast in the lake of fire. 
 Children's catechism. 
 It's in the Bible. 
 I came to America to build a life in this world, not the next. 
 Then I'll have to disown you. 
 Whew. 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Your Elam's friend. 
 I'm his brother. 
 I'd be that baby's Uncle. 
 I appreciate your thoughts, but I'm Mrs. Toole and this is his baby. 
 If that how you see it, then you need to talk to Elam, 'cause his heart is tearing all apart. 
 It isn't time for the gathering of tribes. 
 A blood moon is coming. 
 What's a blood moon? 
 It's a time for bloodletting... 
 The settling of scores. 
 Between who? The tribes? 
 They will come against you. 
 [Yelling in background] 
 I want you to come and tell Durant, so he don't think I'm crazy. 
 You'll never see me again. 
 What did you do after you discovered the Sioux threat? 
 Telegraphed the fort and asked for soldiers. 
 We sent men and weapons. 
 Yeah, five recruits and a small cannon. Much obliged. 
 Baptism is a sacramental cleansing of a life. 
 Do you understand that? 
 Of course. 
 You affirm your love of God above all things. 
 All people. 
 God should be so lucky. 
 This is serious, Sean. 
 You're going to have to renounce your faith. 
 You're going to have to give up your saloon, the pleasure house... And? 
 And... 
 I just can't believe you're going to do that. 
 Doesn't your church compel you to baptize anyone who asks? 
 If you are sincere, Sean. 
 Does your God allow you to deny me access to him? 
 Of course not. 
 Well... 
 To the river then. 
 Is it that ugly? 
 No... it's beautiful. 
 I knew you'd come around once you saw it... 
 And saw that I was serious. 
 I'm married, Elam. 
 Don't matter out here. 
 No... My husband is, um... 
 He's... he's a good provider, and, uh... 
 He's gonna be a good father. 
 Me, too. 
 No. 
 Think about it. 
 No, um... 
 I'll always love you, Elam, but I... 
 My future is with Mr. Toole. 
 You know you don't want that. 
 It doesn't matter what I want. 
 It's what's best. 
 Good-bye. 
 Eva! 
 Oh, no. 
 I looked all over for ya, prayed to God and Christ you weren't here, but here you are. 
 It's not... it's not what you think. 
 Steady, Mr. Ferguson! 
 I thought we were on our way. 
 We are. 
 God spared me once, for what... I thought it was you. 
 Now I see God is a malicious b*st*rd, a streak of cruelty as wide as the sky. 
 No. I came to tell him that it's over between us, I swear it. 
 I love you, Eva, and you made me think that you loved me just a little bit, as well. 
 I do. 
 Your heart is for this black son of a bitch! 
 Don't, please. 
 Please. 
 Forgive me, father. 
 Aah! 
 Elam! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 [Coins dropping] 
 Do you renounce the spiritual forces of wickedness, reject the evil powers of this world, and repent of your sin? 
 I do. 
 Do you accept the freedom and power God gives you to resist evil and oppression in whatever forms they present themselves? 
 I do. 
 Do you confess Jesus Christ as your savior and promise to serve him as your lord? 
 I do. 
 Wherever Mr. Gregory Toole is... 
 I'm sure he wishes he hadn't... 
 He hadn't done what he did. 
 It's the nature of this place, isn't it? 
 Goes and makes ya do things that can't be undone. 
 He gave every man a square deal, he always bought us a fair share of rounds. 
 He liked to drink... 
 He loved his wife. 
 Today... Today, we bury a brother. 
 Sliocht sleachta ar shliocht bhur sleachta... 
 May there be a generation of children on the children of your children. 
 Amen. 
 Jesus, accept this humble servant into your heart. 
 Be reborn in the glory of Christ. 
 Brother Sean... your sins are washed away. 
 I thought the lord was going to send the angel Gabriel himself to strike me blind. 
 Well, thankfully, that didn't happen. 
 Ohh. 
 Sean. 
 Sean, stop! 
 Good day, Mr. Durant. 
 I thought we had an agreement, Mr. Ferguson. 
 This job you need doing... 
 Cold feet, hmm? 
 I would've thought... 
 That you would want to keep your land, your house, your future... 
 You said after the bridge... 
 The bridge is complete. 
 It's time, Mr. Ferguson. 
 Good boy. Good boy. 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 "From major Joshua Short, U.S. Army... 
 "Dear Thomas... 
 "I received your request for military support. 
 "Though I wish I could accommodate all similar requests, unless your scout can provide better intelligence..." 
 "I'm afraid we can't accommodate you at this time." 
 This is some kind of bullshit. 
 This is the world we live in. 
 We cannot panic every time somebody sees an Indian and bring the work to a halt. 
 Well, guess what? The men are already spooked. 
 Damn it! Thomas... 
 What will you need? 
 To keep them working? 
 [Footsteps] 
 Cullen? 
 Mr. Ferguson. 
 Sit down. 
 Did you change your mind about sending it? 
 In case something happen to you? 
 Mr. Durant have it his way, I'm gonna be shipping it in the morning. 
 You're here to kill me. 
 Mr. Durant promised me my land and my house down on the river. 
 My life is worth only a few acres of river bottom. 
 It's a nice spot. 
 How are you going to do it? 
 Strangle or cut. 
 Probably cut. 
 You got a reason for me not to? 
 I don't think you're the person the Durants think you are. 
 I done my share of killing. 
 Not like this. 
 How would you like to be chief of security operations on this railroad? 
 Cullen Bohannon already that. 
 Upon the arrest of the Durants, Mr. Bohannon and I will be his natural replacements. 
 How the Durants arrested? 
 Once that package reaches its destination, there'll be a warrant issued for Mr. Durant. 
 For you, a permanent position of respect on this railroad. 
 Do we have a deal? 
 What is it? 
 Is it Indian? 
 No, ma'am... 
 Mr. Gunderson? 
 [Crying] 
 Mr. Ferguson came to see me last night. 
 Ah. 
 Well, you had your chance, Lily. 
 We asked you to leave town nicely. 
 I told you already, Thomas. 
 I won't be pushed out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You betrayed me to Bohannon over pillow talk. 
 So you decided to have me killed. 
 It's vulgar, Thomas. 
 Sordid. 
 The railroad is at stake! 
 The railroad. The railroad? 
 I have borne every privation for this railroad! 
 I lost my husband, killed another human being, suffered humiliation at the hands of your wife... 
 I've even endured your bed! 
 That, Lily, makes you a whore. 
 [Sighs] Know then that when your precious railroad is ripped from your thick and grasping fingers that you've been undone by a whore. 
 Why? 
 What have you done? 
 I'll leave you to your work. 
 When I try to convince them I was their white spirit... 
 They stretched me on the ground and they built small fires upon my body. 
 [Screaming and laughing] 
 [Groaning] 
 The pain must be awful. 
 No! 
 I should never have turned to the... the heathens. 
 You should never have lost your place in this town. 
 I have... I have missed you... 
 Seeing you by your husband's side. 
 Shh. 
 I'm here now. 
 [Muttering] You must leave this place. 
 [Cocks gun] Wait! 
 Why? Why must I leave, Mr. Gunderson? 
 [Grunting] 
 The Sioux are attacking on the blood moon. 
 Yeah. When's that going to be? 
 Tomorrow night. 
 Oh, God! 
 There's no need for that, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Look at him. 
 I doubt he's even going to make it through the night. 
 Friend of yours or not, he's going to hang for sabotaging the railroad. 
 I'm putting a guard on him. 
 Hey, you! 
 [Groaning] 
 [Grunting] 
 Stop! This is not the way. 
 Son of a bitch tried to kill you? 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 You will not kill another man in a rage, I won't have Durant's blood on my hands. 
 Then why the hell did you tell me? 
 To prove to you finally that he has to go. 
 But not this way. 
 You and I can build this railroad together. 
 I've already shipped the ledger. 
 But the board won't take a woman seriously. 
 I can't do this without you. 
 And you... 
 You're better with me, aren't you? 
 Yeah. 
 I am. 
 I want you on the first railcar out of here. 
 You ain't gonna be on it, is you? 
 No. 
 Thought so. 
 Protect our bridge. 
 I'll be here waiting for you when you get back. 
 You know how to work a cannon? 
 Cannon? 
 I seen plenty cannon work. 
 You really got one? 
 Mount up, this ain't no place to die. 
 Thanks for not killin' my lady friend. 
 You welcome. 
 Gotta ask you though. 
 Was you ever gonna do it? 
 You know your Bible? 
 Some. 
 You know when the angel came down, grab a hold of Abraham's arm right before he cut Isaac's neck? 
 Yeah? 
 It won't like that. 
 Almost got my ass shot. 
 She ain't a woman to be messed with. 
 True. 
 True, she ain't. 
 Hmm. Let's do it. 
 [Clicking] 
 Ahh. 
 If I could have a quiet word, please. 
 [Gasping] 
 My personal ledgers... How damning are they? 
 You ask because you have lost them, hmm? 
 How damning? 
 How far you are falling, min herrdome. 
 You may fall through the floor into hell itself. 
 [Gasping] 
 At least a prison in upstate New York. 
 What am I going to do? 
 You are suffering... That is good! 
 Suffering builds character. 
 You will need that during your incarceration. 
 I will die in prison. 
 [Gasping] That is not true. 
 Come... come. 
 The truth is... 
 You will not die in prison but here. 
 Soon, in the streets of hell on wheels... 
 [Gasping] 
 Come. Let me kiss you farewell. 
 Get your filthy hands off me! 
 [Screaming] 
 [Gasping] 
 Was Durant aware of the impending attack? 
 We did what we could... 
 Evacuated the women and children, and we armed the rest. 
 Did Mr. Durant attempt to flee? 
 At least not with the women and children. 
 Where is Durant? 
 In custody. 
 [Chatter] 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 God be with you. And with you. 
 [Indistinct] 
 Excuse me. 
 [Bell clanging] 
 All right. Here we go. 
 Excuse me. 
 There'll be another train in the... in the evening. 
 Please. Everybody... stand back. 
 There's room for everyone. 
 Be careful. You all right? 
 All right. Form a single line. 
 One at a time. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 Let me help you. 
 Are you leaving? 
 Heading for Council Bluffs? 
 Don't tell me you can't recognize your own travel case, Ruth. 
 You packed my things? 
 Why? 
 As you said... 
 I'm going to Council Bluffs. 
 You're coming with me. 
 My place is here. My church. 
 I have taken the liberty of wiring the mission. 
 We can be wed tomorrow noon. 
 Sean, I can't. 
 I have removed every obstacle. 
 I have done everything you've wanted. 
 And I have already given you my answer. 
 I'm not ready, Sean. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 This here our ordnance? 
 Can you tell me who's in charge? 
 You're lookin' at him. 
 Let's see what you got. 
 Whoo! [Laughing] 
 Now, that's the kinda sugar papa likes! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Why you ain't on that damn train? 
 I ain't runnin'. 
 If Bohannon can't hold 'em... 
 I'm goin' to your house. 
 My house? 
 This ain't about you and me. I... 
 It's the safest place to wait out the Sioux. 
 What about after the Sioux? 
 I don't know. 
 I... I got blood on my hands, Elam. 
 It's bad magic and you don't need to be a part of it. 
 Listen here... Mr. Toole ain't on you. 
 He took the coward way out. 
 No, he didn't. No, every man's got his limits, Elam. And... 
 He didn't deserve what he got. 
 No, none of us deserve it. 
 Did you deserve the hardships you got? 
 Did you ever think to do like he did? 
 No. No. 
 'Cause you strong. 
 And that baby gonna be strong. 
 Let's get to that house. 
 I know the way. 
 There weren't no room on the train for the whores. 
 I'd be obliged if you kept 'em safe. 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 Finish our game? 
 Rest. 
 I... 
 Must have rest. 
 [Groaning] Rest. 
 [Grunting] 
 [Gasps] 
 You ok? 
 Rest! 
 [Grunting] 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 Here we go! 
 [Overlapping yelling] 
 Make ready! 
 [Indistinct yelling] 
 [Sioux yelling in background throughout] 
 Take cover! 
 Get down, get down! 
 Aah! 
 Positions! 
 Aim... fire! 
 Now, psalms, now! 
 Damn it! Where the hell is the runner? 
 Go find him right now! 
 Over there. Look! They're flanking us, Mickey. 
 Here they come. 
 Here we go. 
 Cover on the right flank. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Ready! 
 Prepare to fire! 
 Fire! 
 Give 'em hell! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Ah! Hey! 
 Thomas? Thomas! 
 Thomas! Thomas, they're coming! 
 They're coming! 
 You're going to be all right, Hannah. 
 We are going to be all right. Take this. 
 Take it! It's loaded. 
 Hide in here. Go. 
 And shoot anyone who comes through this door. 
 My brother... The town. 
 Go on back if you have to. I ain't abandoning the bridge. 
 I... Go on! 
 Jesus! 
 Uh! 
 [Hollering and grunting] 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Stop it! Help me! 
 [Gunfire in background] 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
[Horse neighs] 
 Let's get the hell out of here! 
 Get out of here! 
 It's gonna blow! 
 Get out of here! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 [Screaming] 
 Rifle! 
 Uh! 
 Ah! 
 Aah! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 [Women yelling] 
 Elam? 
 Where's Bohannon?! 
 He is where he needs to be. 
 Elam! I'm out. 
 Aah! 
 Jenny! 
 Oh, Jenny, no! 
 Bring her to the bed. 
 [Overlapping yelling] 
 Ladies, get the hell out of here. 
 We need to help her. 
 Can't nobody help her now. Go! 
 Let's go! Get out of here! Go! Go! 
 [Gunfire in background] 
 [Sioux hollering] 
 [Gasps] 
 Aah! 
 [Shuddering] 
 [Banging on door] 
 [Sobbing] 
 Eva. 
 Come on, come on. 
 [Screaming] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Cocks gun] 
 I'll shoot you. 
 Yes. 
 [Click] 
 Fate has taken its hand. 
 No! No! No! 
 No! No! No! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 No! No! 
 No! Please! Please! 
 No! 
 Shh. I will be quick. 
 I was kind to you. 
 Yes, you was. 
 I thank you. 
 Cullen will kill you. 
 Yes... 
 For this is all for him. 
 No! No! 
 Oh! 
 Aah! 
 How was it you decided to defend the bridge and not the town? 
 I learned in the war to protect strategic assets. 
 The town. 
 The town ain't nothing but wood and canvas, replaceable. 
 And its inhabitants? 
 Replaceable.

 Ah. A beautiful bridge, Mr. Bohannon. 
 An enduring monument to the vision of Mrs. Lily Bell... 
 And your own myopic single-mindedness. 
 [chuckles] 
 I was surprised that you made it so easy to take her from you. 
 Thank you. 
 It was, uh... inexplicably pleasurable... 
 Not as much as it'll be to see you swing. 
 You evil son of a bitch. 
 Regrettably not, Mr. Bohannon... 
 [chuckles] 
 ...for you and I are now... consumated. 
 Are we not? 
 Adieu to you! 
 Good day! 
 Whoa! 
 Mr. Bohannon... 
 It's gonna take some time to sort this all out. 
 Meanwhile, the President of the United States has ordered the construction of the railroad to continue. 
 Would you entertain in assuming Mr. Durant's role and leading us westward? 
 Mr. Bohannon... will you finish this road?
