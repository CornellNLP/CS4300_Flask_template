 Man: It is good to make this sacrifice where the sun can look down and see you. 
 It is a great privilege to dance with the sun. 
 The sacrifice will be hard, but you are strong... and brave. 
 You will not give up, as I did not give up when my father brought me to this place. 
 Ah. 
 Follow the sun... All day and pray. 
 If you are strong and true, your sacrifice will be rewarded and you will have a vision. 
 [Men grunting] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 Ahem. 
 Ma'am. 
 It's not your manners, Mr. Bohannon. 
 It's your manner. 
 Beg your pardon? 
 Yesterday... 
 When everyone was running from the disaster... 
 You walked calmly in. 
 You are their hero, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Lily! 
 I just heard from your father. 
 Everything is arranged. 
 I'm assuming you're here to see me? 
 Yes, sir, um... 
 Payroll didn't come in on the train this morning. 
 Mr. Bohannon, one of the reasons I spared your neck was because I thought you were a capable man. 
 Was I mistaken? 
 No, sir, but the men are already grumbling about not getting their pay last week, sir. 
 Well, see the Swede about petty cash. 
 Mr. Durant, uh, that won't cover the men's pay. 
 Of course not, you idiot. 
 It's for the walking bosses, Just keep the men in line until you get your money troubles sorted out. 
 My problems are no concern of yours, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Actually, today Mr. Durant, your troubles are mine. 
 But y'all go have yourselves a nice picnic, all right? 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 [Grunting] 
 Reverend... I can find someone else to help with this. 
 Just a moment to catch my breath. 
 Man: Whoo-yah! Yah! 
 [Chatter] 
 Man: Get the hell out of the way. 
 We need to ride out and speak to many horses immediately. 
 My father's people won't feel threatened by 4 men. 
 Well, these men are the eyes of the Union Army, the tip of the spear. 
 Let's go. 
 Business has been slow, Mr. Swede. 
 We will pay ya though. 
 Yeah. 
 We just need a little more time. 
 Well, thank you, gentlemen. 
 Thank you for telling me that you are unable to pay what is owed. 
 I shall give you a little more time, hmm? 
 See, I told you Mr. Swede was a reasonable man. 
 Heh. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't say that. 
 Yeah. 
 [Speaking in Swedish] 
 He just took one of our slides. 
 Are you sure we can find them? 
 Yes. 
 But they're not going to be happy to see us. 
 Why is that? 
 These rituals... they're not meant for white man's eyes. 
 Father? 
 Father? 
 It's Ruth... 
 Your daughter. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Mother died. 
 I came to find you. 
 Well, we'll send you to the mission in council bluffs. 
 They'll take care of you. 
 The mission sent me here. They said... 
 Yea, you're not staying here. 
 I have nowhere else to go. 
 She can stay in the church tent. 
 At least till we get back. 
 I'll decide where you go when we return. 
 In the meantime, there's a bed in the back. 
 Thank you, father. 
 How long has it been since you've seen her? 
 12, 15 years. 
 I don't exactly recollect. 
 And you're just going to leave her here... 
 In a place like this? 
 You're right. 
 There are some things I need to tell you. 
 There's... bacon in the bear box... 
 And... and... and coffee and flour. 
 Don't let the, uh, the drunks stumble in and... 
 And sleep on the pews. 
 There's a butcher knife under... Under that altar if you need it. 
 And just... you know, try to make yourself useful. 
 Don't leave the tent... 
 You know, unless, uh... It's on fire. 
 Understood? 
 Either the roof or... Mum's hair was set ablaze... 
 By the Harrigan brothers? 
 Those bastards. 
 Did they say they were able to put the fire out? 
 Uh... 
 What the hell is this strange wind? 
 The bloody last page is missing. 
 Oh, Jesus! It's a whirlwind! 
 Where did you... 
 No. No, no, no! 
 Bloody hell. 
 What are you... 
 We thought you said you were going to give us more time. 
 You asked for a little more time, and that's what I gave you. A little more time. 
 Man: Put your backs into it there, boys! 
 Come on! Work, you mules. 
 Hey, up! 
 I want all the walking bosses right here, right now. 
 Thomas, Toole... 
 Y'all are getting paid to work the men until the payroll situation gets figured out. 
 Again? 
 If they aren't paid, they'll strike, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Then you keep quiet as long as you can. 
 Hey, now, walking bosses only. 
 I am a walking boss. 
 Tell 'em you made me a walking boss. 
 Get back to work. 
 This about all you walking bosses getting paid again and we ain't gettin' paid again, right? 
 Tell you what... you keep your mouth shut and you keep your job. 
 Now, get back to work. 
 Come on! 
 Someone needs to put that boy in his place. 
 2,000 miles due west lies the Pacific ocean, and yet I remain stranded here, blocked by the great rocky mountains. 
 The rocky mountains... They are some 500 miles from here. 
 Beyond that rise, the Platte River forks. 
 Do I follow it to the North or South? 
 A mistake here and we could miss our strike on the Rockies by hundreds of miles. 
 I'm assuming you strike the mountains at any route you take. 
 The problem is not striking the mountains, Lily. 
 The problem is crossing the mountains. 
 And you think Robert was the only person who knew the way? 
 It took him 7 years and my open purse... 
 But yes, he told me he'd found it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Surely there'll be other surveys? 
 Oh, yes. Ha ha. 
 Yes, someone will build this railroad, but... without the secret, which Robert took to his grave, it will not be me. 
 If I'm remembered, it will be as the man who failed. 
 Unfortunately, Robert will probably not be remembered at all. 
 [Grunting] 
 At pay up, I'm gonna buy me a double hot soak. 
 [Grunting] 
 And liniment. 
 And a bottle of whiskey that don't burn going down. 
 Ha ha. 
 We ain't gettin' paid. 
 Well, they ain't paid us last week. 
 I was figurin' on double pay today. 
 You might as well put that tool down and go back to camp. 
 That's what I'm gonna do. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 It ain't quittin' time. 
 It is for me. 
 I done worked for free my whole life, I ain't doin' that no more. 
 You get back in that cut. 
 Get down off that horse and put me in the cut. 
 I don't need some slave uprising on my hands this day. 
 That's how you see it? 
 All I see is some field hand acting like a house boy. 
 Take off that gun. 
 Take it off. 
 [Shouting and yelling] 
 Give it to him now, boy! 
 [Shouting and yelling] 
 Mr. Bohannon! 
 I hired you to run these men to build my railroad, not to wrestle in the dirt with your former chattel. 
 What is the meaning of this? 
 Payroll! 
 Lack of. 
 And who told the men there is no payroll? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I did. 
 Well, you told them nonsense. 
 Gentlemen, I see that unfounded rumors have caused tempers to flare. 
 Believe me, the payroll is en route, merely delayed. 
 And as for you and your sparring partner, Mr. Bohannon, I suggest you settle your differences like the gentlemen I know you all to be. 
 [Laughter and chatter] 
 This evening, when you have completed your work, I suggest a pugilistic match between Mr. Bohannon and his negro Nemesis! 
 A real fight. 
 Yeah! Yeah! 
 And to compensate you for the tardiness of your well-earned pay, I will donate 10 cases of whiskey for your refreshment. 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 I didn't know you had a daughter. 
 Well, now you know. 
 Why don't you ever speak of her? 
 Are you really going to send her away? 
 You know, Jesus says, "if any man come to me and not hate his father and hate not his mother and his wife and his children and his own life, then he cannot be my disciple." 
 I don't think I have enough hate in my heart to be a good Christian. 
 Whoa. Whoa. 
 Black moon. 
 Father. 
 Why have you brought this man to our sacred place? 
 [Rattling] 
 He's putting a curse on you. 
 He calls you black spider because you trapped my son in your web. 
 Joseph came to Christ on his own free will. 
 Is that so? 
 Tell me, do you have no children of your own? 
 I had... I have a daughter. 
 Who just returned to him. 
 Praise God. 
 Where has she been? 
 I left her. 
 You abandoned your child and steal mine. 
 What kind of man are you? 
 A flawed one. 
 Father, reverend Cole has come... 
 Because he's concerned for our people. 
 Chief, the soldiers have already come. 
 Yeah. 
4 soldiers on horseback. 
 But more will come, enough to wipe out all the human beings from the world. 
 But there may be another way. 
 If you come to town, we discuss peace. 
 I will come, but only if my son black moon asks me to come. 
 Please come... 
 For me. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Come inside, gentlemen, and witness the greatest contest in the history of hell on wheels! 
 The finest corn liquor compliments of Mr. Thomas Durant, president of the Union Pacific Railroad. 
 Woman: Hey, over here. Give me one of those. 
 You must be able to spell your name to wager, you morons. 
 Now, who just flung down that silver? 
 This here's enough peppers to make a Mexican cry. 
 It'll probably kill you. 
 Sean's putting everything we got in you. 
 I thought you were broke? 
 We put the magic lantern up for collateral. 
 Sure that was a good idea? 
 Sure. 
 The whole town's betting on you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 There's time enough if you want to place a bet on yourself. 
 Nah. 
 I ain't doin' this for money, Mick. 
 Then why are you doing it? 
 Hmm. That man needs to be put in his place. 
 There's only one thing he understands. 
 What if, God forbid... You were to lose? 
 [Grunts] 
 That ain't gonna happen. 
 You win this fight, they're gonna kill you, and if you lose, they're gonna kill you for thinkin' you could win. 
 You don't understand. 
 This is somethin' I gotta do. 
 Why? 
 Because you're half white... 
 Or because you're half black? 
 All my life folk been tellin' me who I am. 
 One white man tell me I'm a slave, another one say I'm free. 
 Tonight I say who I am. 
 Hello. 
 Tonight and one night only, you will be allowed in. 
 But one sign of misbehavior... And I will throw you all in chains. 
 Understood? 
 Good. 
 
 
 
 You are welcome. Come in. 
 Yeah. That's it. 
 [Crowd booing] 
 Your corner here. 
 Mr. Ferguson's corner. 
 Bloody hell. 
 Look at what the bowels of the place have s out. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Crowd booing] 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Get the bloody hell out. 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 [Crowd booing and jeering] 
 Make way for Mr. Bohannon. 
 [Cheering and shouting] 
 You gonna win this fight, ya hear? 
 You gonna win this fight for us. 
 You hear me?! 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Jesus, he is a big buck, Mr. Bohannon. 
 It ain't all about the brawn, Mick. 
 [Whistling] 
 Now, this fight is going to be a fair fight. 
 [Laughter] 
 No grappling below the waist. 
 No eyeball gouging. 
 No biting. 
 No unnecessary kicking. 
 [Crowd grumbles] 
 Now, the fighters will come from their corners and toe this line. 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 Mr. Dix is going to be the referee... 
 [Crowd cheering and booing] 
 For this contest. 
 Now, I assume both fighters are ready to fight. 
 [Crowd cheering and shouting] 
 Toes on! 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Yeah! 
 Fight! 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Push them back, will ya? 
 [Crowd cheering and shouting] 
 All right, boys, back to your corners. 
 Back to your corners. 
 30 seconds! 
 Out of the way. Sit down. 
 [Cheering and applause] 
 The bank is denying the request for a credit extension. 
 Reply. 
 If credit not extended forthwith, will call in all shares of aforesaid bank stock to be joined by other 4 major investors. Stop. 
 Anticipate collapse of bank by close of business tomorrow. 
 Stop. 
 And send. 
 [Telegraph tapping] 
 Samson brought the temple down on his head. 
 I will happily do the same. 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Give him a fat lip, Mr. Bohannon! 
 He already has two, lad! 
 [Laughing] 
 Get in there and fight, boy. 
 Get him! 
 Knock him down! 
 [Shouting and cheering] 
 Knock his nappy n head off! 
 Punch his black arse back to Africa! 
 Get up! On your feet. 
 Are you gonna start fighting or what? 
 Huh? 
 About to see this now. 
 [Crowd cheering and shouting] 
 All right, break it up. Break it up. 
 Give us some room! Give us some room! 
 Give us some room. Back it off! 
 Get him to the corner, now. 
 Are you seeing what I'm seeing? 
 What? 
 He ain't fighting. 
 What the hell's wrong with you, boy? Huh? 
 Is it 'cause you ain't never hit no white man before? 
 Is that it? 
 Look here, son... 
 That man who sired you, that won't your father, that a white man who raped your mother. 
 You know? 
 The same man done beat you all your life with his foot on your neck. Huh? 
 The same man who say he your master... When you supposed to be free. 
 Huh? 
 Look over here. 
 That's him sitting on his soft white ass. 
 Huh? 
 I want you go over there... 
 And I want you to kill him. 
 You hear? 
 You go kill him. 
 You ain't gonna do this for us... 
 Do this for you. 
 [Crowd cheering and shouting] 
 Man: Take a knee, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Take a knee! 
 Come on! Come on! Come on! 
 Come on! 
 Don't worry. Don't worry. 
 You still in this. 
 You sill got him, Mr. Bohannon. You still got it. Don't worry. 
 Take a breather, boy. Take a breather. 
 Lent to thy neighbor in time of his need. 
 He paid thou thy neighbor again... 
 [Crowd cheering and shouting in distance] 
 Excuse me. 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 [Crowd cheering and shouting] 
 You're almost there. 
 Mrs. Bell? 
 Where have you been? 
 I looked all over for you. 
 I took a walk. 
 And then I heard all the commotion. 
 Ah. 
 It's a little vulgar for a lady's taste, I'm afraid. 
 [Speaking in Latin] 
 Ah, I'm afraid my Latin was a little undernourished. 
 Bread and circuses. 
 You engineered this fight as a distraction until you could get payroll. 
 Just like the Romans did with unruly crowds, give them food and spectacle. 
 Ahh. 
 I think you overestimate my abilities, Lily. 
 I hope not, for all our sakes. 
 Holy mother of God. 
 You had us worried there. 
 I thought for a wee bit we'd lost our wager, right, Sean? 
 Sean? 
 Sean? 
 [No audio] 
 Shall I walk you back to the car? 
 [Sighs] 
 I have Robert's maps. 
 And yes... he found the route. 
 To the Rockies? 
 And beyond. 
 And you've had them all this time. 
 I have. 
 I knew it! I knew it! 
 Oh, I could strangle you and embrace you at the same time. 
 Where are they? 
 They're in a safe place. 
 Ah. 
 [Inhales] 
 How much? 
 What Robert is owed. 
 All right. Let's go. Let's go. 
 All right. That's right. 
 That's right. You gonna do this. That's right. 
 Time! 
 Now, boy. Now! 
 [Cheering and shouting] 
 You got it. 
 Come on, Bohannon! One more time. 
 Get in there. 
 Come on! 
 Come on, Bohannon! 
 Get your hands up. Hands up. 
 Come on, boy! 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Come on, Bohannon. 
 Get in there. 
 [Heavy breathing] 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 It's over. It's over. 
 [No audio] 
 Why are you so glib? 
 We just lost everything. 
 I bet it all on the darkie. 
 30 to one. 
 We're rich, brother. 
 What'd you use? 
 The liniment, hmm? 
 Was it a little pepper powder to the eyes, was it? 
 Are you trying to get us both killed? 
 And Mr. Bohannon... being our only friend and all. 
 This is my only friend. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Makes punching sound] 
 [Chicken clucking] 
 Ohh. 
 Are you all right? 
 Never better. 
 Good. 
 Did you enjoy the fight? 
 Very much. 
 Good. 
 Unh. 
 Thank you for the water. 
 Unh! 
 [Chuckling] 
 Ah. 
 [Chuckling] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 Next. 
 Gregory Toole, walking boss for cut crew 3. 
 And to be completely honest with you, Mr. Bohannon, we thought you had more in you. 
 Mmm. 
 Life does have its surprises, don't it, Mr. Toole? 
 Next. 
 Elam Ferguson, walking boss... 
 Freedmen cut crew. 
 Ahem. 
 You have done it, my son. 
 The sacrifice is over. 
 Father... I was blessed. 
 I had a vision. 
 I've seen a great steel beast, its breath was smoke... 
 It shook the ground. 
 I killed it.
