 THE MANDALORIAN: I am told that you can lead me to others of my kind.   
 Come on. It's uncouth to talk business immediately.   
 (ALL GRUNTING)   
 All right, stop! I'll tell you where he is.   
 The city of Mos Pelgo. 
I swear it by the Gotra.   
 Oh! This little thing has had me worried sick.   
 I need your help. Where is Mos Pelgo?   
 PELI MOTTO: It's an old mining settlement. Not much to speak of.   
 THE MANDALORIAN: Where did you get the armor?    
 Bought it off some Jawas.    
 THE MANDALORIAN: Hand it over.    
 I'm sure you call the shots where you come from, but 'round here, I'm the one tells folks what to do.    
 Help me kill it, I'll give you the armor.    
 THE MANDALORIAN: That's the krayt dragon.    
 COBB VANTH: It's bigger'n I guessed.    
 (COOS)    
 (CHEERING)    
 COBB VANTH: This was well-earned. Thank you.    
 (GRUNTS)    
 (ALL GRUNTING)    
 - Get the Child! 
- (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 (THE CHILD COOS)    
 (BOTH GRUNTING)    
 - (YELPS) 
- (BOTH GRUNT)    
 THE MANDALORIAN: Wait! 
Don't hurt the Child.    
 If you put one mark on him, there's no place you will be able to hide from me.    
 We can strike a bargain. There's a lot of value in this wreckage.    
 Take your pick.    
 (THE CHILD COOS)    
 But leave the Child.    
 (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 THE MANDALORIAN: Okay.    
 Here. It's yours.    
 Take it.    
 It's okay.    
 (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 (COOS)    
 - You okay? 
- (COOS)    
 (COOS)    
 (SNORTS)    
 (INDISTINCT JAWAESE CHATTER)    
 I don't know. Looks like someone's gonna be goin' home empty-handed.    
 (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 You finally found a Mandalorian and ya killed him?    
 THE MANDALORIAN: He wasn't Mandalorian.    
 I bought this armor off of him, though.    
 - What'd that set you back? 
- Killed the krayt dragon for him.    
 Oh. Is that all?    
 THE MANDALORIAN: He was my last lead on finding other Mandalorians.    
 (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 Okay. Well, you might be in luck.    
 Dr. Mandible says he can connect you with someone who can help you, if you cover his call this round. It's what he said.    
 THE MANDALORIAN: What's the bet?    
 - Five hundred. 
- That's a high-stakes game.    
 Hey, he's on a hot streak.    
 - (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
- (THE MANDALORIAN SIGHS)    
 - Is the pot right? 
- (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 Ha! Idiot's Array! Pay up, thorax!    
 (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 THE MANDALORIAN: I thought you said he was on a hot streak?    
 Oh. Stop your cryin'. You'll rust.    
 (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 All right. He says the contact will rendezvous at the hangar.    
 (DR. MANDIBLE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)    
 They'll tell you where to find some Mandalorians.    
 That's what you wanted, right?    
 - Yes. 
- All right, well, stop your mopin'.    
 More importantly, did you bring back any of that dragon meat?    
 Better not have any maggots on it. I don't like maggots.    
 (COOS)    
 Hey, don't overcook it, Treadwell. I like it medium rare!    
 I'm not some Rodian, for crying out loud.    
 (EXHALES) All right, here's the deal.    
 A Mandalorian covert is close.    
 It's in this sector, one system trailing.    
 Are they the ones that left Nevarro?    
 Don't know. All I know is that the contact will lead you to them.    
 - How much will it cost me? 
- Well, that's the great news. It's free.    
 Aside from a finder's fee, of course.    
 - What's the not-great news? 
- Nothing. It's all great.    
 Okay.    
 However, there is one small skank in the scud pie.    
 - Which is? 
- The contact wants passage to the system.    
 - Do you vouch for them? 
- On my life.    
 - Fine. 
- And... no hyperdrive.    
 You want me to travel sublight? Deal's off.    
 It's one sector over.    
 Moving fast is the only thing keeping me safe.    
 These are mitigating circumstances.    
 What do you mean "mitigating"?    
 (FROG LADY GRUNTS)    
 - I'm not a taxi service. 
- I know, I know, I hear you.    
 But I can vouch for her.    
 (FROG LADY SPEAKING FROG)     
 - THE MANDALORIAN: What's the cargo? 
- (SPEAKING FROG)     
 It's her spawn. She needs her eggs fertilized by the equinox or her line will end. If you jump into hyperspace, they'll die.     
 She said her husband has settled on the estuary moon of Trask in the system of the gas giant Kol Iben.     
 - She said all that? 
- I paraphrased.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Is she sure there are Mandalorians there?     
 (BOTH SPEAKING FROG)     
 She said her husband has seen them.     
 (COOS)     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Do you know the husband?     
 No. I met her ten minutes before you walked in.     
 I thought you said you vouched for her on your life.     
 What can I say, I'm an excellent judge of character.     
 Now, I'm gonna ask you to stay strapped in whenever you're seated.     
 Traveling sublight is a bit dicey these days.     
 Whether it's pirates or warlords, someone either ends up with a nice chunk of change or your ship.     
 (SPEAKING FROG)     
 I don't speak whatever language that is. You speak Huttese?     
 (THE MANDALORIAN SPEAKS HUTTESE)     
 (THE MANDALORIAN SIGHS)     
 (COOS)     
 So, I'm gonna hit the rack. I've set the nav for our course.     
 It's gonna take a while. I recommend you get some rest.     
 - Kid? 
- (SLURPING)     
 - No, no, no! 
- (SLURPS)     
 - That is not food. Don't do that again. 
- (BURPS)     
 Nap time.     
 (COOS)     
 (BEEPING)     
 CARSON: Razor Crest, M-One-Eleven. 
Come in, Razor Crest. Do you copy?     
 THE MANDALORIAN: This is Razor Crest. Is there a problem?     
 CARSON: We noticed your transponder is not emitting.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Yes, I'm pre-Empire surplus.     
 I'm not required to run a beacon.     
 CARSON: That was before.     
 This sector is under New Republic jurisdiction.     
 All craft are required to run a beacon.     
 Thank you for letting me know. I'll get right on it.     
 CARSON: Not a problem. Safe travels.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: May the Force be with you.     
 CARSON: And also with you.     
 - Just one more thing. 
- THE MANDALORIAN: Yes?     
 CARSON: I'm gonna need you to send us a ping.     
 We're out here sweeping for Imperial holdouts.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: I'll let you know if I see any.     
 CARSON: I'm still gonna need you to send us that ping.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Well, I'm not sure I have that hardware online.     
 CARSON: We can wait.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Yeah, I... Doesn't seem to be working.     
 CARSON: That's too bad. If we can't confirm you're not Imperial, you're gonna have to follow us to the outpost at Adelphi.     
 They'll run your tabs.     
 - Oh, wait. There it is. Transmitting now. 
- (FROG LADY GASPS)     
 - THE MANDALORIAN: Be quiet! 
- CARSON: What's that?     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Uh, nothing.     
 The hypervac is drawing off the exhaust manifold.     
 (FROG LADY GRUNTING)     
 WOLF: Carson, can you switch over to channel two?     
 CARSON: Copy.     
 Was your craft in the proximity of New Republic Correctional Transport, Bothan-Five?     
 (FROG LADY SCREAMS)     
 - We got a runner. 
- I'm on it.     
 CARSON: Razor Crest, stand down. We will fire. I repeat, we will fire.     
 WOLF: I don't know where he thinks he's goin' in that thing.     
 CARSON: That thing's gonna break apart in this atmosphere.     
 (SCREAMS)     
 (SCREAMS)     
 CARSON: He's headin' down into that canyon.     
 I got 'im. Target computer active.     
 CARSON: Come on, Razor Crest, don't make us do it.     
 (GRUNTS)     
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)     
 - Hold on. 
- (GRUNTS)     
 (THE MANDALORIAN GRUNTS)     
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)     
 CARSON: I've lost visual. He's got to be around here somewhere.     
 You head north. We'll cover more ground.     
 (FROG LADY GASPS AND GROANS)     
 (FROG LADY GRUNTS)     
 (GASPS)     
 - (FROG LADY SCREAMS) 
- (THE MANDALORIAN GRUNTS)     
 (GRUNTS)     
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)     
 (FROG LADY GROANING)     
 (WHIMPERS)     
 (GROANS)     
 (SPEAKS FROG)     
 I'll find your eggs, don't worry.     
 (WHIMPERS)     
 Gotta get you some blankets, keep you warm.     
 Damn it.     
 Where are you?     
 (FROG LADY SPEAKING FROG)     
 Hang on, I'm looking for your eggs!     
 (THE CHILD SLURPING)     
 (COOS)     
 No! I told you not to do that.     
 (SPEAKING FROG)     
 Found them!     
 (SLURPS)     
 How many did you eat?     
 
 
 
 (BURPS)     
 If you hadn't guessed, we're in a tight spot.     
 The main power drive is not responding, and the hull has lost its integrity.     
 I suspect the temperature will drop significantly when night falls.     
 (COOS)     
 I'll have a better idea of our prospects at that time.     
 (SPEAKING FROG)     
 I'm sorry, lady. I don't understand Frog.     
 Whatever it is, it can wait until morning.     
 I recommend you get some sleep.     
 (THE CHILD COOS)     
 (WHIMPERS)     
 (GROANS)     
 (WHIMPERS)     
 (GRUNTS)     
 FROG LADY: Wake up, Mandalorian.     
 This cannot wait until morning.     
 Do not be alarmed. I bypassed the droid's security protocols and accessed its vocabulator.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: What the hell are you doing?     
 That droid is a killer.     
 FROG LADY: These eggs are the last brood of my life cycle.     
 My husband has risked his life to carve out an existence for us on the only planet that is hospitable to our species.     
 We fought too hard and suffered too much to resign ourselves to the extinction of our family line.     
 I must demand that you hold true to the deal that you agreed to.     
 (WHIMPERS)     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Look, lady, the deal is off.     
 We're lucky if we get off this frozen tomb with our lives.     
 FROG LADY: I thought honoring one's word was a part of the Mandalorian code.     
 I guess those are just stories for children.     
 (COOS)     
 (SIGHS)     
 THE MANDALORIAN: This was not a part of the deal.     
 (WIND HOWLING)     
 (THE CHILD SPEAKING GIBBERISH)     
 How 'bout you come over here, give me a hand? Make yourself useful.     
 (SIGHS)     
 Hey, kid.     
 I said hey! Where are you going? Come back here!     
 (THE CHILD SPEAKS GIBBERISH)     
 When did she go?     
 (THE CHILD SPEAKING GIBBERISH)     
 (FROG LADY GRUNTS)     
 There you are.     
 You can't leave the ship. 
It's not safe out here.     
 (FROG LADY SPEAKS FROG)     
 (SPEAKING FROG)     
 Let's gather these up.     
 (SPEAKING FROG)     
 I know it's warm.     
 But night's coming fast, and I can't protect you out here.     
 (SPEAKING FROG)     
 (COOS)     
 No. No!     
 (WHINES)     
 (COOS)

 (FROG LADY GASPS)     
 (INDISTINCT GROWL)     
 (INDISTINCT GROWL)     
 (GROWLS)     
 Go, go, go! Back to the ship!     
 (GROWLS)     
 (THE MANDALORIAN PANTING)     
 (GROWLS)     
 (GRUNTING)     
 (FROG LADY GASPS)     
 (COOS)     
 (GRUNTS)     
 (GRUNTS)     
 (WHINES)     
 (SPEAKS FROG)     
 (THE MANDALORIAN PANTING)     
 Strap yourselves in. This better work.     
 I've got limited visibility. 
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.     
 (GROANS)     
 (GROANING)     
 We ran the tabs on the Razor Crest.     
 You have an arrest warrant for the abduction of prisoner X-Six-Nine-Eleven.     
 However, onboard security records show that you apprehended three priority culprits from the Wanted Register.     
 Security records also show that you put your own life in harm's way to try to protect that of Lieutenant Davan from the New Republic Correctional Corps.     
 Is this true?     
 THE MANDALORIAN: Am I under arrest?     
 Technically, you should be.     
 But these are trying times.     
 THE MANDALORIAN: What say I forego the bounties on these three criminals, and you two help me fuse my hull so I can get off this frozen rock?     
 What say you fix that transponder, and we don't vaporize that antique the next time we patrol the Rim?     
 All right. I'm gonna repair the cockpit enough for us to limp to Trask.     
 There's nothing I can do about the main hull's integrity, so we're gonna have to get cozy in the cockpit.     
 It's the only thing I can pressurize.     
 If you need to use the privy, do it now. It's gonna be a long ride.     
 (FROG LADY SPEAKS FROG)     
 Okay, repair's all done.     
 Let's see if we can get this thing going once and for all.     
 (SQUEALING)     
 (GRUNTS)     
 Wake me up if someone shoots at us.     
 Or that door gets sucked off its rails.     
 (SPEAKS FROG)     
 I'm kidding. If that happened, we'd all be dead. Sweet dreams.     
 (THE CHILD GRUNTS)     
 (FROG LADY SPEAKS FROG)     
 (COOS)     
 (SLURPS)
