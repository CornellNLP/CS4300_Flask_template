 Ash! Stop the car! 
 [all screaming] 
 Welcome to the 80s, kid. 
 We're in the 80s? 
 If young me never reads from that book, then evil will not plague my life, and Pablo will be alive again. 
 Ash : I haven't read from the book. 
 This can't be happening! 
 Run! 
 [growling] 
 [thumps] 
 Who's there? Henrietta. 
 My husband, he's found some book of the dead. 
 Why am I here? What the... 
 f*ck! 
 So I read from the book, and summoned the Kandarian Demon. 
 [growing] 
 [ripping] 
 [all screaming] 
 Stop the Professor! 
 [grunts] 
 I'm going to hurt you, real bad. 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 [crow cawing] 
 You'll never get the Necronomicon. 
 [Deadite Henrietta cackling] 
 Poindexter, you get your ass over here, right now! 
 Please, forgive me! 
 Oh, my God. 
 He just left with the book. 
 [Tanya panting] 
 No one escapes their destiny, Ash. 
 [shotgun cocking] 
 Yours, is to watch me suck out your soul! 
 Make sure you suck both barrels. 
 [gunshots] 
 [groaning] 
 [whimpering] 
 [laughter] 
 [clattering] 
 [Deadite Henrietta groaning] 
 [Ash grunting] 
 Ha! 
 [screaming] 
 [chomping] 
 [Tanya continues screaming] 
 [wind howling] 
 [engine revving] 
 [screaming] 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 [splattering] 
 Delicious, but I couldn't possibly finish! 
 [grunting] 
 [gunshot] 
 [chain rattling] 
 Tanya : Help me! 
 Please! 
 [sobbing] I don't want to die! 
 [Deadite Henrietta cackling] 
 Come on, sweet cheeks. 
 [panting] 
 [wood creaking] 
 [heavy breathing] 
 Help me! Ah! 
 Oh. 
 Oh! 
 [wind blows] 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 [deep breathing] 
 Oh, Ruby. It's you. 
 Oh, great. You got the book, good job. 
 What's different about you? 
 [shrieking] 
 Whoa! 
 [grunting] 
 Ah, come here, Ash! 
 [yelling] 
 [Ruby gasps] 
 Whoa. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm you. 
 From another time. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I came for that. 
 [faint whispering] 
 And for Ash. So where is he? 
 [growling, clattering in basement] 
 Ash! 
 [Kelly yelling] 
 You're with him? 
 [both grunting] 
 Ah! 
 [ding] 
 [both grunting] 
 How about some nice warm milk? 
 [squirting] 
 No! 
 From Granny! 
 No! 
 [groaning] No, uh, no! 
 Uh...! 
 [Deadite Henrietta chuckling] 
 [both grunting] 
 [spitting] 
 Oh. Prison rules, eh? 
 Yah! 
 [squishing] 
 Ooh, ooh! 
 Feels so good inside me! 
 [Ash yelling] 
 [ragtime music playing] 
 [grunting] 
 [chuckles] 
 I don't pop my cork for every man I see! 
 [groaning] 
 [roaring] 
 [in distorted voice] I'll kill you! 
 I'll kill you! I'll rip your face off! 
 [roaring, chomping] 
 [grunting] 
 Stay still! 
 [Deadite Henrietta grunting] 
 Suck on this, bitch! 
 [laughing] 
 [Deadite Henrietta growling] 
 Let go my face! 
 [Ash grunting] 
 Is that all you got? 
 [chomping] 
 f*ck! 
 [Deadite Henrietta grunting] 
 [yelling] 
 Get ready, Ash! Ah, whee! 
 Whoa, whoa! 
 I like it on top! 
 [laughing maniacally] 
 [yelling] 
 [chainsaw revving] 
 [both grunting] 
 [Deadite Henrietta screaming] 
 [Deadite Henrietta laughing maniacally] 
 [both grunting] 
 [Ash panting] 
 [splattering] 
 f*ck... you! 
 You're some kind of trick. 
 No, the opposite. 
 I'm the key to you getting everything you ever wanted. 
 All I ever wanted was this book, and my... 
 And your babies. I know. 
 [growling] 
 [slamming] 
 [groaning] 
 [neck cracking] 
 [banging] 
 Okay, well, that old bat must've really rung my bell good, because I'm seeing two Rubys right now. 
 One too many. 
 Wait, this is your opportunity to choose a new life. 
 Oh, wait a second. 
 I know what's going on now. 
 You're the 80s version of Ruby. 
 Wow! That is trippy. 
 Oh, here's a question. 
 If we all had s*x right now, would it still be a threesome, because technically you're both the same person? 
 [Ash chuckling] 
 Mm. 
 Okay, well, either way, you should listen to this Ruby, because your future sucks. 
 Your demon kids are going to betray you for their demon dad. 
 Then they're going to make you kill him. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Didn't see that coming, did you? 
 [speaking softly] Trying to help. 
 [gasps] You kill my babies? 
 But you don't have to. 
 Don't you get it, you can walk away with your immortality intact. 
 You can create a new future. 
 What would I even do? 
 Anything, you can do anything. 
 [speaking softly] Anything. 
 [splattering] 
 [grunting] 
 Oh! 
 No! 
 [Dark Ruby grunts] 
 [gasping] 
 [Ruby yells] 
 [blasting] 
 [grunting] 
 Ruby! 
 [Kelly and Ruby panting] 
 [weakly] She won't be down long. 
 Uh... I'll do what I can, but I want you to get out of here. 
 And just leave you here alone to die?! I don't think so, no. 
 We just need to stop this bleeding. 
 Kelly... stop. 
 So Ruby, does this mean I don't have to pay back the twenty bucks I owe you? 
 It's 200 bucks. 
 [Ruby wheezing] 
 I was wrong about you. 
 You're an all right sort of person. 
 Sort of. 
 Well, and even though you unleashed evil on the world, you didn't get in my way while I cleaned it up, so I guess you're an okay half-demon, half-person yourself. 
 [faint breathing] 
 [Ruby exhales] 
 [clock ticking] 
 [sighs] 
 Mm-mm. 
 I'm not dead, you dumb b*st*rd. 
 Oh, wow. That was weird. You were really still for a minute. 
 Oh Kelly... oh, take it. 
 [faint growling] 
 You know what to do. 
 And you go and forge that path, all right? 
 [wheezing] 
 [grunting] 
 I'll hold her off as long as I can. 
 [whispering] Time to go. 
 [Kelly grunts] 
 [gunshots] 
 [Dark Ruby gasping] 
 Ah, yah! 
 Ow! 
 Oh! 
 [groaning] 
 [rumbling] 
 What the deuce is going on? 
 Ash, what's wrong? 
 [triumphant music playing] 
 Holy hand! 
 Kelly, you see this?! 
 I got a hand! It's real! 
 It works! 
 [laughs] It's magnificent! 
 Too bad Pablo couldn't be here to see this. 
 No, Ash, don't you see what this means? 
 We changed history. 
 It worked! 
 [thumping inside trunk] 
 Pablo! 
 Let me out of here! 
 [laughing] 
 [Kelly and Pablo grunt] 
 Wait a minute. 
 I was-what-is... 
 Oh! 
 What is... what is happening? 
 What is going on? 
 Well, you were dead. 
 Uh-huh. 
 So, we went back in time, we changed history, and now you're back alive. 
 Wait. I was dead? 
 Oh, yeah. Sunken eyes, horrible stench. 
 The whole nine yard. 
 [Kelly chuckles] 
 Welcome back, Pablito. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah! 
 Now that is a firm handshake, Jefe! 
 Crazy, huh? Brand spanking new hand. 
 Or, brand new spanking hand? 
 Now. 
 [Ash chuckles] 
 Wait, guys. Where's Ruby? 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 [screeching] 
 Ah! 
 She didn't make it, man. 
 So what, this other Ruby, the evil 80s Ruby, she's just chilling at the cabin? 
 Our Ruby was going to hold her off for as long as she could, until... 
 Can we change the subject to something less depressing? 
 Like Pablo, maybe tell us more about the time you died? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 It almost feels like it happened to another me, but this me still knows about it. 
 And in that moment, right before I died, all I could think about was, how I wanted to save the world, and be a hero, like you. 
 Well, you'll never really be like me, because I'm a legal citizen, but you did help save the world. 
 I hate to be a buzzkill, but we kind of need to get back to the future. 
 Without Ruby's help. 
 [snaps fingers] Kelly, book me. 
 Pablo. 
 You think because that book was inside you, some Sumerian rubbed off? 
 Like enough to read from the time travel passage in there? 
 Don't you worry, Jefe. 
 I got this. 
 Ah, ha, ha! 
 I knew you could do it. 
 Oh, yeah. I can do it, all right. 
 Just don't know if I want to. 
 [sniffs] 
 What? 
 I said, "I don't want to." 
 [slicing] 
 Hey, whoa, whoa! 
 Whoa, whoa! 
 [Kelly screaming] 
 Better?! 
 [brakes squealing] 
 Bill! 
 You f*ck! 
 [blasting] 
 [Kelly grunts] 
 No! 
 Whoa! 
 No! 
 [splattering] 
 Whoa! 
 [laughing] 
 [Ash yelling] 
 [grunting] 
 [grunting faintly] 
 [lightning crashing] 
 [snarling, growling] 
 [whispering] Ash? 
 Kelly. 
 Are we back in Jacksonville? 
 [Dark Ruby chanting in foreign language] 
 [growling] 
 [screeching] 
 [splattering] 
 [in distorted voice] Mama. 
 Look who's awake. 
 [Spawn growling] 
 You mind telling me what the Flying Dutchman is going on? 
 We're course correcting. 
 Rebuilding the family you tore apart. 
 See, this era's Ruby hasn't been exposed to you like the recently departed Ruby was. 
 Hasn't betrayed me. 
 [lightning crashes] 
 [Spawn continue growling] 
 Well, that's good. You found yourself a keeper. 
 Now where the hell is my Pablo? 
 It's hard to say, see, most cultures have different names for the netherworld. 
 Uh, the Aztecs called it Mictlan. 
 The Greeks, the Tartarus. 
 You call it hell. 
 None of it's correct, but your tiny little minds cannot comprehend the reality of the dimension that your friend now finds himself in. 
 [shouting in Sumerian] 
 You know, you almost had me. 
 [all yelling] 
 You really blocked off all my options. 
 Well, most of them, anyway. 
 [splattering] 
 And it's not ideal being inside a dead body, but it's not an insurmountable challenge. 
 No! 
 [splattering] 
 [cat screeching] 
 Especially when all I had to do was convince the one man foolish enough to swallow my chicanery... 
 Hi! 
 .. if he went back in time, he could resurrect his dead little friend. 
 [laughing hysterically] 
 You flim-flamming S.O.B. 
 You played me like a cheap fiddle. 
 Oh, don't be so sore, Ash. 
 There's no way you could've known. 
 See, my transference was one of those... blink and you'll miss it moments. 
 [yelling in Sumerian, wailing] 
 Blah-di-blah-di-blah. 
 Heard it all before, pal. 
 That so? 
 Yeah, demon powers, immortality, jumping into people's bodies. 
 Honestly, I'm not impressed by that. 
 Now you strip that away, give us a fair fight, I'll bet I would kick your candy ass. 
 Ignore him. 
 Come on, buddy. What do you say? 
 A little mano a mano? 
 Test the mettle of man? That's what this is all about, right? 
 I'm willing to throw in. 
 But... and this is a big, hairy but... you got to turn off your demon powers. 
 This has to be a fair fight. 
 What do you hope to achieve by this? 
 If I win, you, Ruby, your worthless kids, and all the other evil crap here, takes a freight train to the underworld, and I get my buddy Pablo back. 
 And what do we get when you lose? 
 I don't know, toots. What do you want? 
 I want to rip the skies open until they bleed. 
 And the flood to flush away humanity, and the Earth to burn, so that the flames touch the heavens. 
 Is that it? 
 And then I want my spawn to eat her. 
 [yells] 
 [snarling] 
 Ah. 
 Apocalypse, and a side of Kelly for the kids. 
 Okay, I accept. 
 Wow! Really, dude? 
 The Necronomicon. 
 What? 
 Now! 
 Ash, do you really think you can trust this piece of sh1t to keep his word? 
 How the hell should I know? I'm making this up. 
 [slicing] 
 Hey! 
 Easy man! It's a brand new hand! 
 You defeat me, we accept exile from this realm... and your friend shall be returned. 
 Okay, you defeat me, I guess all kinds of bad crap's going to happen for a long time. 
 Got it. 
 [slicing] 
 [lightning crashes] 
 [Book growling] 
 [chanting in Sumerian] 
 [Ruby continues chanting in Sumerian] 
 [growling loudly] 
 A promise sealed with blood. 
 There's no stronger bond. 
 Put your dancing shoes on. 
 Let's do this. 
 [dramatic music playing] 
 
 
 
 [both grunting] 
 [Ash chuckling] 
 Too quick for you, huh? 
 [grunting continues] 
 Come on, Bill. 
 The idea is to actually hit me. 
 [Ash grunting] 
 [Baal groaning] 
 [lightning crashing] 
 [grunting continues] 
 Ow! 
 [both grunting] 
 Whoa! 
 [yelling] 
 [both grunting] 
 Look at them. 
 [Ash and Ball yelling] 
 Slaves to pride. 
 Willing to risk everything for vanity, while using us as bargaining chips. 
 Baal : Come on! 
 Me to be banished, and you to be defiled and devoured. 
 I never heard anything about being defiled. 
 It was implied, trust me. 
 They've shown us just how little they think we matter. 
 [thumps] 
 [glass shatters in distance] 
 [Ash and Baal continue grunting] 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm not going to risk everything for a contest of egos. 
 I'm going to alter the deal. 
 [gasping] 
 [snarling] 
 [both grunting, yelling] 
 You feel that? 
 That's what mortals call "pain!" 
 [Ash grunting] 
 [Baal spitting] 
 Get on board, because the pain train is stopping in Bill Ville! 
 [both grunting] 
 [chomping] 
 [laughing maniacally] 
 You fight like a girl! 
 Ah! Hey! 
 [both yelling] 
 [smashing] 
 [grunting] 
 What are you doing with Ash? 
 Because you're stronger than him. 
 Why be a follower, when you could be a leader? 
 Kelly. You're stronger than Ash. 
 Why follow, when you should lead? 
 You join with me, and I'll give you powers you couldn't possibly imagine. 
 I'd rather die! 
 [Kelly grunting] 
 [Spawn growling] 
 [yelling, groaning] 
 Don't be foolish. 
 You can't win. 
 [Ash grunting] 
 [shattering] 
 [grunting] 
 [Baal tumbling] 
 Oh! No, no, no! 
 [gasps] Chet! 
 Ash! 
 Hey. 
 Mm. 
 Oh! 
 [both grunting] 
 Whoa! 
 [piano sounding] 
 Oh, gah! 
 Oh, oh! 
 You are stuck in there real good! 
 A real friend would give you a hand. 
 Of course... 
 [piano playing] 
 [grunting] 
 You did let Cheryl kill me, so, guess you're not a real friend. 
 [knuckles cracking] 
 ♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah ♪ 
 Ow, ow! [grunting] 
 Chet! Stop that! 
 Oh! [chuckles, grunts] 
 [wood splintering] 
 [continues grunting] 
 Oh well, I guess I'll have to take, your hand, buddy. 
 [revving] 
 What's that? 
 What do you think you're do... 
 Oh, no! 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Oh! Be still! 
 No! Ah! 
 [Chet laughing maniacally] 
 Woo-hoo! 
 No! Oh! 
 Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 Chet : Oh, man! 
 [continues laughing] 
 [screaming] 
 Oh, my virgin hand! 
 It hasn't even held a beer! 
 [Ash grunting] 
 [hand laughing] 
 Hey! 
 You get back here right now! 
 [high-pitched voice] Take that! 
 Uh? 
 Hey, gross! 
 [lighting crashing] 
 [slams] 
 [grunting] 
 [laughing] 
 [heavy breathing] 
 We never finished our game, Ashy. 
 [groaning] 
 [Spawn snarling] 
 [grunting] 
 Do you really want to die here with Ash Williams, or join with me? 
 There's one thing I learned from Ash. 
 Shoot first, ask questions never. 
 [Kelly yelling] 
 [Spawn snarling] 
 [yelling, snarling continue] 
 [yelling] 
 [grunts] 
 Oh. 
 [Kelly groaning] 
 You could've had it all. 
 [snarling] 
 [chainsaw buzzing grows louder] 
 Hiding in the skins of people. 
 That's a punk move! 
 You said you wouldn't use any powers! 
 [chainsaw revving continues] 
 [revving stops] 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 [eerie music playing] 
 [shrieking] 
 [screaming] 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 Oh! 
 [cackling in distance] 
 Man : Ashley? 
 Ashley? 
 Ashley. Where are we? 
 You are not my father. 
 Oh yes, son. It-it's really me. 
 Uh, there's no time to explain, but listen carefully. 
 It's vital that you know the truth. 
 I should've told you years ago, but you weren't ready. 
 You are now. 
 You see, you and I... 
 [Ash grunts] 
 You leave my dad out of this! 
 [glass shattering] 
 Ashley, you idiot! 
 Stop it! 
 Sorry. 
 I don't come with brakes! 
 [both grunting] 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 Listen to me... 
 Shut up. 
 Between breath... 
 [gurgling] 
 Tell it to somebody who cares! 
 Ashley, you are... 
 Take a breath, buddy! 
 You're going to need it! 
 [grunting] 
 [gurgling stops] 
 Game... over! 
 Savior of Humanity? 
 Couldn't even save the ones dearest to you. 
 Did you really think I was going to honor the deal? 
 Brock's voice : Take the chainsaw, son. 
 Humans are so gullible. 
 [dramatic music playing] 
 [revving] 
 [revving] 
 Hey! 
 [both grunting] 
 [both yelling] 
 Oh, nice move, for a cheater! 
 [both grunting] 
 [grunting continues] 
 [both yelling, grunting] 
 [yelling, grunting] 
 [groaning] 
 [both grunting] 
 [groaning] 
 [smashing] 
 [Spawn growling] 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry, Kelly. 
 Ash : I was wrong to bring us here. 
 I failed you, I failed Pablo... 
 I failed the world. 
 We won a f*ck ton more than we lost, Ash. 
 [gasping] 
 That's not failure. 
 Baal : I disagree. 
 Prophesized one will die by my hand. 
 Humanity will bow to evil once more. 
 And by every definition... that spells failure. 
 [Ash grunting] 
 Wait! 
 Okay. 
 You did it. 
 You won. 
 Now I'm not afraid of dying. 
 But before I go, I got to know one thing. 
 What is it? 
 What was she like in the sack? 
 [Baal scoffs] 
 [Ash yelling] 
 [both gasping] 
 [shrieking] 
 [gasps] 
 [groans] 
 [chuckling] Wow! 
 You immortals are so gullible! 
 [grunting] 
 [slicing] 
 [Spawn shrieking, snarling] 
 What have you done?! 
 Honored the deal! 
 [wailing] 
 [growling] 
 [grunts] 
 [skin splattering] 
 [distorted groaning] 
 [moaning] 
 [Spawn continue shrieking] 
 [clattering] 
 [grunting] 
 [Necronomicon chanting] 
 [creaking] 
 [gasps] 
 [all screaming] 
 [splintering] 
 [gasping] 
 [both screaming] 
 Ash! 
 That's our cue! 
 Ash! [panting] 
 [growling] 
 [sizzling] 
 No, no! 
 No! 
 [dramatic music playing] 
 [Kelly grunting] 
 [groaning] 
 [screaming] 
 [explosions] 
 [shattering, splintering] 
 [both panting] 
 [growling] 
 Mm. 
 [rustling] 
 [Kelly gasping] 
 [groaning] 
 [triumphant music playing] 
 Pablo! 
 [both gasping] 
 What? 
 What happened? 
 Well Pablo, you died. 
 But you died saving the world. 
 Wait. 
 Am I dead right now? 
 What? 
 No, that's crazy! 
 We went back in time to the 80s, and we saved you. 
 Oh, okay. Cool. 
 Thanks, Jefe. 
 You're welcome, Bill. 
 [grunts] Come on now! Let's do it... 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you?! 
 [groans] I save the world, and you punch me in the face? 
 I'm sorry, Pablo. 
 Just had to be sure. 
 It was one of those days. 
 Come on! Now give it up! 
 [marching band playing music] 
 [Ash laughing] 
 Whoo! 
 Give me an "A!" 
 Cheerleaders : "A!" 
 Cheerleader : Give me an "S!" 
 Cheerleaders : "S!" 
 [crowd cheering] 
 Cheerleader : Give me an "H!" 
 Cheerleaders : "H!" 
 Cheerleader : What's that spell? 
 All : Ash! 
 [cheering] 
 [band music continues] 
 [crowd gasping] 
 Cheerleaders : Ash Williams! 
 [cheering loudly] 
 Now Elk Grove, let's welcome our hero, Ashley J. Williams! 
 [crowd cheering] 
 [eerie music playing] 
 Ash? Everyone's waiting for you. 
 Oh. 
 [Linda chuckles] 
 [cheering loudly] 
 Thank you! 
 Thank you very much! 
 Thank you, good people of Elk Grove. 
 [Ash chuckling] 
 You know, uh... 
 30 years ago, I was a pariah in this town. 
 Yeah, you were! 
 I was kicked out. 
 Permanently, for allegedly doing something unspeakable to my friends, and family. 
 So, as you can imagine, when I came back here, I was afraid you wouldn't listen to the real truth. 
 Which is, I'm just a total badass hero, not a serial killer. 
 [laughter] 
 Yeah. [clearing throat] 
 Unfortunately, all my worst fears came true. 
 You were still complete assholes. 
 Ash : You called me horrible names, and you were basically responsible for the deaths of my best friend and my father. 
 [murmuring] 
 [baby crying] 
 Yep. 
 But... I'm glad that we're past that now. 
 Today is a new day, and I want you to know... 
 I love this town. 
 [cheering loudly] 
 So much so, I'm moving back here, and this time it's for good! 
 [cheering loudly] Yeah! 
 That's right! 
 Evil, if you show your ugly mug in this town... ever again... 
 I will f*ck you up! 
 I will take you down, and I will wipe you out! 
 [cheering loudly] Yeah. 
 I love you, Elk Grove! 
 All : [chanting] Ash, Ash...! 
 I love you, Ash! 
 Hey, I love me too! 
 Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash...! 
 Let's party! 
 [music playing] 
 [cheering loudly] 
 [wind blowing] 
 You okay? 
 [softly] Yeah. 
 Wow, it's just that... all of this... it's so perfect, I mean, I-I never expected any of this. 
 What? 
 You deserve this, Ash. 
 You've done your part. 
 Now you can live a normal life. 
 It's time you relax, and do whatever you want. 
 Whatever I want? 
 Ooh, I want some sugar! 
 [cheering loudly] 
 [band music continues] 
 Come on, guys. 
 All : [chanting] Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash! 
 Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash! Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash! 
 Man : We love you! 
 Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash...! 
 Yeah, that's right! 
 [eerie music playing] 
 Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash! 
 Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash! Ash, Ash, Ash, Ash! 
 Whoo! 
 [ragtime music playing] 
 [ragtime music slows down, fades] 
 [wind howling] 
 [eerie music playing] 
 [leaves rustling] 
 [fly buzzing] 
 Girl : Hey, look what I found!
