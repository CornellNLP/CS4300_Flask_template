 You're more important to me than the army is. 
 That's why I'm staying. 
 You're absolutely sure? No nagging doubts? 
 No, it's time. 
 Call me. 
 Why don't you give me a call some time? 
 I am SO calling you, babes. 
 (They laugh) 
 When's the big day? 
 I asked him not to say anything. 
 Congratulations. 
 OK, if you'll just let me explain. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Glen, it's important to me that you understand the reason why... 
 Really. What? 
 Glen. 
 You and Tom have a nice life. 
 Glen? 
 (Tyres screech) 
 sh1t. 
 Computer : 'Glen Boyle. 
 'Calling.' 
 Come on, come on. 
 (Phone rings) 
 'Hello this is Glen Boyle, I can't take your call.' 
 'Glen Boyle. 
 'Calling.' 
 (Phone rings) 
 Glen? The last thing I wanted was to hurt you. 
 You needed help and I came running. 
 You knew exactly what would happen, and you just didn't give a sh1t. 
 Did you? I called you in a moment of weakness because I needed you. 
 I convinced myself, almost certainly, you wouldn't come. 
 But I... I'm sorry, I can't hear you - you broke up. 
 I said, but I did. 
 Yes, you did. 
 Two years too late. 
 Oh, come on. I lost our baby, Glen. I was on my knees. That's when I needed you. 
 You wanted me to go... 
 I didn't. I... You ran. 
 Just like you're running now. 
 Where are you even going? 
 I don't actually know. 
 Turn around. 
 Let's talk. 
 No, you've made your choice. 
 What the hell is there to talk about? 
 'Call ended.' 
 (Phone rings) 
 I'm sorry, OK. 
 I am. 
 Tom asked me out of the blue. 
 He's a good... he's... 
 (Call fails) 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t. 'Call ended.' 
 Come on. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Glen? 
 Can you hear me? Yes. 
 What about Tom? 
 He loves me. 
 I love you. 
 You know, I came back for you. 
 Put myself on the line. 
 For you. 
 And now you're leaving again. 
 You've made your choice, so... 
 I don't want you to leave. 
 I don't want you to leave again. 
 Glen? 
 What DO you want, Fiona? 
 Tell me, right now, what do you want? 
 I don't know! 
 Hello? sh1t. 
 Glen? 
 Electronic voice : Glen Boyle.

 Christ. 
 All right, Billy? 
 Er, I was just passing. 
 You've been listening in on a police channel, haven't you? No. 
 No. Either way - glad you're here. 
 Mr Boyle. Yeah? 
 I might be of some help here. 
 You might have some ketamine in your grab-bag. 
 I couldn't possibly have it. I'm just an ODP. 
 Billy, could you possibly see if you can find some ketamine in my grab-bag, please? 
 I'll have a look, Mr Boyle. 
 There's your ketamine, Mr Boyle. OK. 
 I'm just giving you something to make you comfortable, OK? 
 Can you tell me what your surname is and your date of birth, please? 
 Billy, can you get this down?

 Thank you.

 OK, guys, let's make some space. Get his legs free.

Just going to get your leg out. (He whimpers) You're doing really well, really well. Thank you. Billy, can we release the tourniquet nice and slowly, please? Yeah. Thank you. Yep, OK, this is doing the job. Let's go again, let's get this other leg out please. Carry on! (Engine splutters, metal creaks and groans) (He whimpers) (Hydraulics whir) Cut it! Let me see, please. No, you need to keep going. We can't get any more clearance. The leg is stuck. OK. You're doing really well, mate. Let's have another BP please. Yeah. So, Rory, I'm just going to have to feel your belly again. Nah, it's 50 over unreadable. It's dropping. (Instruments beep rapidly) 
 
 It's looking like there's only one way to get him out of there in time. Unless you've got something you can come up with in the next five minutes that will release that leg? Not in five minutes. I'm sorry. Hey, Rory, can you hear me? (He gasps) Rory? Listen, your right leg's trapped. And I'm very concerned that you might have a massive bleed in your belly. I'm going to be honest with you. If I don't get you to a hospital within the next hour, you're going to die. Do you understand me? I'm sorry, but that's why I have to amputate your leg. Now, you listen to me. I've done this before. So, I know that I can save your knee joint. And that means that with a simple prosthetic, you will be able to walk again, and you'll even be able to run. OK? We're going to pump you full of some painkillers. ..Any more of that ketamine left? Yes, you do. OK. Make it up to a total of 120. Coming up. OK. I'm going to need gloves and antiseptic from your truck. I've got blast dressings, but I need you to get me a couple of blankets and some bandages, please. Yep. There you go. Thank you. Listen, you wouldn't happen to have sux and a tube, would you? We've used mine. I've got roc. In your bag. OK. And are you up to tubing him, under my supervision, obviously? Er, yeah. Good man. All right. Let's get that head rest off, please. Come down here. Have you got him? Yep. There's your roc. Thank you. (He exhales) There's a tube, Thomas. Cricoid on, please. Let me get the mask. Cricoid on. 80mg roc going in now. (He exhales) Here we go. Bring him this way a little bit. (He exhales) Here we go. Tube. Cuff up. OK. I'll do it. Bag. Ta. Here we go. Breath. (Hissing) Breath. (Hissing) Both lungs ventilated! Cricoid off, please. (He pants) Well done, Billy. Ta. Let's get that brace on here. Brace. (Fabric rips) I don't have enough room here for a saw. Do you have bolt-cutters? Bolt croppers? OK, listen. This is going to need to be fast. Billy, I need you to move this tourniquet down to just above his knee and then pull it tight, please. And I mean tight as a drum. Yes? Yeah. Sorry. Tell me when. Yeah, got it. Fresh blade in there, please. Yeah. There you go. We good? Yeah. Cutting. Coming around.
