 [Growls] 
 [Snarling] 
 I told you to meet me, not eat me! 
 Hey, man, we're not playing paintball out here, okay? 
 You want to practice your Grimm skills, you gotta be ready for anything. 
 Now could you get off me, please? 
 I'm finding this a little, you know, awkward. 
 [Groans] 
 Come on. 
 And I told you to use wolfsbane, dude. 
 I could smell you a mile off. 
 I used wolfsbane. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Use more. 
 [Laughs] 
 No, no, easy. Come on. 
 Eine doppelarmbrust. Somebody's getting serious. 
 My ancestors used all of this stuff, you know? 
 I figured it's about time for me to learn it. 
 Dude, you have a gun. 
 I can't shoot everybody. 
 Plus, I used pepper spray on this kid the other day, turns out he was a skalengeck. Had no effect. 
 Skalengeck. He probably enjoyed it. 
 Yeah, this definitely would've done the trick, but how are you gonna explain all this stuff to Hank? 
 I don't know. 
 Check it out. 
 The first bolt is meant to slow the attacker down. 
 You fill it with hellebore extract. 
 According to the book, that's supposed to act like a tranquilizer gun. 
 And if that doesn't work, you always have the second bolt, filled with hemlock. 
 Whew. 
 You know, these were designed specifically to stop blutbaden. 
 Mmm. 
 I suppose I should take that as sort of a backhanded compliment, huh? 
 I know how to shoot. 
 Not bad. 
 Now... 
 Anyone for some kanabo? 
 Dude, out of the park. 
 You're running a little late, Robert. 
 Oh, yeah. Sorry, Sal. 
 Got the money? 
 Look, Sal, I've thought a lot about our conversation, and I've made a decision. 
 I'm not gonna pay. 
 You think you're being brave, but you're not, Robert. 
 You're being stupid and reckless. 
 Now I understand you have to protect your interests. 
 The thing is, I have to protect mine. 
 I'm going to the district attorney and there's nothing you can do to stop me. 
 You seem like a man who likes to bury himself in his work. 
 Let's see if I can't help you do that. 
 [Screams] 
 Yeah, yeah, I checked the rebar. 
 I'm just wrapping up. 
 Hey, w-will you save me a couple of slices and a few cold ones? 
 I don't know, like, ten minutes. 
 Hey... hey, look, I'll be there. 
 Okay, I'll be there. Bye-bye. 
 [Man groaning] 
 [Phone dialing] 
 911, what's your emergency? 
 Yeah, you... You gotta come quick! 
 The construction site off of 99e, under the Gladstone bridge! 
 Oh, my God, he killed him. 
 He killed him. 
 What's your name, please? 
 M-my... my name? Um, my name is, uh... 
 Uh, my name is...

 [Both screaming] 
 Arnold! 
 What are you doing here? 
 [Weakly] 
 I saw something terrible. 
 What? 
 What did you see? 
 Hey. 
 We didn't get a name from the 911 call, but whoever it was saw the whole thing go down. 
 Did we I.D. our vic? 
 According to the wallet, Robert Grosszahn, not that the picture helps much. 
 Whoa. Now that's some old-school mob stuff. 
 Yeah, this is Detective Burkhardt. 
 We're gonna need an I.D. On the 911 caller. 
 Yeah, the witness at the Gladstone bridge construction site. Thank you. 
 Robert Grosszahn, as in Grosszahn constructions? 
 They're a pretty big operation. 
 I'm guessing that's his truck. 
 Let's take a look. 
 Let's check his calendar. 
 He may have had a late appointment. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Yeah? 
 Thank you. 
 Dispatch just I.D.'d our witness. 
 Arnold Rosarot. 3863 Woodland Road. 
 Let's check it out. 
 Doesn't look like he's home. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 [Handle clicks] 
 Unlocked. 
 Missing witness to a murder? 
 Exigent circumstances to any judge I know. 
 Hmm. 
 Hello? 
 Man loved himself some whirligigs. 
 Nice work. 
 Yeah, nice... but weird. 
 None of us have ever seen a Grimm before. 
 Where's the beer? 
 You! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Who's "Eisbiber"? 
 That's a possible witness. 
 You know what I would like to do? 
 I think so. 
 I should probably shower first, I'm a little bit cementy. 
 No, I would like to invite your friend Monroe over for dinner. 
 Oh, uh... Yeah, that's a good idea. 
 But, you know... 
 We're not... 
 He's not really a, uh... 
 He did save my life. 
 I think it would be a nice gesture. 
 Come on, what does he like to eat? 
 I don't know. Honey, Monroe's really not a dinner kind of guy. 
 He's a loner. I think he'll be uncomfortable. 
 Well, why don't you just ask him? 
 And if he says no, I'll think of something else. 
 A picnic maybe. 
 It's worth a try, I guess. 
 Good. 
 Ew, cementy. 
 [Sighs] 
 So what would you have us do? 
 I don't know, just... Just say you're sick. 
 That works for one night, then what? 
 Besides, that would be totally rude of me. 
 I think it's a very nice offer. 
 Monroe, think about this for one second. 
 What would we possibly talk about? 
 "Oh, gee, guys, how did you two meet?" 
 "Well, honey, it all started when I found out Monroe was a blutbad, and that was right after I found out I was a Grimm. And by the way, did I tell you that I can see things other people can't?" 
 Okay, okay. 
 So technically, we would have to... 
 Bend the truth about some things. 
 Some things? Monroe, name one aspect of our relationship that we wouldn't have to lie about. 
 You're right. 
 All the time we've spent together. 
 All the sneaking around. 
 God, suddenly, it just seems so wrong. 
 She's a really good cook, isn't she? 
 Yeah, she's fantastic. 
 Monroe, please stop thinking about food for a second. 
 Okay, look, the only way we do anything like this is if we agree on a story, we keep it simple, and then we stick to it. 
 Yep. Simple story, stick to it. 
 Okay. 
 So how did we meet? 
 Well... In my experience, the best lies are sort of the truth. 
 Was he having any problems with the business? 
 No. 
 I mean, it was a stressful job, and he was doing battle with the planning commission. 
 I worked with him for almost ten years. 
 He was like a father to me. To everyone here really. 
 Well, what kind of battle was he doing with the planning commission? 
 Inspections, permits, code compliance. 
 It never ends. 
 There was something scheduled in his cell phone calendar for 9:30. 
 Well, I didn't know anything about it, and I schedule all his meetings. 
 The initials "S.B." were next to the time. 
 Does that mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 Who was he having trouble with at the planning commission? 
 That would be Mr. Butrell. 
 I'm Detective Burkhardt. 
 I'm Detective Griffin. 
 Sit. Sit down. 
 I was really sorry to hear about what happened to Robert. 
 How can I help? 
 Well, we just have a couple questions. 
 Sure, of course. 
 How well did you know Robert Grosszahn? 
 Oh, we've done a few projects over the years, but I've never gone to his house for dinner if that's what you're talking about. 
 And where were you last night at 9:30? 
 Um, the, uh, trip-trap club down on Chauncey. 
 Me and the guys, we, uh, we have a poker night there every Wednesday. 
 You have someone who can vouch for you on that? 
 Only six or so. 
 I hope you don't need any more than that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You don't think I had anything to do with this? 
 Oh, we need to check out everybody who had contact with Robert recently. 
 We understand there was some contention between you two about the bridge project? 
 We found Robert's cell phone at the construction site. 
 In it, there was an appointment at 9:30 with someone with the initials "S.B." 
 You know, we did talk about setting something up for 9:30 this morning, but he never got back to me. 
 Maybe he put it in his phone wrong. 
 Sorry to intrude. We got Johnson construction down there asking about the permits for the highway. 
 Tell them I'll be there in a few. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Tell these detectives where I was last night. 
 Oh, he was with a bunch of us down at the club, taking all our money. 
 Need to know how much? 
 That's okay. 
 We're done for now. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 Wait a second. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Get in here. 
 We have a problem. 
 What problem? Cops bought it. 
 One of them is a Grimm. 
 Detective Burkhardt! 
 I was surprised, but so glad you called. 
 Would you like some carrot cake? 
 My wife, Phoebe, left me two of them. 
 She's, uh, at her mother's in terre haute with the kids. 
 She, uh, misses her mother. 
 I don't, but hey, that's nothing you need to worry about. 
 I just need some help. 
 Absolutely. Whatever you need, I'm there. 
 I'm trying to track down a witness... 
 Wow, okay. Not what I expected. 
 To Robert Grosszahn's murder. 
 And I was thinking it might be someone you know, a, uh, Arnold Rosarot. 
 Arnold? Y-you... 
 Arnold saw Robert's murder? 
 Well, he's the one who called 911, but I have not been able to track him down, and I was hoping you might be able to tell me where he is. 
 I wish I could help you, but I haven't seen Arnold in weeks. 
 Well, one more thing. 
 Do you have any idea what this is? 
 Aah! A hasslich! 
 Uh, you think that's who murdered Robert? 
 Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. 
 Oh, well, Arnold was working on a bridge for Robert. 
 And the hasslichen, they have a real thing for Bridges. 
 They... they think they own them. 
 No one touches them without those guys getting a cut. 
 So you're talking extortion? 
 Well, tradition. 
 It's just that it's always been this way. 
 No one likes it. 
 You see, most of the construction firms in town are Eisbiber, which means you gotta pay the troll, so to speak. 
 Listen to me. 
 I need to find Arnold if I'm ever gonna bring this guy down. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, if Arnold's hiding, I might know where. 
 If I'm right, I'll come to your house and carve a small series of numbers on the porch steps. 
 The odd numbers will mean... 
 Or just call me. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 [Laughs] 
 That would work too. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll call you, huh? 
 All right, thanks, bud. 
 Sure. Sure thing. 
 Looks good. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Knock at door] 
 Hey, welcome to our home. 
 Thanks. Oh, it's great to be here. 
 Oh, you didn't have to do all this. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Hi, Nick. 
 Hi, Monroe. 
 How's it going? 
 Good. How's it going with you? 
 Good. 
 Ah, let me get your coat. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 [Laughs] 
 Thanks, Nick. 
 I hope you like vegan salmon. 
 Oh, I love vegan salmon. 
 Good, well, come on in. I'm gonna go put these in water. 
 It was a vintage Lusina, Valijoux movement, triple chronograph, original complications... 
 Which means month and date. 
 So I open the back of this grand old watch, and the killer had put glue in it to stop the movement. 
 At the exact time and date that he was sentenced to prison for life. 
 That's crazy. 
 So you've helped Nick a few times? 
 Yeah, you know, whenever I can. 
 So how did you guys meet? 
 Well, we met when that little girl was kidnapped. 
 Oh, I remember that. That was awful. 
 You helped with that case too? 
 Sure did. 
 Well, what did you do? Were there clocks involved? 
 Mm-mmm. 
 No, in that case, it had nothing to do with clocks. 
 It had to do with boots. 
 Boots? 
 Yes, a particular kind of boot. 
 See, there was a print in the park across the street from where Monroe lives. 
 And believe it or not, I saw those very same boots on my local postman. 
 Who happened to be the guy that we were after. 
 Well, that was kinda lucky. 
 Well, a little luck, a little skill. 
 You develop a nose for these things. 
 That's amazing, based on a pair of boots you could find out where the guy lived. 
 Yeah, and his cabin is way out there. 
 I don't think Nick could have found it without me. 
 You went there with Nick? 
 I thought you went there with Hank. 
 I did. 
 And with you too? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 I mean, yes, in the sense that... I knew that the cabin was owned by the postman who wore the boots, because... 
 Uh, because I told him where it was. 
 You told him where the cabin was? 
 I thought he told you where the cabin was? 
 Who? 
 Monroe. 
 I did. 
 You told him about the cabin? 
 No, I told him about the boots, because... 
 The boots led us to the cabin. 
 Uh, which means, in other words, without the boots, there would be no cabin. 
 This is so delicious, I can't even explain it. 
 Is it, by any chance, honey-pepper cedar plank vegan salmon? 
 Because mark my words, I am not leaving your house without this recipe. 
 Can I have it now, actually, just to be safe? 
 
 
 
 We need to talk. 
 What's wrong? 
 You're hiding Arnold. 
 What... no... What are you talking about? 
 Nick told me Arnold saw what happened to Robert Grosszahn, and if Arnold's hiding, this is the first place he'd go. 
 But I... 
 Don't "but" me, John. 
 I checked your side yard. 
 You pulled the tarp over the basement doors and pushed those potted ferns around to block sight lines from the street. 
 Well, I had to do something. If the hasslich find him... 
 I need to talk to Arnold. Where is he? 
 What... what are you doing, giving tours? 
 No one's supposed to know I'm here! 
 Take it easy, it's only bud. 
 Oh, geez. 
 Arnold, I know you're scared, but this isn't gonna work. 
 It's working so far. 
 You can't stay down here the rest of your life. 
 If I come out now, I won't have a life to have the rest of! 
 You saw what happened to Robert. 
 You saw who did it. 
 Believe me, I wish I hadn't. 
 You're the only witness. You know who killed Robert! 
 I think you should consider coming forward. 
 Come forward and get killed? 
 Come forward and have a hasslich do to me what he did to Robert, or worse? 
 There's something worse than being buried alive in cement? 
 We're talking about hasslichen! 
 Look, it doesn't have to be that way. 
 We're not on our own here. We have someone on our side. 
 Nick said that he would... 
 Wait, Nick? 
 Who... who's Nick? 
 Nick Burkhardt. 
 Detective Nick Burkhardt. The Grimm. 
 You're on a first-name basis with the Grimm? 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 He's not the enemy, Arnold! 
 The hasslichen are the enemy! 
 No, I'm staying right here. I'm not going anywhere! 
 And no one can make me leave! 
 Uh, well, technically, I could. 
 This I house. 
 You would do that? 
 That's not the point. 
 Nick wants to help, but he can't help us if we don't help him. 
 Do you realize what this could mean for us? 
 Having a Grimm on our side? It could change everything. 
 If I tell the police who killed Robert, it won't matter if the hasslichen can't find me. 
 They'll just kill one of you, or two of you, or three of you! 
 Their point still gets made: Don't rock the boat. 
 Arnold's right, this is something that affects us all. 
 We need to take this to the lodge. 
 The lodge? No. No, then everyone will know. 
 Wait, Oblinger has a point. 
 We'll do this the way we always do it, fair and Democratic. 
 Everyone gets heard. Then we'll put it to a vote. 
 We all have a stake in this. What do you say? 
 I don't know. 
 I just want it to all go away. 
 Sometimes it doesn't go away unless you make it go away. 
 This situation could turn into a big problem for all of us. 
 All right, all right. Let's not panic. 
 You didn't have a Grimm in your office questioning you about a murder! 
 He saw me. He knows. 
 Well, we could leave town, wait for all this to blow over. 
 Are you kidding? 
 I might as well send them a signed confession. 
 Well, I was actually just talking about me and Herman. 
 You know, you could call us when the coast is clear. 
 Well, let me clear a little coast for you right now. 
 We're gonna kill him. It's the only way. 
 Kill a Grimm? Is that even possible? 
 The Grimm needs to be dealt with. 
 But how? 
 The same way Grimms have always been dealt with. 
 Reapers. 
 Y-you're talking about going nuclear. 
 I'm talking about protecting ourselves, protecting what we've built. 
 This is crazy. 
 A reaper? Where would we even find one? 
 My great-Uncle Mamoose was one. 
 They made him a reaper after he cut the head off a Grimm in Copenhagen. 
 Sal, are you sure this is the thing to do? 
 Give me another choice. 
 So what'd you think? 
 Well, Monroe is definitely one of the stranger people I have ever met, but he did save my life, and I think I love him. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, well, should I be jealous? 
 Maybe. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Ooh... 
 Burkhardt. 
 Hey, Nick, uh, sorry to call so late, and I hope I'm not interrupting anything with you and your lady friend, Juliette, whom I adore, by the way. 
 Bud, what is it? 
 Can you be at the old power plant at the bull run dam tomorrow night, 9:00? 
 We're calling an emergency lodge meeting and Arnold will be there. 
 And so will I. Bud, thank you so much. 
 You're welcome, Nick... Uh, Mr.... 
 Uh, Det... Detective Burkhardt. 
 "Nick" is fine.

 You face death every day, I don't. 
 So where's this meeting? 
 It's in the lodge. 
 We gotta take the stairs. 
 Look, I'm gonna take you in, make an introduction, and then you'll, you know, make it clear that there's a threat to our society and that the only way to deal with it is take responsibility for our own... 
 Well, I don't want to tell you what to say, even though I guess I already have. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Yeah. 
 You called for us and we are here. 
 Already? 
 We need to meet. 
 Don't keep us waiting. 
 Yeah, just tell me where. 
 Eisbiber and hasslichen have lived by certain customs for centuries! 
 I can't say that I like it, nor can I say that it's fair, but what I can say is that as long as each of us lives by those customs, no one gets hurt. 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 [Gavel banging] 
 Quiet! 
 With all due respect, we're getting hurt all the time. 
 We're living in constant fear, and that's no way to live! 
 We've got to stand up to these monsters! 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 [Gavel banging] 
 Order! Order! 
 The assembly has been advised of tonight's question. 
 Will Eisenbud Wurstner please come forward and introduce our guest? 
 Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to request this meeting. 
 If it pleases the lodge, I would like to introduce Detective Nicholas Burkhardt of the Portland police department, and I'm proud to say, my friend. 
 [Sighs] 
 One of you has witnessed a murder. 
 And without that testimony, that murderer might very well walk free. 
 Look, I understand your fear, I really do, but I want you to know that things can change. 
 I'm a Grimm, and I'm also a cop, and I can help you, but only if you help yourselves first. 
 So please let Arnold Rosarot know that if he comes forward, then together we can put an end to this hasslich threat. 
 When someone defies the hasslichen, they send us a message. 
 I don't want my husband or my children to end up being that message. 
 I say we send a message back to the hasslichen. 
 "We've got a Grimm. 
 You mess with us, you lose your head!" 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 [Gavel banging] 
 Call to order! 
 Order! 
 We will put the question to a vote. 
 All those in favor of the witness coming forward? 
 Those opposed? 
 [Sighs] 
 I move to request that the Grimm does not cut off our heads for opposing him on this question. 
 We are... 
 We are what we are. 
 Nick! I'm sorry! 
 You did your best. 
 I really thought we had a chance to change things. 
 It's just that bravery isn't in our nature. 
 Hey, I don't know about that, bud. 
 Even after you knew what I was, you still came to my house, fixed my door, brought me pie and a quilt, and that took guts. 
 I figured if you could do it, so could they. 
 Thanks for trying.

 It's not just Arnold, it's all of us. 
 At that meeting, I saw us through Nick's eyes. 
 I saw us for what we really are. 
 I wouldn't be surprised if the Grimm never speaks to us again. 
 I can't believe I just said that. 
 Yeah, well, I never thought I'd say this, but for the first time in my life, I'm ashamed to be an Eisbiber.

 Yeah, sure, anything. 
 I'm the one that called you guys! 
 I'm the one whose great Uncle used to be a reaper. 
 [Coughs] 
 Not one bit of physical evidence to tie Sal to the murder. 
 And he's got a solid alibi. 
 Three guys can vouch that he was playing poker with them that night. 
 What about the witness? 
 Still in the wind. 
 Checked his home, his work, put an APB on his car. Coming up empty. 
 Do you know he's still alive? 
 Haven't found a body. 
 My guess is he's too terrified to come forward. 
 Yeah, he's not too terrified to call 911, but when push comes to shove, he won't come forward. 
 What kind of person is this? 
 We have nothing unless we find this guy and convince him to do his civic duty. 
 Put some more people on this, otherwise we're gonna lose this case.

 This is Detective Nick Burkhardt. 
 What can I do for you? 
 We have a few more questions for you. 
 We're gonna need you to come downtown.

 What if I don't want to go downtown to answer any more questions? 
 I'll be forced to send officers to make sure you do. 
 Look, let's just cut to the chase. 
 I know what you are. You know what I am. 
 Let's just have a face-to-face. 
 Off-the-record, so to speak.

 Do you see the man who killed Robert Grosszahn? 
 Third man from the right. 
 Just take your time, make sure. 
 I'm sure. That's him.

 They're just gonna keep coming for me until I'm dead, aren't they? 
 Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how it works. 
 I think I need to send them a message. 
 I think you do too. 
 And you know what? 
 When it comes to sending these guys messages, two heads are better than one. 
 [Squelch] 
 Surprised to see me? 
 No. 
 I met your friends. 
 What happened? 
 Oh, you know how it is. 
 They got angry... 
 Kinda lost their heads. 
 Hey, what's wrong? 
 There's just so many. 
 What are you talking about? 
 They've been dropping them off all day. 
 What did you do? 
 Just my job.
