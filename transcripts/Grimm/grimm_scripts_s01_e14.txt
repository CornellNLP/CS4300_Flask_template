 Look at this. 
 You think somebody got here before us? 
 You didn't tell anybody, did you? 
 [Chuckling] No! I didn't tell anybody. 
 I'm gonna be pissed off if someone did. 
 Open it. 
 It's warm. 
 Maybe we should just let this one go, man. 
 No, nobody else is getting our copper. 
 [Metal clanking] 
 Someone's here. 
 There's no truck outside except ours. 
 Maybe they already took a load. 
 I mean, someone's still cutting. 
 Well, they're gonna have to share. 
 [Fire crackling] 
 They got a torch. 
 Whoever's down here, you better get the hell out. 
 We're security, and we'll arrest your ass if we find it. 
 You take off now and... 
 We'll forget you were ever here. 
 I'm not gonna tell you again. 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Growling] 
 The hell... 
 I-I can't breathe. 
 [Both screaming] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 Idiot! 
 You trying to get yourself killed? 
 [/i]Where are the bodies? 
 Downstairs in the basement. 
 What condition? 
 Toast. 
 We get an I.D. Yet? 
 It's gonna require dental work, but we've got the pickup, registered to Joseph Oliver, small-time operator. 
 I've arrested him a couple times for stealing scrap. 
 But I couldn't tell you that was him in that basement. 
 Lance Truman, waiting to talk to you. 
 Found the break-in this morning, called it in. 
 Guy with him is his contractor. 
 Arson downstairs? 
 Yeah. 
 Vance, he's downstairs doing the prelim. 
 You wanna talk to Truman? 
 Oh, let's see what the bodies have to say first. 
 Okay... 
 It's pretty rank down there. 
 Looks like they were here to steal the copper. 
 We found a pile of it in a cart over there. 
 Were they using torches? 
 If they were, we didn't find any. 
 Well, then, how'd they set themselves on fire? 
 Guess that's why we have an arson investigator. 
 Ooh. 
 What do we got? 
 Where's my "good morning"? 
 Good morning, Jordan. 
 [Chuckling] 
 What do we got? 
 Not a heck of a lot. 
 Two dead...Men, I think. 
 Don't know the source of the fire, but it happened pretty quick, so whatever they were working with, it was extremely volatile. 
 Don't know the source of ignition yet either. 
 Usually you don't burn a body. 
 Unless you're trying to cover up a homicide. 
 Well, that's if they were dead. 
 Burn patterns suggest ignition occurred here, and they were thrown up against the wall. 
 As a result of the blast. 
 Well, so someone doused them first? 
 Explosion like this, had to be. 
 Gasoline? 
 No, we would smell that. 
 I'll know more after I run some tests. 
 But here's the odd thing... 
 A body has to burn for a few hours. 
 To reach this state of immolation. 
 So whatever it was got really hot really fast. 
 Like getting hit with napalm. 
 That's kind of brutal. 
 Let's talk to the owner. 
 This is the third building I own that's been hit. 
 Anything copper, they take it. 
 I put fences around my buildings, I padlock them. Doesn't make any difference. 
 They just cut into any type of lock I put on it. 
 Well, they didn't use a welder's torch. 
 There's no clean-cut mark. It's like... 
 The whole area around the latch is melted. 
 I don't know what they use, but that's the same as all my other buildings. 
 This feels like oil. 
 Anybody have a match? 
 A lighter. 
 Thanks. 
 Damn. 
 Am I reading this right? Lipids? 
 Yes, basically human fat. 
 Human fat. Are you sure? 
 No mistake about that. 
 Mixed with a lot of methane. 
 If sprayed and ignited, it'll flash and burn. 
 And become intensely hot. 
 Where does someone get that much human fat? 
 Well, if it were beef, I would say a butcher shop. 
 But human fat, uh... 
 A morgue maybe, I don't know. 
 We're running samples for DNA. 
 We think it's a homicide. 
 Why? 
 No evidence of ignition at the scene. 
 So whoever set them on fire had to have taken it with them. 
 The same substance was used. 
 To burn through the lock on the gate. 
 And the lock on the loading dock door. 
 And we found other instances of similar break-ins, all at abandoned or shut down properties. 
 Someone stealing copper is nothing new. 
 You check with the scrap yards? 
 Yeah, according to them, they're not seeing any copper. 
 So whoever's stealing it isn't selling it. 
 Makes a lot of sense. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Sorry to interrupt. Witness just came in. 
 Says he saw somebody running away. 
 From that building last night. 
 I was driving by that building last night. 
 I didn't think anything of it. 
 Until I heard about the two guys dying on the news. 
 You saw someone outside the building? 
 Yeah, he ran right in front of me. 
 I almost hit him. 
 I don't know if he had anything to do with it, but he was there, and he looked scared. 
 Can you describe him? 
 Huh. I'll never forget. 
 Half his face was scarred up. 
 His hair was all scraggly, like he hadn't shaved in a while, and he was wearing a long coat. 
 My guess is he was homeless. 
 What happened after you stopped? 
 I yelled at him for being an idiot. 
 He kept on running. 
 You didn't see him get into a vehicle? 
 No. 
 We'd like you to talk to the police artist, see if you can work up a sketch of what he looked like. 
 Okay. 
 Oof! 
 That's pretty close. 
 Hey, 9-1-1 call just came in. 
 Lance Truman got attacked outside the building. 
 Where we found the burn vics. 
 Got a patrol car en route. 
 [Siren] 
 We need an ambulance at 391 Clark street. 
 He hit me. 
 I think he's still inside the building. 
 Stay with him. 
 He returned to the scene of the crime? 
 If you see him, do not go near him. 
 Keep a visual and radio it. 
 [Rustling in distance] 
 The shopping cart's gone. 
 How'd they get it upstairs? 
 The elevator's not working. 
 The only way is the stairs. 
 Wu : We got movement up here. 
 [Rustling in the distance] 
 I heard something. 
 [Walkie-talkie crackles] 
 In the shipping and receiving area. 
 Toward the back. 
 [Walkie-talkie crackles] 
 [Coughing] 
 I got sprayed... Can't breathe. 
 Move back. Run. 
 Do not fire your gun. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Coughing] 
 Stay where you are. 
 Oh, jeez! 
 [Growling] 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, you? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, I'm not. 
 This stuff is in my eyes, my nose, my ears... 
 I saw him. It's definitely the guy with the scar. 
 See where he went? 
 No. 
 Let's get him out of here. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 I like that idea a lot. 
 Burkhardt. 
 Yeah? It's vance. 
 He got DNA results on the lipids. 
 We got an I.D. Go ahead. 
 Fred Eberhart. 
 48 years old. 
 Been in and out of the V.A. Hospital. 
 For several years now. 
 Desert storm vet and decorated war hero. 
 You talk to V.A. About him? I did. 
 They said they haven't seen him in the last six months. 
 Evidently, Eberhart drops off the grid quite a bit. 
 Any known address? 
 No. 
 What about a last job? 
 Worked as a welder for the rail road, but they, uh, laid him off two years ago. 
 Where's he from? 
 Local boy. 
 Portland, born and raised. 
 Any relatives here? 
 There's a daughter. Uh... 
 Ariel Eberhart. 
 V.A. Had a phone number as next of kin. 
 Well, let's see if she's home. 
 Did you get a look at what Eberhart was using? 
 Was it a tank of some kind? It was too dark to tell. 
 But I heard some kind of noise, like a real bad smoker's cough. 
 Next thing I know, a ball of flame was coming at us. 
 Well, it's not a home phone or a cell phone. 
 Got an answering machine for club Trop Chaud. 
 Maybe she works there. 
 It's on my way home. I'll check it out. 
 [Loud music] 
 Hi. 
 Show's already started, but if you're alone, I can squeeze you in. 
 Oh, I'm, uh... 
 Looking for Ariel Eberhart. You know her? 
 There she is.

 Hey, Nick. 
 What are you doing here, man? 
 Not exactly the last place in the world I'd expect to see you, but, uh... 
 Pretty darn close. So you come here a lot? 
 What, me? No. 
 Yeah, sometimes. 
 Okay, a lot. Come on, she is smoking hot. 
 ♪ this fire is out of control ♪  
 ♪ I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city ♪ . 
 I got a case involving her father. 
 He's some kind of a... 
 Daemonfeuer. 
 You sure we should be conversing like this here? 
 No. 
 I was hoping you'd say that. 
 ♪ oh, how I burn for you 
 ♪ and burn. 
 So daemonfeuer? 
 You just said we weren't gonna do that in here. 
 Okay. 
 I really don't know that much about them. 
 There's not that many of them around any more. 
 They're kind of a throwback to the days of yore, you know? 
 Knights in shining armor. 
 From my understanding, they come from a dragon-like lineage. 
 Oh, I thought dragons were mythological. 
 Dragons are. Daemonfeuers aren't. 
 Well, so can they breathe fire? 
 Well, in an obtuse way, I guess they can, yeah. 
 I mean, from my understanding, and I'm telling you, I am not an expert on this, it's a kind of ketonic... 
 What's the word I'm looking for... vomit. 
 You ever hear of the low-carb, high-fat diet? 
 Puts your body in a state of ketosis, where it burns its own fat. 
 In their case, they can vaporize their own fat. 
 Highly explosive and kind of disgusting. 
 Unless, of course, you're dancing half-naked. 
 On a stage. Well, how do they ignite it? 
 Static electricity would be my guess. 
 What did her father do? 
 Well, he may have burned. 
 A couple guys to death. Ooh. 
 Actually, that reminds me... 
 I got a call from my cousin Naydler in antwerp. 
 Apparently, a grimm was found dead in a back alley. 
 Off the Krijgsbaan near the Schoonselhof, which I'm sure means nothing to you. 
 Well, when? 
 Two days ago. 
 He was decapitated, and the head has not been found. 
 Rumor has it, it was the reapers. 
 So I'm thinking, you know, you should watch yourself. 
 [Knock at door] 
 I'm detective Burkhardt. I need to talk to you. 
 Lucky me. 
 I'm investigating an arson-related homicide. 
 I had that tattoo way before the books came out. 
 Am I your first daemonfeuer? 
 I hope so. 
 You're my first grimm. 
 I was a little worried I wouldn't get to see you again. 
 Although I have to say... 
 You're not exactly what I expected. 
 What did you expect? 
 Grimms are bad-asses. 
 And that's kind of a turn-on. 
 Unless, of course, you're gonna cut off my head. 
 I'm looking for your father, Fred Eberhart. 
 You're not gonna find him here. 
 He's a suspect in an arson investigation. 
 Two men died. 
 So you figure where there's smoke, there's an Eberhart? Do you know where he is? 
 No. 
 When was the last time you saw him? 
 My father's a bit of a lost soul, detective. 
 After my mother passed away, he fell apart. 
 He blamed himself. Maybe he should have. 
 He didn't protect her. 
 Anyway, he couldn't handle anything. 
 Especially me. 
 I kind of lost both parents at the same time. 
 Does he have any friends who might know where he is? 
 I wouldn't know. I wish I did. 
 Sometimes I really miss him. 
 You sure it was him? 
 Yeah. 
 So you want to put my father in prison, and you want me to help. 
 I want to stop him before he hurts someone else. 
 So should you. 
 
 
 
 [Car starts] 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Flames roaring] 
 [Grunting] 
 Wow, and I thought I was hot. 
 Okay, just wait a minute here. 
 No, I'm glad you stopped by. 
 Next time, try using the front door. 
 Oh, I just saw something in your backyard. 
 You did. I was doing a little purging. 
 [Honeinging] 
 Hello, Nick's phone. What do you want? 
 Who is this? 
 Uh, this is a friend of Nick's. 
 Who's this? Give me the phone. 
 Where's Nick? 
 He's right here with me. 
 Hey, hey! 
 Hey, take it easy, baby. Ow, oh, that kind of feels good. 
 Ah! Uh... Which one's Juliette? 
 Juliette, I can explain. 
 Oh, good, I can't wait. 
 Oh, you're not leaving so soon, are you? 
 After you came all this way? 
 I hope you're not some kind of a tease. 
 Remember, Nick, you came for me. I didn't come for you. 
 Why wasn't Hank with you? 
 Because he went home. 
 All right? I told him I'd follow up on a number, which led me to the club, which led me to her, which led me to her house. And Juliette... 
 She's... I mean, she's crazy. 
 How'd she get your phone? 
 It fell out of my pocket in the backyard. 
 Oh, so it just jumped out into her hands? 
 Oh, stop. 
 No, that is... I know where you're going, and that is not what happened. 
 Okay, I was hit. 
 She hit you? 
 Yeah. 
 Why didn't you arrest her for assaulting an officer? 
 Because I'm trying to get her to help me find her dad. 
 What does this girl do besides hitting young men. 
 In her backyard? 
 Well, she's a fire dancer. 
 [Laughing] 
 Juliette, listen. 
 I could not make this up if I wanted to. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 I hope so. 
 I would never do anything like that to you. 
 Then make sure you keep your phone in your pocket. 
 "His children were even more fierce "than the daemonfeuer, "willing to sacrifice themselves for him. 
 "We avoided them and followed the daemonfeuer "high into the mountains "where we discovered his terrible lair, "filled with treasure stolen from all the villages. 
 "The bones at the entrance of the cave "were too many to count. 
 "If we did not know better, we would've guessed it was the entrance to hell." 
 That's just what I need... 
 An entrance to hell. 
 It's gonna be okay, daddy. 
 I found someone who's gonna make you better. 
 Eberhart was one of the best welders we had. 
 Learned in the military. 
 Told me his old man handled a flamethrower in Vietnam, and his grandfather used one in the South pacific. 
 He was pretty proud of that. 
 When was the last time you saw him? 
 A couple weeks ago. 
 I tried to talk to him, but he ran off. 
 He's gone crazy. 
 You know, his wife died in a fire, and he was never the same after that. 
 Just stopped showing up. 
 Felt bad for him, but what could I do? 
 Where was he when you saw him last? 
 Over by an old line we don't use any more. 
 It's an old, uh, mining spur. 
 You see where he came from or went? 
 No. He was just walking down the tracks. 
 I got it. 
 It's a map from 1945 showing all the old rail lines. 
 This is the old rail station right there. 
 This is the spur line he was talking about. 
 It goes right up into the hills. 
 And it branches off into four tracks. 
 Nice place for a lair. 
 A what? 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Uh, you know... A... a good place to hide. 
 Burkhardt. 
 Hi, it's me. 
 I'm putting on a special show tonight... 
 Just for you. 
 Don't disappoint me. 
 Listen to me... 
 I know, Nick, you're taken. 
 I'm just having fun. Listen... 
 I've decided to help you find my father. 
 Come by my house tonight, and I'll tell you everything I know. 
 Who was that? 
 That was Ariel Eberhart. 
 Says she wants to help us find her dad. 
 How? 
 I don't know. 
 Said she wants me to stop by. 
 Her house tonight. Really? 
 You sure she's not playing a little badge bunny with you? 
 All I know is, you're coming with me. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Okay, I'm gonna be right up front. 
 I'm gonna be late, and the investigation is taking us back. 
 To the fire dancer's house. 
 And I do mean "us." Hank's coming with me. 
 Tell her, Hank. 
 I'm going with him. 
 [Laughs] 
 Okay? 
 Okay, okay. 
 I get it. I trust you. 
 Maybe I'll be waiting for you when you get home. 
 Have a little fire dance of our own. 
 Oh. Can't wait. 
 Ooh, man, this place must be fun in a storm. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin. 
 If her father knew she was trying. 
 To help us find him... 
 Her life could be in danger. 
 That's what I'm thinking. 
 What the hell? 
 It's all copper. 
 Why? 
 I mean, I had an aunt who wore tinfoil hats for years, but this... 
 Jeez. 
 So... 
 Where is she? 
 [Thunder rumbling] 
 [Electricity buzzing] 
 You hear that? 
 Yeah. 
 I think it's time for us to... 
 Get the hell out. 
 'Bout all we can do is run an apb on her car, see if we can pick her up. 
 Till then, you might as well go home and get a little... 
 Rest. 
 Where you going, baby? 
 Where's Juliette? 
 What do you care? You've got me now. 
 I'm asking you one last time. 
 Ooh, knight in shining armor. 
 Where is she? 
 [Coughing] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Juliette, where are you? 
 She's with me. 
 Time for a little search and rescue. 
 Where are you taking her? 
 Oh, come on, Nick. 
 Where do you think? 
 You know who we are. 
 You know what we do. 
 What do you want? 
 I'd lost hope of being able to help my father... 
 Until I found you. 
 Offering my father a chance at redemption. 
 Now grimm up... it's time to face your daemonfeuer. 
 Oh, and if you want to see her alive again, no cops. 
 Well, my guess? "Meet your daemonfeuer" means, you know, "see you at the lair." 
 And according to this map, the third track. 
 Goes into a tunnel, which would be... 
 Perfect. 
 Dude. 
 You know what she's doing? You know what this is all about? 
 I can't believe I didn't see it before. 
 What? 
 It is so classic. 
 What? 
 The quest. 
 Your princess has been taken by the dragon. 
 Right? And the rest is obvious. 
 You know? Beautiful women being taken, dragged into caves, and the men sacrificing everything. 
 To go after them. 
 It is the ancient archetype. 
 Of the whole relationship megillah. 
 The only problem is, somebody always dies. 
 [Thunder rumbling] 
 That's Juliette's car. 
 It looks like the tunnel is all the way down those tracks. 
 That's a long walk. 
 There's got to be a quicker way. 
 What about that? 
 Hell, yeah. 
 That's a Fairmont section car, man. 
 A draisine. Any idea how it works? 
 I haven't been a model train collector. 
 All these years for nothing. 
 All right. 
 [Laughing] 
 Now, just so you know, Baron Karl Christian Ludwig Drais von Sauerbronn. 
 Invented the precursor to this called a [i]Laufmaschine In 1817, so... You should know that. Great. Come on, baby. [Engine revving] Oh, yeah. [Laughing] Oh! All right. Now, hold on. Whoa, whoops. Sorry about that. Here we go. Hey, I'm just glad I could be here. To, you know, help rescue a woman I've never met before. Or been introduced to. But, you know, I... look, I don't take it personally. Are you really gonna bring that up right now? No, no, I know, I know, I'm just a little nervous. You know, these are daemonfeuers after all. And I know you have a plan, it's just, you know, you haven't shared it with me...Yet. Oh, dear God. Dad, wake up. I brought her. She's here, waiting for you. She's just like mom. Now's your chance. Isn't she perfect? Who... who comes for her? Someone worthy of you. We better stop here. [Thunder rumbling] So...What are we gonna do? I mean, you can't use your gun in there, you know, with them breathing all that gas. Ah, it's too bad you don't have a Lance. I bet you got one back in the trailer... I'm giving them what they want...Me. I'm not liking the plan so far. I'm gonna distract them long enough. For you to get Juliette. But what if I can't find her? What if I get burned alive? We're going in no matter what. Okay, no, I got it. Just stay in the present, not the future. [Metal clanging in distance] Ariel! I'm here! Juliette? Ariel! Ariel, think about what you're doing! He's coming for mom. You have to protect mom. [Clanging] Shh. I'm here to help. You're Juliette. We've never been introduced, but I'm a friend of Nick's. Mm! Give me your hands. [Clanging in distance] [Whispers] Don't move. Time for you to scream. Time for you to scream. Oof! We gotta get out of here now. Come on, okay, follow me. [Coughing] [Growling] [Coughing] Oof! [Guttural howl] [Grunts] Argh! [Coughing] [Roars] Dad... You fought valiantly, daddy. You did. I got her, Nick! We're out! You didn't help him. But you did. He died with dignity. Now it's my turn. [Coughing] Ariel. Don't. [Coughing] Father of fire, fierce and wise, dragon blood shall once more rise. Dragon blood... Nick! Avenge thine father by dragon fire. Are you okay? You okay? Yeah, I think so. That was a little close for comfort, man. Thanks. [Cell phone dialing] This is detective Burkhardt... Are you a detective too? More of a... Private investigator... Friend of Nick's. I'm Monroe, by the way. It's nice to meet you. You too. Nick, pull over. You okay? Look, Juliette, I'm sorry. I didn't want this to happen. Look, if I... Had any way of knowing... Nick, she was crazy. How would you ever know. What somebody like that is gonna do? Well, I can't promise it's gonna get any better. I can't promise I can keep doing this. I know you love Juliette... But you have to end it and never see her again. What do you wanna do? All I know is that I'm too tired. To talk about it tonight. Let's just go home. I'm just glad that bitch is dead.
