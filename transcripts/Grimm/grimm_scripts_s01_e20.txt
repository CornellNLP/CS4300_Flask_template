 Mr. Aidikoff, can you open the door? 
 Mr. Aidikoff, we have a warrant! 
 Open the door! 
 Mr. Aidikoff! 
 Facing arrest this morning, Bernard Aidikoff alleged shot himself on the top floor of the building where his investment group had their offices. 
 Federal investigators believe the massive fraud began as early as 1993. 
 The amount missing from client accounts so far, including unsubstantiated gains, has totaled over $35 billion. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Arthur. 
 Spencer, we have to talk. 
 Aidikoff killed himself. I mean, he just killed himself in his office. 
 It's all over the news. 
 He took our money, he took all the money, and he just killed himself. 
 There's nothing. 
 Calm down. 
 It's gone! It's all gone! 
 Listen to me. Go home. 
 I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

 Oh, my God! Arthur... 
 I didn't hear you come home. 
 How do I look? 
 For the charity ball. 
 Well? 
 You look incredible. 
 Well, I should hope so. 
 You stay right here. 
 Arthur? 
 He was making us 20% to 30% a year. 
 At least that's what he said. 
 You know, you read those reports. 
 You put everything with Aidikoff? 
 Yes, except what's in the checking and savings accounts, but you know us, we're not exactly frugal. 
 What about the company funds? 
 I moved everything over to Aidikoff six months ago. 
 Every penny is invested with him. 
 I even borrowed against the house. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I have a huge margin call coming in three days. 
 I haven't told Lucinda anything. 
 Don't. 
 Not yet. 
 Not until we look at... 
 Look at all of our  options. 
 I can't... 
 You think you have a choice? 
 I can't go to her stepmother. 
 Arthur? 
 What are you doing down here? 
 [Giggles] 
 Spencer! 
 I didn't know you were coming over. 
 Oh, Arthur didn't tell me. 
 Why didn't you tell me, you bad boy? 
 Well? What do you think? 
 Beautiful, as always. 
 [Giggles] 
 I am sorry, Arthur. 
 I have to say no. 
 Mavis... 
 Please, Spencer, let me deal with my son-in-law, thank you. 
 While I understand the desperate circumstances of your situation, they are of your own doing. 
 You trusted the wrong people for the wrong reasons, and you've only come to me only because you suddenly find yourself in need of money. 
 It has been a year since your marriage to Lucinda, and I have yet to be invited to your house even once. 
 No, I'm not interested in explanations or excuses, and neither should you be, and I am sorry, but that is all the time I have to give you. 
 I have back-to-back meetings. 
 Give my love to Lucinda. 
 If it wasn't for Henry's money, you'd still be cutting hair in Beaverton. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm a little shocked you've taken this godfather role so seriously, Spencer. 
 I think it would be good for all of you to face a little reality for a change. 
 She is not asking for anything that is not rightfully hers. 
 Henry married me. 
 He may have given me a very good start, but I earned every dollar after that. 
 Now, Lucinda's loss is not mine. 
 She is a big girl now, and it's time for her to take responsibility for her own life, and that of her husband. 
 I promised her father... 
 Get a life... 
 Of your own.

 - Listen to me... 
 [Groans] 
 Two people killed in Rhinebeck, New York, 18 years ago. Reed and Kelly Burkhardt. 
 Nick, wake up, you're having a nightmare. 
 Nick. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh. 
 I don't know what you were dreaming about, but it could not have been good. 
 No, no. It wasn't. 
 Oh. 
 You want to tell me? 
 I was dreaming about my parents and the accident. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know, it's just, it's... 
 One of those things that never leaves you. 
 I can't even imagine how terrible it must have been for you. 
 You know, for the first few years, I wished I was in the car with them. 
 Yeah, thank God for my Aunt. 
 And you know, she's a lot like my mom. 
 Hmm. 
 And without her, I... 
 I don't think I would have survived. 
 Hey, whatever happened to that guy who knew your Aunt? 
 Farley Kolt, or whatever his name was? 
 I let him go. 
 Did he ever tell you anything else about her? 
 Not really. Yeah, I don't even know if he was telling me the truth. 
 Well, we know he was in Rhinebeck when your parents were killed. 
 I don't know, maybe there's something else we could find out. 
 Want me to look into it some more? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Mmm. Come here. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 You staying down here all night? 
 No, I was just thinking. 
 Stop it. 
 Thinking's no fun this late at night. 
 What are you worried about? 
 The usual stuff. 
 Don't want to tell me? 
 I don't want you to lose your smile. 
 That would kill me. 
 I don't want you to lose yours either. 
 I called the factory. 
 She's not there. Where are you? 
 In the car. You call the house? 
 Yeah, I called there first, tried her cell. 
 She's not answering anywhere. 
 Maybe one of us should go over to the house. 
 I'm at the house. I'm just going in now. 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God! 
 [Sobbing] 
 Oh, my God! 
 What? 
 Oh, my God! 
 [Siren wails] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Hey. 
 Could have been an accident, except for the claw marks on her face, and the exploded eyeballs, which I can't say I've seen before, or would like to see ever again. 
 Who found her? 
 She has two grown daughters. 
 Tiffany and Taylor. Neither of them live at home. 
 The older one, Tiffany, called her mother this morning, couldn't get an answer, came over to see if anything was wrong, and discovered there was. 
 Where is she? 
 In the dining room with the other sister. 
 Either of them touch the crime scene? 
 They were both here by the time we arrived. 
 Tiffany said she was too freaked out when she saw her to do anything except dial 911. 
 A lot of broken glass. 
 Chandelier, or what's left of it. 
 I suppose she could have been pushed. 
 Maybe she jumped, trying to get away from somebody. 
 Any sign of forced entry? 
 None. 
 None that we could find. Doors and windows were locked. 
 Well, let's take a look upstairs. 
 Broken glass here, too. 
 Somebody broke everything. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Well, to make it dark. 
 But you wouldn't break the mirror. 
 You know, I didn't see any cuts on her feet, so she didn't come through this. 
 So she had to fall before the glass broke. 
 Or as it was breaking. 
 Let's talk to the daughters. 
 I'm Detective Griffin. This is Detective Burkhardt. 
 We're sorry for your loss. 
 We were hoping you would be up to answering a couple of questions. 
 All right. 
 You have any idea who might have done this? 
 Yes. 
 Who? 
 Our brother-in-law, Arthur Jarvis. 
 You have another sister? 
 Stepsister. 
 Her name is Lucinda. 
 Do they live close by? 
 About a mile away. 
 Arthur came here yesterday and asked our mother for money. 
 She turned 'em both down... 
 Him and Spencer, both. 
 That would be Spencer Harrison. 
 He's Lucinda's godfather, and he pokes his nose into everybody's business. 
 Are they in some kind of financial trouble? 
 Apparently. 
 Spencer...[Sighs] 
 Never liked our mother, thought she married Lucinda's father for his money. 
 Is this Detective Arnold Gubser? 
 Speaking. 
 My name is Juliette Silverton. I'm calling from Portland. 
 Are you the Detective that investigated my name is the 1994e Silverton that involved the deaths of Kelly and Reed Burkhardt? 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles] Whoa. 
 Ma'am, you are going way back in time, uh... 
 I know. 
 Yeah, I was the Detective assigned to that case, but you know, I haven't thought about it in a lot of years. 
 Why would you be asking? 
 I'm just doing a little research for their son. 
 He's actually a aetective, too, with the Portland Oregon P.D. 
 He's just hoping for a little closure. 
 Yeah, as I recall, there wasn't much closure with this case, but, uh, why don't you give me his number? 
 Uh, I'll call him if I find out anything. 
 That would be great. Thank you so much. 
 Um, his name is Nick Burkhardt. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Guess who I just talked to. 
 You got me. 
 Detective Arnold Gubser of the Rhinebeck police department. 
 He's the guy who investigated your parents' car accident. 
 He's still on the force, he's gonna check his files, and he's gonna call you back. 
 How's that for first thing in the morning? 
 That's amazing, wow. 
 I should tell you my nightmares more often. 
 Yeah, well, you're gonna wake me up in the middle of the night, I'm gonna have to do something about it. All right. 
 I'll talk to you later. I love you. 
 I love you, too. Bye. 
 [Doorbell ringing] 
 Detective Burkhardt and Griffin, Portland P.D. 
 We're looking for Arthur Jarvis. 
 I'm Mrs. Jarvis. Won't you come in? 
 Between here and the office, well, the art alone should bring between $4 and $5 million. That ought to cover... 
 It's not enough, it's not enough. 
 We're leveraged way beyond that. 
 [Knocking at the door] 
 Sorry, sorry. 
 I know you're in the middle of something, but there are two police detectives here. 
 They want to talk to you. 
 They didn't say what it was about. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Everything's fine. 
 You want me to stay? 
 No, honey. 
 I'm sure I can handle whatever it is they need. 
 Actually, it would be better if she did stay. 
 Arthur Jarvis? 
 Yes. 
 We'd like to talk with you and your wife in private. 
 Whatever you have to say can be said in front of Spencer. 
 He's a part of our family. 
 Spencer Harrison? 
 Yes. 
 Mrs. Jarvis, we regret to inform you that Mavis Kerfield was murdered last night. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I don't believe it. 
 Her body was discovered this morning. 
 Are you certain she was murdered? 
 It was a homicide, yes. 
 Now, we'd like to ask you all a few questions. 
 You think we might have had something to do with it? 
 We're just beginning the investigation. 
 Now, we understand that you and Mr. Harrison met with the victim yesterday about financial concerns. 
 Financial concerns? 
 What are they talking... 
 That conversation was confidential. 
 We'd like you all to come down to the precinct. 
 This is simply outrageous. 
 Who told you... 
 Sir, please, calm down. 
 I don't understand what's happening. 
 It's fine. It'll be fine. 
 Could you give us a few minutes? 
 We'll wait outside. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Yeah, Burkhardt. 
 This is Detective Gubser from the Rhinebeck police department. 
 Am I speaking with, uh, Nick Burkhardt? 
 Uh, yeah. Juliette said you might be calling. 
 Do you have anything for me? 
 Yeah, a year after the accident, the case was reclassified as a homicide. 
 It was one of the more frustrating cases I ever worked on. 
 Uh, we identified four suspects we believe were responsible for the deaths of Kelly and Reed Burkhardt, who I believe were your parents. 
 Uh, yeah. I'm sorry. You said four suspects? 
 Uh, yeah, uh... 
 Soledad Marquesa, Hans Roth, Ian Flynn, and, uh, Akira Kimura. 
 I'm s... I didn't get that last name. 
 Could you repeat it? 
 Yeah, Akira Kimura. 
 I-I-I pulled up the most recent photos we got on these guys. Three of them are mug shots, one of them is a surveillance photo from Interpol. 
 You want me to send you what we got? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't expect her to just give me the money. 
 I told her I just needed some time to figure things out. 
 I only went to her because there was no other place to go. 
 And what'd you do after the meeting? 
 I went home and I stayed home. 
 You didn't tell your wife? 
 No. I didn't want to worry her. 
 We only got married a year ago. 
 We just moved into that house last July. 
 Everything's been going so well un... until this. 
 What kind of relationship did you have with Mrs. Kerfield and her daughters, Tiffany and Taylor? 
 The relationship was strained. 
 I met Tiffany and Taylor through a mutual friend. 
 It was supposed to be sort of a set-up between us. 
 There was a party at the house, a big black tie fund-raiser. 
 Anyways, I went, and I danced with both Tiffany and Taylor, and then I met Lucinda. 
 After I danced with her... 
 Well, you saw her. 
 I don't know if you believe in love at first sight, but that was it for me. 
 So we've got some sister rivalry going on here? 
 Long before I came on the scene, but I think my marriage to Lucinda was the straw that broke the camel's back. 
 Did you have any kind of sexual relationship with either of the sisters before you met Lucinda? 
 No. 
 Look, it's a typical family situation. 
 Lucinda is beautiful. 
 The other sisters, not so much. 
 It's a girl thing, there's jealousy, and Lucinda's always been the outsider. 
 Her mother died when she was 9 years old and then her father married Mavis when she was 11, and he died 7 months later. 
 I can't believe anyone would do this to her. 
 Tiffany and Taylor must be devastated. 
 Poor Tiffany. 
 What she must be going through after finding her body. 
 You didn't always get along with your sisters or your stepmother, did you? 
 Of course not, but if you think that's unusual, I... 
 We just want to find out what your relationship was like. 
 It was difficult... Sometimes. 
 I mean, my dad died. 
 I was pretty young, it hit me very hard. 
 I guess I closed off from everyone for a little while. 
 I spent a lot of time by myself, blaming my dad for dying and leaving me with... 
 People I didn't know that well. 
 What do you expect? I was just a kid. 
 Do you know if there was a will? 
 I'm sure there was, but, you know, I'm not exactly in the loop. 
 Did you know your father's estate was left to your stepsisters? 
 No. That doesn't surprise me. 
 I was never Mavis' daughter. 
 I was always her stepdaughter. 
 I suppose that made you pretty upset. 
 I guess it should have, but no, I... 
 I consider myself very lucky. 
 I met Arthur, and he's a wonderful man. 
 I fell in love. 
 I'm not unhappy. I would never do anything to jeopardize my life with him. 
 What about Spencer? How long have you known him? 
 Forever. 
 He's my godfather. He was my father's best friend. 
 He's always been there for me. 
 He was the only real family I had after my father died. 
 Lucinda's father and I grew up together. 
 We made and lost a couple of fortunes. 
 He kept his last one, I didn't. 
 He was kind enough to bring me aboard, and I never left. 
 When he got sick, I promised him that I would always look after Lucinda. 
 I made a vow to him. 
 Why didn't he set up a trust for Lucinda? 
 Well, Henry was... 
 Never really a good judge of women. 
 He always trusted them to do the right thing, and they never did. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What time did you and Arthur get back from your meeting with Mavis? 
 We returned home by about 7:00. 
 And what'd you do then? 
 We tried to figure a way out of this Aidikoff mess. 
 And what time did you leave? 
 I didn't. I stayed in the guest room. 
 Arthur and I, we had a lot to discuss. 
 There's no physical evidence to place any of them at the crime scene at the time of the murder. 
 Do we have any explanation for the shattered glass? 
 Techs are still trying to figure that one out. 
 Best explanation they've come up with so far is a giant microwave, or a jet flew through the living room, breaking the sound barrier. 
 All that busted glass, bleeding eardrums, blown-out eyeballs... 
 If I didn't know better, I'd say someone set off a bomb. 
 Right, so there's no rational explanation then? 
 Not yet. 
 Who's winning the lottery on this? 
 That would be the stepsisters. 
 Lucinda was cut out of the will when her father died. 
 Do we know why? 
 Bottom line, step-mom likes her daughters best. 
 And what do we think about the sisters? 
 Still on the list. Checkin' alibis. 
 Well, this family is politically connected. 
 The sisters have enough money to get the best representation, and the D.A. will not prosecute without hard evidence. 
 So when you make a move, make sure it's the right one. 
 
 
 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 Anything important? 
 Uh, could be. 
 Those are the guys that were involved in the jewelry store robbery. 
 Yeah, yeah, I got this from a Detective in Rhinebeck who was investigating the murder of my parents. 
 They were involved? 
 Seems like. 
 Well, that would be weird. 
 At least they're all dead. 
 Except one. 
 There was a fourth man. 
 [Keys clacking] 
 The money doesn't matter, the property... 
 None of that stuff matters. 
 The only thing that's ever mattered is you and me. 
 From the first moment I saw you, I forgot about everything else. 
 I don't know... We'll move. 
 We can leave this place. 
 We'll start over. All I know is I just want us to be together for the rest of our lives, and I know in my heart that you want that, too. 
 You just have to let it go. 
 Do you really think I care about the money? 
 I don't care about any of that. 
 I really don't, but I have to go over there. 
 This is my life, I need closure. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 Don't do this to me. 
 I just love you so much. 
 I love you, too, Arthur, but this is family. 
 They don't like you! 
 They never have! 
 If one of them could kill their own mother, what's going to stop them from killing you? 
 We're not giving them a dime. 
 We should give them something. 
 If we do, where would it stop? 
 You saw what happened to mom. 
 [Chuckles] 
 They did that to get to us, and they think we're gonna cave, but we're not. 
 [Sobs] 
 Taylor, we have to be strong. 
 I'm not like you. 
 Get a hold of yourself, and put the vodka back in the freezer. 
 [Call disconnects] 
 [Sighs] 
 Arthur, what's wrong? 
 I woke up this morning, and she was gone. 
 She's gone? Well, where did she go? 
 I don't know. 
 Did she go see Tiffany? 
 We argued last night. 
 She said she wanted to talk to her. 
 It was something she had to do. 
 Oh, boy. You were supposed to protect her. 
 I've never been able to say no to her. 
 That's the problem, isn't it? 
 When you married her, she was supposed to become your responsibility. 
 You don't protect her by letting her run off alone! 
 [Gasps] 
 Ohh... 
 What are you doing? You scared the hell out of me. 
 I didn't mean to scare you. Is Taylor here? 
 What do you want? 
 I just came to tell you how sorry I am that mom... died. 
 You don't mean that. You never even liked mom. 
 No, she didn't like me. 
 Excuse me, you were the one that was the terror. 
 I was alone in this house. 
 Anything I did was for self-preservation. 
 You never even wanted me as part of your family. 
 Not with the way you acted. 
 Always entitled to everything. The little princess. 
 Oh, my God, here it comes. 
 [Chuckles] Thank you for stopping by, Lucinda. 
 It was very nice. I have to go. 
 Tiffany, please. 
 Spencer and Arthur cannot force us to give you anything. 
 I don't know how they did what they did to mom, but I know they did it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Get out of my way. 
 Tiff, I just want you to listen to one thing. 
 [High-pitched screech] 
 I think I got something. 
 Well, good, 'cause I got nothing. 
 Did he look like this? 
 Yes. 
 Murcielago? 
 Well... 
 At least according to your Spanish for-bearer, Jose Maria Lopez Diego y Grimm, who caught up with one in the upper Amazon. 
 My people know them as Geolter Blitz. 
 Literally, "bat out of hell." 
 It's a legendary, liminal being. 
 And, um, that means what? 
 Well, it's two distinct states of existence simultaneous within one physical body. 
 The duality of humanity, the yin and the Yang, the Ike and Tina Turner of it all. 
 Anyway, ahem, according to these notes, they make a very high-pitched sound that can peel the bark off a dog. 
 At the murder site, there were broken light bulbs and mirrors. 
 Could that Murcielago or Geo-whatever? 
 Well, if I'm reading these illustrations correctly, its sound can shatter eardrums, pop eyeballs, rupture nasal passages, blow out bowels... 
 [Sighs] 
 And generally wreak havoc with whatever is left. 
 How am I gonna face off against one? 
 With one of these, if you've got one. 
 A Murcielago Matraca. 
 Looks like some kind of hand-crank siren. 
 Apparently... 
 Yeah, it wreaks havoc with their ultrasonic sound waves, negating their ability to, you know, blow out your eyes. 
 Have you seen anything like that before? 
 Actually, I think I have. 
 You're kidding me. 
 God, there is some amazing stuff in this trailer. 
 Do you have this place insured? 
 Well, that would mean having to admit that it existed, so... 
 Oh, yeah, there's that. 
 Oh, man! We got to try this out! 
 Look at this craftsmanship. 
 I mean, this is one solid piece of work. 
 There you go. 
 All right, you know, this is the handle. 
 I think you just crank her up, get her up to speed. 
 I think this is the, uh, silencer. 
 You want to do it? 
 Oh, man, so bad. 
 Be my guest. 
 [Sighs] 
 [High-pitched siren increasing in volume and pitch] 
 Ooh. 
 [Siren intensifies] 
 [Items ratting] 
 [Siren diminishes] 
 I don't hear it anymore. 
 I do. It's pretty intense. 
 It's a little uncomfortable, actually. 
 I mean, I think if this thing were pointed in my direction... 
 [Glass shatters] 
 Oops. 
 Looks like you're good to go. 
 [Knocking at the door and doorbell ringing] 
 You here to arrest me? 
 Where's Spencer? 
 I don't know. 
 Look, it would be very easy for me to put out an APB on him, and I don't want to do that yet. 
 You think he killed Lucinda's stepmother? 
 When was the last time you saw him? 
 Uh, this morning, but I don't know where he is now. 
 Okay, where's your wife? 
 I'm right here. 
 What's the problem? 
 We need to find Spencer. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 He thinks Spencer killed your step-mom. 
 No, that's impossible. 
 You're wrong. He couldn't have. 
 Lucinda, you need to stop protecting him. 
 Spencer was furious. I tried to stop him. 
 He's the one that made me go to Mavis in the first place about the money. I didn't want to go. 
 I think he went back to the house to talk to Tiffany, but that's all I know. 
 Yeah, Hank, listen, it's me. 
 I need you and a couple of units to get to 435 Woodbury Drive. 
 Yeah, I think Spencer's on his way there to kill one of the sisters. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Okay, bye. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Lucinda, what have you done? 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Damn it, Tiffany, where are you? 
 [Sobbing] 
 Pick up the phone. 
 Pick up the phone. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 I had nothing to do with this. 
 Turn around. 
 Hands above your head. Turn around! 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Open your mouth and I blow your head off. 
 I know how you kill. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 We got a crime scene here. 
 Block off the area around the BMW. 
 We got a dead vic inside. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, man, not again. 
 Afraid so. 
 Same M.O.? 
 Looks like. 
 You don't understand. 
 Put him in a car. 
 Let's go. 
 No jet plane, no microwave. How did he do this? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Tiffany Kerfield was killed in the same manner as her mother. 
 Anybody want to explain it? 
 [Sighs] We can't. He had no weapon with him. 
 How do we connect him to the murders? 
 We're hoping c.S.U. Can connect him with DNA. 
 I read the report from the first scene. 
 So far, there's nothing definitive to connect anybody to that crime. 
 [Knocking at the door] 
 Sorry to disturb, but, uh, your suspect wants to confess. 
 Thought you might want to know. 
 There's our link. 
 Let's get that confession. 
 I don't see the need to play any games. 
 I know what you are, and I guess you both know what I am. 
 So it's time to state the obvious. 
 I killed both Mavis and Tiffany Kerfield. 
 Why? 
 I've been involved in Lucinda's life since the day she was born. 
 I witnessed firsthand how she was treated by her stepmother and stepsisters. 
 When they turned down her request for help, it was more than I could bear. 
 I understand you were mad. 
 I get that. 
 How'd you kill 'em? 
 Well, as you know, I have the ability to project a sound so powerful, it can shatter glass and burst eardrums. 
 At its most optimum frequency, this ability can cause the arteries in the human body to explode, hence the explanation for the eyeballs. 
 Now, look, shouldn't I be, like, signing something and... And writing this all down? 
 Okay. All right. 
 You think you're gonna get out of this by playing the crazy card. 
 It's not gonna work with me. 
 [Door closing] 
 Very clever. 
 Telling the truth. Now what? 
 I needed to talk to you alone. 
 Now, I did not kill either of them, though I am responsible for their deaths. 
 I failed her father as much as I failed her. 
 Um, I mean, I kept watch on her all those years, and made sure that she never lost control. 
 As long as she got everything she wanted, it worked, but she has no conscience. 
 She's uncontrollable and she made those people's lives miserable. 
 So you're telling me Lucinda did this. 
 I'm saying that Taylor does not have much longer to live, and once she dies, Lucinda inherits everything, and you'll never be able to prove that she had anything to do with it. 
 [Door closes, lock clicks] 
 I need you to meet me there as soon as you can, but first... 
 I need you to go to that trailer and pick up the Matraca. 
 Are you good with that? 
 Yeah, yeah. I got it. 
 All right, great. 
 Thank you. I appreciate that. 
 I don't think Spencer did it. 
 No kidding. He's a nut case. 
 Just heard back from the estate lawyer. 
 Once the mother dies, the $52 million goes to the sisters. 
 Once they're dead, Lucinda inherits everything, will or no will. 
 She'll be going after the last sister. 
 Better check her out. 
 [High-pitched screech] 
 [Screech echoing] 
 What the hell is that? 
 That came from interrogation. 
 [Car alarms blaring] 
 No way. 
 No way. 
 Let's go. 
 What happened? 
 I did what you said. 
 I stood up to her. 
 She went to Taylor's. 
 I swear, I tried to stop her. 
 She said... 
 She said she never loved me. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Taylor Kerfield? 
 Yes, speaking. 
 This is Detective Burkhardt. 
 We have reason to believe your life could be in danger. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Are you at home? 
 Yes. 
 All right, stay there, we're on our way. 
 Lock the doors, do not open them for anyone until we get there. Do you understand? 
 Yes, yes, I'm doing it now. 
 Hi, sis. 
 [Shudders] 
 Get away from me! 
 Are we gonna play chase... Just like when we were kids? 
 [Gasps] 
 You know I always caught you. 
 [Screams] 
 She's in the house! 
 Ah! Ah! 
 [Whimpering] 
 [Screams] 
 Now you're gonna look just like your mother and sister. 
 One big, happy, dead family. 
 [Growling] 
 Ah! 
 Lucinda, stop! 
 Watch out for Spencer! He could be here! 
 Got it. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 I got it! I got the device. Am I too late? 
 Oh, no, I can't be too late. You're still alive. 
 That's a good thing. 
 She's in the garage. 
 No, no, no, dude! You can't go in there, man! 
 If you can't see her, you can't shoot her. 
 You gotta... you know, she'll, like, blow your head up. 
 You got to force her out. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, let's set this up. 
 Here. 
 [High-pitched siren increasing in volume and pitch] 
 [Siren diminishes] 
 [Whines in pain] 
 Aah! 
 Spencer! You have to help me. 
 I know. 
 I should have helped you a long time ago. 
 [Sighs] 
 Stop. 
 [Siren shuts off] 
 Aah! God! 
 [High-pitched screeching] 
 Hey, hey, hey! Wait up! Slow down! 
 [Screeching continues] 
 [Screeching stops] 
 It stopped. 
 Maybe I should set this thing up again. 
 Wait. 
 No, it could be a trap. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I did the best I could. 
 Good-bye. 
 [Roars] 
 [Screams] 
 You did hear what I said about it being a trap, right? 
 Oh, man. 
 So how you gonna explain this one? 
 So this is what she used? 
 Apparently. 
 Yeah, they found it at the crime scene. 
 It makes a really high-pitched sound that shatters glass. 
 Among other things. 
 Huh. 
 Anybody want to show me how it works? 
 Hey, I'm really sorry about all of this. 
 I-I thought I thought I could help bring you some closure, or something, and all I did was open an old wound. 
 No, it's okay. 
 This is something I needed to know. 
 And something I'm gonna have to deal with.
