 Ohh! 
 Nirvana. 
 Why weren't we born rich? 
 'Cause our parents didn't have money. 
 Hmm. 
 Shall we go on our yacht, darling? 
 Which one? 
 [Both giggling] 
 Slow down! 
 Oh, you wish! 
 Gilda? 
 Where do you think... You're going? 
 [Shrieking] 
 [Laughing] 
 Catch me if you can. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, I can. 
 Gilda, come on. 
 [Both laughing] 
 What was that? 
 What? 
 I think I heard a car. 
 No, you didn't. 
 Rocky, stop. Go look out the window. 
 Now? 
 Yeah, go. 
 Somebody's here, you're right. Come on, let's go. 
 No, no, not the door. The window. 
 Come on. 
 [Giggles] 
 You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 Ohh! 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. 
 Hyuh! 
 [Roar] 
 Rocky, what are you doing? 
 [Roaring] 
 [Rocky shouting] 
 [Engine struggles] 
 Come on! 
 Are you still dizzy? 
 I'm all right. 
 Well, your liver enzymes are elevated, with a spider bite. 
 Lucky you didn't get more of it, or it would've paralyzed your lungs. 
 Well, if you feel lightheaded or feverish, come on back. 
 All right. 
 They find anything wrong with you? 
 Just a few toxins in the blood. 
 Just a few toxins? Like the kind that can kill you? 
 Well, apparently not. 
 You gonna be okay? 
 How do I look? 
 Like a cop who's been working all night. 
 Aw, that's funny, Hank. That's how you look. 
 Well, then you look good. 
 Marie. 
 She's not stable. 
 We can't allow anyone in the I.C.U. yet. 
 Well, when can I talk to her? 
 After we're done running the tests. 
 We can't risk letting her slip back into a coma. 
 I'll call you the minute we know something. 
 I.D. anyone who wants access to the room. 
 How is she? 
 Well, she came out of the coma, but they're still running tests. 
 So when did the attack happen? 
 About ten minutes after I got here. 
 She came up behind me. 
 She had a syringe in her hand. 
 How do you know she wasn't a nurse? 
 Well, she stuck a needle into me, and she ran away. 
 Well, you think you can identify her? 
 Yeah, she should be on the security tapes. 
 I grabbed them when I got here. 
 They're on their way to the precinct. 
 Let's take a look at those tapes. 
 If we got another killer on our hands, we better get on this. 
 [Indistinct pa announcement] 
 When's the last time you saw your aunt before this? 
 Not for a couple years. 
 I don't know what she's been up to. 
 That's her. 
 Was she alone? 
 She's the only one I saw. 
 It'll be difficult to make an I.D. from the back. 
 Is this all you got? 
 Yeah. 
 Let me know if you get something we can work with. 
 Dude, what'd your aunt do to piss off so many people? 
 She work for the government or something? 
 I had a D.U.I. out on highway 2 about an hour ago. 
 Driver's got some crazy story about her boyfriend being attacked. 
 Name's Gilda Darner. 
 What do you think? 
 Ah, grown up way too fast. Single parent, if she has any. 
 Takes way too many chances, and looks for excitement in all the wrong places. 
 Sounds like me. 
 Yeah. Look how you turned out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Gilda Darner? 
 This is the house. This is where it happened. 
 Somebody got here before us. 
 Stay in the car. 
 What are you doing here? I haven't even called it in yet. 
 Well, what do you got? 
 Breaking and entering. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Rabe got back from Seattle a couple hours ago, found their house broken into. 
 Somebody raided the fridge, hit the liquor cabinet, tried on some clothes, and test-drove a couple of beds. 
 Any sign of violence? 
 No. No blood. No body parts. 
 Only stains we've come up with are wine and whoopee. 
 Who's her missing boy toy? 
 Says his name's Rocky. 
 We're still trying to figure out how much of her story is true. 
 Well, she's copping to the B and E, so some of it is. 
 Where are the owners? 
 Upstairs. 
 Somebody was sleeping in our bed. 
 Sleep had nothing to do with what they were doing in our bed. 
 You have an alarm system? 
 Well, we've been a little lax in using it lately. 
 We're pretty remote out here. 
 I mean, we've never had a problem before. 
 You should see the living room. 
 Nothing was stolen? 
 Don't know yet. Nothing obvious. 
 You have quite a collection. 
 Is that a Fijian war club? 
 Yes, actually, it is. 
 And a new Guinea tribal fork. This is some valuable stuff. 
 You know your aboriginal art. 
 I've never seen one like that before. 
 It's Germanic. Uh, very rare. 
 From about 900 A.D. 
 We belong to organizations that protect native land from development. 
 There's a lot of rich cultural heritage disappearing, and we're trying to protect what's left both locally and globally... 
 Honey, I think you're getting a little irrelevant. 
 Well, you have to respect your ancestors. 
 Right, detective? 
 I had to respect mine, otherwise, I couldn't sit down for a week. 
 Anyone else have access to the house when you were away? 
 Just our cleaning people. 
 And our son Barry, who's staying with friends. 
 And our neighbors, the Colberts, who check on our house from time to time when we're out of town. 
 Fijian war club? 
 Second wife was an anthropologist. 
 So there were two people in that house. 
 So where's Gilda's boyfriend? 
 My guess, Rocky's home right now, sleeping it off. 
 [Growling] 
 Ohh! Ah. 
 [Hisses] 
 [Screaming] 
 So you do this? 
 Break into homes, party hardy. 
 We were just having fun. 
 Illegal fun. 
 Gilda, you said after you dropped out of the window, you heard Rocky scream, you started running away from the house, and something chased you. 
 Yes. 
 It's my fault. 
 I should've gone back for him, but...I just left him there. 
 I left him there. 
 Please. Please, you've gotta do something. 
 Gilda, do you have any idea who was chasing you? 
 A man? A dog? 
 Some kind of animal? 
 I-I don't know. I don't know. 
 I couldn't really get a good look at it. 
 I was so scared, I just wanted to get out of there. 
 I know that something terrible has happened to him. 
 They went to Rocky's house. Rocky wasn't there. 
 Talked to his dad. Truck driver. 
 Just got back the night before last, hasn't seen Rocky. 
 What about his mother? 
 Died when he was a kid. 
 Did he have a cell phone? 
 Used to. Dad said they had to cut back on expenses, so... 
 Did he have any idea where his son might be? 
 He said if you find his pickup, that's where he'll be. 
 Well, his truck's already been impounded. 
 Gilda was driving it last night. 
 That's all I got. 
 What if their little party got out of hand, Rocky got hurt? 
 Maybe he fell down the stairs. 
 Maybe Gilda pushed him, broke his neck. 
 Gilda got scared, dumped his body in the river or into the woods. 
 Now she's trying to make it look like she's innocent. 
 I don't think she's trying to cover anything up. 
 It seems to me she's pushing us to find him. 
 I think we have to take another look at that house they broke into. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 I need to see you. Now. 
 She's very weak, but I realize you may not have much time. 
 I'll be right outside. 
 I was afraid I lost you. 
 Not yet. 
 You're all I have left. 
 I don't want this to happen. 
 I know. But you'll be all right. 
 Yeah, I don't feel like I'm gonna be all right. 
 I'm still trying to make sense of everything. 
 Look, if you hadn't been here, I would've lost my mind. 
 I'm not sure I haven't. 
 Don't doubt yourself. 
 I've seen so much. 
 And you'll see more. 
 You have a responsibility that you cannot ignore. 
 I couldn't ignore it if I tried. 
 You have to hunt down the bad ones, just like your ancestors did. 
 There's a reason that you're a cop. 
 You have an ability, and you must use it, no matter what happens to me. 
 I'll go get a doctor. 
 No. 
 The reapers followed me here. 
 That means there could be more. 
 How many are there? 
 Nobody knows. 
 They're a secret organization dedicated to killing us. 
 You mean Grimms? There are more like us? 
 Yes, but I don't have contact with them. 
 What about the things I've been seeing? 
 How many more of those are there? 
 There are more in the books than I've ever seen. 
 You must not let the trailer be found. 
 They don't know it exists. 
 I hope I haven't done more harm than good by coming to you. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 [Gasps] 
 Let her rest. 
 You can come back later. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Machine beeping] 
 How is she? 
 Well, she's dying of cancer. 
 She's had two attempts made at her life. 
 Other than that, she's doing all right. 
 She's one tough lady. 
 I had no idea. 
 So you got anything on the Rabes? 
 Yeah. Their house sits on about 200 acres, backs up onto the national forest. 
 500 square miles of trees behind them. 
 Lots of places for Rocky to get lost. 
 [Engine turns] 
 These woods are too big for the two of us. 
 Let's get some people out here. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look out. 
 Hey. Nice riding. 
 Oh, I hope we didn't scare you. 
 Oh, no, you guys are lucky you didn't get thumped. 
 Look, we knew what we were doing. 
 That's a good thing, 'cause I hate cleaning blood off my car. 
 You guys, uh, here for my parents? 
 Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin. 
 You're Barry Rabe. You live here, right? 
 Have you guys ever seen either of 'em? 
 Oh, no, take your time. 
 Make sure you don't know them from school or anything. 
 Look, we've never seen them before. 
 Boys, dinner's ready. Wash up. 
 What are you doing back here? 
 Did you find out who broke into our house? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Frank, you should come out here. 
 Ma'am could you take a look at these? 
 Now, the girl's already in custody, but we haven't seen the guy yet. 
 Have you ever seen either of these guys? 
 No. 
 Yeah, me, either. 
 Hey, Barry, you didn't happen to come home last night, did you? 
 He was staying at Jason and T.B.'s house while we were gone. 
 Sorry, Mrs. Rabe, we have to ask. 
 Just in case he saw the boy leave. 
 No, I didn't get home till this morning, after my parents got back. 
 [Gulps] 
 No, I-I didn't see 'em. 
 How far away do you guys live? 
 What is this? 
 Look, we're just trying to figure out where everybody was last night. 
 We know they broke into your house, but no one's seen the boy since last night. 
 The girl said she heard a scream inside the house after she left. 
 And you believe someone who broke into our house, drank our wine, ate our food, and took advantage of our bedroom? 
 I think you'd be better off looking under a few rocks. 
 Wish you'd remember that we're the victims here. 
 Boys, let's go in the house. 
 If you want to talk to me, you can call me tomorrow at my law firm. 
 Man, we really hit a nerve. 
 Let's run some phone records, pin down where everyone was last night. 
 She came out of the coma, and I've had to put guards on her. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 We can't allow her to tell him anything more. 
 We need him with us. 
 And how do I get to her? 
 Well, you don't. But you get somebody who can. 
 With guards on her? 
 Don't worry about that. Just find the right people... 
 And I do mean people. 
 We can't afford someone getting excited and blowing the whole thing. 
 Don't you know this is a bad neighborhood? 
 How much is it worth for you not to get hurt? 
 Don't worry. I'll take care of this. 
 [Snarling] 
 [Man screaming] 
 
 
 
 Nick? 
 Yeah, in here. 
 I picked up Chinese from Lotus, and... 
 Got Voodoo doughnuts. 
 Ah, you are the best. 
 Don't be such a cop. 
 The doughnuts are for dessert. 
 Are we buying a totem pole? 
 No, I saw one outside a house of a case I'm working on. 
 Some kind of clan of the bear. 
 "The bear is a messenger to the supernatural world. 
 "His position of dominance in the totemic hierarchy "is the result of a common ancestral belief in the sanctity of their territory." 
 Hmm. 
 Is the totem pole some kind of clue? 
 I don't know, but you make it sound kind of sexy. 
 It's just the word pole. 
 Mm. 
 I stopped by to see Marie today. 
 It scared me, seeing all the police in the hospital. 
 I don't know why anybody would want to hurt her. 
 She can't even die in peace. 
 How are you doing with all that? 
 Well, I'm not doing too good about it, but... 
 You know, there's nothing I can do, so I'm putting on my happy face. 
 I'm not buying that grin. Put it back. 
 Okay. Do it. 
 Uhh! 
 [Thud] 
 That'll work. 
 [Door opens] 
 Aunt Marie. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Remember what I told you. 
 Okay. 
 There'll be more red... 
 When the sun goes down. 
 Uhh! 
 [Gasps] 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, just, uh... A bad dream. I hope. 
 What was it? 
 My aunt just stabbed me in the hand. 
 What did you do to her? 
 Nope, just a dream. But I don't even know where to begin interpreting that one. 
 I was trying to let you sleep. Lot of good that did. 
 Hey, hey. Where you going so early? 
 I'm operating on a bulldog at 7:00. 
 I'll call you later. 
 You have to hunt down the bad ones. 
 [Growls] 
 [Knocking on door] 
 [Knocking again] 
 [Sighs] 
 We need to talk. 
 Not at 6:30 in the morning, we don't. 
 This is important. 
 Oh, well, come on in, then. Have a cup of coffee. 
 Bagel? Cream cheese? 
 First, I want to thank you for helping me out with the kidnapping. 
 A gift basket would've been nice. 
 How long is this gonna take? 
 I'm right in the middle of my Pilates, man. 
 You ever seen one of these? 
 Not up close, thank God. 
 [Sniffs] 
 I think Jagerbars use these for disemboweling. 
 Now I'm hungry. 
 Sure you don't want a bagel? 
 I'm gonna French press some coffee, too. 
 Guatemalan highlands. Craft roasted. 
 Very robust. 
 What do you know about Jagerbars? 
 What am I, your personal Grimmopedia? 
 No, you're a Blutbad, and I'm assuming that Blutbaden know about Jagerbaden? 
 It's just Jagerbars. 
 Well, you see them like I see them, right? 
 Yes. 
 Hey, I'm just trying to figure out what I'm up against here. 
 Okay. 
 Right there... Don't even compare the two. 
 We don't rummage like they do. 
 How'd you run across a Jagerbar anyway? 
 Look, I'm working on a case. 
 I saw a kid turn into one. 
 That where you got the claw? 
 No, my aunt had it. 
 Oh, right. Her again. Aunt Marie, right? 
 Yeah. I couldn't sleep the last two nights thinking ol' aunt Marie was gonna cut off my head, stick it on a lamp post. 
 That's how my great grandma ended up, you know. 
 Hey, she's still in the hospital. 
 Oh. Sorry. Um... 
 They use those claws in the Roh-Hatz. 
 Roh-Hatz? 
 It's like a Bar Mitzvah for bears. 
 You know, a Jagerbar Mitzvah. It's a very physical thing. 
 A lot of pounding of chests, and, like, wailing. 
 Who wails anymore? 
 Supposed to connect with the primitive beast in all of us. 
 And believe me, I do mean all of us. 
 So what do they do? 
 It's all about the chase. 
 What chase? 
 The Roh-Hatz, you know? Caveman mumbo-jumbo. 
 "Let's get some beers and barbeque and be stupid." 
 I mean, I like to camp as much as the next guy. 
 You know, maybe once a year. 
 Want plain or onion? 
 I gotta go. 
 Oh. Well. Thanks for stopping by. 
 What are you drawing? 
 Jagerbar. 
 You saw one? 
 Well, there was a family, but the boy's the only one I saw. 
 How old? 
 18. 
 That could be a problem if they're traditional. 
 Anyone die? 
 I don't know. I've got a missing person. 
 Do you know what the Roh-Hatz is? 
 You're learning. That's good. 
 It's a rite of passage from boy to man. 
 They do it at sunset. 
 It isn't pretty. 
 The red of the sun and the blood on their hands. 
 Just got the phone records. 
 Several calls were made between 9:00 and midnight. 
 We triangulated a call made from Barry Rabe's cell phone that puts him at his house at 11:30 that night. 
 When Gilda was there with Rocky. 
 Yeah, so Barry's lying, and lawyer dad is running interference. 
 Oh, a lawyer doing a bad thing? 
 Never heard of that before. 
 Hey, Nick. 
 Can I talk to you a minute? 
 Yes, sir? 
 Listen, I had to pull the guys guarding your aunt at the hospital. 
 What? 
 With no hard evidence of a second attack, I couldn't justify the expense to the chief without it looking like we're giving preferential treatment to police families. 
 I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 [Multiple clocks ticking] 
 [Ringing] 
 Monroe. 
 Now what? 
 A Grimm? Are you out of your mind? 
 I can't do this. 
 Look, I just need your help until I can figure something else out. 
 I'm not a cop. 
 Yeah, you...You're the only one who knows what I'm... 
 No. I am the only one who is stupid enough to talk to you. 
 I'll owe you one. 
 Dude, you already owe me three. 
 Three? 
 Yeah. The little girl who was kidnapped, the Jagerbar at 6:30 this morning in the middle of my Pilates, and now this. 
 Okay. I'll owe you three. 
 What the hell makes you think I am gonna stay here and protect her? 
 Because I trust you. 
 Look, I'll be back as soon as I can. 
 Maybe you shouldn't trust me. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Rocky's dad just called. Gilda made bail. 
 She went over to his house and got a gun Rocky had in his room. 
 He couldn't stop her. 
 Said she was gonna get Rocky back or kill the people that took him. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Where is he? 
 Where is he? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Are you the girl that broke into my house? 
 You tell me where he is, or I'll shoot. 
 Please don't hurt me. 
 I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You know where he...Aah! 
 Uhh! 
 [Snarling] 
 Are you okay, mom? 
 I am now. And well done, son. 
 Hunting two is better than one. 
 You make your ancestors proud. 
 Ohh! 
 Get rid of her truck. 
 Hi. 
 Barry home? 
 No, he's out with friends. 
 Doing what? 
 I don't know. Riding their bikes? 
 God, I hope he doesn't break his neck. 
 What do you want? 
 The woman who broke into your house is on her way here... And she's not happy. 
 She's got a gun. 
 What? Is everything okay? 
 Everything's fine. 
 I don't really think so. 
 It doesn't look like she's here yet. 
 I'm going back down the road. 
 I'll block it off in case she shows. 
 We need to talk. Right now. 
 I know what you are. You know who I am. 
 So let's cut the crap. 
 You wanna cut the crap? 
 Okay. You're a Grimm. 
 You're a danger to my family. 
 And don't think wearing a badge is going to protect you. 
 This isn't about me. 
 I know about the hunt. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The roh-hatz. 
 Nobody does that anymore. 
 Yes, they do. 
 And when the sun goes down tonight, it's gonna be too late. 
 Look, Barry and those two boys have got Rocky, and we don't have a lot of time. 
 Come on, you're a lawyer. 
 If they kill this innocent kid over this stupid hunt, their lives are over. 
 Where are they? 
 I told you. 
 Where are they? 
 Why don't you ask to see his warrant? 
 Oh, my God. I didn't realize. 
 So what do you want to do? You want to go inside, have a few drinks, forget about it? 
 Or do you want to come with me? 
 Okay. But we're gonna have to take my four-Wheeler. 
 You know where they are? 
 I think I know where they might be. 
 Requesting back-up at 1534 Wilder road. 
 If we find them, promise me you're not gonna hurt them. 
 I won't if I don't have to. 
 Okay. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 It's Nick. You got anything? 
 I found the truck. She's here somewhere. 
 I'm with Frank Rabe. I'm going after the boys. 
 I'll call you if I get anything. 
 [Crying] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Sobbing] We're sorry we broke into your house. 
 We'll never do it again. 
 Uhh! Just let her go! 
 Yeah, we'll let her go. 
 We're gonna let you go, too. 
 Don't worry. We'll give you a head start. 
 [Gilda crying] 
 No, please, no. 
 Oh, wow, man. They're really scared. 
 Please! 
 It's ridiculous. 
 You people murdered my grandfather. 
 The Grimms burned down his farm, cut off his head, his hands, and his feet. 
 Okay, he may have deserved it for some of the things he did. 
 But if my parents could see me now, standing this close to you and not avenging the family, last Thanksgiving I'd be invited to, I can tell you that. 
 Take your best shot, Blutbad. 
 We're gonna have to take the trail from here. 
 How do you know they'll be there? 
 I don't. 
 Uhh! 
 Guh! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Growling] 
 Uhh! Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 [Growling] 
 Okay, that went a little too far. 
 There's a cave up ahead. 
 Let me go first, try and talk them out. 
 No. 
 I'm either coming with you, or I'm going alone. 
 We're too late. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Growls] 
 [Deep voice] 
 It's started. 
 [Growls] 
 [Growling, snarling] 
 Come on, get up! 
 [Growling] 
 Get out! 
 Aah! Uhh! 
 [Grunting and growling] 
 [Gunshot] 
 This isn't gonna get any better unless you stop. 
 No! Barry! Son! This is over. 
 Stay down. 
 It stops now. 
 No! 
 Mom! Don't! 
 [Roars] 
 [Squealing] 
 [Indistinct police radio chatter] 
 Mom. 
 Mom...Please. 
 I am so sorry. 
 You did nothing wrong. 
 Yeah, he did, Diane. 
 And now we're all gonna have to pay for it. 
 You have to respect your ancestors. 
 Not like this. 
 Okay, let's see, we got kidnapping and attempted murder for Barry, Jason, and t.B. 
 Breaking and entering for Rocky and Gilda. 
 Well, at least they weren't doing drugs. 
 Detective. 
 She wanted them to know their heritage. 
 She never understood the danger of it. 
 It isn't easy to give up your history. 
 You haven't had to give up yours. 
 Yeah. It's been a lot of fun. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 You told me to protect her. And I did, but... 
 Get me four units of o-positive. 
 I think I may have gone a little overboard. 
 [On pa] Trauma surgeon to O.R. one, stat. 
 Trauma surgeon to O.R. one, stat. 
 Look, I can't stick around. 
 Things are getting a little dicey. 
 And you should get down here. I'm not sure I got all of 'em. 
 [Heart monitor beeping] 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 Oh! 
 Get security up here! 
 [Overlapping shouts] 
 Uhh! 
 Remember who you are. 
 Trust your instincts and nothing else. 
 No. 
 Marie. 
 Come on. 
 Rest well. 
 Are you all right? 
 [Sniffles] 
 No. 
 But I will be. 
 [Growling]
