 Previously on  Beyond. 
 Your son was unconscious for 12 years. 
 Tom : You're in the hospital, son. You're safe. 
 I know who you are. I know what you can do. 
 I'm not who you think I am! 
 Can you confirm where you were last night? 
 Is this about Kevin? 
 What happened outside the bar? 
 Shoemacher :  Discretion is how this organization continues to operate. 
 Frost wanted to see what the kid can do and now we know. 
 Who is that? He looks familiar. 
 Luke : That's Kevin's brother... the psycho that put you in a coma. 
 Hi, I'm Jamie. 
 Holden! 
 They're coming for you, Holden. 
 Holden! Holden! 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. 
 What? 
 Holden :  The other night you said we lived a life together. 
 Where? 
 Look, it's not an easy explanation. 
 Okay, well... 
 I've come all this way. 
 Humor me. 
 While you were in your coma, your mind traveled. 
 "Traveled"? 
 You left your physical body here in Fort Reed and your mind traveled to another world. 
 And you're telling me I did all this while I was unconscious? 
 I don't expect you to understand. 
 No, I... I understand. I just... don't believe you. 
 Well, you're here now, so there must be some part of you that wants to... 
 I want it to stop. 
 All of it. 
 Before someone else gets hurt. 
 (phone trilling) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hey, Kevin. Where have you been? 
 I can't explain right now, baby. 
 I think I'm being followed. 
 What? 
 What? Where are you? Why would anybody be following you? 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 Look, I can't explain right now, okay babe? 
 I just need you to pack a bag, okay? 
 Just pack a bag. 
 No, Kevin. I'm not going anywhere  until you tell me what's going on. 
 (crash) 
 (groans) 
 Kevin? 
 Kevin? (crash) What you're experiencing are physical manifestations of your mind simply trying to remember those 12 years. Nothing about that was simple. More English. You've heard of PTSD. Soldiers returning home feeling the effects of recent trauma. Like in your case, it's brought on by stress. How many soldiers can burn houses to the ground with their minds? Your emotional responses are a bit more... dramatic. Yeah. Your mind wants you to remember. Your memories are trying to force their way out. But you're stubborn. I'm stubborn? You called me 37 times over the past 48 hours. Yeah. Now you know why. The key to controlling these outbursts is freeing your memory. At least, that's my best guess. Your... We can inject you with a carefully synthesized Propranol and an Anisomycin chaser. That's funny, it sounded like you said inject me. Which will dull the fear response in your brain and amplify your long-term memory. It's perfectly safe. No, no way are you sticking me with that. I... I don't even know you. But you do know me. And until you remember that, you're still a danger to yourself. (breathing heavily) (grunts) (tires screeching) sh1t! (groans) That's not your call. You came to me for help. Because I'm out of my mind. Because you knew I could help you. You just don't understand how and that's what scares you. Look, I just need time. I need to think. Not too long. These outbursts, they could get worse. What are my options? Your only option is to trust me. I... Even though you have no reason to. Please, just... don't give me a reason not to. (doorknob clicking) Hey, um... Those 12 years, were they... good? What you and I had... was good. (door closes) Man, is it good to be back here. I definitely remember this place. I mean, come on. Look at this. Same table. Brings back some great memories, doesn't it? This was Friday nights for us. All-you-can-eat pasta, garlic bread... Yeah. Then after, we'd, uh, school Dad over at the batting cages. Right. Yeah, I think your memory of the batting cage is grossly inaccurate, son. Your selective memory is one again second to none. (Diane chuckles) Slow down there, buddy. See something you like, Holden? What? No, I... For dinner. What looks good to you? Right. Uh... well, it has been 12 years since my last bacon ravioli. Dude, that thing was a health code violation with Parmesan. They used to pile on those meatballs. You remember? Yeah. Oh! Hey, Dad, tell him about, um... the meatball grinder at Sanderson's. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, Luke was driving one of those Drivers Ed cars Diane, Diane... and the instructor was in the front with him and your dad was in the back, you know, as a witness. It wasn't just a lesson. Okay, I was going for my license... Okay, it was like this metamorphosis happened within me. Oh, yeah. Tom : It was the meatballs. It was just hanging there like 90 degree weather. Like, it's thick. Did he pass you? Oh, to get some fresh air back at the DMV. Hell yeah. There's a test you can take, too. High school equivalency test. Okay. He hasn't even passed the seventh grade yet, Diane. Which is why he needs to get back to it. It's fine. It's a good idea. Who's he in a race with? Nobody. It'll be good for him. I just with you would have discussed this with me first. You know, I might have an opinion as to what's good for him, too. Hey, it's okay. Can we order or... Why do you question every single decision? Because maybe nobody else ever gets to make one. Listen, he's gonna get his diploma, all right? It's just not gonna happen before sundown. Okay, you sit back and watch while things get done by somebody else. This isn't gonna "get done." This isn't like a task like... like picking up the dry cleaning, all right? This is gonna take some time. He's gonna need time... You don't think that I don't know this? Would you both just shut up? The hell did you just say? Excuse me? Luke : I'm... I'm done. I'm... I'm done lying. Lying? About what? So are you gonna tell him why you sleep on the couch, Dad? (sighs) Holden, your mom and I, we've been separated. For over a year. That doesn't make any sense. I... I mean, we've all been home together. I... I... I know, son, but... I actually have my own place now. Diane : We thought it would be best for you to come home to a stable family environment when you woke up. To make you feel comfortable. How long were you all gonna pretend? Great. Um... so great job making me feel comfortable. I feel right at home. Both : Holden. Holden, come on. No, I hope this doctor-prescribed reunion wasn't too hard for you all. Holden. Holden, wait. The hell were you thinking? (train horn) No. (gasps) Come on! Don't do this to me. Not tonight. (rattling) (electricity humming) (yelling) (clicking, whirring) You're losing control. Fight it. (pitching machine throws balls) (siren chirps) You should get out of those clothes. I mean, you're all wet, so... I'll get a towel. Thanks. Hey, um... who's that guy I keep seeing in all the visions? Your mind is trying to make sense of a lot of things. Huh. The man's getting a habit of scaring the crap out of me. Thanks. (sighs) I thought having dinner with my family was bad. You, uh... your parents still together? No. I... I didn't mean, um... It's none of my business. So to control your outbursts, we need to get you to remember. You ready? I'm ready to try. Narrator on TV :  It seems like Michael had finally found true love, but nothing could have prepared him for true heartbreak. Girl : See? Hear that? He's been hurt by past relationships. You're right. It sounds like he's done with that now. No more heartbreak. Well, he's a software salesman. He gets paid to sell stuff. There you go again. The sales will pick up soon, honey. I promise. (television plays) We got enough for another glass? Depends how badly you want it. (groaning) You could probably use this more than me, huh? (muffled screaming) Willa : This bowl represents the here and now. The world we currently live in. That sponge in there is you. Holden Matthews living in the here and now. Did you... rehearse this? Of course I did. When you went into your coma, the traditional laws of physics say that the space, time, energy, and mass of Holden Matthews remained in that bowl for 12 years. But you're telling me I... I left that bowl. The water in this sponge represents all the experience you absorbed from the real world. Your consciousness, pain, pleasure. Love. Things that the traditional laws of physics don't account for. Now your brain, it transferred all that stored experience over to here. This is that other plane of existence. Where we met. I call it the Realm. "The Realm." The term came out of an old medical journal. Because "Narnia" was taken? The water I rung from your sponge swirled in this muddy pool for 12 years. Until you woke up. And your body reclaimed it. This is you now. Since you awoke. Gee, thanks. What we need to do is isolate your memories of the Realm... and once your mind can make sense of everything you've experienced... I can finally get a good night's sleep. Lie on your back. For luck. 
 
 What is it? Nothing. I'm just... not that crazy about needles. Would it help if I count to three? Actually, yeah. Yeah. I'm giving you an integrated stress response inhibitor. It's been known to boost memory functions in mice. But it's been tested on humans, too, right? Right. Just, uh... just lay back and relax. And you're gonna count to three? Yes. I'll count to three. Think about the last thing you remember before your coma. Just concentrate on that. The woods. Good. Here we go. One, two... three. Follow the light, Holden. Follow the light. (gasps) (rustling) (gasps) (yells) (screaming) (gasping) That was the Realm? How is that possible? Try to breathe, Holden. It's okay. Drink. It'll help. Oh, man. It was like being thrown into a blender. I... I saw trees and this light, really bright, and then... and then it'd go away. You're remembering. That's good. That's very good. If these are memories, then why am I not younger like... like a 12-year-old? Your mind only reflects the current you. The current me feels like I dove headfirst into an empty swimming pool. In rare cases, a decreased level of consciousness can cause hypothermia. The bath helps dilate your blood vessels. Here I just thought you wanted to get my shirt off. Joking. We'll need a few additions for next time. Even sedated, your body control was... erratic. Seriously? We just didn't know the right way to go about telling him. It's okay, Diane. You knew the split was gonna hit hard. I mean, you know, there isn't a how-to guide for what you and your family have been through. (door unlocking) He's home. Thank God. Oh, it's you. Warm welcome. Thank you. Late night for you, Pastor. Diane : I couldn't sleep. Ian agreed to wait up for Holden with me. It's nothing. I offer my support to the community in any way I can. Oh. That's a kind gesture. Doesn't go unnoticed. But you'd be wise to remember that Holden is my son. And we're perfectly capable of worrying about him without your holy blessing. Of course, Tom. (footsteps) Hm. Looks like I was the good luck charm that brought him home. (sighs) What did you do to Holden? You're referring to the demonstration he gave us in the parking lot that night. Pretty impressive stuff, right? First I didn't believe in my employer's cause. Another plane of existence, it sounded like a fairytale I'd read to my daughter at bedtime. But then I forced your friend's hand. And wow. Holden has a gift and he doesn't even know it. He will. Why me? The misinterpretation of a command resulted in you being a witness to something you should not have seen. I'm saddled with cleaning it up. Sorry. I'm not gonna talk. I swear. In that case, I'll be candid. I hate killing. Turns my stomach. Please. My wife. She's going to give birth to our first child. I... I just need to see them. Only when taken away does one really know what he has. So... you gonna behave? Uh-huh. All right. Let's take you home. (chiming) Hey, Holden. Jamie! Hey! What's up? Sorry about, uh, breaking it off the other night. Oh, no. There were flames. Wasn't your fault. (chuckles) Yeah. So what kind of a deck do you got? Uh, I'm looking for one of the... a helmet. (both chuckle) These ones too. Hey, what's your cell? Um, the phone I have right now isn't... Well, look. It's just one of those temporary ones, so... Oh, no, here. Let me. "You have work to do." Who's Willa? My sister. Oh, I... I didn't know you and Luke had a sister. She... likes to be kept out of the press. She's shy, so. She sounds smart. (typing) There. Now in case this place spontaneously goes up in flames... (both chuckle) ...you got my number. Call me sometime. I will. Oh, and, um... whatever high-flying act you've got planned, the ones that actually protect your skull are just over there. Right. Good tip. Thanks. Yup. See ya. Yeah. (beeping) He's been asking for you. Thank you, Daniel. (door closes) I'm here. He's starting to remember. But it's slow. Just fragmented memories. It'll be some time before he can make sense of them. Before he has control. (phone chimes) I'm trying. So is he. But I can only go as fast as he'll let me. (phone chimes) Nothing will distract me from bringing you home. How many months is she? Seven. Taking you home to see your family... seemed like the right thing to do. Thank you. (rattling) No. (rattling continues) No. (click) You know, it's about time, I guess. No use in pretending anymore. Gonna leave some tools here in case your mom needs help around the house. Dad, thought I'd let you know I'm... I'm heading back. I got an Econ midterm and... What happened to taking the semester off? School knows what you're dealing with. Yeah. At a certain point, I need to string together some life moments that don't involve the coma. I know. That's exactly what Holden's around here doing. You can help more than anyone, Luke. "More than anyone"? Until a few days ago, I was just the kid who visited the hospital, you know, every week with you and Mom. Hand me the impact wrench, will you? No, no, not that. Not that. Come on. How do you not know what an impact wrench is? Holden would know. He was always pretty good with this stuff. Yeah, he never missed chance to get his hands greasy, that's for sure. Look, Luke. You know, doing projects and things, that just... that was never your thing. That's okay. Yeah, maybe because instead of inviting me in there like him... you just went in there to hide. I wasn't trying to hide. I was trying to keep this family together. I was trying to keep a roof over our heads is what I was trying to do. You were trying to disappear! Like... like this was somehow my fault. Luke. Luke! All I ever heard about was how destroyed you and Mom were about Holden. It's always about Holden! But you had me. I was still here. And I'm here now and Holden's here! Luke, we can try it again! Hey! Luke! (knock on door) It's open. Hey. Um, got most everything on your wish list. Do you reimburse? (chimes) I feel like a tool. You worried about style points? Why are you so intent on helping me? Because I care about what happens to you. Oh, I... Brought good luck the first time, right? Thanks. (chirping) Think back. What can you recall from your last visit? The woods. And a light. Focus on that light. In one, two... Come on, Holden. I'm in there. Just have to find me. Just have to remember. (breathing heavily) My God. (gasps) (cawing) (screams) (screams) Holden! Holden! (screams) Wake up, Holden! Come back! Come back! I'm sorry. Holden, wake up! Wake up! (screams) Holden, wake up! (screams) (gasping) It's okay, it's okay! It's okay. You're okay. There's this castle or something. It's okay. You're okay. I never want to feel like that again. I never want to feel like that again. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Could eat for days. It's a side effect. I was attacked in there, Willa. It's because you didn't belong. I mean, I was in there for years. You spent years on the run. It's a beautiful world. Filled with more wonder and magic than you'll see in your lifetime. But it's also extremely dangerous. You were in there with me... and we were on the run together? Did you go in voluntarily? Why? You spent 12 years in that place. Nearly half your life. But that place is my life. What about your family? My mom died during childbirth. And after I was born, my dad just took off. I never knew either of them. My grandfather looked after me. Raised me. Read me bedtime stories by Hawking, Darwin, Sagan. After all I missed, I will always be grateful for the life he gave me. Made me feel like I was a part of something. To be working alongside him was important. Sounds like a great man. Even after everything he's done for me, I... I still wonder sometimes what it must be like... to have a mom and a dad. To know them. Love them. It's... it's harder than you think. But it's worth it. I can't do this on my own. You're gonna have to eat something. I mean, a piece of pizza, burger, I... We're gonna need a two-front attack. What do you think? Come on, seriously. You're gonna have to help me out. This is a lot of food. Thank you. Might stay for a little bit, if that's okay. I'll see ya, big brother. Take care of things around here like you're supposed to, huh? Guess I'll have to get into trouble on my own. Don't study too hard. Yeah, you're the poor schmuck taking the high school equivalency. Drive safely. I will. Okay. It was so good having you two under one roof. Just felt whole. Dad mentioned the other night the Pastor? Of course he did. You know how he feels about church. At the house late the other night, Mom. Seems pretty... dedicated. I was up waiting for you and I was upset about how we parted ways. Pastor Ian's been counseling us since the accident and last night, he offered to keep me company. He was worried about you, Holden. Good. I'm glad he was there for you, Mom. Thank you. Students, you may begin your exam now. (whirring) (screams) (breathing heavily) (screams) We need to talk. What do you mean? About what? Where's my brother? I don't know. Whoa. No, no, no, please! I don't... (screams) (end music playing)
