 Narrator :  Previously on  Beyond... 
 Don't you ever feel like we're a part of something bigger? 
 Oh, no. 
 Holden : The cops? 
 Kevin : Worse. My brother Jeff. 
 Assface. 
 You're dead. 
 (engine revving) 
 Ah! 
 (gasps) 
 Woman :  Your son was unconscious for 12 years. 
 You're in a hospital, son. But you're okay. You're safe. 
 You're in a lot of trouble. 
 Holden : What are you talking about? 
 Kevin :  They're going to be coming for you. 
 I know who you are. 
 I know what you can do. 
 (brakes squeal) 
 Holden, get in the car! 
 Who are you? 
 It's me, Willa. 
 I can't take you home. That's the first place they'll look for you. 
 I don't want any of this! 
 Willa :  Those past 12 years, I watched you learn to do the things you can do. 
 Arthur :  No more holding back. 
 Willa :  This is just a scratch on the surface. 
 Beneath that surface is something dangerous if you don't learn to control it. (thunder rumbling) Willa : You don't have any more time. You have to go now. Feels like I just got here. They know who you are. They know what you're going to do. (thunder crashing) Here. (beeps) For luck. (footsteps booming) I'll see you where the light shines the brightest. (dripping) Run! (echoes) (gunshot) (gasping) Diane : That must be him now. Holden? Honey? Holden. I'm Sheriff Dayton. This is Deputy Lee. You mind if we ask you some questions? You're the police? Why don't you get dressed and... we'll talk. (theme music playing) Is that necessary? You wouldn't ask if you could see my handwriting. Am I in trouble? No, of course not. Fifth Amendment, dude. Don't have to answer anything you don't want to. I'll be quiet. You don't have to answer. But we're just hoping you can help us fill in some blanks. Okay. Okay. Now can you confirm where you were last night? Um... We were at a bar. I don't really remember the name. You were at a bar? You said "we." That's you and...? Kevin. I don't know how much time we have or what they plan to do. They? Is... is this about Kevin? Is he okay? We haven't been able to reach him for questioning. Holden :  What does that mean? Where is he? What... what the hell is this all about? Holden, what happened outside the bar? In the parking lot? The bartender. He saw you exit the bar, followed by Kevin. (grunting) Kev... (grunts) He then heard several gunshots. (Gunshots) We have over a dozen shell casings at the scene. Okay, stop the tape. Tom, just let them do their job. Their job is to protect Holden, not level accusations, Diane. There was gunfire. Dayton : No one is accusing your son of anything. I'm not who you think I am! They grabbed him. Who did? They started hitting him. Diane :  Why didn't you say anything? Dayton : Did you see their faces? I know who you are. No, it... it was too dark. Do you remember anything physical? Height, hair color? Clothing? More importantly, I know what you can do. No, I... it was too dark. What happened next? How did you get away? (tires squeal) Dayton : Holden, how did you get away? Holden, get in the car! (gunshots) All right, we're done here. That's enough. We're done. Okay, well, thanks again for your time. If we have any follow-ups... Phone call will be sufficient, Sheriff. Okay. Thank you. Have a good day. Don't worry. "Don't worry"? Were you even listening in there? (Tom whispering) He's safe, all right? Diane : Whether he is safe, he doesn't feel safe. Tom : Diane, let it go. (indistinct chatter) Did all that really happen outside the... the bar? What, you think I made it up? Maybe. Truth is I don't know you well enough to know if that's something you'd make up. But for what it's worth, you know, I'd avoid any lie that causes Dad to go into cardiac arrest. And I know technically I'm still your kid brother, but, you know, technically I've been doing this longer than you have. This? Yeah, you know... life, existing out in the world. So if you ever need anything... Yeah. I need a ride. (Polish accent) I don't usually rent month-to-month. One year minimum. I can pay cash. You're not from here. (speaking Polish) No. So what brings you here? A boy. So why did you want to come back here again? Maybe if I knew what we were looking for, I could, like, you know, help speed up the process. I missed 12 years. You can't give me 10 minutes? Look, don't get me wrong, man. Bar parking lot at noon on a Saturday is not without its thrills. (sighs) You gotta be kidding. Seriously, there's a trash can, like, six feet away, but God forbid you have to behave like a functioning member of society. Whoa, whoa, come on, man. Get off my truck. Holden? What, you see something? Nothing. Let's go home. You okay? I'm fine. Rough night. Is that real? You bet. You a cop? Sure. Then where's your badge? I'm undercover. Would you like to hold it? Here. Jake, honey, come here. Honey? So you do this every Sunday? For the past few years, yeah. Man, Mom took to church like a duck to holy water. And Dad? Dad believes in two things... air conditioning and sleeping in on the weekends. He sees church as an affront to his "core convictions." Wait, so Dad's not coming? I'm sure if you asked him... (sighs) This is... I have no idea what I'm doing. I can't... Here, here. I got it. Pop a squat. Thanks. Come on. Hey, you know, it's not so terrible... church. You know, it makes Mom happy. And I kind of think she likes being around others who don't have a clue what it all means... but, you know, aren't afraid to ask. There you go. Hey. That's pretty good. Boom. Yeah. So what's in it for you? You know, going to church? (chuckles) I go for the scenery. (door opens) (organ music playing) (murmuring) (all giggling) I like the scenery too. Hey. Who is that? He looks familiar. Yeah, he should. That's Kevin's brother. The psycho that put you in a coma? Jeff. The subject of rebirth, of resurrection, appears again and again throughout the Bible. But what is it about the restoration of life that makes it such a prominent and poignant theme? We are tremendously thrilled and grateful to have with us today someone who's experienced a rebirth of sorts... a miracle. Holden Matthews. Holden has been granted his second chance, along with his mother, Diane, his brother, Luke. Their patience, their ardent belief in our Lord has not gone unrecognized. (phone vibrating) But the question remains... (vibrating continues) Ahem. But the question remains, even with the gift of a second chance... (whispers) When the hell did you buy a phone? Just... just turn it off. (vibrating stops) Pastor : The answer to that is found within your heart. (whispers) Sorry. Pastor : No matter where you come from, where you are or where you're going... Luke : Sorry. ...if the Lord lives within you... (breathing deeply) Remember, Holden. You have to remember. Demonic voice :  You have to remember. Leave me alone! (people murmuring) It's okay, Holden. Come back and sit down. Come on. You okay? It's gonna be okay. (phone vibrating) (knocks on door) Tom : Hey. Hey. You're home early. Yeah. I... I don't know if church is really my thing. (chuckles) I don't know if anyone's gonna blame you. Well, except, you know... (chuckles) Right. You got a second? There's something I want to show you. (chuckling) What? No. Oh! Does it work? Well, not yet. Couple of replacement parts, some man hours. If anybody can fix it, it's you, Holden. You saved all this? Of course I did. I cannot count the many times I had to pull you away from that thing just to get you to eat. That bike... hell, this whole garage... this was your church. You're a lot like me, son. We're nuts-and-bolts kind of guys. We see something that needs to be fixed, we fix it. Right? We don't sit around and pray that it's going to fix itself. That's... that's crazy. Hey, Dad? You and Mom... you guys are okay, right? (sighs) We're through the worst of it. That's all the matters, right? Yeah. All right, well, come on. Give me a hand. (beeps) (beeps) Come on. You have ID? Where's your car? Missus forgot to get it serviced. It's not the first time. (typing) (beeping) Mind if we move this along? I've got an appointment. (beeps) With Frost. Of course. We'll have a car escort you up to the main house. 
 
 (kids talking, playing) Group : Over the archway, across the light. Deny the side of darkness into the light. (rock music playing on radio) Think that'll do it. Okay. Start her up. See how we did. (engine revs) (laughs) Your mom would kill me if I didn't say, "Be careful," so be careful. ♪ Chest hum, a black gun, and $40 ♪ 
♪ Chest hum, a black gun, and $40 ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh. ♪ (honking) Holden : Are you crazy? Hey! (tires squeal) Get away from me! (honking) What the hell's wrong with you? Get in! Kevin? (thunder rumbles) Why can't we talk in the truck? They could be listening. Who? Who is listening? We're in the middle of nowhere. Keep your voice down. Not until you tell me what's going on. Damn it, Holden, shut up! No! You need to tell me what's going on! What are you? What? Kevin, I'm your friend. No, you... you were a vegetable for 12 years. And now look at you. People don't just wake up from a coma and walk out of the hospital. Kevin, you need to calm down. No, I know what I saw! I know what I saw. They were right about you, about what you could do. And now they won't leave me alone until they have you. I never asked for any of this. Neither did I! I didn't ask to live half my life unconscious in a hospital bed. I didn't ask to do whatever the hell it was you saw me do the other night. I certainly didn't ask to be driven miles out of town by some ninja girl from  The Matrix  who claimed we lived a life together while I was in a coma. The only thing I asked for was help... help from my best friend who shared beers with me right up there, man. I just want things to be like they were. I still want that. Well, it's too late for that now. Then I'm sorry. I'm sorry I woke up and ruined your life. (thunder rumbles) (groans) (phone vibrating) (muffled vibrating continues) You're back less than a week and Mom's already got you doing chores? No wonder you're the favorite. Maybe it has something to do with you sneaking out after Mom and Dad are asleep. Yeah, I'm in college, man. You're sneaking. I'm not sneaking, I... I get it. Mom runs this place like Guantanamo. A little rebellion now and then could be good for you. Then you must be a pinnacle of health. (chuckles) Yeah. You should come with me. This girl Julia's having a few friends over. You know, it's nothing major. I... I don't think so. You sure, Holden? Maybe a little bit of practice being around other people wouldn't be the worst thing. Come on, dude. You got a shirt I can borrow? (dance music playing) (chattering) A few friends? Okay, so I underestimated a little. Welcome down the rabbit hole. Just try and keep up. Okay. Start with this. You're going to want to avoid any reds, blues, or clears. There's gonna be punch floating around. It's essentially Kool-Aid with turpentine, so... Guess who? Ooh. Sorry. Holden, uh... uh, this is my... Riley... girlfriend, sorry. Um, Riley, this is my brother... Brother? Yeah, I know. You're all this town's talking about. So, do you remember anything from your coma? Could you, like, hear people speaking to you while you were unconscious? I saw a kid on YouTube that could hear everything going on around him. This is a party, so could we not talk about comas? Why are you drinking beer? (unsure) It's a neutral color? (laughs) Come on, I'm taking you where we got the good stuff. It's cool. I'll catch up with you. I promise. Okay. Let's go, superstar. (clock ticking loudly) (footsteps approach) I'm meeting with Frost. No, you're not. I think there's been a mistake. No, no mistake. You had a meeting with Frost. Now you have a meeting with me. Sorry to waste your time. Please take your seat. You've got my number where Frost can reach me directly. Sit down! What the hell were you thinking? You had orders to be discreet. Discretion is how this organization continues to operate with minimal outside interference. What you did... that was the opposite of discreet. Frost instructed me to find something out... And yet that moronic show and tell wasn't the worst of it. Your blunt-force tactics have likely spooked Holden, not that I blame him. He'll involve law enforcement... if he hasn't already... and photos of you in that hideous... mustard jacket will be posted on every bus bench from Fort Reed to Fort Worth. You're being reassigned. You don't have the authority to do that. Our cause is too important. Holden is too important. His cooperation is crucial. And by alienating him, you've jeopardized the life's work of a great man. I gave him proof! Frost wanted to see what the kid can do and now we know. You don't get a gold sticker for a job half done. (ticking continues) You can go now. (dance music playing) Holden! If it's too strong, I can add more lemonade. Hi, I'm Jamie. Holden. Yeah, I... I know. You see? Everybody knows. Luke told us not to say anything, but I feel like it's wrong not to say anything. Right? Like when someone dies, you don't just ignore the fact that they're dead. You acknowledge the fact that they've lived. I didn't die. I'm still... Obviously you didn't die, but just 'cause you're not dead doesn't mean you were alive. Ignore her. She gets hammered and then suddenly she's Aristotle. Uh, the philosopher. Yeah, don't forget scientist. You know, a lot of people don't know this, but his model of the universe is actually what paved the way for Copernicus, who, as most people do know, said the earth revolved around the sun, not the other way around. I was really big into science. No kidding. Well, I'm really big into keeping this party a party. So let's skip study hall for now and let's start having some fun. All right, bitches, around the world. Here we go. Man : All right. Woman : Yeah! Woo! (Riley inhales) (dance music playing) (exhales) Woo! Good job, Riley. (exhales) (all hooting) Woman : Oh yeah! (coughing) (all cheering) (mellow music playing) You don't look like you were in a coma for 12 years. (chuckles) You look like a quarterback. The miracles of modern medicine. Some miracle. I... (chuckles) I really don't do this. I mean, make out with guys I hardly know. I thought everyone knows me. Valid point. I've wanted this for so long. What? What's the matter? I... nothing. Um... Oh, we don't have to... No. No, I... I want to. (dance music playing) (gasps) Um, I gotta... where... where's the bathroom? There's... sorry, I'll be right back. Holden? (music intensifies) Don't resist. (panting) They're coming for you, Holden. (dance music stops) (Tense music playing) (screaming echoes) (panting) (Music stops) (can clatters) (tense music playing) (yelps) Whoa. (echoes) Where am I? (loud thud) Hey! Hello? (loud thudding) (pounding on door) (muffled dance music playing) Man : Hurry up, man! I gotta take a leak! Man 2 : Dude, did you fall in or what? (dance music playing) Hey. Hey! Where's Holden? What? My brother? I thought you were watching him. (panting) (creature thuds, growls) (growling) (hooves clop) (chain rattling) (fire hisses) Man : Come on, man! Let's do this! (laughing) Woo! (music thumping) Man : Hey! Woman : Oh! Man : Right over there! (woman laughs) Man : Oh yeah! (mutters) Woman : I love you! (creature growling, banging) (panting) (all screaming) (ground rumbling) Whoa, whoa, whoa! (all screaming) Man : Man! What's going on? (house rumbling) (fire alarm beeping) Luke : Holden! Holden? Holden! Holden! Holden. Holden. Holden, come on. Wake up. Wake up, come on. (gasps) It's okay. Luke. Come on, we gotta get out of here. Okay, you gotta stand up. I'll help you. (coughing) (clattering) (fire alarm beeping) (electricity sparking) I got you. I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. What? (sirens approaching) Hey. Hey, come on. We gotta get out of here. Let's go. (grunts) (idyllic music playing) (dog barking) (tense music playing) (woman and little girl speaking indistinctly) (dishes clanging, chatter) (beeping) Daddy! Daddy! He-he-he-hey! Easy there, butterfly. You're getting too strong for me. You know what might have happened? I think you got bit by some radioactive spiders. No. Yeah, 'cause that's a spider bite. That's another spider bite. There's another spider bite. Lots of spider bites. Hey, I didn't hear you come in. Hi. Hi. Pancakes are almost ready. I'm starved. Did you get taller while I was gone? No! I think you did. No. No, I measured you before I left. You are definitely taller. I have a tall girl! (scraping plate) Oh, right there. The door was unlocked. Spent an entire weekend installing that double cylinder, but if you don't actually lock it... Did you talk to your supervisor? Wasn't that the whole reason you made the trip? He got called away, last minute. Called away? He invited you down. Did he at least apologize and reschedule? He's the owner, Mel. He didn't actually speak to me. His assistant relayed the message. Great. Maybe you can ask his assistant for that promotion. (phone ringing) You need to be more aggressive. Emily starts at Westover in the fall. That plus mortgage payments... I mean, maybe it's... I don't know... maybe you need to try something new. A sales job that doesn't require that you travel so much. (phone ringing) (sighs) Hello? Uh, just a moment. (whispering) It's for you. Mr. Frost? Yes, hello. No, no, it's quite all right. Absolutely. I understand. No, no, thank you. (phone beeps, clatters) Ah, he is risen. Before noon, no less. You want me to make you something? No thanks. I'm not really hungry. You sleep okay? Yeah, fine. Just, uh, weird dreams. Well, try and eat. You'll feel better. Hey, Luke, you didn't happen to know anyone involved in that house fire, did you? House fire? Yeah, it happened right off-campus. Just awful. I guess there was a party and it got out of hand. Whole house went up in minutes. Three kids were taken to the hospital. It's a miracle nobody was killed. Yeah, that's crazy. Hi. Hi. Can I come in? Of course. You live here? I... I just mean, you know, there's a lot of, uh, empty space. I am still moving in. The other night, you, uh, said we lived a life together. Yeah. Where? (theme music playing) (no discernible dialog)
