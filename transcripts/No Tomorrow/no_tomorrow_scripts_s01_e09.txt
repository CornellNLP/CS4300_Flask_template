 Previously on  No Tomorrow... 
 Tyra DeNeil Fields is the most popular astrophysicist in the world. 
 And she's just the sort of person who could not only validate my theory,  but alert the general public. 
 Can you toss this for me, please? 
 CyberHugs does not yet have an animal rescue branch. 
 And I think someone with your experience should help us launch it. 
 My brother's trotting out his new fiancée. 
 This... is Sofia. 
 It's a green card marriage. 
 I'm into you. 
 Sofia Letícia Fernandes. 
 Will you marry me? 
 If you are with them,  you are, by definition, against me. 
 You are therefore no longer my boyfriend. 
 Man : What is your name? 
 Stanley J. Turkleton. 
 Lie. 
 What is your name? 
 Harvey Stevens. Sioux City, Iowa. 
 Lie. 
 What is your name?

 Hamish Stegner. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You did it! (Laughs) 
 All you got to do is, uh... think about something calm, like, um... like light rain, or the infinite size of the universe, and your tiny little miniscule part in it. 
 Okay, got it. 
 What's your name? 
 Martha Waterbottom. 
 Lie. 
 Where do you live? 
 Buckingham Palace. 
 Lie. 
 Balls. 
 Why don't I ask the question, maybe it'll keep you more calm. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Um, do you like my new haircut? 
 Yes. 
 Lie. 
 Evie. (Exhales) 
 Ugh. Uh, do, uh, do you like, um, my French toast? 
 Yes. 
 Lie. 
 Evie, come... You ate four pieces of that yesterday. 
 You said it gave you a yumgasm. 
 Well, I didn't want to hurt your feelings. 
 Do you like any of my cooking? 
 Yes. 
 Lie. 
 (Gasps) 
 You make good microwave popcorn. 
 Lie. 
 Reggie, you're killing me. 
 You're... Okay. 
 Something else. Um... 
 All right. 
 Do... I satisfy you sexually? 
 Yes.

 Is there something that you want to do that we haven't tried yet? 
 No. 
 Lie.

 Do you want to try that right now? 
 Yes. 
 That is true. 
 Reggie, you're dismissed. 
 Right.

 Screw the lie detector test. 
 I got to cross a way better item off my lyst. 
 _ 
 I admitted something very personal to Xavier, and it paid off. 
 Three times. 
 Wake me when you do something that requires a safeword. 
 Oh! And this morning at the coffee shop, I got too much change back, so I told the barista and she gave me a free scone! 
 An honesty scone. 
 (Groans) 
 You're like a human hangover. 
 The universe rewards honesty. 
 And I'm gonna keep the rewards coming. 
 Hank's taking over for me in quality control, and I'm gonna give him the cold, hard truth about that job. 
 In the form of a color-coded, fully comprehensive binder. 
 Okay, can you keep this honesty mission to yourself? 
 Some people are very content to live in a world of lies. 
 Radical honesty is very liberating. 
 Maybe you can apply it to that situation... with your... with your brother...? 
 Shh. Oh! 
 Hey, Rohan! 
 Who needs a little happy sippy? 
 Yay! 
 So much... joy. 
 (Exhales) 
 Okay. What's happening? 
 (Closes drawer) 
 Yeah. He's not handling the breakup with Sofia well at all. 
 I told him he could come here and raid my mini-bottle stash. 
 You have to tell him you're engaged to his ex-fiancée. 
 Wha... I'm going to, but first I have to get him through the stages. 
 Wh-what? 
 With every breakup, he goes through five very specific stages of grief. 
 Stage one... day drinking. 
 Two... despondency over trivial things. 
 Three... excessive self-love. 
 Four... TRH: Totally Random Hookup. 
 And finally five... obsession with physical fitness. 
 Once he gets through all of those, he'll be over her, and I can tell him the truth about everything, and not ruin our relationship. 
 Is that a llama? 
 (Whinnies) 
 Fern : An alpaca, actually. 
 You know, like the blankets? 
 It's animal therapy. 
 (Laughs) 
 It's part of a company-wide initiative to improve work conditions post-strike. 
 Yeah. All this week, an animal therapy training center... supported by CyberHugs... is going to bring in their animals during lunch hour. 
 What do you think? 
 Honestly... 
 I think it's fantastic. 
 Just be careful when you go over there. 
 I almost ruined my 'Gamos stepping in some alpaca caca. 
 Yeah, they are heavy defecators. 
 That's good to know. 
 I got to get back to work, but, um, enjoy therapy. 
 Wow. This is quite the line. 
 Oh. Yeah. Sorry for the wait. 
 We only have the one alpaca today. 
 We hate to split up Brad and Angelina but it was inevitable. 
 We couldn't afford the double-wide. 
 Oh. Didn't CyberHugs give you a sizable donation recently? 
 Oh, yeah. But that five percent processing fee really takes a chunk out of it. 
 Well, since when do we charge a processing fee? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, I'd be thrilled if it was a mistake. 
 We really could use a bigger trailer. 
 And the staff could use new boots. 
 (Whispers): Alpacas are heavy defecators. 
 Yeah. I've heard that. 
 You know what? Let me get your name and contact info, and I'll look into the fee and then follow up. 
 Uh, my name and number is Sabrina... 
 Mm-hmm... and it's 206. 
 Oh, gosh, what is the freaking hold up? 
 (Whispering): I loved her. 
 And then she left, and you're my only friend. 
 I loved her so much. 
 Oh, wow. Okay. Stage one complete. 
 Move this way. 
 Okay. Don't judge. We all cope with heartbreak in different ways. 
 Hey. 
 You doing okay? 
 She's wearing purple. 
 That's my favorite color. 
 It's just mean. 
 Maybe you should pet the therapy alpaca. 
 I just don't get it. I mean, we had this heat. 
 This flaming heat. 
 Then it fizzles out because of some work issue? 
 Like, flames don't fizzle. 
 That's not how flames work. 
 Maybe it was just a fling. 
 It... definitely wasn't a fling... 
 Yeah? 
 Well, how would you know? 
 Okay. 
 The truth is really working for me today, so I'm gonna lay some on you. 
 When Xavier nearly got me fired, the only way Deirdre would rehire me was if I helped her win your affections. 
 I was the subject of a conspiracy? 
 She called it Operation Hanky Panky. 
 (Gasps) 
 It had a codename? 
 See? It wasn't a fling. And if you want to be with her, tell her exactly how you feel. 
 You're right. You're so friggin' right. 
 (Grunts) That a boy. Go get that honesty scone. 
 Yeah. Gonna get that scone! 
 Is that a s*x thing? 
 Never mind. 
 'Cause I'm open to new ideas. 
 No. It's not a s*x thing. 
 It sounds like a s*x thing. 
 It's not a s*x thing. 
 Okay, 'cause it is now. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 I am ordering supplies. 
 How cute is Cyber Marty? 
 What? 
 Cyber Marty. He's our upselling tool. 
 You know, before you finalize your order, he suggests other items to buy based on your purchase. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 And the people who frequently order what Marty recommends are... 
 Cybermart's most valued customers. 
 We call them The Suggestibles. 
 Oh! 
 (Laughing): He wants you to buy an electric can opener, because you bought a... case of creamed corn? 
 Yeah. Well, I'm just getting provisions in case I need to hole up for a few days. 
 Well, why would you need to hole up? 
 Because, according to my calculations, Tyra DeNeil Fields will be publishing her peer review of my theory in the next couple of days. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Well, I figure... she's had my research for a month. It took me two weeks to double-check the math, but with her I.Q., she could probably do that in half the time. 
 However, she had a two week conference in Toledo and a lecture to prepare for in Boston. Add... six days assuming she doesn't work weekends and a two day grace period, and the logical conclusion is that she's gonna go public in the next 48 hours. 
 And I do not want to be around during the ensuing chaos. 
 Oh, gosh. Honesty scone. 
 What? 
 I have to tell you something. 
 All right. 
 Tyra never read your theory. 
 The day you gave your research to her, she threw it away. 
 Wait, what? 
 Well, I went back to grab my purse and I saw her toss it. 
 Right after I gave it to her? 
 Yes. 
 A month ago? 
 Yes. 
 Wait, you've been holding onto this for a month? 
 I'm sorry... 
 Evie, that's a month I'm never gonna get back. 
 That's one of the only six we've got left! 
 Xavier... 
 That's a month that countless people have wasted their lives, 'cause they don't know the world is ending. 
 Evie, time is the only thing that matters and... 
 You just stole a bloody month from me. 
 Well, I just thought... 
 No. 
 There's nothing you can say to make this better. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 She stole from me. 
 I mean... 
 Eh... 
 No. She stole from me. 
 A month, a whole month. 
 And it was one of the long ones. 
 She can't just give it back. 
 I know. 
 That's why I'm so upset. 
 Well, do something about it. 
 Graffiti a billboard or-or get on a talk show. 
 Actually, I tried that one... sort of. 
 When we get back, we're gonna talk to my man Xavier about a big-ass asteroid. 
 How many people actually watch this show? 
 Oh, like, easily in the dozens. 
 I can't believe Evie lied to me. 
 I didn't lie. I just didn't tell him. 
 Like how you haven't told Rohan you're involved with Sofia. 
 Deflection. Classic liar behavior. 
 I haven't told Rohan yet because I want to minimize the pain it causes when I do. 
 Yeah, and I didn't tell Xavier because I knew it would hurt him. 
 I wouldn't have been hurt. 
 I just would've found another way to get the message out. 
 Ah, yeah, I'm sure she'd love that. 
 Who wouldn't want to date the Grim Reaper? 
 Oh. 
 That's why she didn't tell me the truth. 
 When I thought I'd passed off the responsibility of publicizing the asteroid to Tyra, I guess I didn't talk about it as much. 
 He stopped going on about her all the time. 
 And it was... kind of nice to get a break from all that doom and gloom. 
 Bring it home. 
 But it was super selfish of me to try to stifle his message for my own comfort. 
 I have to make it up to him. 
 Okay, well, who else can get his message out? 
 (Knocking) 
 Evie. 
 Oh. Ah. 
 Fern! I was just looking for Timothy. 
 So sorry. It's not a good time. 
 No, no, I'm-I'm sorry, I don't normally answer another person's door naked. 
 I thought you were the Thai food delivery guy. 
 I-I can come back. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Peanut? Um... 
 Evie's here. 
 Evie... 
 Uh, you know Fern. 
 (Nervous chuckle) 
 And Fern, of course, you know Evie. 
 And I know both of you, so... 
 Fern : And I... am going to go find my clothes. 
 If I can find them 'cause they came off in a hurry. 
 (Both chuckle) 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know you wanted to take a friendship breather, I just, I didn't know who else to go to. 
 No, i-it's totally fine, what's up? 
 I screwed up big time with Xavier. 
 And I kind of need your help. 
 So you want me to help Xavier? 
 Well, if it makes a difference, you're actually helping me... help him. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um, so, Xavier has this theory. 
 Kind of like a Jade Helm thing like Hank? 
 Well, this is actually a very well-researched scientific theory that... maybe you could put a public voice to, or introduce him to someone who could. 
 Look, I-I know it's-it's super awkward for me to ask my ex-boyfriend to help my current boyfriend. 
 Then again, my... ex-boyfriend moved on with my ex-best friend, so it's all kind of just, you know... 
 Sure. 
 And you and Xavier have bonded a bit, right? 
 Yeah, yeah, we're-we're cool. 
 Yeah. 
 So maybe it's not too weird. 
 (Stammers) Sure. 
 Yeah, I'll-I'll hear him out. 
 Thank you. 
 Hank :  There's still something here and we both know it. 
 Okay, still something here. 
 We can both feel it. 
 It's between us. 
 We know it and we feel it. 
 Here we go. 
 (Exhales) 
 Hey! (Clears throat) 
 (Voice cracking): Okay, we have a thing. 
 We got a... 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 We have a thing, okay? 
 It's between me, you. 
 We got a thing. 
 Let's do the thing. 
 That was complete nonsense. 
 Okay, I have real feelings for you. 
 I'm not ready for this to be over. 
 Hank, allow me to be violently clear. 
 I do not wish to be involved with you any longer, as our toxic chemistry perverted my priorities. 
 I need to focus on my career and my responsibilities, and shirk any romantic entanglements. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting.

 Awfully tight in here.

 Hi, I'm Evie. 
 I work for CyberHugs. 
 Are you new? 
 No, I'm not new, I'm swamped. 
 Department downsized by 75% in Q1 of 2016. 
 What's the action item? 
 Okay, well, there's some mysterious fee getting deducted from every CyberHugs account. 
 No mystery. CyberHugs accounts are all deducted 5%. 
 Paid out to Rosie Baxter & Associates. 
 It's not unusual for legal firms to charge for handling a charity's contracts and payroll. 
 Well, maybe I can talk them into a flat fee instead. 
 Can I get the contact info? 
 You cost the company $10.53 in overtime by interrupting me. 
 Okay. Thanks.

 Okay, so, there's this... this guy, and then, he came in with f... 
 (Sniffs) Oh. 
 Hey. Here... 
 And then, he... 
 Okay. (Kisses) 
 I think I got that last part. 
 Use your words. 
 There was a guy in Deirdre's office, and he gave her flowers and then he kissed her on the cheek! 
 (Whispering): That's my cheek! 
 I kiss that cheek! That's my cheek! 
 She told me no more romantic entanglements. 
 It's all about work. So I hacked her calendar, and I found out she has an appointment at 7:30. 
 Tonight. In blue. 
 Both : What does that mean? 
 Work appointments are in Cybermart green, and personal appointments are in blue. It's a blue! 
 It's a personal! 
 She's going on a date. 
 What do I do? 
 I think you have to kill him. 
 Yes, that is good. 
 How? 
 What? 
 Wait, no, that's bad. 
 I can't, I can't do that. 
 You know she's gonna see him tonight, just... get in there and do some date sabotage.

 Oh! 
 And there you have it. 
 A rather graphic illustration of what awaits us and why it's critically important that we make sure that it's publicized.

 Never mind. 
 No. Now you're being petty.

 Well, if you want to accuse me of being someone that would do something that would make me someone who you didn't think I was, you know, then maybe I don't know you that well, either. 
 Huh?

 Yeah, but look what happened when I set fire to a globe with Timothy. 
 The takeaway was "unhinged conspiracy guy." 
 And look at you. 
 You didn't tell me Tyra tossed my research, because you liked that I was backing off the whole "end is nigh" talk, didn't you? 
 Yeah, it's, it's a lot to take. 
 And I get it, which is why I'm not gonna tell a bunch of strangers they're gonna be obliterated by a fiery ball of iron and silicate. 
 'Cause this whole thing isn't about doom and gloom. 
 It's about embracing life. 
 So, I'll tell them the truth. 
 I'm just gonna soften the blow with two little words. 
 Timothy :  What if 
 I tried a reverse phone look-up? 
 Hey, Peanut, I need to ask you something important. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Theoretically... if I had been dishonest, but I made up for it and did the right thing, would you still want to be with me? 
 I-I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. I was just researching Evie's boyfriend. 
 It's a long story, but it's taken a bit of a disturbing turn. 
 You're probably never gonna get over her, are you? 
 Yeah, it's really interesting. 
 'Cause I...

 I accept your proposition.

 Xavier :  What if I told you the world was ending? 
 What if I said that an asteroid was headed directly for Earth in six months time? 
 What would you change about your lives? 
 I know it sounds like a bizarre hypothetical, but what if... what if it were true? 
 What if you gave yourself permission to seize the day? 
 What might your life look like? 
 I would implore you to embrace that "what if." 
 What are your wildest dreams? 
 What are your deepest fears that you... that you wish you could overcome? 
 Be honest with yourself about what it is that you would change about your life. 
 When you have your "what if," grab a piece of chalk and write it down. 
 You're making a promise to yourself that you're gonna do it. 
 So go on, grab a piece of chalk. 
 What would you do if you only had six months left? 
 There we go. 
 Well done, mate.

 I didn't see that one. 
 No? 
 It was right there in, like, orange caps. 
 Oh. You know, you were right to soften the truth for those people, but for us, from now on, let's just say complete and brutal honesty is our relationship policy. 
 Right. I agree. Full-time honesty scones. 
 Okay, here goes, I cheated on a second grade spelling test and never told anyone about it. 
 (Gasps) 
 Scandalous! 
 Well, what was the word? 
 Irreconcilable. 
 "Irreconcilable"? 
 Well, that's far too hard for second grade.

 Where you headed? 
 Uh, to find Fernberger. Why? 
 Ah, stage 5. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I got Rohan a Zap Strap. 
 Grief process complete. I'm home-free. 
 I can come clean about Sofia without crushing him. 
 I'm glad. For both of you. 
 Yeah. 
 Good luck. 
 Oh, hey, if you're heading to Fernburger, will you get me one of those doubles with facon and vegan cheese? 
 No, it's a different... different Fernberger. 
 Oh, and some radish fries. 
 Different Fernberger! 
 Fern :  Evie, you were right. What I did was wrong, and I dressed it up as nobility. If I were a stronger person, maybe I could stay and make it right. But the truth is, I'm not ready to accept the consequences of my actions, and by the time you get this, I will be halfway to Uruguay to get back in touch with what I love... saving kittens from floods. Best, Fern. P.S. Enjoy the alpaca scarf. Don't worry, I used my own money. 
 Deirdre : She really pulled the wool over our eyes. 
 There are missing funds that we cannot account for. 
 And there is an accountant that we cannot account for. 
 He seems to have quit, too. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Yeah. Wow. 
 And without Fern's skilled money-raising efforts, the program may be in jeopardy. 
 You are now manning a sinking ship. 
 Good luck. 
 You lied to me. 
 Said you only had room for work in your life. 
 So what's the truth? 
 You just don't have feelings for me? 
 We had powerful chemistry. 
 But during the strike, you didn't stand by me, and that hurt my... my feelings more than I expected. 
 If I continued down a road with you into emotional territory, then it would be exponentially more painful if you rejected me. 
 So the possibility of rejection made you reject me? 
 I exercise risk management in all aspects of life. 
 I think that's the stupidest thing you've ever said. 
 I appreciate your honesty, Hank.

 Evie :  I'm so sorry  about Fern. 
 Sounds like she wasn't who we thought she was. 
 No. 
 And you deserve better. 
 So do you. 
 Uh, which is why I wanted you to see this. 
 I won't publish this without your consent. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I-I never intended to make Xavier look crazy. 
 I went looking for his credentials to legitimize him, but... 
 Uh, just read it. 
 He's not who he says he is. 
 His name isn't even Xavier Holliday. 
 Hamish Stegner. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hey. 
 Who the hell are you?
