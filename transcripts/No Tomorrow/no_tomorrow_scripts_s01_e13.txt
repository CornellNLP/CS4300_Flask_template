 Previously on  No Tomorrow... 
 What if the asteroid doesn't hit? 
 I don't know. It will, so... 
 You need to decide what's more important to you, obsessing over this theory... or us. 
 Evie :  I'm going to the airport, and I hope you meet me there. 
 I'm wrong. 
 (laughs) 
 I'm wrong! 
 I can spend a lifetime with Evie! 
 Oh, my God, we've got to get to the airport. 
 Xavier :  Jesse, man,  you just missed the exit. 
 We're not turning around, cuz. 
 Did you drug me? 
 (snoring) 
 Oh! 
 Hello, Mr. Finger. 
 The asteroid... theory. 
 It's a credible threat. 
 Tyra : So, Mr. Finger, where exactly did this asteroid theory come from? 
 His name is Hamish Stegner, Jr. 
 Oh, but he also goes by the name Xavier Holliday. 
 Xavier Holliday? 
 Beard? Lots of man jewelry? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I will be damned. 
 He has been chasing me down for months. 
 Has he shown this theory to anyone else? 
 He talks about it all the time, but people don't really take him seriously. 
 Okay, great... because absolutely no one can know about the reality of this threat until we have a plan in place to deal with the public's expected response. 
 Mass panic and chaos? 
 Exactly. 
 You share this information with anybody, and you will spend the last few months of your life in a prison for treason... You hear me? 
 Hmm? 
 All right, do you have any idea where Xavier Holliday is right now? 
 (smacks lips) 
 It's kind of a soft "X." 
 What d... ? 
 It's like "Zavier". 
 Z... Okay, do you have any idea where Xavier Holliday is right now? 
 No, I don't.

 Jesse, you turn around! 
 We're supposed to be halfway off to... 
 Skaftafell. 
 Wow, that looks incredible. 
 Man : I hear the waterfall there will "take your breath away." 
 Wow. That is a coincidence. 
 This guidebook is pretty under the radar. 
 Yeah. I did a fair amount of research trying to find the best one. 
 Uh, it was either this or... 
 Beyond Reykjavik? 
 That's the one! Yes! The other one. 
 (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) 
 (snores, exhales) 
 (groans) 
 Um... so, my seatmate is... snoring, which is totally fine, I can live with that, you know? 
 Except he's also drooling on me. 
 You see that? 
 Oh, wow. 
 That is substantial. 
 (whispers): It's so wet. 
 (laughs) 
 Would you mind... if I... 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. No one else... claimed it, so... 
 Yeah. 
 (heavy snoring) 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I'm sorry. Um, I'm Graham. 
 Oh, Evie. 
 Evie. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you, too. 
 (exhales) 
 (panting): Are you out of your mind?! 
 I've been screaming through this window for hours! 
 What the hell is going on? 
 (wind whistling) 
 Where the hell are we? 
 Jesse : Majestic eastern Oregon, cuz. 
 Should be rolling into Houston in 26 hours, depending on bathroom breaks. 
 Luckily, I have a huge gallbladder. 
 Your gallbladder has nothing to do... 
 Wait. Houston? What? 
 You've been preaching nonstop about this looming asteroid strike for years. 
 Now you have a chance to sit down with Mr. NASA himself, the head of space! You have to go... 
 I... I was wrong. 
 I saw the simulation... It's coming for us. 
 I don't care what Tina Danza Fate says. 
 Tyra DeNeil Fields is the most credible astrophysicist on the planet. 
 We're not going to Houston; I'm going to Iceland to meet Evie. 
 She thinks I blew her off. Now, give me the keys! 
 (echoing): And where are my pants? 
 Uh, yeah, the tranqs that I gave you relax all the muscle groups, including the gallbladder ones, so... you pee-pee'd, but I hung them out of the window to air-dry. 
 Wha... ? Aw, nads. 
 That's where I taped 'em. See? 
 (panting) 
 (sighs) 
 My phone and my passport were in the pockets. 
 Ah. We'll find them. 
 We'll just retrace our steps. Don't worry about it. 
 We've only gone, like, 500 miles or so. 
 (chuckles) 
 This is a nightmare. 
 (gasps) 
 (laughs softly) 
 (shudders) Oh... 
 Oh, no. I... I don't know how... 
 Oh. I'm-I'm so sorry. 
 No, no, no. No, it's fine. 
 Uh, don't worry about it. 
 (chuckles) 
 Hey, I guess it's symmetrical now, right? 
 (nervous chuckle) 
 It's like earrings... one's weird, two is cool. 
 Symmetry. 
 (both laugh briefly) 
 Uh, all right, well, now you're awake, um, I'm gonna stretch a bit. 
 Oh, you were waiting to stretch. 
 I'm the worst. 
 No, no, it's fine. 
 How long was I out? Are you gonna end up with a blood clot because of me? 
 (chuckles) Well, the chance of deep vein thrombosis is actually very small without associative risk factors, so I should be fine. 
 You sound like a doctor. 
 I hope so. 
 I am a doctor. 
 Oh, what kind of medicine? 
 It's whatever's needed, really. 
 Uh, have you heard of Doctors Without Borders? 
 Yeah. Is that... that's why you're going to Iceland? 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 Their health care system is stellar. 
 (chuckles) 
 Um, I got a bit of time off before my next assignment, so I'm gonna go see the northern lights. 
 Same here. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. I mean, I'm not a selfless doctor, but seeing the northern lights has always been on my list... I'm also between jobs, although I blasted out my résumé just before I boarded on one of those national employment Web sites to keep things moving while I'm away, but in the meantime, I'm really happy to be unplugging and enjoying some me time while also getting a chance to see some solar particles (out of breath) light up in a spectacular way. 
 (takes deep breath) 
 That was one sentence. 
 Yeah, my lungs started to burn at the end. 
 (laughing) 
 Hank :  I have a weird feeling about this. 
 Deirdre's been acting strange since we started here. 
 Well, that's a whole new group of people she has to coldly assert her will over. 
 Must be stressful. 
 Hmm. You're right. 
 She needs a little sweet treat pick-me-up. 
 Hmm. 
 I'm gonna grab her some Dr. Dibbs. 
 Okay. 
 Oh... 
 Oh, no! No! 
 Deirdre :  You may be wondering  where the soda is. 
 It's related to my first official act as the new branch manager for Cybermart Tacoma. 
 HI. 
 Um... hello? 
 No. 
 H-period-I-period for Healthy Initiatives. 
 New programs and policies promoting healthy bodies and a healthy planet, which includes a complete and immediate ban of all soda and confections. 
 What? 
 I thought I left USSR. 
 I thought I left Fresno! 
 I detect your resistance, but you will heed my decree. 
 My goal is to ensure a safe and healthy future for the world for Cybermart and all of its workers. 
 That is all. 
 She... she can't... she just... 
 Okay, this, this is a... 
 A what, Hank? 
 Deirdre, you know how I feel about cream soda. 
 And you know how I feel when you don't support my work initiatives. 
 You are no longer my boyfriend. 
 That's right, and that is why we are all gonna embrace this new plan! 
 Right? 
 They're all gone, but they're all embracing it. 
 Boo! Soda. 
 Hey, remember my advice. 
 Yes. Um, eat almonds every day and stay off WebMD. 
 (chuckles): Yeah. You know, since we're both solo travelers, maybe we could... get a drink or see some sights together. 
 You know, it wouldn't hurt to have some company. 
 Actually, it would. 
 See, I was, um, originally going on this trip with a guy, but when he bailed, I realized it was time for me to strike out on my own, so I'm making this a solo journey. 
 It's just, you know, what I need right now. 
 Okay. All right. 
 I think I see what's going on here. 
 You feel like we slept together too soon. 
 The thing is I was awake the whole time just... feeling your saliva slowly soaking through my shirt. 
 (laughs) Sh... Shut up! 
 No, I get it, I get it. 
 A solo journey. Okay. 
 Well, I hope it's a wonderful one. 
 You, too. 
 (bird cawing) 
 Tell you what, that Find My Phone app's a godsend. 
 Yep. 
 Now all we have to do is find a way up there. 
 (birds cawing) 
 Going up? 
 Yep. 
 Yay. 
 Ooh. 
 (siren chirping) 
 Should I run? 
 Please don't. 
 I really want to run. 
 Officer : First, you pulled over without putting on your hazards. Second, running your plates pulled up a bench warrant for your arrest. 
 What? 
 You have 85 unpaid parking tickets. 
 That's accurate. 
 And you... 
 (laughing) 
 ... are in possession of unprescribed equine tranquilizers. 
 No, sir, those are prescribed. 
 The equine's just not here today.

 Listen, I was on the way to the airport, all right, but I just got waylaid. 
 Um, I'm now in a... jail cell in, uh, Yakima, actually. 
 Uh, Jesse's here. 
 Hey, Evie! 
 That was Jesse. 
 Listen, I'm gonna find a way out of this mess, and I'm gonna come meet you, all right, I prom... 
 Time's up. 
 You know, that was very rude. 
 I hope that was worth your one call. 
 Yeah, well, I'm sure my cousin made a call and bailed both of us out, so... 
 I did... not think of that. 
 I called Amber and got pretty sidetracked.

 Oh. Oh, that's... 
 That's fantastic. 
 Well done. 
 Thanks.

 So I'll just bring it down to the concierge, and you'll call the airline? 
 Uh-huh. Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Hey! Hi! 
 Oh, uh... Um, you... 
 This is kind of weird, huh? 
 Yeah, we have the, we have the same suitcase, and you're staying in the room across the hall from mine?

 I was gonna take this down to the concierge so they could call the airline, but no need, I guess. 
 No.

 Perfect.

 Of course you do, yes!

 Solo journey. 
 (loud knocking) 
 Hey. 
 Where were you? 
 I waited at the bar for three hours. 
 You haven't been returning my texts. 
 I'm sorry. I-I-I-I... 
 I got caught up in a... in a story, and I lost track of time. 
 Okay, look. 
 I understand getting caught up in a story, but are you sure you don't want to tell me about it? 
 As a journalist, what do you do if you have very sensitive information, but you've been sworn to secrecy, but the-the weight of it all just, just weighs you down because it's so... weighty? 
 You are much too burdened by this. 
 You need to free your mind. 
 You got to go on a trip. 
 Yeah? 
 Where... Aruba? 
 Jamaica? 
 Different kind of trip. 
 Scratchers? 
 Honeymoons don't pay for themselves. 
 Well, where you gonna go? 
 Key Largo? Montego? 
 Hedonism Resort in Jamaica. 
 It's expensive, though, even splitting the suite six ways. 
 "Six ways"?! 
 Don't think about it too hard. 
 Have you noticed that nobody's doing any work? 
 (sighs) 
 All right, come on, guys. 
 Hey, you don't need sugar to have a good, productive work day. 
 We cannot just quit cool turkey. 
 The Deirdre is worst. 
 Look, she's not gonna mind if we sneak one little soda in every now and again. 
 Deirdre : Hands up! 
 Uh, that came with the socks. 
 This is a dry warehouse! 
 (speaking foreign language) 
 Pardon me? 
 Would you mind sharing your table with another diner? 
 It's the only open seating we have. 
 Oh. 
 Of course. 
 I'm happy to share. 
 Thank you.

 Right this way, sir. 
 Man : Thank you. 
 Oh. Hi. 
 I didn't realize it was your table she was talking about.

 No, it's-it's fine. 
 No, no, no, no, no.

 It's been confirmed.

 What? Who's waiting for me? 
 How's it going? 
 It's an honor, Mr. Holliday. We're so glad you're here.

 Ayahuasca isn't some party drug that dulls your senses and makes you crave cheese-puffs. 
 How much of this are we supposed to smoke? 
 You don't smoke Ayahuasca. 
 You drink it. It's a tea. 
 You know I'm not really a tea guy. 
 It's a very spiritual experience. 
 Yeah, not really a spiritual guy, either. 
 I promise, this will be a very transcendent experience for you. 
 All negative energy will be purged from your soul.

 Da. 
 Hello, honeymoon. 
 Xavier :  Has anyone got any questions? 
 Uh, yes. 
 Why can we neglect the seasonal Yarkovsky Effect in calculating the probability of impact? 
 Ah, because the heliocentric radius is large compared to the geocentric radius, so, as we get closer to the planet... 
 It has less influence, so what was a close encounter at the same position is now a direct hit. 
 Precisely. 
 So how do we stop it? 
 I have got a few thoughts on the subject, but we might want to order dinner first. 
 Who wants Thai? 
 Oh, so, are we getting close? 
 Yeah. Just follow my lead. 
 Okay.

 I reconciled with my dad...

 So thank you. 
 Well, because of you, I took risks I never would've taken, I quit my job, and I learned to carpe the fig out of my diem, (chuckles) so... thank you. 
 (laughs softly) 
 Hold on to this. 
 And if everything goes as I hope... 
 I'll be back for it in four months. 
 It feels so weird to say good-bye. 
 Well... then... let's just say, "Until we meet again." 
 Yeah, until we meet again.

 Evie? 
 I knew I should have worn my bib today.

 What are you doing here? 
 I-I could ask you the same thing. 
 Well, I'm headed to my next post in the Philippines. 
 You must be in the wrong seat, 'cause they told me this one's reserved for our new logistics coordinator. 
 That would be me. 
 Excuse me? 
 Yeah, they, uh, they said in my interview that Doctors Without Borders has 60 posts across the world. 
 What are the chances that we'd both be bound for the Philippines? 
 Is it chance? Or is it the result of every decision we've ever made? 
 I thought a lot about what you said in Iceland, and, um, you were right. 
 I'm here right now because four months ago I made a decision to get soda from a vending machine. 
 Well, that must have been a great soda. 
 There's more to it. Um, I was working at a hospital here, and, uh, I had the strangest conversation with this guy by the vending machine. 
 He said that I looked burned out, and I said I was, and... he said, "What would you be doing if you knew that your time was limited?" 
 When was this? What was the date? 
 September 15. 
 And I know for sure, because I applied for Doctors Without Borders that night. 
 Hey, uh, thanks for the talk, man.
