 [CHORUS STOPS SINGING] 
 Good to get out? That crisp Chicago air. 
 A mix of car exhaust and fish. 
 Nothing quite like it. [LAUGHS] 
 You grew up near here, didn't you, Solomon? 
 Humboldt Park. Two blocks from Saul Bellow. 
 Those were the days of great men. 
 Mr. Waltzer. Good day to be out and about. 
 It is. We should arrange a conference for after. 
 Why is that? After our next witness, you'll want to settle. [LAUGHS] 
 The man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him. 
 [WAREHOUSE DOOR CLOSES] 
 In all, 28 shots were fired. 
 Eight came from the Heckler & Koch P30... 
 ...that was found in the hands of the deceased, Antonio Phelps. 
 And he was selling illegal guns at the site? 
 Yes. This was an undercover sting operation to stop the spread of illegal arms. And the remaining 20 shots? 
 They came from the two Glock 17s carried by the arriving officers, there and there. 
 And was one of the arriving officers the defendant, Detective Daniel Whitehead? 
 Your Honor. Yes, Mr. Waltzer? 
 Do you have an objection? 
 Not an objection, so much as a clarification. 
 Detective Whitehead is one of the defendants. 
 The other is the Chicago Police Department. 
 That is correct. Thank you, Mr. Waltzer. You may continue. 
 Now let's turn to the actions of our client, Rashid Clarkson. 
 Rashid was here undercover. Yes. At this marker here. 
 And isn't it true, Mr. McVeigh, that Rashid was unarmed? 
 KURT: Yes. According to the police report. 
 Why isn't he objecting? ADRIAN: I don't know. 
 Whenever I've met a legend, I have been unimpressed. 
 JULIUS: Was our client injured in the crossfire? 
 No. Where was he injured? 
 The undercover officer, Rashid Clarkson, was hit here, during a foot chase. 
 He was trying to catch the other suspect. Yes. 
 Were you able to determine the gun that was fired at Officer Clarkson? 
 Yes. It was the Glock 17 carried by Detective Whitehead. 
 Were you able to determine the trajectory of the rounds that Detective Whitehead fired at our client? 
 Factoring in Detective Whitehead's height, and the point of aim to point of impact, the trajectory was a downward angle of 15.6 degrees. 
 JULIUS: Indicating what? KURT: Officer Rashid Clarkson was lying prone on the ground when he was shot. 
 And so, our client will never be able to walk again... 
 I think I'll object to that, Your Honor. 
 And I will sustain it. One more question, Mr. McVeigh, before the defense asks you the same thing. 
 Are you related to anyone on our plaintiff's legal team? 
 Yes. I'm married to Diane Lockhart, one of your attorneys. 
 JULIUS: And has this biased you in any way? 
 No. In fact, have you ever testified on the other side from Ms. Lockhart? Yes, on three cases. 
 Well, that can't go over well at home. [LAUGHTER] 
 KURT: Well, we understand that facts always eclipse emotion. 
 Thank you, Mr. McVeigh. Mr. Waltzer, anything? 
 Yes. 
 Mr. McVeigh, have you ever been charged with perjury in any case? 
 No, sir. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Hey, you were great. Thank you. 
 I don't think I should kiss you here. 
 How about later? 11:30. 
 I'll leave the door unlocked. 
 Hey, uh, you have never been charged with perjury, right? 
 Right. 
 That was a weird cross. Maybe he's going senile. 
 Mr. Waltzer. Why don't you ride with us? 
 Oh, I'd like that. 
 8.3 million. I think we could accept that. 
 I was hoping for more, but I'm feeling sorry for you. 
 DIANE: We have a sympathetic client, Mr. Waltzer, in a wheelchair, shot by a racist cop. 
 If this goes to verdict, the CPD could end up paying more than 12 million. 
 We're offering you a deal. 8.3 now, and we're done. 
 Thank you, but I'm enjoying court. 
 I used to work at a car wash right there. 
 $1.25 an hour. 
 Mr. Waltzer, you do realize you're losing? 
 That's what Justice Scalia said to me in 1991. 
 One of my strengths is never knowing I'm losing. 
 All I ever wanted was to be a cop. 
 I'm born and raised in this city. I love it. I wanted to give back. 
 That was taken from me. 
 See, I'm 34. It's not how I expected my life to go. 
 [SOBS] Sorry. 
 Now I can't even walk my dog. 
 My wife has to turn me over in bed. He's not objecting to anything. 
 I think you can push this. 
 ADRIAN: Officer Clarkson, were you familiar with Detective Whitehead prior to the shooting? 
 No. So why do you think he shot you? 
 He saw a black face and decided to shoot. 
 I was screaming at him that I was unarmed, that I was an undercover cop. 
 I was trying to chase down one of the suspects. 
 Had you heard rumors of Detective Whitehead's racism before? 
 JUDGE: Uh, one second. 
 Uh, Mr. Waltzer, uh, do you want to object to that? 
 No, thank you, Your Honor. 
 I trust the jury to discern what is fact and what is opinion. 
 JUDGE: Okay. I heard stories about Whitehead using drop guns and going out of his way to harass black arrestees. 
 I was told to watch out for him. Thank you, Officer. 
 Uh, Mr. Waltzer? Anything? SOLOMON: Yes. 
 Hello. Hi. 
 You mentioned not being able to walk your dog earlier. 
 What kind of dog? 
 A bull terrier. Augustus. 
 Augustus. 
 My guess is he wasn't named after the first Roman emperor. 
 RASHID: No, a friend. SOLOMON: I see. 
 And you still have Augustus? Your Honor, objection. Relevance. 
 Your Honor, I didn't bring up the dog, the witness did. 
 I'm just getting a fuller picture. Okay. 
 I have no idea where this is going, but overruled. 
 So do you still have Augustus? 
 No. He died a few months back. 
 I see. And what did he die of? 
 RASHID: It was natural causes. He got old. 
 Big dogs have a harder time. So are you saying he died naturally? 
 Or do you mean he was put down? 
 RASHID: He was put down. SOLOMON: I see. 
 And a veterinarian did this? Yes. 
 And it wasn't done illegally, after an injury from a dog fight? 
 Objection, Your Honor. Relevance. Not in evidence. 
 I think the relevance will become clear, Your Honor. 
 Um, get to the point, Mr. Waltzer. 
 Officer Clarkson, in June of 2014, didn't Internal Affairs investigate reports that you were conducting dog fights... Objection, Your Honor. 
 ...after complaints by Jean Bibb... Objection. 
 ...a neighbor? Objection! 
 Your Honor, this line of questioning is meant purely to disparage our client. 
 There is no evidence of this, Your Honor. 
 Even if there were, it would have no connection to this shooting. 
 Sorry, Your Honor, if I could speak? 
 I'm not used to this new way of debate where the loudest voice wins. 
 Go ahead. I think any Internal Affairs investigation has a direct bearing on this case. 
 That is not true. Mr. Boseman. Shh. 
 JUDGE: Where is the evidence of this investigation? 
 My paralegal found an article referring to a leaked IA report. 
 I'm subpoenaing the department even as we speak. 
 Okay. I want evidence brought to me by tomorrow morning, and I'll rule on the admissibility of this questioning. 
 The bell has already been rung, Your Honor. 
 And if there is no evidence, we will unring it. That is all I can offer. 
 [GAVEL BANGS] 
 Come on, man, it's not true. 
 How did your dog die? Exactly as I said. He was getting old. 
 Look, I'm not lying. 
 Could this neighbor, Mrs. Bibb, have been lying? 
 I don't even have a neighbor. We live out in the country. 
 Okay. Jay, check if there are any Internal Affairs reports we don't know about. And, Marissa, you check if there's any news reporting on this at all. 
 [KEYS JINGLING] 
 GUARD: Who are you visiting? Craig Savador, please. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [ALARM BUZZES] 
 Oh, man! 
 So, hey. Hey. 
 [MUMBLING] Let's see this. 
 Dope. Okay. 
 This is Basquiat-level dope. 
 Yeah, I took what you did and riffed off it a bit. 
 Oh, so, you jocking my style now, huh? 
 You wish. [LAUGHS] 
 That's classic Boondocks. I'm just taking it to another level. 
 Hey. Ah. 
 Now it's your move. 
 So what up? Talk to me. 
 It's looking good. I heard that before. 
 It's different this time. [SCOFFS] I heard that before, too. 
 I think some stuff is about to drop in court that can help your appeal. 
 But your firm don't know anything about me. 
 No. That doesn't matter. 
 There's damning stuff about Whitehead. And his use of drop guns. 
 You serious? Yeah. Call your lawyer. 
 Tell him to get to court and use what we're getting on the record. 
 Hey. 
 What do you think? Oh. 
 I think Solomon knows he has a losing case, and he wants to distract us as well as the jury. 
 He didn't have the facts on his side. Right. 
 So he wants us chasing our tails. 
 And here we are chasing our tails. 
 Yeah. Where you going? 
 Oh, uh, court. For what? 
 Oh, I... just... I promised someone. 
 Who? 
 Do you mind if I don't answer that? 
 It's really... it's not a big deal. [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 [GAVEL BANGS] 
 Thank you... for all, uh, joining me here today. 
 I'm Judge Trig Mullaney, a new appointee here. 
 And... 
 Oh, of course. Thank you. 
 Cleanup on aisle seven. 
 [SIGHS] I'm Judge, uh... I'm Judge Trig Mulla... 
 I'm Judge Trig Mullaney, a new appointee here, in new robes. 
 Uh, and I will be your judge today, and, uh, you will be... 
 ...my, um... 
 What should I call you? My arrestees. 
 [WHISPERS] You made it. Yeah. I said I would. 
 I think I'm f*cked. This guy's a Trump appointee. 
 All right, just follow my lead, and don't say anything radical. 
 Oh, like we need to assassinate the president? 
 No, don't even joke about that. 
 JUDGE: Let's just take this one thing at a time here. 
 Uh, you, at the... at the thing there. 
 The lectern, Your Honor. The lectern, yes. 
 You are with... Who are you with? 
 The Department of Justice. Of Justice, yes. 
 AUSA Monica Timmons. Good. Good. 
 And, uh, you... contestant number one. 
 Come on down. [CLEARS THROAT] 
 I am Diane Lockhart, representing Tully Nelson. 
 Okay. And what are the accusations? 
 The charges, Your Honor? Mr. Tully's charged with incitement to riot and resisting arrest. 
 Application for release on the defendant's own recognizance. 
 MONICA: Government opposes. 
 Okay. 
 [INAUDIBLE] 
 JUDGE: Thank you. Shh. That's fine. Shh. Thank you. 
 Thanks. I'm gonna need a moment to think on that. 
 Um... ponder it, you know. 
 Conjugate. 
 Your Honor, bail is customarily set, even in Class A felonies. 
 Yeah. Yep, well... 
 ...in my court, we do not follow, you know... customary things. 
 The court should know that we will be filing an interlocutory appeal on this ruling. 
 And that's not a good thing, unless bail is granted. 
 Your Honor, the government supports detention because the defendant is a flight risk. 
 The crime involved destruction of property. 
 [STIFLED LAUGH] At a post office. 
 It did, huh? Without bail, Your Honor, we will be asking you to honor the Daubert standard. 
 Your Honor, the Daubert standard has nothing to do... 
 Whether it's res judicata or stare decisis, there is no basis for imposing some draconian policy with regard to bail nunc pro tunc. 
 Your Honor, the defense is now just making up words. 
 Excuse me. You insult His Honor. 
 I think he knows the difference between a legal standard and a lawyerly trick. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 That was intense! 
 Listen, you need to get a permanent lawyer, Tully. 
 No, the way that played in there, you are my attorney. 
 No, I can't. 
 Listen, you can't say what you said in court. 
 Not even in jest. 
 Oh, you mean about assassinating the president. 
 Tully, don't. It was a joke, that's all. 
 But you know what's not? Something's gotta give. 
 Meaning? In the streets. 
 Oh, God. 
 I don't enjoy destroying things, but it's the only language some people understand. 
 It is fake news until someone bloodies their noses. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Tully, don't make me regret getting you out. 
 No. No. Diane. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 MAIA: What are you doing? [SIGHS] Failing. 
 [LAUGHS] Anything I can do? 
 I don't know. I think it's my problem. Boseman got me a raise. 
 My guess is if I'm not worth it, they'll take it back. 
 What are you looking for? 
 Something about our client and dog fights. 
 Try PETA. Look on their comment section. 
 They have a whole subcategory on dog fights. 
 Good idea. 
 Anything? No. 
 Maybe dog fights and Chicago PD? 
 MAIA: Hmm. 
 Huh. Got something. 
 Has anyone else seen this article about a Chicago cop with dog fights in his backyard? 
 Weird. No link, no response. 
 Well, you should respond. Ask where they saw it. 
 What? I think I'm about to be smart. 
 Hey. Hey. What do you need? 
 The jurors in the Rashid trial. You have the jury consultant's workup? 
 Yes. Why? Hello? 
 I'm just here to see Marissa being smart. 
 I think I know what's going on. Can I see the consultant's research? 
 [CHORUS HARMONIZING] 
 I Lalala, lala la, la la la laaa I Lalala, lala la, la la la laaa Uh, hello. Hey. 
 What are you doing? Uh, not sure yet. 
 I just got five new clients. Can you help me? 
 Of course. That pregnancy really working out for you. 
 Uh, more the father. They expect me to have some political clout with Colin. 
 Can you come in, like, an hour? Uh, sure. I'll be there. 
 Okay, we have a fan of NASCAR, juror number 11. 
 A movie poster collector, juror number five. 
 A Mensa member, a Stanford alum. 
 And we have one chef, New Orleans food. 
 A waitress. 
 Uh, a day trader. 
 An architectural student. 
 He's the one who went to Cornell. Okay. 
 And what is this? We're creating a Facebook profile. 
 With all the juror characteristics? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 To individualize our news feed. MARISSA: Day trader. 
 Okay, now his hobbies. Movie posters... 
 MAIA: Put down Cajun food. MARISSA: Right. Cajun food. 
 Okay, give me a name. 
 For what? Our profile. 
 Tiresias Barnes. 
 Who is that? Greek mythology. 
 She's the one who... Okay, no. Bored already. 
 Typing her in. 
 And... there's our news feed. 
 You are smart. 
 It's called microtargeting. 
 Sites like Facebook offer it to advertisers to refine their ad dollars. 
 It was weaponized by the Russians during the last election. 
 They could target their fake news articles towards smaller and smaller groups. 
 You're saying this was used against our jurors? 
 Yep, through their Facebook pages. 
 And they can really target just 12 people? 
 No, but they can target people with the same characteristics as the jurors. 
 MARISSA: Take juror number ten. 
 He's an African-American man living in Chicago. 
 There are 500,000 men who share those characteristics. 
 But he's also a fan of Brazilian soccer. 
 That narrows it down to 58,000. 
 He also subscribes to The New York Times. 
 That narrows it down to 1,489 men. 
 So, you keep refining it down and down to a group of 1,000 or so people, who you know will include your jurors. 
 How do we know this? How do we know this was done to our jurors? 
 We created the same profile. 
 We put in all the same characteristics as our jurors. 
 And here is an article that was pumped into our personal news feed. 
 "Police Investigate CPD Cop for Dog Fights." 
 Oh, my God. MARISSA: Yep. 
 It's an article that mentions Rashid and everything asked in court. 
 There's more. "Trial Ends in Hung Jury." 
 What's that about? 
 A murder case, but, uh, it mentions... Sorry. Thank you. 
 It mentions that the trial turned on the ballistics expert being accused of perjury. 
 Kurt. Yeah. 
 And none of this is true? MARISSA: None of it. 
 It's fake news. Can this be traced to the defense lawyer? MARISSA: No. It's all anonymous. 
 He can create a fictional news service with fictional articles, and we have no way to know who did it. 
 He's using those articles to undercut us. 
 So we show it to the judge. It doesn't matter if it's anonymous. 
 Clearly, Solomon is the one who benefits. 
 So, this is fake news? 
 It's more than fake news, Your Honor. It can lead to... 
 Where did you get your information, Mr. Waltzer? 
 The dog fight? It is not just the dog fights, Your Honor, it's also the accusations of perjury against our expert witness. 
 Again, Your Honor, I'd rather not talk over everybody. 
 Mr. Boseman, wait. Where did this come from? 
 I don't know, Your Honor. 
 Came from a paralegal, and he's since been dismissed. 
 [LAUGHS] This is bullshit. I mean... JUDGE: Stop. 
 So, what is your requested remedy, a mistrial? 
 No. The same tactic can be used against a new jury. 
 And you happen to like this jury? That has nothing to do with it. 
 Look, I can instruct the jury to, uh, ignore its Facebook feed... 
 ADRIAN: Which will have the exact opposite effect, Your Honor. 
 The first thing they'll do is go check their Facebook feeds. 
 So you want me to ignore this? No, we ask that you censure the defense for employing these tactics. These are not my tactics, Your Honor. 
 I must admit to being a bit of a luddite. 
 None of this Facebook business makes much sense to me. 
 Your Honor, one of the microtargeted articles reports that our firm was prosecuted for stealing money. 
 And that I was prosecuted for sexual harassment. 
 I understand your outrage, but we have no way to trace this back to the defense. 
 Then we ask that we be allowed to question an IT specialist on how microtargeting is used. I will instruct the jury to ignore any references to dog fights or perjury, but I will not bias them against Mr. Waltzer. 
 Now, can we please have the jury come in? 
 What about a mistrial? No. The jury likes the ballistics. 
 Let me try something. 
 Jay. 
 Solomon's acting like an old fool, but he's the one behind the microtargeting. 
 Yeah, I agree. What do you need? 
 He's doing it anonymously, so there's no way to trace it back to him. 
 Or to anybody. 
 And this is not something I can ask you to do, Jay. 
 I can only tell you... what I wished would happen. 
 I'm on it. 
 What are you doing? Typing. 
 Ah. Fictional news service. 
 Making fake news, are we? 
 So, are we writing something about Solomon Waltzer? 
 Caught with child p0rn or something? 
 We aren't doing anything. 
 Where are the juror rundowns? 
 Uh... right there. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Jay Dipersia's phone. 
 AUTOMATED VOICE: This is a collect call from Danville Correctional Center. 
 Will you accept the charges? Definitely. 
 CRAIG: Hey, Jay, it's me. 
 Actually, this is Marissa. I work with Jay. 
 Oh, hey, hey. 
 Could you tell him I called my lawyer, and he's sick, like, chemo sick. 
 I need to find a new lawyer fast. 
 I mean, like, today. Okay. Uh, here he is. 
 It's for you. Someone in prison. 
 Uh... 
 Okay. I'll see what I can do. 
 [EXHALES] 
 Who was that? Afriend. 
 He needs a lawyer? 
 Uh-huh. If only we knew some. 
 I'd rather have you not tell anyone. 
 Why? This is my thing. 
 Your friend is a thing? I've been pursuing this for a while. 
 The firm won't understand. Okay, but Maia and Lucca might. 
 If your friend needs a lawyer, Maia and Lucca could do it. 
 So you've been in for two years? Yes, for trafficking. 
 5,000 grams of marijuana with the intent to distribute. 
 It's a Class X felony. 
 But with the minimum, that would be three years. 
 Except with a firearm present. That's why he's serving 15 years. 
 Only problem is I didn't have a gun. 
 And you blame Detective Whitehead? Yeah. 
 That's why this accusation in the civil case is so important. 
 He's accused of using drop guns in other cases. 
 It's a civil case and it's just a charge at this point, so I'm not sure if that will help with the appeal. 
 We're putting Whitehead on the stand, right? 
 Yes. Let's get him under oath. 
 No, we can't be using our civil case to help with this criminal case. 
 That's how firms get into trouble. No. Both cases help each other. 
 Jay, you need to tell the partners that's why you brought Rashid's case to the firm. You have an agenda. 
 My agenda doesn't matter here. CRAIG: How many months pregnant? 
 Um, I'm seven months. 
 You look good. 
 My girlfriend was pregnant when I was sentenced. 
 I have a son now. Roy. 
 [SIGHS] Okay. 
 Look, we'll do the best we can. 
 We'll file an appeal and ask for the case to be reopened based on new information. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 So, we are going to have a trial at some point, right? 
 The defense is ready, Your Honor, and has been for some time. 
 Your Honor, we've been following these Facebook feeds targeted at our jurors. 
 Targeted, but not necessarily read. 
 Yes, but unfortunately, this new article we just found worries us. 
 JUDGE: Why is that? It's about you. 
 Really? [SCOFFS] So, what does it say? 
 It refers to you as a Muslim judge. 
 JUDGE: Well, I am a convert, so it has that right. 
 Well, the headline says, "Muslim Judge Makes Questionable Donation.” Really? What... what donation did I make? 
 $120,000 to ISIS. 
 SOLOMON: Your Honor, again, the defense has nothing to do with these fake news articles. 
 Microtargeting is a way to direct information and misinformation towards Facebook and other social media users. 
 So, it can use profiles provided in the jury selection? 
 MAN: That's right. It's very simple. 
 You can target a specific group, like... like you jurors, with fake news and ads. 
 Hmm. Fake news. 
 Like articles about the plaintiff conducting dog fights? 
 Exactly. And in this way, the whole world doesn't see the faked article, just the small group you want to target. 
 So, you microtargeted that article about the judge? 
 Oh, we thought you did. You know I didn't. 
 Of course, because you're too much of a luddite. 
 So, this is all-out war now? Alas, yes. 
 It was almost better when I thought you were senile. 
 Do not let me hear the wisdom of old men, but only of their folly. 
 Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession. 
 Marissa, what do you got? Where is... where is Jay? 
 I don't know. 
 I think I know where Solomon Waltzer's going next. 
 What do you mean, going next? 
 I've been following the microtargeted articles to see where the defense will go in their next attack. 
 And where is that? There are three articles questioning Kurt McVeigh's reputation. 
 Yup. They're going after our strengths. Ballistics. 
 Where is Kurt vulnerable? 
 1 don't know. What are the articles saying? 
 Um, maybe you should just read it. 
 No, you read it. 
 That he cheated on you. ADRIAN: Oh, Jesus. 
 He's turning it into a soap opera. 
 So we prep Kurt on all the questions. He's good on the stand. 
 You stay out of court. No. 
 Diane, the jury will be looking at you to see your reaction. 
 So? I won't react. 
 Can you not? 
 I can not. 
 You sure you're all right? 
 
 
 
 Cool as a cucumber. 
 Your Honor, we would like to call our first witness, but I must apologize. 
 We've had to replace our ballistics expert at the last minute. 
 Objection, Your Honor. Witness was not disclosed prior to trial. 
 Our expert witness was taken sick. It's merely a replacement. 
 I'll allow. Don't worry. You'll... you'll be given time to prepare. 
 Go ahead, Mr. Waltzer. We call Holly Westfall. 
 What? Yup. 
 We're deep in soap opera territory. 
 SOLOMON: According to the plaintiff's expert, Mr. McVeigh, the angle of the bullet that resulted in the plaintiff's injury was 15.6 degrees. 
 First of all, do you agree with that? No, unfortunately. 
 And do... 
 Why do you say unfortunately? 
 Well, because I have deep respect for Mr. McVeigh. 
 I just think he's wrong on this. SOLOMON: I see. 
 So, you don't think Rashid was lying on the ground in front of the warehouse when he was shot? 
 No. From my analysis, he was hit in the crossfire in the salvage yard warehouse earlier. 
 I see. Now, Ms. Westfall, you know Mr. McVeigh personally, is that correct? 
 Kurt McVeigh was my ballistics professor at one time. 
 And did he ever share with you his approach to persuading a jury? 
 Yes. He believes in taking the jury to the scene of the crime because it makes more of an impression. 
 It can also bolster your credibility as an expert and make it more likely that you can persuade them. 
 And did he tell you all this in the classroom? 
 No. SOLOMON: I see. 
 Where did he tell you this? Objection, Your Honor. Relevance? 
 It helps the jury gauge the value of the statement, Your Honor. 
 Overruled. 
 No, it wasn't in the classroom. 
 It was in a private setting. SOLOMON: What kind of a private setting? 
 Again, objection, Your Honor, as to relevance. 
 Ms. Westfall, you've been told to answer the question. 
 I had a relationship with Mr. McVeigh, and he shared this with me then. SOLOMON: In bed? 
 HOLLY: Your Honor, I would really prefer not... 
 It goes to Ms. Westfall's knowledge of Mr. McVeigh. 
 You are, uh... you're under oath, Ms. Westfall. 
 Yes, I believe it was in bed. 
 SOLOMON: You believe that Mr. McVeigh still has these same beliefs and concerns, though, isn't that right? 
 HOLLY: Yes. SOLOMON: And why is that? 
 Uh, because we've discussed cases since then. 
 SOLOMON: At ballistics conferences? HOLLY: No. 
 SOLOMON: Where then? 
 HOLLY: We still socialize. We get drinks sometimes. 
 SOLOMON: And you have no reason to believe that Mr. McVeigh would not tell you what he was thinking and feeling? 
 HOLLY: I've never known him to lie to me. 
 So, what can you tell us? 
 Nothing. Holly Westfall's really damaged your credibility. We need to damage hers. 
 I understand that. I'll offer testimony on ballistics. 
 That's what I do. 
 Nothing personal. 
 ADRIAN: Your relationship with Ms. Westfall can ruin this whole case. 
 That is personal. 
 Could you give us a minute? [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [SIGHS] 
 I need your help on this. 
 The jury was convinced by her. 
 I know. 
 We need something about her from your perspective. 
 I can't do that. Well, she did it. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 So you're loyal... 
 ..to her? 
 I wouldn't put it that way. No? Well, then to whom, then? 
 Not to my firm, not to my client. 
 Not to me. Hold on. 
 You don't kiss and tell? Is that it? 
 That would be disloyal? Diane. 
 Don't you f*cking come any closer to me! 
 I had a drink with her. Not another word. 
 Just hear me out. No. I will not be that wife. 
 Who said that? I don't want to hear a story about how she called or you ran into her... 
 1 did. ...or you didn't mention it because it didn't mean anything. It didn't. 
 You lied, Kurt! It wasn't like that. 
 I'm not that woman. 
 1 will not do this. 
 [CASH REGISTER DINGS] 
 Hey. I know you. 
 The funeral. Right. 
 Right. People were dying on you. 
 They still are. [SIGHS] Yeah. People disappoint. 
 What are you drinking? Oh, um, red wine. 
 California Cabernet? 
 Sure. Whatever. 
 Actually, I asked our partner, who hired you for... for that reception, where she found you. 
 That's why I'm here. Because I am just that charming. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] I can pay. 
 No, I do it for friends. 
 Hmm. And am I a friend? 
 Friend's advice? Don't get addicted? 
 No. Find more than one source. 
 [GROANS] You up? 
 Actually, yes. 
 Why the Beretta? 
 Oh, you know guns? 
 This is not a gun. It's a pistol. 
 And I know it's illegal to modify the milsurp magazine for a 92S. 
 [LAUGHS] You are a mess of contradictions. 
 Why are you carrying? Protection. 
 I don't like guns, but... these are dangerous times. 
 Tell me what you said in court was a joke. 
 Why? You don't believe in regime change? 
 You're discussing a crime with your lawyer. 
 No, no, no, no. I am discussing politics. 
 Violence is not politics. Oh? Really? 
 [TULLY SIGHS] 
 This won't slow us down. 
 MAIA: Excuse me, Mr. McVeigh? 
 Maia Rindell. Oh, yes, Diane's goddaughter. 
 Hello. How are you? Fine. 
 Thank you. I was wondering if I could get your help with a case I'm working on. 
 We think a gun was planted by a policeman... 
 Sorry, um, I've got a lot going on. I'd better give Diane her space right now. 
 She's not involved with this case. Well, I can recommend someone. 
 The policeman was Detective Whitehead. 
 We think he planted a gun on our client, turning a three-year drug sentence into 15. 
 We just need you to look at the file. 
 Mr. McVeigh? You're next. 
 Thank you for returning. You're welcome. 
 The plaintiff attorneys have already pointed out that you and Ms. Lockhart are married. Yes. 
 But, to be exact, the two of you are separated, is that right? 
 Yes. 
 And have you asked her to reconcile with you? 
 Objection. Relevance. 
 This is rebuttal testimony, Your Honor. 
 I never intended to venture into personal territory, but the plaintiff attorneys have opened the door to this relationship. 
 JUDGE: That is true. Overruled. 
 Did you ask Diane Lockhart to reconcile with you? 
 Yes. 
 More than once? Yes. 
 And why was that? 
 I don't understand the question. You injured your wife deeply and you wanted to make amends, is that correct? 
 Yes. I... 
 I hurt her. 
 SOLOMON: So did you buy her jewelry? 
 Come on. Objection, Your Honor. 
 SOLOMON: This is an expert witness, Your Honor. 
 Gifts between lawyers and witnesses are always subject to examination. 
 JUDGE: Cautiously overruled. 
 1 did not buy her jewelry, no. 
 Did you take her on a vacation? No. 
 But you apologized? Yes. 
 And yet she still did not reconcile? Asked and answered, Your Honor. 
 SOLOMON: You injured your wife deeply, and you wanted to make amends. 
 You wanted your wife to reconcile with you, but you didn't buy her perfume or jewelry or take her on a vacation. 
 What you did do was testify at this trial. 
 Objection! Counselor is not only testifying, Your Honor, he's also drawing the most absurd conclusions. 
 I don't need an answer, Your Honor. 
 I think it's obvious. 
 KURT: Could you hold that, please? [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Thanks. 
 Do I know you? 
 I don't think so. Huh. 
 You're a cop, right? No. 
 Ah. [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 You got that cop look. 
 Hi. Diane Lockhart, please. 
 Uh, Maia Rindell. [TYPING] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] TULLY: Hey. 
 It looks good with furniture. 
 Thanks. Oof. 
 A bit chilly. 
 I've been feeling a bit adrift these days. 
 And I'm trying to find some solid ground again. 
 Sounds smart. 
 I think that solid ground means not being with you. 
 That was quick. Did you find something? 
 Yeah, yeah, I think so. 
 This is Lucca. She's working on it, too. 
 Yeah, I know Lucca. Hi, Kurt. 
 This is the serial number of the Glock 17 that you said was planted on Craig Savador. 
 Mm-hmm. 376-88345. 
 Okay. 
 Now, there were no matches in the police database, but I found this. 
 Four Glock 17s recovered from the robbery of a sporting goods store a year earlier. 
 The police logged the sequential serial numbers: 
 88343, 88344, -and... 88346. 45 is missing. 
 That's right. 
 So whoever investigated this sporting goods robbery took it. 
 That's my theory. Whitehead. 
 He wasn't the investigator. 
 Then who? Rashid Clarkson. 
 Uh... what's going on? 
 I asked you in court if you knew Officer Whitehead. 
 You said no. 
 I hate it when clients lie to me. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I take it personally. I shouldn't, but I do. 
 A low-level drug dealer is doing a decade for possession of a Glock 17 handgun. You took it from a sporting goods robbery, but you left it off your evidence report. 
 The drug dealer said that the gun wasn't his. 
 That it was planted by the arresting officer, Whitehead. 
 ADRIAN: So how did Whitehead get the gun? 
 Could you explain that to me? ‘Cause from where I stand, I think your multimillion-dollar settlement is disappearing. 
 What does that mean? What does a nod mean? 
 We skimmed guns from busts. 
 You and Whitehead? RASHID: Yeah. 
 The weapons we seized were popular on the street. 
 They made the perfect drop gun. 
 We'd give 'em to officers who asked for one. 
 ADRIAN: Why did Whitehead shoot you? 
 RASHID: My guess is, he thought I was gonna turn on him. 
 Just wait, wait. We need to leave now. 
 Why? Oh, God, you're right. 
 Attorney-client privilege. We can't be listening to this. 
 Okay. Tell us everything. 
 What happens to my lawsuit? 
 If we're lucky, and you tell the truth, the whole truth... 
 ...maybe we can get a deal. 
 The great society. 
 I look out there and I see a world that could have been. 
 Diversity. Cooperation. 
 You did a lot to foster that, sir. 
 Feels like a dream. So long ago. 
 And maybe now this is the nightmare. Oh, indeed it is. 
 We made a discovery, Mr. Waltzer. 
 And we still think that Chicago PD should pay $8.3 million. 
 [CHUCKLES] No. 
 I didn't bring my reading glasses. You don't wear reading glasses. 
 JULIUS: Those are all the arrests Danny Whitehead made where he supposedly found guns on the arrestees. 
 Quite a few of them, as you can see. Yeah, okay. 
 We've come across some information that those guns were planted by Whitehead. 
 Really? 
 You've just come across? But how does that happen? 
 Our client, Rashid Clarkson, supplied Whitehead those drop guns. 
 JULIUS: We think there are 20 or 30 felons in prison because of Whitehead's testimony that they had guns on them. 
 And this came from your client? Yeah. 
 And due to attorney-client privilege, you can't use it? 
 Unless he allows us to. 
 So this is no longer about the law. This is a... this is a game of poker? 
 If you wish, but my guess is that Chicago PD would rather pay up instead of having 30 prosecutions reopened. 
 And here we are, four idealists casting lots over Jesus' garments. 
 If you wish. 
 I'll talk to my client. 
 And meanwhile, you can all go f*ck yourselves. 
 [DOOR OPENS, SLAMS] 
 Obviously, we feel awful. 
 Because we believe in your case, but now we have a conflict of interest. 
 You can't even tell me what the conflict is? 
 I'm afraid even explaining the conflict, that would breach legal ethics. 
 God, that sounded lame. Uh... 
 Craig, I'm sorry. We are so sorry. 
 We will help you find another lawyer. Sure. 
 Thanks. [LOCK BUZZES] 
 We can file a post-conviction petition based on actual innocence. 
 We can't, but someone else can. 
 Like who? Someone who doesn't work at our firm. 
 Like a public defender with no time and no resources? 
 We have no options. 
 This is stupid. This is... 
 Let's go. 
 [LOCK BUZZES] 
 We couldn't have gotten this settlement without Marissa kicking ass. 
 [CHEERING] 
 Hear, hear! Okay, okay. 
 Thank you, but I had a lot of help. ADRIAN: And Jay, too. 
 [MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] 
 Good job, Jay. [CHEERING] 
 Adrian, can I talk to you? 
 Oh. I'm in trouble. 
 Somebody call my lawyer. 
 And I'll tell you what. Don't drink up all my liquor. 
 [LAUGHS] Too late. 
 $8.3 million. 
 We haven't had that big a payday in a year. 
 You accepted the gag rule. 
 I... What? What? 
 Chicago PD's gag rule. 
 You agreed to it. No. 
 Attorney-client privilege. Rashid is our client. 
 That's our gag rule. 
 What's the matter, Jay? 
 My friend Craig has been rotting away in prison because of a bullshit gun charge Whitehead slapped on him. 
 Okay. This settlement f*cked him over. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We needed Rashid's statement about the planted gun. 
 Yeah, but we can't use that without getting our client's permission. 
 Then why didn't we try to get it? Because your friend's not my client, Jay, Rashid is. 
 And we have a duty to represent and protect him from risk. 
 Even if he's a dirty cop? 
 Rashid's morality wasn't on trial here. 
 This case was about an unarmed black undercover cop shot by a white cop... 
 No, this case was about two crooked cops who turned on each other. 
 And one of them got rich and the other one walked away scot-free. 
 And people like Craig rot in prison. 
 Jay, if your friend is innocent, we can pick that up without using Rashid's statement. 
 Now, it might take a little bit longer to get him out, but, hey... 
 But, hey, we can let Craig sit in prison so you can get rich. 
 You know how things work in these cases. 
 As your boss, I got to tell you, you're being childish and you're being unprofessional. 
 I'm not being unprofessional. I'm telling the truth. 
 Jay, I am sorry things didn't work out for your friend. 
 But what makes you think that you have the right to come up in my firm acting like this? 
 Because it's our firm, too! 
 The people who work here, who sacrifice their time, who put in the hours, who pour their heart out so that you can hustle some slick game! 
 Did you say hustle? Hustle? So I'm a hustler now? 
 If the shoe fits. Hey. Hey. If I'm a hustler, you are... you are an ignorant... What? 
 I'm an ignorant what? 
 Man, get the f*ck out of my office before I put my foot up your ass. 
 You're not even worth it. 
 I quit.
