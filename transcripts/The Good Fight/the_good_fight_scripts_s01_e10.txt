 [LOW CHATTER] 
 [+ ERIN MCKEOWN: "YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING" 
 [EXHALES] 
 I You were never broken by ordinary things... 
 Oh, we settled this. Expand or die, huh? 
 It's not about settling. Hi, Maia. Thanks for coming in early. 
 Have you been waiting long? No. Am I being fired? 
 Are you... What? MAIA: Nothing. 
 It's just you're both here at the same time. 
 No, this is our twice-yearly progress report on associates. 
 Phew. Oh, sorry. 
 We've solicited notes and criticism from the partners, and it's been pretty uniform. 
 Everyone thinks you're smart... OK. and we all know you have been distracted by the business with your family. 
 Yes. I'm sorry. I've... I tried not to let it get in the way. 
 But the report also points to a problematic area. 
 Boldness. BARBARA: Yes. 
 You need to assert yourself more, speak up. 
 I'm sorry. I want to... Maia. 
 That is your third apology in 30 seconds. Forget apologising. 
 Jump in. Don't hesitate. 
 Look, choose a partner, Diane, Thomas, and you follow them around. 
 All day. 24 hours. Learn from them. 
 And don't take no for an answer. Insist on following them around. OK? 
 OK, got it. 
 All right. Go kick some ass. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you think that worked? No. 
 Let's give her two weeks. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Lucca, thank you for coming in early. 
 No problem. This is the bi-yearly review? 
 Yes. 
 How did I do? You kicked ass. 
 You have the most billable hours. All of the partners praise your work. 
 ADRIAN: Lucca, we don't want to lose you. 
 We'd like to move you to a bigger office and put you on the partner track. 
 Seriously? Seriously. 
 They hate me. 
 No one hates you. Who? 
 The partners. My review. 
 Every associate gets a mediocre review. 
 No, they don't. What, did you? 
 It was mixed. 
 Any word from the FBI? 
 No, but my guess is they bury it. You're an afterthought in this scandal. 
 You'll represent me if I'm indicted? You will not be indicted. 
 Good to know. 
 Come by for dinner tonight. If I can. 
 [DOOR SLAMS] 
 I'm gonna miss that so much. 
 OK, first question. Which is most essential in a fixed surveillance? 
 Constant communication, long-term memory, patience, or agility? 
 Patience. Do you think they'd want two investigators here? 
 Nope. 
 Why not? Money. 
 Do you want to retire? Nope. 
 Then I'm coming after your job. Bring it. 
 [BEEP] 
 Diane Lockhart's office. We're here to serve. 
 Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on. 
 Kurt McVeigh is on the other line. I'll have to call him back. 
 My ten o'clock is here. Would you show them in? 
 Sure. I'm thinking of becoming an investigator here. 
 What? 
 I'm thinking of becoming an investigator here. Will you talk to Boseman? 
 Uh... no. 
 Uh... you talk to him and then I'll follow up. My new client? 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 Hi. Are you here for Diane? 
 I'm Diane's assistant, but I also sometimes work as an investigator. 
 Would you like to come back? Yes. 
 Can I get you anything? A garbage bag. 
 Actually, I was thinking more a glass of water. 
 Miss Lockhart, your ten o'clock. 
 Mr Stack? Yes, hi. 
 How are you, Diane? -I'mwell. I, um... 
 Please sit down. 
 Why, uh... didn't you give your name? 
 I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client. 
 I wanted to get a chance to argue my case. 
 That's crazy. Why wouldn't I want you as a client? 
 Oh, Bitcoin. I thought it was all a bit too "disruptive economy" for you. 
 Well, maybe for Lockhart/Gardner. But here you'll fit right in. 
 So, what's the case you want to argue? 
 I'm being set up. 
 For what? 
 Cyber-terrorism. 
 Well, that's certainly serious. Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Chicago is converting to a smart-grid power infrastructure, run on computers, and during the switch-over the system is vulnerable to a malware attack like Grizzly Steppe. 
 OK. I understood about five of those words. 
 Grizzly Steppe was a Russian hack on the Vermont power grid last year. 
 Don't ask me how I know that. 
 This code is identical. 
 It's been injected into ETB Energy and will cause a Chicago blackout in nine hours. 
 And why is it on your computer? I don't know. 
 I encrypt everything. I run all my Net contacts through eight, ten servers. 
 Nothing viral ends up on my hard drive and yet I woke up this morning and there it was. 
 Somebody put this code on my laptop and wants me to be arrested for cyber-terrorism. 
 How much are your retainers? 
 Um... for clients? It depends. 
 Hold that? 
 How's 90,0007? 
 What is he, a drug dealer? No, it's Bitcoin. 
 It's trading at $1,226. More than gold. 
 ADRIAN: And he wants us to do what? 
 This is the malware from his computer. 
 He wants us to offer the Feds a deal. 
 He will defuse the malware from the power grid if they offer him immunity. 
 And if they don't? 
 Well, he wants us to keep his identity confidential in case they don't. 
 Well, we are ethically bound to tell the authorities about this. 
 It's a crime that will happen at 7pm either way. 
 We need to talk to the DOJ. 
 Who do we trust over there? 
 Well, hello, Miss Quinn. Hello, Mr Morello. 
 I'm having a meeting in here. 
 It's been a while. You didn't call. 
 Oh, I didn't think I was supposed to. 
 Why not? 
 Hm. After a break-up, it's customary. 
 Was that a break-up? Was it not? 
 I... don't know. 
 Oh, hey, um... I found this. 
 I think I wore it home one night. 
 Oh, yeah, I've been looking for that. Thanks. 
 You keep it. 
 OK. 
 So, what do you need? 
 Well, hypothetically speaking, if we had a client who had knowledge of a crime being committed, tonight, let's say, and he wanted to help you prevent that crime, might there be a deal to immunise him? That would depend. 
 Is he responsible for the crime? No. 
 OK, what is the crime? An attack on the power grid. 
 Cyber-terrorism. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 And how does your client know about it? 
 He found this on his computer. 
 Who is the client? You understand I can't tell you. 
 He's worried he'll be prosecuted if you know. 
 But if you can make a deal... 
 OK. Can I take this? 
 DINCON: Come in! None of us want to go to trial. 
 But for us it's just about time and money. 
 For you, it's about a life sentence. 
 Important. 
 Look, I have another meeting but here's your bottom line. 
 Immediate surrender, 35 years. 
 35 years? Are you kidding? What happened to ten? 
 Ten was in trade for Mr Rindell's testimony. 
 We can't use it any more. This is bullshit. 
 Think about it, Henry. Madoff would have killed for 35 years. 
 This is an exploding deal. 12 hours and it's gone. 
 Henry. Henry, don't panic. 
 We can still talk them down. Just let me do my work. 
 [SIGHS] It's over, Rupert. They can't offer me a better deal. 
 Not after the backlash over the ten years. 
 We still have options. Don't lose hope. 
 Give me a minute, please. 
 [RINGS] 
 MAN: Yeah? 
 You told me to call if it ever got to that point. 
 I think it just got to that point. 
 So, who's this hacker? 
 The lawyer has been asked by the client not to say. 
 And who's this lawyer? Why? 
 Just trying to get as many facts as I can. 
 Look, if we don't want to make the deal, let's not do it. 
 I have to think about it. It's supposed to hit the power grid tonight? 
 Yes, around seven. 
 OK, tell her I'll get back to her. 
 Her? 
 Yeah. It's just a guess. 
 Doing great, guys. Doing great. 
 Diane, uh... do you have a second? 
 Sure. 
 Am I in danger here? 
 What do you mean? My review. 
 There was concern I'm not bold enough. 
 That's just constructive criticism. Everyone's getting it. 
 I spoke to Marissa today... 
 Oh, damn. I'm sorry, Maia, I forgot something. 
 Marissa! I forgot Kurt called. Could you return? 
 Yes, but there's someone on the line for you. I think it's important. 
 Who? Anurse at Harbor. Line six. 
 [PHONE BEEPS] Hello? 
 WOMAN: /s this Diane Lockhart? -ltis. 
 This is Nurse McRaney at Harbor Hospital. 
 You're listed as the next of kin to Mr Kurt McVeigh. 
 Yes. What's wrong? I need to speak to the next of Kin. 
 Yes, I am. I'm his wife. What's wrong? MAN: What about the patient in ICU? 
 MCRANEY: Move him down the hall and give him extra fluids. 
 Hello? I'm sorry. One second. 
 Don't forget to monitor the gunshot victim. 
 Oh, my God, please. Please. 
 MAN: Have you contacted anyone? MARISSA: What's wrong? 
 MCRANEY: Yes, I got ahold of his parents. 
 Sorry, ma'am. Your husband was in a car accident. 
 What happened? Where is he? 
 Harbor Hospital Emergency Room. He's going through surgery now. 
 How bad is it? 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Miss Lucca Quinn? Yes? 
 Would you accompany us, please? Why? 
 What are you doing? 
 We're detaining Miss Quinn as a material witness. 
 No, you're not. 
 Uh... actually, I don't know who you are. 
 But, yes, we are. 
 Hold on, Lucca. 
 She's gonna f*ck you up. 
 I can't go back to prison. I know. 
 You have it? 
 Yeah. 
 When? Tonight. 
 I'll come for you at eight. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Henry. 
 You can't say goodbye to anyone. 
 They can't know it's a goodbye. 
 Eight o'clock. 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Hello? HENRY: Hey. What are you doing? 
 Working, Dad. Can I call you back? Yeah. 
 Maia, I was hoping you could come by for dinner tonight. 
 I mean, I'll try. Things are pretty crazy here. 
 Well, it... it would mean a lot... to your mom. 
 HENRY: We're thinking of eating around 6:30. 
 OK, I might just be there for dessert. 
 Tell Mom, like, 8:30, 9:00. 
 Um... actually, uh... are you sure you can't come by earlier? 
 Uh... Dad, I mean, I'll try. 
 But, uh... look, I gotta go, OK? I'll call you back. 
 OK. 
 Be safe, please. OK. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 [SOBS] 
 [RAISED VOICES] 
 BARBARA: Wait! Wait! 
 Wait! We can argue this at another time. 
 The fact is, we took on the client, we have his retainer, and the goal should be to defend Lucca, yes? 
 ADRIAN: She's at the DOJ and it's Dincon himself. 
 BARBARA: Phil, call federal court, get us court time. 
 ADRIAN: Who was here when they took Lucca? 
 I was. 
 They want to know the identity of Diane's client. 
 OK. Lucca's friend screwed her. 
 I'll take court. I'll argue for a restraining order. 
 They're trying to pierce attorney-client privilege. 
 I'll talk to the client. Maybe he's willing to come forward. 
 Where is Diane, anyhow? 
 [MACHINES BEEPING] Sorry. 
 Uh... uh... Kurt McVeigh, please. 
 I'm, uh... I'm his wife. 
 [WOMAN OVER TANNOY] 
 Mrs McVeigh? 
 Oh, yes. 
 He's out of surgery. Is he OK? 
 The doctor just needs to run some tests but he should be fine. 
 Well, what happened? 
 There was an incident with a car, some kind of carjacking. 
 Excuse me. 
 [GROANS] 
 Diane? Oh! 
 What are you doing here? Oh, my God. They called me. 
 I'm... I'm your next of kin. 
 I told them, no. It's nothing. Where are you going? 
 I want to move around. No, this is serious. 
 I mean, my God, what happened? You were carjacked? 
 No, somebody else. I was knocked down. 
 Kurt, you're not 20 years old any more. 
 Get back into bed. Ah. 
 [GRUNTING] 
 You look so grumpy. 
 I had to delay my whole day. 
 What were you calling about, this morning? 
 What was I calling about? Yes, this morning. 
 I forget. No. No, you didn't. 
 Got hit in the head. 
 Kurt, I thought you were dead. 
 I'm not. 
 Don't do things that put you in the hospital, OK? 
 OK. 
 [PHONE CHIMES] 
 [PHONE CHIMES] Oh, God. 
 [SNIFFS] Sorry. 
 [SIGHS] I mean, it just never stops. 
 Yeah, she's very well, thank you. 
 What the hell? You undercut me, sir. 
 Get Judge Kassovitz back on. 
 An attorney came to me, asking for anonymity. 
 Your girlfriend? 
 Sir, this is serious. It makes my position here untenable. 
 You didn't tell me anything. I guessed that you were hiding your girlfriend. 
 Tell her that. I'm resigning. 
 Nope, you're being promoted to deputy. 
 That's what you always wanted anyway, right? 
 Your Honour, this all comes down to attorney-client privilege... 
 Your Honour, you know if I'm here, this is not a routine matter. 
 Uh... uh... why are you here, sir? 
 Because this is about cyber-terrorism. 
 No, this is about the Sixth Amendment. Oh, God. 
 They seized our attorney and are holding her until she names our client. 
 That is the definition of governmental overreach... 
 OK, OK, on the record, what relief are you seeking, counsellor? 
 A temporary restraining order forcing the Department of Justice to release Lucca Quinn. 
 And I'm granting such an order. 
 What? 
 Diane! 
 When the f*ck did that happen? DIANE: What happened? 
 We won the restraining order so now they're prosecuting Lucca. 
 For what? 
 And they got assigned Judge Kassovitz. 
 Yeah, the most conservative son of a bitch on the bench. 
 They're venue-shopping. Yeah. Uh... no, I'm coming in. 
 I'll be there in 15 minutes. 
 What's up? I'm tailing you. 
 Today is not a good day, Maia. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Uh... come on, come on, we'll do this tomorrow. 
 You told me not to take no for an answer. So, no, I'm coming. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Sure, sure. Why not? 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] 
 [WHISPERS] OK. 
 What are you doing? Oh. 
 Put some lights on in here. Ha. 
 You going out? To get my hair done. 
 Michael won't see me at the salon any more, but he does it at his home. 
 Hey, come here. 
 Come here. Come here. 
 Hm? 
 I'll bring home dinner. 
 I love you. 
 Hey, Lenny. 
 I'm glad I married you. 
 Me too. 
 Mm. 
 HENRY: OK, buddy. One last walk. 
 OK, Maia, watch what I do. Eye contact always. 
 Mm. Don't back down. Advance. 
 Don't ever, ever, ever retreat. 
 OK, where are we? 
 Everybody sit down. This is an urgent matter, yes? 
 Your Honour, we have a TRO from another judge's court. 
 That is the controlling interest... 
 No, we have four hours to stop a cyber-terrorism attack on our power grid. 
 ADRIAN: Which Lucca Quinn has nothing to do with, Your Honour. 
 That's not true. What? 
 What's not true? 
 We're charging Lucca Quinn as a co-conspirator in cyber-terrorism. 
 [DOG BARKS] [CROWS CAW] 
 Henry? 
 Oh, hey. Hey, Rupert. 
 What's up? We have to talk. 
 Sure, you start. The prosecutor called again. 
 He did offer you one trade for taking the 35 years. 
 [CHUCKLES] Yeah, what's that? 
 A nice view? 
 They have something on Maia. 
 She was offered a proffer. 
 She shared what she knew but they caught her in a lie. 
 She perjured herself. 
 [SIGHS] Well, why didn't they tell us that before? Why... 
 It just happened last week. 
 OK, what's the offer? 
 You take the 35 years, they won't prosecute her. 
 And how much could she get for perjury? 
 If they wanted to be tough... I think, given the popular will, they might. 
 Five years. 
 Hey, hey. 
 What do you want to do, Henry? 
 Look, I am not going away for 20 years, OK? I didn't do anything. 
 Then you won't go away. We're your lawyers. We will defend you. 
 But Lucca Quinn is being held as your co-conspirator. 
 But it's not in my interest to put my name forward. 
 The Feds didn't go for the immunity offer? They're looking for a scapegoat? 
 OK, so you didn't do it, right? 
 Fine. You have any idea who did? 
 My guess is it's someone on 4chan. 
 There's a group of us outsiders who joked about hacks on the infrastructure. 
 JAY: OK, so everybody is anonymous. 
 Right, so how do we find out who? 
 Who do you most suspect? 
 Well, the person I argued politics with the most was Edict776. 
 He kept trying to change the hacking talk from a joke to a reality. 
 You don't know his real name? No. 
 And if he's as smart as his hacks, he's buried his tracks pretty deeply. 
 Here he is. Edict776. 
 You keep saying "he". Maybe it's a "she". 
 Wow. That was surly. 
 I'll funnel his postings through this forensic software for grammar recognition. 
 OK, that's useless. Did this guy ever talk about posting on other sites? 
 Uh... if we could cross-reference it. Not to me. 
 Wait. 
 Go for Marissa. 
 Yeah, I'll send him. Diane wants to talk to you. 
 Oh. Keep me in touch. 
 Did you just make up that phone call? 
 I don't trust him, and it looked like you were on to something. Were you? 
 Yeah, a few screens back. What did he do to you? 
 He's this genius hacker, and he hasn't done what you're doing now? 
 I think you're smart and everything, but he hasn't run it through forensic software? 
 You are pretty good at this. 
 Yeah, I told you, I'm coming after your job. 
 So, what is it? 
 JAY: This posting from Edict776. Read it. 
 MARISSA: Sometimes I think we need a surgical holocaust. 
 Just kill the irritating... 
 We know him. 
 [PROTESTORS YELL] COP: Back up! Get back, get back! 
 MAN: f*ck the alt right! Don't let him speak! 
 This way. Through here. 
 He's the hacker? We think so. 
 Why wouldn't he talk to you two? I'm black. 
 I'm Jewish. Oh, dear God. 
 The alt right sucks! We don't want the alt right! 
 OK, this way. This way. PROTESTORS: No speech! No hate! 
 PROTESTORS: No speech! No hate! No speech! No hate! 
 No speech! No hate! No speech! No hate! 
 No speech! No hate! No speech! No hate! 
 No speech! No hate! 
 Mother. Did you come to hear my speech? 
 I don't think anyone's here to hear your speech. 
 I know. Isn't it great? All these people, so angry and excited. 
 I'm the best thing to ever happen to them, and they gotta pay me either way. 
 Are you Edict776? 
 Diane, where are the pleasantries? 
 I've been living a very full life lately. 
 So I've read. Your joke about dead children hasn't been going well for you. 
 Really? I think it's been going spectacularly. 
 I'm trending on Twitter ten days in a row. 
 How much have you been trending, the last few weeks? 
 [PROTESTORS CONTINUE CHANTING] 
 That's an odd attitude for someone who needs my help. 
 Is this hack yours? What, the hack on the power grid? 
 Diane, no. 
 I've been reading your posts on 4chan. It sure sounds like yours. 
 I'm a leader. I inspire. 
 But you do want this power grid to go down? 
 Who doesn't love a blackout? 
 You get to light candles, f*ck a stranger, loot an Apple Store, make Rahm Emanuel look like an arsehole. 
 So, this is about embarrassing the Democrats? 
 No. I mean, that's great too. But, no, it's... 
 [PROTESTORS CONTINUE] ...it's about disruption. 
 We love it in the tech world. Why not in the real one? 
 But, again, this is not my hack. 
 Yes, I encouraged someone, but legally I did nothing. 
 Who? Do you know his name? No. I know his handle. 
 Listen. 
 We need your help, Mr Staples. Diane. 
 There's nothing I'd rather do than help you, after all we've been through, but I... I have legal troubles of my own. 
 They occupy my days. They interrupt my nights. 
 What legal troubles? Where should I begin? 
 There were several speaking engagements cancelled. 
 I'd like you to sue them too. You know I can't sue all of them. 
 We'll prioritise. 
 You do realise you made a joke about school shootings? 
 Yes, but I didn't commit a school shooting, no matter how annoying my gender studies professors were. 
 There was nothing in those contracts about what I can say and what I can't. 
 All right. Let's move on to the next issue, my issue. 
 What is the screen name of the hacker? 
 Oh, him. MARISSA: Or her. 
 Or they. Tarr19. 
 All right, and you will go online and ask him or her to meet about the blackout tonight? 
 I might. No! One for you and one for me. 
 OK, the first for me is to sue my radio show. 
 Those bitches left me high and dry. 
 Now, I will get on it. Now, you get on it too. 
 You guys would make a great cop show, Mr Brown & Fran. 
 Thanks. [CHUCKLES] Good one. 
 Diane, did you get in touch with your husband? 
 No. I mean, yes. Why? 
 Did you see him on YouTube? No. What do you mean? 
 Very sexy video. You should look it up. 
 Your Honour, this is a trick to get around the restraining order. 
 We ask for immediate relief. I wish it were, Your Honour. 
 But Lucca Quinn is a co-conspirator and we ask that we be allowed to present testimony to support this contention. 
 How long is it gonna take? The witness is right here now. 
 Let's go. 
 DINCON: You had a meeting with Lucca Quinn, did you not, Mr AUSA? 
 1 did. 
 And what did she give you? Aflash drive. 
 Did it look like this? 
 It did. 
 And when we inserted this flash drive into our computers, what happened? 
 [CLEARS THROAT] It introduced the malware into our system. 
 Thus bypassing our firewall? 
 
 
 
 Yes, but Miss Quinn intended the... 
 Thank you, Mr AUSA. 
 Mr AUSA, let's really get down to it here. 
 Are you Miss Quinn's ex-lover? Objection, Your Honour. Relevance. 
 Goes to motive, Your Honour. Sure. 
 Go see what you can do with it. Objection overruled. 
 ADRIAN: Thank you. Are you her ex-lover? 
 Yes. 
 ADRIAN: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Yes. 
 ADRIAN: And did she break up with you? 
 I would guess it was mutual. 
 ADRIAN: You would guess? Since you're in a guessing mode, would you also guess that your whole testimony is an attempt by you to get back at the woman who broke up with you? 
 Objection! Seriously? 
 You're using my client's ex-lover to put her in jail and you're objecting... 
 Stop. ...to the fact that I'm establishing... 
 ...that his whole motivation is... Stop! 
 That's enough. You've done enough damage to the witness. 
 If you have any more questions, ask them. 
 No, Your Honour, but I would like an answer to my question. 
 Mr AUSA? 
 Would you like to lean in so you could hear me clearly? 
 I can hear you just fine. I'd like His Honour to hear you. 
 I'm telling you the truth. 
 Are you using us? E... excuse me? 
 I said, "Are you using us?" 
 They presented evidence that that flash drive he gave us was a Trojan Horse. 
 What? Yeah, it's infected. 
 And he used us to get it past the government firewall. 
 The malware needed to infect a DOJ computer, and you used us to do it. 
 No. No! Yes! 
 I don't believe you. It doesn't matter. I'm your client. 
 We're firing you. You can't, and I'm not firing you. 
 My firm. You're fired. Get your ass out! 
 [DIANE CLEARS THROAT] 
 Was, uh... that just an act? 
 [CHUCKLES] Little bit. 
 What do you think? 
 Even if it's true, we're stuck. Lucca's stuck. 
 Let me see if I can use Felix to get somewhere. 
 No, we're actually using Felix ourselves. You'll need to wait on that. 
 [PHONE RINGS] Ex... excuse me. 
 Maia, yeah, what's up? 
 We're back in session. What? They said an hour. 
 You joining us, Miss? 
 Uh... yes, Your Honour, one second. 
 They can't beat me so they're squeezing me out. 
 All right, look. You start with the rebuttal witness. 
 I'll be right there. Can you do that? 
 Yes, of course. Good. 
 You get angry and you focus. 
 Angry and you focus. All right? 
 I'm pissed. 
 I believe you. 
 Thank you for answering questions today, Mr Staple. 
 Actually, that's two staples, not one. It's like a high-end magazine. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Do you know that Miss Quinn is not a co-conspirator to this malware? 
 Yes, I do not. 
 You do not? 
 Yes, I do know that she is not. 
 Uh... and, uh... how do you know that? 
 Well, I... I feel that I can best illustrate the answer with a song. 
 Objection! I I don't know why it ain't Lucca... 
 You're not singing in my courtroom, sir. 
 MAIA: Mr Staples, are you in touch with the real hacker? lam. 
 Tell us how the hack was devised. 
 Just so we all understand, I am reporting what the hacker said. 
 I thought he was joking. 
 But the hack was devised in such a way as to trick an unwitting mule, such as Miss Quinn, into carrying it on a flash drive and injecting it into a governmental drive. 
 So, as far as you know, Miss Quinn is innocent? 
 As a foetus. Thank you. 
 What did you say about the Jews on 4chan? 
 Oh, come on. Your Honour, objection. Goes to bias, Your Honour. 
 It does not. Maybe it goes to Mr Dincon's bias, but not... 
 Excuse me. A bit more respect. MAIA: Why? 
 You're the one trying to slip something by His Honour. 
 You see his culture and religion and try to use that... 
 DINCON: I did not try to... 
 You're all out of order! I was simply satirising! 
 Shut up. Don't say another word. 
 DINCON: Your Honour, this joker is an anti-Semitic provocateur... 
 No, he is not, and... and this is just an amateurish attempt to try and undermine some damaging testimony. 
 What I find offensive is that you think the judge could be so easily manipulated. 
 She's right, Mr Dincon. Go sit down. 
 Your motion is sustained, Miss. 
 MAIA: Thank you, Your Honour. 
 Thank you, Maia. I didn't wanna push you. But I really wanted to see you. 
 You seem emotional. And you seem happy. 
 It was a good day. 
 My two favourite people. 
 Ah. Part of me wants to take a picture of this. 
 But the other part just wants to remember it. 
 Mm. Will you guys excuse me for a minute? 
 I have to return Rupert's call. I'll be right back. 
 LENORE: How was your day? 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 Rupert. 
 I'll take the deal, the, uh... 35 years. 
 I have one request. 
 I want tonight with my family. 
 I'll self-surrender later tonight but I want one last dinner. 
 [ORIENTAL MUSIC PLAYS] 
 This is awful. 
 I can feel the MSG seeping into my pores. 
 My guess is Tarr19 suggested it. 
 And he and I are supposed to be incognito? 
 The only two Aryans in a Chinese restaurant? 
 [WHISPERS] Unless he's Chinese. 
 OK, I'm leaving you and staying hidden. 
 Just keep him talking for a minute, until they intervene. 
 [WHISPERS] Who's "they"? 
 [BELL ON DOOR RINGS] 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [WHISPERS] God, I feel a certain chill. I feel dirty. 
 You'll get it past the firewalls in Los Angeles? 
 Damn right. But I think we should try Vegas. 
 Right? A blackout there. Celine clawing through the crowds. 
 No, the key is big financial centres. 
 Vegas is a big financial centre. No, not in a way that brings change. 
 You're a Bernie Bro? OK, we really don't need to go there. 
 We agree on the ends. 
 I supported Trump because I thought the world would be more fun. 
 You supported Trump because, what, it would bring on the revolution? 
 Who's the bigger asshole? Are we working together or not? 
 Probably not. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Yeah, sorry. Next time try someone trustworthy. 
 You wanna stand up so I can read you your rights, please? Come on. 
 You set me up? No. 
 We're your lawyers. We didn't know who would show up. 
 COLIN: Sir, you have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law... 
 So, you're representing me? Yes. 
 And I would suggest you remain silent. 
 [PEOPLE GASP] Oh. 
 There it is, right on time. 
 [HORNS HONK] [SIREN WAILS] 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 MAN: Attention. Please stay calm and look for the emergency exit signs. 
 Do not run. Walk slowly and carefully. 
 We'll take it from here, Sal. 
 Here's your cell. Go home. 
 What happened? We caught the real hacker. 
 A little late. 
 Take care. 
 Colin. 
 Yeah? 
 I know it wasn't you that did this. 
 Be careful out there, Lucca. 
 It's nuts. 
 [+ JOANNA WANG: "WILD WORLD" 
 It's beautiful, isn't it? Oh, I love this city. 
 Sometimes it just feels like the Eighth Wonder, you know? 
 [ADRIAN SIGHS] 
 Heard you did well. Yeah. Lucca's free. 
 And you did well too. Hm. 
 [SIREN WAILS] 
 There's a whole lot of people who wanna see this country fail, Diane. 
 You talking about our clients? Not just. 
 It's a grim time out there. 
 And weird. Hm. 
 It feels like something's come detached. 
 You know, like a piece of machinery that doesn't sound right. 
 So, what do we do? The same thing we're doing. 
 The only constant is the law. 
 Everybody running around out there, doing God knows what. 
 The only constant we have is the law. 
 I'm glad I'm here, Adrian. 
 I'm glad you're here too, Diane. 
 I Now that I've lost everything to you I You say you wanna start something new... 
 [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] 
 She was very good. 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 That must be... Rupert. LENORE: Rupert. 
 [CHUCKLING] I'll get it. 
 [PHONE RINGS] Thank you, Maia. 
 For what? Not judging us, not judging me. 
 Do you love Dad? [EXHALES] 
 We had troubles and, um... we never wanted to bother you with them, but, um... 
 ...yes, I love your dad. 
 This will be a hard time. 
 The trial? 
 No. 
 Your father's agreed to a 35-year plea. 
 What? 
 When? 
 Tonight. That's why he called you to come home. 
 HENRY: Got it. I'll be outside in two minutes. 
 Dad, no, you need to fight this. What are you doing? 
 Please, Maia. I can't. 
 You can. They're acting tough but what do they have? 
 I saw the evidence. What evidence? 
 Dad, I spent today thinking I was overwhelmed by evidence, but with a good argument, you... I'm guilty. 
 [SOBS] 
 1 did it. 
 No, Jax did. Yes. 
 And I did it too. 
 And your mom. 
 And everyone. 
 Everyone knew. 
 We paid off the SEC. 
 We paid off anyone who got suspicious. 
 [HORN HONKS] 
 That's Rupert. 
 [SOBS] 
 lam so... 
 ...sorry to disappoint you. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, you never could. 
 [WHISPERS] I love you. 
 [ENGINE RUNNING] 
 You ready? Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 So, you're a hero. 
 I saw it. The video. 
 Look, let's... let's not. What? 
 I was talking to you like you were eight years old, and you're... 
 ...you're Sully or something. Diane. Please. 
 I don't like it when people make a big deal. 
 Oh. 
 I represent unscrupulous people. 
 And you, you save children. 
 You... 
 I was calling you to ask you to dinner. 
 [CAR DOORS OPEN AND SHUT] 
 Are you sure you'll be all right? Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Come in. Stay the night. Don't drive back to the city. 
 [+ JOANNA WANG: "WILD WORLD" 
 I love you. 
 I was so hurt. I know. 
 It won't happen again. 
 Stay. I'll light a fire.

 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 My convict! My lawyer! 
 You f*cking killed it in court. Aw, thank you. 
 Wow, it looks like a soft-porn movie in here. 
 Well, I do my best. 
 Where's Amy? 
 She's on her way home. We'll have to eat cold mac and cheese. 
 I love cold mac and cheese. Oh, good. 
 You still worried about your job? Meh. I'm always worried. 
 It was crazy coming here, like a street party. 
 Yeah, yeah, I kinda liked it, though. 
 Yeah. Mm. 
 To a weird three months. 
 Yes. Hm. 
 Mm. Mm, this is what I think. 
 You wanna hear? Yeah. 
 I think for every weird three months, there are three normal months. 
 I mean, the world has to live in balance. Right? 
 So, I mean, my guess is, the next three months will be boring. 
 To boring. 
 Was everything OK with Colin? 
 Not really. 
 But to boring. Right? 
 OK. 
 Mm. 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] Mm. 
 Amy forgot her keys again. 
 Uh... Maia. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Dinner is going to be cold! 
 Maia Rindell? Come on. We finished. 
 No. Your dad fled. 
 You're under arrest.
