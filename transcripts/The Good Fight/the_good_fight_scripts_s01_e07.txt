 [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 
 COLIN: Reddick/Boseman took an $800,000 bribe from a client. 
 It might be in trouble. 
 I don't want you to get in trouble. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 What's wrong? 
 Colin Morello was just in my office, warning me to stay away from the firm's finances because... we took an $800,000 bribe. 
 That's what I told my dad. 
 I know. 
 Look, I know your first instinct would be to call him, but for the firm... We need to tell the partners. 
 I'm Mike Kresteva, head of the DOJ task force, and... 
 I'm Spencer Zschau, Assistant United States Attorney. 
 This firm is responsible for several major crimes, but we're gonna start by focussing on just two of them, bribery and tax evasion. 
 One of the named partners in the firm, Adrian Boseman, accepted an $800,000 bribe to help a client evade taxes. 
 Now, remember the burden of proof on a grand jury is low. 
 Your job is merely to indict, not to convict. 
 So please keep in mind you don't need to believe beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 You only need to believe that the accused could have committed a crime. 
 Miss Tascioni, this is an order from a federal magistrate compelling you to assist in our investigation. 
 Mike. Hi. 
 Well, come on in. 
 Oh, sorry, I don't have enough... chairs. 
 Are you here to arrest me? 
 No. We're here to confiscate that. 
 Ada, erase history. Purge all files. 
 Understood. Activating. 
 Congratulations, you just tampered with evidence. 
 The Purge is a horror/sci-fi thriller premiering in 2013, starring Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. 
 ELSBETH: Ada, no! Cancel! 
 As the independent observer, this conversation is determined to be "not privileged.” 
 [ELSBETH CONTINUES SHOUTING] You're enjoying this. 
 No, I'm working with you. I want you to succeed. 
 ELSBETH: What were you asking about Kresteva? Okay... 
 What? ELSBETH: Yeah. 
 Listen. 
 ELSBETH: [PLAYS LOUDER] But yes, this problem should be an easy fix. 
 Just back-date receipts. 
 The important thing is that Kresteva believes Travis exists. 
 Just tell me what this is about. 
 Sit down. What's going on? 
 I gave you everything you needed. 
 Are you working with them? 
 Am I working with them? Who's them? Reddick/Boseman defence team. 
 Are you helping your daughter feed us false information? 
 No. What are you talking about? Travis Leopold. There was no bribe. 
 He doesn't exist. 
 MIKE: Ms. Tascioni admitted it on her Ada device. 
 Here are the two options. 
 Either you're working with them, or your daughter knew you were wearing a wire and misled you. 
 I have to see her. 
 MIKE: No. She can see you in prison. 
 We're having your bail revoked. Wait, wait, wait. 
 Let me find out what happened. [MIKE CHUCKLES] 
 I can't trust you. Please. 
 I just need to talk to her. 
 You'll record it? 
 AMY: Hi. Hi. 
 Do we have company? Oh, yes. 
 Your dad's here. He's in the bathroom. Here. 
 What's this? Rum and coke. 
 How long has he been here? 
 15 minutes. Mm. 
 What have you guys been speaking ab... 
 sh1t. What? What's wrong? 
 Uh, will you keep him occupied? 
 Okay. 
 Henry... are you sure you don't want a drink? 
 HENRY: No, I don't think it's a good idea with my bail. 
 Maia. How are you? 
 Dad. Good. 
 Uh, will you give me a sec? 
 Your apartment looks beautiful, Amy. 
 Thank you. 
 We may have to move in a month or two. 
 Oh, why's that? 
 Money, Dad. 
 Oh. I'm sorry. 
 Why don't I let you two talk. 
 Good to see you, Amy. You, too, Henry. 
 We should talk. 
 We did. 
 Yes. But once more. 
 Tell me when we're being honest, Dad, and I'll be sure to switch over. 
 You didn't trust me. 
 You told me a lie last time. There was no bribery at your firm. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God! 
 This is a farce, Dad. 
 You were wearing a wire. 
 If I told you a lie, there was a reason. 
 Talk to me like I'm your daughter, okay? 
 I am right here. 
 It's not what you think. 
 Why isn't it? 
 [BEEPS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 [PHONE BEEPS] Okay. 
 Here we are. 
 I'm not doing this to save my skin. 
 They're coming after you. For what? 
 The foundation. Your signature on the transferred funds. 
 They were forged. 
 Honey, I don't think they'll believe that. 
 You say you were recording our conversations and using them against my law firm out of some clear concern for me? 
 Yes. The Feds are threatening to prosecute you. 
 They're lying. No, they're not. 
 Oh, my God, then don't f*cking use me to clear your conscience, Dad. 
 You want to make a deal for yourself, do it. 
 Don't do it for me. 
 They discovered the lie on your lawyer's recording. 
 They found out the bribery was made up. 
 Why do I trust you, Dad? 
 Because in, um, in ten minutes, your partners will be subpoenaed. 
 Tomorrow they'll be dragged in front of the grand jury. 
 Kresteva doesn't care about a conviction. 
 All he wants is an indictment to destroy your firm. 
 WOMAN: There are five essential French sauces. 
 If you are to learn French cuisine, these are foundational. 
 Now, that is a beautiful velouté, Adrian. 
 Ah, merci. 
 Everyone, come and look at Adrian's work here. 
 [CHUCKLES] This is what you want to imitate. 
 Mr. Boseman. Oui. 
 You've been served. 
 BARBARA: I'm glad you called me. 
 I was thinking about college just yesterday. 
 How we were gonna rule the world... Which you basically did, didn't you? 
 [CHUCKLES] MAN: Hi. 
 Mm. Hi. Are there any specials? 
 I don't know. I didn't see the board. I'm not your waiter. 
 Barbara Kolstad, you've been served. 
 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [NO AUDIO] 
 Eight partners subpoenaed, four associates. 
 BARBARA: He's got nothing on us. 
 He has no case. He doesn't need one, Barbara. 
 He'll still drag us in front of the grand jury, scream "RICO." 
 He gets his indictment no matter what. ELSBETH: I agree. 
 You do? Yes. 
 Grand juries always indict. 
 Unless it's a police brutality case. 
 And then there's the additional problem that Kresteva no longer believes our bribery story. 
 So what do we do? 
 Well, he doesn't want a conviction. 
 I like those earrings. 
 Especially the shape. Thanks? 
 I wish I could wear earrings like that, but they make my face droopy. 
 Elsbeth. Right. Sorry. You're amazing. 
 Um, he wants to bankrupt you. 
 ADRIAN: Right. I got a call from the Paisley Group. 
 There was a federal agent over there yesterday asking questions about us. 
 BARBARA: He's trying to scare off our clients. 
 What? 
 What? No, you. What? 
 You were about to say something. No, I just... 
 I'm not sure if this helps, but Kresteva's boss, the assistant attorney general, was concerned that the investigation was seeming... racist. 
 How do you know that? 
 I... I just know. 
 ELSBETH: That's a possibility. 
 What's a possibility? 
 Uh, well, I don't want to say it. 
 We're an African-American firm being persecuted by a majority white department? 
 You want us to turn our answers toward race? 
 Yes. 
 The only way to prevent an indictment is to close down the grand jury. 
 And the only way to close down the grand jury is to convince Wilbur Dincon, the assistant attorney general, it's not in his interest. 
 The only way to convince him it's not in his interest is to turn our answers toward race. 
 Yep. We have an audience of one: Wilbur Dincon. 
 ADRIAN: Barbara, what do you think? 
 About using race? 
 Well, it is about race. 
 Adrian Boseman. 
 I'm an attorney with the firm of Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad, the largest African-American firm in the Midwest. 
 Named by American Lawyer as one of the top ten black firms in the country. 
 You finished? 
 Yeah. 
 Mr. Boseman, how long have you practised law in Chicago? 
 35 years. 
 I was sworn in by Mayor Harold Washington, the city's first and, so far, only black mayor. 
 I actually keep a photograph of him in my pocket just to... 
 ...remind me of the struggles of black people who've come before and... 
 ...paved the way for me. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Would you agree that suing the Chicago Police Department has been a major income stream for your firm? 
 I agree that our firm, as a majority-owned African-American firm... 
 Ma'am, I didn't ask about your racial makeup. 
 Yes, but you did ask me to answer in my own words, and these are my own words. 
 Please, continue. Thank you. 
 As I said, there's no mistaking that, as an African-American owned firm... 
 COLIN: “...certain victims feel more comfortable coming to us than to a majority Caucasian firm." 
 "Question: Again, this is not about race, ma'am." 
 "Answer: You asked for context, sir, and the context involves the racial makeup of our firm." 
 What the hell is going on? You were supposed to stay away from race. 
 We are. We're not the ones taking it there, they are. 
 I don't care who is. 
 It's looking like a persecution. It's a tactic. 
 Well, then, go around it. 
 You need to make it clear that this is not about race. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [SPEAKS ITALIAN] 
 [CONTINUES SPEAKING ITALIAN] 
 What's that? 
 Italian. Why? 
 I always wanted to learn Italian. 
 You are an odd child. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 "In my next life, I want to come back as a shark.” 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Great. Makes sense to me. 
 Hi. 
 Marissa Gold, right? No. 
 [SPEAKS ITALIAN] 
 [SPEAKS ITALIAN] 
 ADRIAN: So, he's pivoting? 
 ELSBETH: Exactly. No more black lawyers. 
 Now, he's going after you three. For what? 
 I don't know. We'll find out soon enough. 
 We're scheduled for the grand jury tomorrow. 
 And the good news, we have an audience. 
 Yep. Wilbur Dincon is paying attention. 
 So, how do we exploit that? ELSBETH: Well, let's think. 
 Let's... 
 We don't want a grand jury to connect the dots. 
 We won't get a conviction unless the facts hold up. 
 Let's worry about this later. Grand juries work off of emotion. 
 First, we need an indictment. 
 Well, we need an indictment based on facts. 
 Uh, hello? 
 Hi. Hi. Do you need something? 
 Do you know how much I make for every subpoena I deliver? 
 No idea, but I'm sure you can talk to the sheriff's office about this. 
 $47. Great. Good to know. 
 And this has been a really good 48 hours. 
 You've been served. 
 [HUMMING] 
 Mike, how are you? You're back. 
 Hello, Miss Tascioni. 
 You have bitten off way more than you can chew. 
 Really? I can chew a lot. 
 You're suing me in civil court? 
 Yes, for tortious interference with contractual relations. 
 I thought that was clever. You don't believe it? 
 I believe it the same way you do your grand jury. 
 No court will allow you to sue me at the same time that you're being prosecuted. 
 Maybe you're right, Mike. 
 Hmm. Do you want a fig bar? 
 No. 
 Maybe you're right that no court will allow my suit to go forward, but you could've told me that on the phone. Instead, you came over here. 
 And you're welcome anytime. 
 I'll see you in court. Both courts. 
 We'll see which one finishes first. 
 Putting something on top of the pile is a great way to get me to move it to the bottom. 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] I don't think Mr. Boseman would like that. 
 What is this? No idea. 
 It's something regarding the Rindell Ponzi scheme. 
 Well, these are Fortune 500 names. Not all of them, but some. 
 But look at these numbers here, nine digit numbers. What are they? 
 No idea. Social Security numbers? No, I checked. 
 Okay. 
 My curiosity is whetted. 
 Me, too. I like mysteries. 
 Could you find out how this list might come back to hurt this firm? 
 Are we sure it will? Oh, yes. 
 Mr. Kresteva worked too hard to get it. 
 Okay. I'll take a look. 
 Thank you. 
 COLIN: You're kidding? WILBUR: No. I'm putting you in, kid. 
 Sir, please. It's not... [SIGHS] I hate him. 
 Oh, I see. 
 Are you under the mistaken impression that you only defend people you like? 
 No, I'm under the mistaken impression I don't defend anyone. I'm a prosecutor. 
 Well, when you get this tortious interference nonsense dismissed, you can go back to prosecuting. 
 Sir. [SIGHS] 
 I have to... apprise you of a conflict of interest. 
 And what's that? 
 I'm dating one of the lawyers at the plaintiff's firm. 
 I see. 
 That's not good. Yeah, I'm, uh... 
 ...not sure that I could be... objective. 
 I agree. Stop dating her. 
 Then you can be. 
 You're late for court. 
 Jesus Christ, where is everybody? It's 10am. Am I right? 
 You are right, Your Honour. The plaintiffs are ready. 
 Good for you. Stop kissing my ass. Where's the defence? 
 I'm here, Your Honour. You're late. You had me waiting. 
 My apologies, Your Honour. I was just assigned this case. 
 I don't give a sh1t. We start at 10:00, you're here at 10:00. 
 What do we have today? Tortious interference. 
 Yes, Your Honour. This law firm... We ask for an motion to dismiss. 
 Hey, hey, hey! Stop it. You first, Mr. Late. 
 Uh, the defence moves to dismiss. 
 Mr. Kresteva is in the middle of an active grand jury investigation. 
 Initiating these proceedings is a cynical attempt to interfere with that. 
 Vehemently disagree. Adrian. 
 Good morning, Your Honour. Mr. Kresteva's grand jury investigation... 
 Objection, Your Honour. Is he the lawyer or the plaintiff? 
 The plaintiff. 
 Then, he shouldn't be arguing in court. He should be called as a witness. 
 Oh. Then, I'd like to call Mr. Adrian Boseman as a witness. 
 No, excuse me, no. No. 
 Uh... uh, Your Honour, you never heard on my motion to dismiss. 
 Yeah, but you just told them to put him on the stand. 
 I said he shouldn't be arguing in court. Defence is using this civil action... 
 "The plaintiff"? Is that the word you're looking for? 
 COLIN: Yes. [CLEARS THROAT] The plaintiff... is using this civil action as a poor man's discovery. 
 Uh... They don't have access to our grand jury room, so they are using this court as a way to find out... 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 ...what's going on in the grand jury room. 
 Is that what you were doing, Counselor? 
 No, Your Honour. 
 I wish I were that smart. [FORCED CHUCKLE] 
 Good idea. 
 JUDGE: Okay, overruled, call your witness. 
 Elsbeth. 
 Make me your second chair. Why? 
 Because it's a good idea. 
 Mr. Boseman, why are you suing for tortious interference? 
 ADRIAN: We're losing clients. Three clients in the past two weeks. 
 Why is it important that this case be heard now? 
 Because this grand jury is the reason we're losing clients. 
 Mr. Kresteva doesn't want a conviction. 
 He wants our bankruptcy. Objection. Speculation. 
 Uh, that's a proper objection for a question, not for a response. 
 If Mr. Morello has a rebuttal witness, he should present him. 
 I would agree. Overruled. 
 Mr. Boseman, did any of your clients explain why they were leaving? 
 Yes. 
 The Paisley Group said federal agents came to their workplace questioning them about our work. 
 They didn't want the hassle. 
 And you think this was an intentional move on Mr. Kresteva's part? 
 Objection. Absolutely. 
 This time calls for speculation. 
 Look at you, making a proper objection. Sustained. 
 Nothing further, Your Honour. Your witness, Mr. Morello. 
 Thank you, Ms. Quinn. 
 These three clients you lost, how important were they to your bottom line? 
 Every client is important. 
 Hmm. That sounds like not very important. 
 Objection. Lamely argumentative. 
 Yeah, no, it sounded that way to me, too. 
 How much money a year do you lose from losing these three clients? 
 I guess $1.3 million. 
 But that's why we need to stop this leakage now, Your Honour. 
 And didn't you just sign Chumhum, a massive social media empire worth $86 million a year to you? 
 ADRIAN: Yes, we did. So... 
 ...$1.3 million versus $86 million. 
 Those two things are not connected. Whah-whah-whah-whah. 
 Don't cry poverty in here! Oh, we're not crying poverty. 
 Ms. Quinn wants to avoid oversight... We're saying that the DOJ... 
 ...by officials and every time... ...is intentionally trying... 
 [WHISTLES] 
 No, no, no. Both of you, back in your seats. 
 Decorum. 
 That's what I insist on. 
 My apologies, Your Honour. 
 May I ask a quick question? 
 You may, quietly. 
 Why is the defendant not here? 
 I see that the defence sent its lawyer, but does the defendant think so little of this court that he only sends his lawyer? 
 [CLEARS THROAT] I believe the plaintiff's lawyer knows the reason. 
 The defendant is busy running a grand jury room. 
 I see. So, Mr. Kresteva is too busy for Judge Gallo? 
 Did you explain that I'm conducting a grand jury? 
 1 did. It's Judge Gallo. He doesn't like being dissed. 
 Dear God. Okay, when? 
 This afternoon. 
 This is playing right into their hands, you know that. 
 I sure do. 
 SPENCER: So, Ms. Gold, what is your relationship with Diane Lockhart? 
 She's my boss. Also, I consider her my mentor. 
 Really? What does she mentor you in? 
 Well, since coming to work at an African-American firm, I'd say it's becoming aware of the nature of white privilege. 
 And you worked with Ms. Lockhart at her previous firm, did you not? 
 1 did, but that was definitely not an African-American firm. 
 It was like the Trump White House there. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Ms. Gold, we're not asking about the racial makeup of the firm. 
 Oh, sorry. Touchy. 
 SPENCER: You were aware, were you not, that Ms. Lockhart had frequent meetings and phone calls with Adrian Boseman prior to going over to his firm? 
 Absolutely. 
 Mr. Boseman's firm was representing a young, African-American man who had been pretty severely beaten by a white police officer... 
 Again, this is not about race, ma'am. 
 I agree, but you guys keep asking me about race. 
 Isn't it true that Ms. Lockhart slipped privileged information to Mr. Boseman about this case? 
 You mean the case about this African-American kid being beaten up by the white cops? 
 I'm sorry, but you asked the question. 
 Hey, Diane. I think it went great. Uh, yeah. 
 Okay, I'm on my way back. Mm-hmm. 
 [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
 It's Andrew Hart. DIANE: What does he have on us? 
 Why is Kresteva calling him to testify? 
 Did you see him with anybody else? No, he was alone. 
 We need to find out what he said to the grand jury about our firm. 
 How do we do that? 
 What did you say to the grand jury about the plaintiff's firm? 
 Objection. Grand jury proceedings are under seal and cannot be made public, no matter how clever Ms. Tascioni thinks she is. Sustained. 
 That's sweet, complimenting me for being clever. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice to see you, Mr. Kresteva. Oh, how's Diedre? 
 Oh, she's fine. 
 Uh, hello? Civil court. Taxpayers' money being spent. 
 Yes, sorry. 
 Is it fair to say that in an effort to gain some competitive advantage, you sought to have Adrian Boseman disbarred? 
 Is it fair? No, it's not fair. 
 I see. Uh-huh. 
 Well, is it fair to say that you tried calling Reddick/Boseman clients to steal them away? 
 No, that's not fair, either. 
 Not even a little bit? Objection, Your Honour. 
 This is a fishing expedition. 
 Yes? 
 It's... [CLEARS THROAT] what I said. 
 Ms. Tascioni, where is this going? 
 I just have a few more questions. Uh-huh. 
 Did you ever meet with Reddick/Boseman clients in order to steal them away? Is that fair? 
 I have not done anything illegal. 
 ELSBETH: That's not my question. 
 Did you ever meet with Reddick/Boseman clients with the direct intent of stealing them? 
 I did what any business would do. Which client, Mr. Hart? 
 Objection. Relevance. 
 They're just trying to establish that the witness is feeding negative info to the grand jury, so he can steal their clients. 
 Exactly, Your Honour. 
 Ma'am, you're an acquired taste, and I don't think I've acquired it yet, so... shh. 
 Please answer the question. 
 I met for lunch with a Mr. Spiegel, who owns a string of department stores. 
 Get to Spiegel. 
 Hart's trying to poach him. 
 Are you in a pissy mood? No. 
 Then come by tonight. 
 I've been told to break up with you. 
 [CHUCKLES] You've been told? 
 Really? 
 Then you'd better do it. 
 You're going to get fired. 
 Mm, I hate my job, anyway. 
 Mr. Spiegel, how are you? Good. 
 I hope since you called me I'm not getting billed for this. 
 [CHUCKLES] Meter's off. 
 We're sitting down with some of our clients this week. 
 We just want to make sure we're not missing anything, their needs are being met... And no one's jumping ship? 
 [SIGHS] 
 There's a smear campaign against our firm, Anthony. 
 I want to set the record straight. 
 You want to know who's been whispering in my ear. 
 If I were to guess, I'd say lately it's coming from Andy Hart. 
 You'd be right. 
 Mind telling me what he said? 
 He warned me that Reddick/Boseman was in the path of a major storm, and that I would be wise to seek other representation. 
 Did he say anything about a grand jury having been impanelled? 
 Objection. 
 Your Honour, I'm not asking about the content of the grand jury proceeding. 
 All I want to know is, did Mr. Hart use the fact that he testified before the grand jury to steal Reddick/Boseman clients? 
 Objection as to stealing. 
 Can I get out one statement without an objection? 
 Sure, just don't use loaded words like "stealing." 
 Okay, which one of your objections would you like me to rule on first, Counselor? 
 The fir... uh, the second. 
 Overruled. Would you like to hear about the first one now? 
 Overruled. 
 Sir, did Mr. Hart mention his testimony? 
 No. JUDGE: Thank you. 
 Because he hadn't testified yet. 
 Uh, when was it that you met with Mr. Hart? 
 
 
 
 Two weeks ago. 
 And did he mention that a grand jury would be impanelled? 
 As I recall, it was the centerpiece of his presentation. 
 I'd direct the court's attention to the fact [PHONE VIBRATES] that this would've been before anyone outside of Mr. Kresteva's office would have known about a grand jury. 
 Is Ms. Quinn questioning a witness or testifying? 
 I'm just pointing out the obvious. 
 How are my favourite litigation financiers? 
 Not good, Mr. Boseman. 
 We just got subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Litigation financiers. What an interesting title. 
 Where'd you guys go to law school? We didn't. 
 Then can you explain how you've been directly involved in over 75 civil cases? 
 We provide financing to law firms that allows them to cover operating costs while undertaking time-intensive legal battles. 
 Law firms like Reddick/Boseman. 
 How many of their cases have you bankrolled? 
 Twenty-one. No. 23. 
 Wha... how do you figure? 
 The appeal and the Christmas settlement. 
 No, that's 21. No, 21 plus two is 23. 
 Okay, let's leave it at 21 or 23. 
 What does Reddick/Boseman give you in return for this financing? 
 An agreed upon percentage of the settlement amount. 
 Well, I assume Reddick/Boseman pays you your percentage out of theirs. 
 Do you really assume that or are you just trying to make a point by saying you assume it? 
 Where does the percentage come from, Mr. Warshofsky? 
 It's 23, not 21. Okay, Jerry, j... just... 
 From the client's percentage of money he never would've seen if it weren't for the money we invested. 
 MIKE: Thank you. 
 On February 20th, just before the settlement, you gentlemen decided to increase your stake in the case by investing more money. Why was that? 
 Mr. Boseman was confident they'd come in north of five million. 
 Did he tell you the basis for this confidence? 
 He had a source on the other side who told him they were ready to settle. 
 The other side at the time being Diane Lockhart. 
 Did Mr. Boseman tell you what the other side was nervous about? 
 They discovered a piece of evidence that would hurt them if they went to trial. 
 He told us that we're not allowed to tell anyone what they asked us in there. 
 Well, that's true, but you can tell us what you said. That's free speech. 
 I don't like getting involved in this. Let's go. 
 Wait, wait. One second. 
 Now, we have made a lot of money together. 
 Right? Right. 
 So, did you talk about one of our cases? 
 Was it one of the police brutality cases? 
 Is it the one we're running now? 
 Uh... No. 
 I don't think we should answer any more. 
 TOM: [STAMMERING] I know, but... 
 Just one more question. 
 Is it a case that Diane and I worked on together? 
 Yeah, but not together. f*ck. 
 But hey, please, don't swear, okay? Ah! Okay. I... I got it. 
 It bugs out Jer. I'm sorry. 
 And thank you. Thank you for coming. Yeah. Yeah, good luck. 
 ADRIAN: Thank you. Let me get that. 
 Appreciate it. TOM: Yeah, yeah. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 It's about the Toby Kendall case. 
 They're coming after me for telling you about the camera evidence. 
 You didn't tell me about any camera evidence. 
 You told me to hire an associate who, in turn, discovered evidence. 
 No, I didn't. I told you more. 
 That's disbarrable. Diane. 
 Listen to me. 
 We all know we get close to the line sometimes. 
 Now, we try to stay on the right side of the law. 
 You wanna be a good lawyer, you need to get close to that line and you know that. 
 This wasn't about being a good lawyer. 
 This was about getting a new job. 
 Not for you, for the Rindell kid, Diane. 
 Stop kicking yourself. 
 We are dealing with people who are coming at us for the smallest infraction. 
 [SIGHS] 
 So, how do we defend ourselves? 
 Mere puffery. 
 Seriously? 
 I haven't used it since law school, but, hey. [CHUCKLES] 
 I... I don't think I've ever used it. 
 Mere puffery. Mm-hmm. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 Does that even work? Uh, we will find out if it works. 
 My guess is they call you next. 
 Damn it! Yikes, who pissed you off? 
 Can we do the cute talk another time please? 
 Maybe I can help. What's up? 
 A nine-digit number, some repeats, all connected to top CEOs. 
 But none of them are from tax returns or legal cases or employee numbers. 
 Did you try Social Security numbers? Yes. 
 Maybe they're passwords. 
 That just happened to all be nine digits? 
 Maybe they're part of some secret society of rich assholes. 
 Oh... [GASPS] 
 What? 
 Just so I'm clear, I never win at anything. 
 If it's a lottery ticket, none of my numbers ever match up. 
 Okay. 
 I know this number. 
 Here too, and here. 
 This is my W-2 from last year. 
 And, uh, here. There, that number, what is that? 
 JAY: Federal Tax ID Number. 
 MARISSA: It's the same. 
 Who are you, Rain Man? 
 You should see me at the blackjack tables. 
 Who's this W-2 from? 
 My last job, Lockhart, Deckler... 
 Oh, sh1t. It's about Diane. 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] 
 1 did not slip Mr. Boseman any information about the Toby Kendall case. 
 Hmm. You're sure? lam sure. 
 So Mr. Boseman lied to these litigation financiers. 
 No. My guess, it was mere puffery. 
 Really? 
 Mere puffery is the legally acceptable practise of promoting through exaggeration. 
 Yeah, I know what it is, thank you. 
 Let's turn to the work that you did for the Rindell Fund, the recently exposed Ponzi scheme. 
 What is this, Ms. Lockhart? 
 I have no idea. 
 Isn't it a list of VIP clients at the Rindell Fund? 
 It might be. I have no idea. 
 Aren't these the Rindell clients the fund went the extra mile for? 
 Backdating gains to avoid taxes? 
 Um, again, this is news to me. 
 MIKE: Yes, but... 
 ...isn't that your firm's ID number? 
 There and there and there? 
 Isn't that how the fund billed your legal work? 
 Again, this is my first time seeing... And isn't this why you arranged for the Rindell daughter to get a job at your new work, so they wouldn't expose your culpability? 
 No. 
 Well, it's a good thing we have Henry Rindell coming in tomorrow to... clear this matter up. 
 I need to resign from this firm. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Why is that? Because I'm about to be indicted. 
 Are you... guilty of anything other than being friends with the wrong people? 
 No. 
 Then, do you think it surprises me that someone inside this firm is being targeted? 
 DIANE: He has Henry Rindell in his pocket. 
 He is going to get an indictment against me. 
 ADRIAN: Assume he does. I haven't been here that long, Adrian. 
 What does that matter, Diane? 
 I'm not running scared from M*therf*ckers like him. 
 I got to fight him. You got to fight him. 
 So, we might as well fight him together. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Bizarre that it's come to this. 
 Yeah. That's one word. [CHUCKLES] 
 So what do you need, babe? 
 You're testifying to the grand jury tomorrow? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 You're testifying against Diane? 
 No, I'm telling the truth. 
 Oh. Your alternative truth? 
 Yeah, Diane did a lot of legal work for the fund. 
 Because she was your friend. 
 No, because we paid her. 
 Is that why you had me get the Schtup list from Uncle Jax's computer? 
 So that you could use it against Diane? 
 Make it look like she took a bribe? 
 No, so I would have some leverage. 
 You betrayed her for a lighter sentence? 
 [CHUCKLES] You won't see any jail time, Mom won't either. 
 And you? 
 I don't want to die in prison, Maia. 
 I want a chance to see you have kids. I want to hold my grandkids. 
 What was the deal? Ten years. 
 Don't testify against Diane. What? I have to. 
 No, Dad. If they're offering ten years, they must have a weak case. 
 It's for you, too. 
 You do this, Dad, and if I ever have any kids... 
 ...you'll never see them. 
 I'll never let you see them. 
 [HENRY EXHALES DEEPLY AND CHUCKLES] 
 I love you. 
 MAN: All rise. 
 Okay, let's wind this down. What do we have today? 
 ELSBETH: I just have one more witness, Your Honour. 
 Promise? I think so. Aren't you having fun? 
 COLIN: We object to this witness, Your Honour. 
 JUDGE: Oh. All alone again, are you, Counselor? 
 Yes, Mr. Kresteva thought it best to stay away given this next witness. 
 Now I am curious. You know who this witness is? 
 Yes, the subpoena was served this morning. 
 And I would like to reiterate my objection to permitting this man to testify. 
 Ms. Quinn, for all her purported innocence, seems hell-bent on compromising the integrity of the judicial system. LUCCA: I've done nothing of the sort... 
 My God, you people love to hear yourselves talk. 
 Call your witness. 
 We call Henry Rindell. 
 JUDGE: Thank you. Are you all right? 
 No, not really. 
 I wish I could tell you it'll get easier. 
 I wish you could tell me that, too. [DOOR OPENS] 
 I imagine this is someone who's going to be testifying in front of the grand jury later? COLIN: It is, Your Honour. 
 JUDGE: And I imagine you're going to promise not to ask questions about what he'll testify to? 
 ELSBETH: I'll go even further. I have just one question for this witness. 
 JUDGE: Any objections, Counselor? COLIN: That depends on the question. 
 Quite the suspenseful moment. Please, proceed. 
 Mr. Rindell... Good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony? 
 What are you looking at him for? 
 I wasn't sure of the question. 
 Well, then, look at me. 
 What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony? 
 He said he would recommend to the judge a sentence of ten years instead of life without parole. 
 ELSBETH: No further questions. 
 [PHONES RINGING] 
 I had no idea of the plea deal. 
 No, I did not authorise it. 
 Yes, Senator, I understand you lost money. 
 WOMAN: I've got The Sun-Times on line one. 
 Tell them no comment. 
 WOMAN: And Mike Kresteva's here. 
 Have him come in and hold my calls. 
 [SHREDDER RUNNING] 
 [SHREDDER STOPS] Oh. [GROANS] 
 [SHREDDER RUNNING] Yes. 
 [SHREDDER STOPS No. [GROANS] 
 [SHREDDER RUNNING] 
 [SHREDDER STOPS] 
 So that's what that does. 
 Congratulations. 
 What for? 
 I was just relieved of my duties. 
 You're kidding. 
 I mean, I'm sorry. 
 Here you go. Little present for you. 
 Oh, and I didn't get you anything. 
 Yes, and let's keep it that way. 
 Well, I'm just happy it's over. 
 That's funny. What is? 
 Oh, I just think it's funny that you think this is over. 
 Here you go. [SHREDDER RUNNING] 
 [GASPS] 
 Ada. 
 I owe you a thank you. 
 No, you don't. I do. 
 You could have protected yourself... Please, don't mention it. 
 ...and instead, you protected me. 
 You got me this job. 
 You deserved it. 
 Thank you. 
 Let's get a drink. 
 [CHUCKLES] No. No, I... 
 I better get home and... 
 Sure. Yeah. 
 Let's get a drink.
