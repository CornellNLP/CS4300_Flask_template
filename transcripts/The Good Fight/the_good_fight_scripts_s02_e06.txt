 [SWITCH CLICKS] 
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
 So, please look at the camera, but once it passes you, if you could exit, sir, is the note. Okay. 
 Okay, let's send the camera to one. 
 STUDIO TECH: [OVER RADIO] Can you hear me, sir? 
 ADRIAN: Yes. 
 Can you talk for a minute? 
 About what? 
 Anything. We just need a sound check. 
 Check, check. One, two, three, four. Check. 
 Good. It'll just be a minute. 
 You'll hear the feed from our main studio, and Ted will introduce you. 
 Just speak to the lens, please. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Uh, that's right. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 Now, these are the same lawyers offering their services free of charge. 
 The... I... 
 Uh, please, let me... let me finish, ma'am. 
 My apologies. I... I can't see you. 
 Well, I'm not involved in the Peeper case, but I think it was a mistake for the defense attorney to concede the point. 
 STUDIO TECH: Thank you, sir. 
 That's it? 
 Yes. I'll be in in a sec to unhook you. 
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 What? The show last night. 
 You were good. Thank you. 
 Uh, Diane, Julius? In your office. 
 And there's a visitor here for you. I put him in the conference room. 
 Who? I don't know. Dale somebody. 
 Morning. 
 Well, Mr. Jeffrey Toobin, how did it go? 
 Fast. [LAUGHS] 
 So, um, who's in the conference room? 
 Dale Kuzma, editor of Peeper News. 
 Damn. 
 I talked about Peeper last night. He's probably pissed off. 
 The next time they ask me to be a pundit, [CHUCKLES] tell me no. 
 Uh, wait, wait, wait. We've got to discuss Lucca. 
 We can't ask her if she's pregnant. It's illegal. 
 And Lucca's not saying anything. 
 No, but she has the Marconi case in two months, so if we're gonna make a change, we have to make it now. 
 That's why she's not saying anything. 
 She don't want to get bumped to second chair, biggest case of the year. 
 JULIUS: Okay. I'll talk to her friend, Maia. 
 She might know what delivery date we're looking at. 
 Um... 
 So, about my case and what you said. 
 Look, I shouldn't have said anything. And that's between you and your lawyer. 
 I fired my lawyer. I want you. 
 Excuse me? I want you as my new lawyer. 
 What do you need from me? 
 Mr. Kuzma, you're in the middle of trial. 
 No. We just finished voir dire. Trials take months of preparation. 
 My comments, my criticisms of your lawyer, completely uncalled for. 
 But... was it true? 
 Well... there are probably some unknowns I'm not aware of. 
 What do you want, a retainer or something? 
 Mr. Kuzma, the judge will never agree to a change in lawyer this late in the process. 
 Yeah, he will. He hates my current lawyer. 
 Come on, this is the forces of evil against the forces of good. 
 Join the good. 
 [CHUCKLES] All right. [KNOCK ON GLASS] 
 What's wrong? There's another visitor here for you. 
 Do people not make appointments anymore? 
 Who is it? Franz Mendelssohn? 
 Franz Mendelssohn is here? 
 In reception. Who is he? 
 Oh, my God, he wants to buy us out. 
 No, he already bought Stanley and Gledhill. 
 So? That's what he does. He gobbles up smaller firms. 
 Did he say what he wanted? No. 
 Want me to ask? ALL: No. 
 Because I said no. 
 You want me to take it to my client? Add another zero. 
 I have to go. 
 Mr. Boseman, hello. 
 Franz Mendelssohn. Good to meet you. 
 We've never met? Chicago, and we've never met? [CHUCKLES] 
 I believe we, um, move in different circles. 
 We'll, we're all in the same circle now. 
 And, Diane Lockhart, I know you. Franz, hello. 
 It's nice to see you looking so well. No, not so well. Strange times. 
 And Julius Cain, yes? That's right. Hello. 
 Well, I apologize for not making an appointment... 
 Oh, not at all. Not a problem. 
 ...but I saw your clip online today, Adrian, and I said this is someone I need with us. 
 My clip? I didn't know I had a clip. 
 And 300,000 likes. Whoa. 
 Do you have a moment? Uh, please, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 So, let me tell you why I'm here. 
 Franz, please, sit, sit. No, it's all right. I like pacing. 
 -Sodol. Well, then let's circle each other like caged beasts. [GROWLS] 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Now, I'm sure you saw that, last week, Wilk Hobson committed suicide. 
 Yes. Terrible. But did you know that his partners don't agree with the police assessment? 
 They have reason to believe that it's one of these copycat murders, a disgruntled client killing another attorney. 
 Now, the big six firms have been meeting over the last few weeks to discuss how to address this problem. 
 Roger Hill, hit by a van. Dan Oxenbold, shot in the chest. 
 And now Wilk Hobson. 
 We want you to attend our next meeting. 
 But we're not one of the big six. True. 
 But, Adrian, we saw you on cable news last night, and we were impressed. 
 We have agreed to invite one more firm... yours. 
 Uh, what are these meetings about? 
 An existential threat to our livelihoods and our lives. 
 Chicago lawyers are being killed, and the authorities are too busy making lawyer jokes to help us. 
 No one sympathizes, so it's up to us to do for ourselves. 
 Whoa. 
 Respect. 
 Big time. 
 Whoa! One in seven firms. 
 What did you say last night on the news? 
 I do not know. 
 I... I thought it was stupid. 
 You were good. You should take a look. 
 Lawyers have had this coming for a long time. 
 If they're looking over their shoulders now, I... 
 Maybe that's a good thing. ADRIAN: Uh, excuse me. 
 Now, these are the same lawyers offering their services free of charge? 
 Well, you look good. It's the big head. 
 Big heads play well on TV. 
 Please let me finish, ma'am. Excuse me, I'm not a ma'am. 
 ADRIAN: My apologies. I can't see you. 
 Okay, 30 seconds. The recent lawsuit of PeeperNews.com... 
 Adrian, do you have a take on their recent legal moves? 
 Well, I'm not involved in the Peeper News case, but I do think it was a mistake for the defense attorney to concede the point. 
 Have they asked you to come back on? This week. I told them no. 
 ...holding to the First Amendment. I mean, it's not just the First... 
 Thank you very much, Mr. Boseman. 
 Maybe you should reconsider. 
 You know what Gore Vidal said. Mm-mm. 
 Never pass up a chance to have s*x or appear on television. 
 [LAUGHS] Okay. [SIGHS] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 [NEWS THEME MUSIC PLAYS ON LAPTOP] 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [CLOSES LAPTOP, MUSIC STOPS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 MAN: [ON LAPTOP] Lawyers have had this coming for a long time... 
 No workstations available? Uh... [LAUGHS] 
 I got here too late. Quick question. [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Has Lucca talked to you? 
 About? About... her... condition. 
 Uh, no. 
 Do you think she will? 1. 
 I think she wants to be thought of as a lawyer, and not an expectant mother. 
 Okay. [TAPS DESK] 
 When's the next pretrial motion in the Marconi case? 
 Day after tomorrow. Okay. You handle the motion. 
 Uh, Mr. Cain? Lucca is first chair. 
 Yes, but not for this motion. 
 You take it. Why? 
 Because I'm a partner, and you're an associate, and I want you to take it. 
 Is this about Lucca's condition? 
 No. It's about you having a chance to be first chair. 
 Does Lucca know? 
 No. 
 Go ahead and tell her. 
 Still no desk? No. I don't mind. I like the corner. 
 You are different since your ride-along. 
 No, I am the same. Exactly the same. 
 So, I am hoping we can use the DOJ's problems against them in this Marconi continuance. Been looking at their workload, and they have asked for continuances on 70% of their active cases... 
 Julius just asked me to argue the next motion. 
 What? 
 Julius told me to argue the next Marconi motion. 
 Why? He didn't say. 
 But he was talking about... your condition. 
 [SIGHS] Oh, f*ck. 
 They just want to know if this is gonna be something... 
 Do you know what? It's my business. It is. You're right. 
 It is your business. But you haven't even told me, and I'm your friend. 
 I'm pregnant. I'm having a baby. 
 Congratulations. Thank you. 
 Now, part of it was just having those words come out of my mouth. 
 It feels weird. 
 Well, you know what? You spoke them well. 
 Hmm. 
 Here's the other worry. 
 I'm on the partner track. 
 For the first time in my career, I have some traction. 
 And now I'm worried they'll use... this to penalize me. 
 They can't. Legally. 
 Well, look, it's gonna be easier for them to hold you back if you don't tell them. 
 Then they can just say it's all about performance. 
 You should get your pregnancy on the record. 
 That's a good point. 
 Then tell them. 
 And here we are, again. 
 Ms. Lutz. How are you? 
 Every time a new lawyer is killed, I think of you. 
 And every time a new killer is arrested, I think about you. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 So much in common. Ready to spar? 
 BAILIFF: All rise. Hear ye, hear ye. 
 This branch of the Circuit Court of Cook County is now in session, pursuant to adjournment. 
 The Honorable... 
 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Please. 
 Now, let me prepare you for what you're about to see. 
 Trials are nothing like what is shown on television. 
 Justice is slow. 
 Nothing is ever wrapped up in 60 minutes here. 
 Now, it's fine to enjoy TV lawyers, but real-life lawyers hardly even go to court. 
 In fact, 90% of a case is just paperwork. 
 90%... 
 Hello. Who are you? 
 Mr. Adrian Boseman. And Ms. Diane Lockhart. 
 The defense moves for substitution of counsel. 
 Sidebar, please. 
 This is an example of something you may have seen on television, where the lawyers request something from the judge. 
 But take my word, it's not as interesting as TV. 
 [LAUGHTER] Your Honor, the defendant wants to disrupt the proceedings even before they've begun. 
 Your Honor, Mr. Kuzma has asked that we replace his earlier counsel. 
 Now, the defendant should be allowed... 
 He was allowed his representation of choice. 
 He was. Now he's changed his mind. 
 The defendant can choose his lawyers, but I will not allow this to turn into some game of musical chairs. 
 Is that understood? lt is, Your Honor. 
 Understood, Your Honor. We move for a continuance. 
 Of course you do. 
 ADRIAN: Given that we've just legally begun representing Mr. Kuzma, preparing properly for trial requires that we have at least... 
 Plaintiff objects. The jury's been seated. The trial's in progress. 
 Sustained. 
 How is it that so many lawyers are being killed, and yet my courtroom is still full of them? 
 The fire took everything. 
 The piano my mother left for me. My photo albums. 
 And this was your house, Mrs. Honeycutt? 
 Yes. 
 And this is your house afterwards? 
 Let the record reflect that Mrs. Honeycutt is responding emotionally in the affirmative. 
 Now, I'm sorry, Mrs. Honeycutt. Just one more question. 
 Is this your dog? 
 [QUIETLY] Oh, God. -HONEYCUTT: Yes. 
 AMBER: And he died in the fire, didn't he? 
 Yes. And who do you blame for this fire? 
 Objection, Your Honor. Inflammatory. Calls for a conclusion. 
 Well, the conclusion is the point of this trial, isn't it? 
 1 will, however, caution the jury. 
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, a trial is never as dramatic asitison TV. 
 We don't wrap things up here in 60 minutes. 
 So just because a witness points towards a defendant doesn't make it true. Please keep that in mind. 
 Mrs. Honeycutt, you may continue. 
 I blame him and his website. 
 But he didn't light the match? 
 No, but he published our home address, and he said we deserved everything we got. 
 That's the match. 
 Thank you. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Honeycutt. 
 What was your dog's name? 
 Puffy. 
 Did you ever find Puffy? 
 [SOBS] No. 
 She's trying to provoke you. 
 Don't take the bait. Mm-hmm. 
 ADRIAN: Mrs. Honeycutt, I'm really sorry for your loss. 
 Who is that sitting next to Ms. Amber Wood-Lutz? 
 HONEYCUTT: That's my son, Dennis. 
 And your son Dennis lives with you, isn't that right? 
 For the moment, yes. 
 And he lived with you in the house that was destroyed? 
 He's been helping me since I had my hip replaced. 
 And your son Dennis is a neo-Nazi. 
 Is that correct? Objection! Inflammatory! 
 The lady can say no if it's not true, Your Honor. 
 Even the question implies a rationale for this fire. 
 No, the question implies a rationale for why my client printed these folks' address. Your Honor. 
 And that is all he is being sued for. [GAVEL BANGING] 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Apologies for the fireworks. 
 Occasionally things can get a little out of hand here. 
 Overruled. You may answer. 
 My son is a good boy. 
 He works hard, and he reads a lot. 
 And he is not a Nazi, neo or otherwise. 
 But wasn't he at the Oak Woods protest at the Confederate soldier statue, ma'am? 
 Yes. But as a history buff. 
 Is this Dennis's photo, Mrs. Honeycutt? 
 Yes. But he's yelling for everyone to stop. 
 ADRIAN: Mrs. Honeycutt. 
 Is this really the face of someone yelling to tell everyone to stop? 
 300,000. 
 You didn't see what happened in that courtroom? The jury loved her. 
 Yes, but they hate her son. 
 300,000. That's enough to rebuild her home. 
 Nope. 10.5 million. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] Pain and suffering. 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 DIANE: Jesus, it's everybody. 
 ADRIAN: Everyone who never hired me. 
 Oh, look. Elvis White. 
 Mm. And Roger Woodruff. He defeated me twice in court. 
 This is like the beginning of that nightmare where I realize I'm naked. 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 Adrian. Franz. 
 Franz, hello. Diane. 
 Thank you for coming. Thank you. 
 We're all here. Let's get started. 
 Uh, no, thank you. Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm, Ms. Wood-Lutz. 
 ADRIAN: Looks like they're pretending to be diverse. 
 We're about to see why jackals never meet. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] 
 Welcome, all. 
 I'm glad we're all alive and kicking still. 
 First order of business: we're asking everyone to contribute $20,000 to the fund for the widows of our fallen peers. 
 Let's not be stingy here. I think we can all spare $40,000. 
 None of us are struggling. 
 [LAUGHTER] [ADRIAN CLEARS THROAT] 
 FRANZ: Well, let your conscience guide your checkbook. 
 The sad fact is we're having to do for ourselves nowadays. 
 In a world without guardrails, we are the despised. 
 And not to be too melodramatic, we are also being hunted. 
 Not to be too melodramatic. 
 What do you call it? Three Chicago lawyers dead. 
 By clients. While the authorities make jokes. 
 Sometimes justifiably. No. 
 [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] MAN: What is this big hubbub about? 
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute, okay? Who has handed over their client list to the police? 
 Come on. Raise your hands. Huh? No one. 
 That's beside the point. Attorney-client privilege prevents us... 
 That's bullcrap. If we wanted to, we can have a prosecutor subpoena those records in five minutes. 
 FRANZ: The difficulty is... But nobody wants to. 
 Wait. Wait. Difficulty is clients will leave us. 
 If they know that we are handing their names over to the police... 
 That's true. Even the innocent ones. 
 No. No. No. The problem is us. 
 We're worried we'll poach from each other. 
 It's not about clients leaving. It's about us stealing. 
 Then what's the answer? 
 The police are throwing this back at us, saying it's our problem. 
 Remind them that we're not some South Side squatters. 
 Remind them of our tax base. 
 Talk to Rahm. Lay it out for him. He knows where his money comes from. 
 MAN: That's right. Rahm won't touch this. 
 His deputy might. Warren Hesseman. FRANZ: That's right. 
 Warren just hinted that he was running in 2019. 
 He's gonna be looking for trial lawyer money. 
 He's also friends with the police. MAN: Problem solved. There you go. 
 FRANZ: Good thought, Adrian. 
 STUDIO TECH: Five minutes to air. Five minutes to air. 
 So, you're back. 
 Yeah. That's good. 
 Just so we don't cross lines here, don't go angry on me. 
 Wh... Um, one more time? 
 [LAUGHS] I'm the young, angry activist. 
 You're the older... Obama statesman. 
 That's the only way they keep two black pundits on the panel, if we both stick to our lanes. 
 Huh. Okay? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 It's good to have you on board, Adrian. 
 That was fun last time. Good viral clips. 
 Keep it up. Thanks. 
 [NEWS THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 
 As usual, we have our team of legal experts giving us their perspective for the week in law. 
 And for the fourth week in a row, we turn to the bizarre series of deaths tied to clients killing lawyers. 
 Overnight, there was another murder. This one is still unsolved. 
 A lawyer gunned down in her carport while walking her dog. 
 Donna Evans, seen here representing a vandalized mosque. 
 Police suspect her boyfriend, but many think it's another client killing. 
 Your thoughts, Jedidiah? 
 I think it's part of this anti-Muslim hysteria led by Donald Trump, who made the Muslim ban the cornerstone of his entire... 
 Okay, not everything is racism. 
 Everything that's racist is racism. Okay, look. 
 This woman dealt with Islamic radicals. 
 What was she thinking? Did she have a death wish or something? 
 It was a desecrated mosque, Chuck, not ISIS. 
 Yes, but this lawyer was dealing, on a daily basis, with Islamic extremism. 
 She should've known what she was getting into. 
 Do you even know what you're talking about? 
 Go ahead, Adrian. No. It's all right. 
 No, I think I know as much as you, sir. 
 No, we're too quick to coddle extremists in the name of open borders and globalization. 
 But these are real people you're talking about, Chuck. 
 I knew Donna Evans. She was a great lawyer. 
 She did more good in her short life than you ever will. 
 CHUCK: [LAUGHS] I'm not out there defending Islamic radicals. 
 No, you're in here, being paid $170,000 a year to ignorantly yap your mouth off, Chuck. 
 How dare you? Now, how much do you make as a lawyer? 
 Don't play all high and mighty with me. 
 So you're coming after my job, now, huh? 
 We'll see who wins. 
 I probably should've mentioned the one rule of cable news. 
 Don't ever, ever, ever mention money. 
 Yep. 
 It was nice meeting you. 
 Adrian. Good morning. 
 [DIANE CLEARS THROAT] 
 Well, that was interesting. Which part? 
 The $170,000 a year part. 
 Is that really how much he's paid? 
 I lost it, didn't I? 
 No, I've seen you lose it. 
 That was intentional. [CHUCKLES] 
 My innate sense of drama. Oh. 
 Hmm. Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. I never do this, but you're the guy from cable news, right? 
 My mom could not stop talking about you last night. 
 Could you sign something for her? Her name's Eunice. 
 AMBER: The defense has called you a Nazi, Dennis. Are you? 
 No, ma'am. You were present at the demonstration at Oak Woods Cemetery, in which it has been alleged there were neo-Nazis present. 
 I was there to honor the Confederate soldiers who were imprisoned and died. 
 It's been charged that the demonstration you were a part of, has, at its purpose, to intimidate various racial and ethnic groups. 
 It wasn't my purpose. 
 Well, I... I just don't want to lose our history. 
 Not because it's perfect. It's not. 
 Those Confederate dead share the same cemetery as Jesse Owens and Harold Washington. And we should have to think about that. 
 AMBER: I see. Did you come to a... I think you should take this. 
 What? The jury. 
 The whole testimony, they're watching you. 
 TV does that to people. AMBER: Thank you, Dennis. 
 [WHISPERS] Jesus. God. AMBER: No further questions. 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go for it. 
 ADRIAN: Mr. Honeycutt. [CLEARS THROAT] 
 So you were aware that there were Nazis at the demonstration, but you yourself are not a Nazi? 
 Not at all. You are one of the very fine people that the president referred to? 
 Object to the sarcasm, Your Honor. 
 It's a direct quote, Your Honor. Sustained nonetheless. 
 According to your Facebook page, Mr. Honeycutt, you are a Civil War reenactor? Uh, yes, sir. 
 And you put up a post, an angry post, about the uniforms that some of the reenactors were wearing. 
 When you wear Velcro at the Battle of Chickamauga, you're showing a lack of respect. 
 Since you take uniforms so seriously, tell us about the uniform that you were wearing at the demonstration you attended. I wasn't wearing any uniform. 
 White polo and khaki pants, like most of the other young men. 
 Objection. So did the salespeople at the mall. 
 Argumentative. I will sustain that. 
 Are you familiar with a website called The Mighty Hammer? 
 I've heard of it. ADRIAN: You've heard of it. 
 "Put away your brown shirts and swastika armbands. 
 Wehrmacht of today requires that the State not be able to pick us out. 
 Khaki pants and white polo shirts only." 
 When I got dressed, I wasn't thinking about any of that. 
 Also, I don't own any swastika armbands, and I don't much appreciate being lumped in with people who do. 
 Or being lumped in with people at the mall. 
 [LAUGHTER] AMBER: Your Honor. 
 Mr. Boseman, please dial back your sarcasm. 
 Certainly, Your Honor. 
 Mr. Honeycutt, if I have mischaracterized your beliefs, I'm sorry. 
 It's just that we were able to retrieve... 
 ...some writings, postings of yours from 2012, which you subsequently deleted. 
 I'd like to read some now, Your Honor. 
 Objection, Your Honor. Prejudicial. That was six years ago. 
 The witness is free to disavow, Your Honor. 
 Overruled. 
 ADRIAN: "We make ourselves too easy of a target wearing the Hakenkreuz." 
 That's like the white hood of the Klan. 
 "We should let those now in power forget that we exist. 
 The Jew's busy making money, the homosexual's busy contaminating the culture, and the Ethiopian is too stupid to recognize what we represent.” I don't believe that. But you believed it then? 
 DENNIS: No. No. I was just quoting other people. 
 It was just a... a pose. It was just to provoke. 
 ADRIAN: Provoke? Provoke people like, uh, Jews? 
 Provoke people like homosexuals? And provoke blacks? 
 No! I never... I never meant it! I didn't believe it! 
 I would like a short recess, Your Honor. 
 ADRIAN: Fine. 
 The witness probably needs a new disguise anyhow. 
 MARISSA: They should be here in a minute. 
 You all right? Yeah. Why? 
 No reason. Just asking. 
 I'm pregnant. Congratulations. 
 I'm telling everyone now. Okay. I'll throw you a shower. 
 No. Please. Don't. Too late. 
 No, seriously. I hate showers. 
 Well, this'll be a new, hip one. With a stripper. 
 DIANE: Lucca, sorry to keep you waiting. Come on in. 
 Thank you for the meeting. 
 I wanted to officially inform the partners of my pregnancy. 
 Oh! Ah! 
 You may have wondered why I haven't yet told anyone. 
 It was only to prepare some contingencies. 
 DIANE: Uh, may we interrupt? Yeah, of course. 
 Congratulations! Congratulations! 
 You look wonderful. 
 Thank you. [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Uh, the birth date is scheduled for May 22nd. 
 I'll be back at my desk on May 25th, having missed only three work days, none of which are in court. 
 All medical appointments will be before 9:00 a.m. 
 All at-home child care is lined up. 
 I'm not asking for, nor do I need, any special allowances. 
 I can and will continue my full workload. 
 With no interruptions. 
 And I'm especially eager to resume first chair on the Marconi double murder case, having worked on it for a year. 
 Well, uh, as the, uh, father of six, [CHUCKLES] 
 I'd like to bring up the... fullness of the task. 
 Noted. 
 DIANE: And I would like to acknowledge, in accordance with the law, that we are behind your plan. 
 Sogotoit. 
 Oh, how'd it go? 
 So what do we think? 
 I don't think we can think, legally. We just have to react. 
 So, we'll react to how she does in court. 
 Yeah. And keep Maia ready to step in. 
 FRANZ: I want to welcome Warren Hesseman, deputy to the mayor. 
 I should say up front, I'm a trial lawyer's best friend. 
 Now more than ever, we need ‘em. They're our guardrails. 
 Then we need you to be intermediary with the police. 
 They're not taking these murders seriously. 
 It may look that way from the outside, but that's not true. 
 [ALL MURMURING] 
 Wilk Hobson did not commit suicide. I knew him. 
 He was getting angry phone calls. Then the police will investigate. 
 They already investigated. They called it a suicide. 
 That was an unofficial statement. 
 Look, Warren, we don't think the police are taking these cases seriously. 
 What do we have to do? 
 I'll bring your concerns to them. FRANZ: Ugh! 
 [ALL MURMURING] But... but I need your help. 
 Ah, now we get the solicitation. 
 No. The police, whether rightly or wrongly, see you as the enemy because sometimes, frankly, you are. 
 How are we the enemy? You sue them. 
 FRANZ: Of course we sue them. It keeps the police honest. 
 Some firms make it their mission to sue the police. 
 Stop beating around the bush. 
 There's only one firm at this table responsible for 60% of the lawsuits against the police. 
 Every single one of them was justified. 
 No one's denying that, but it's the provocation that sets the police against you. The victims are the problem? 
 WARREN: The police should be sued when they do wrong. 
 But sometimes they don't do wrong, and they still get sued. 
 It's making the dialogue with the police much harder. 
 We don't want the police to be our friends. 
 We just want them to do their f*cking job. 
 FRANZ: Okay, let's leave it there, Warren. 
 Anything you can do for us, we ask that you do, and we'll see what we can do for you. 
 It's none of their business what we do with our police brutality cases! 
 And that's what we told them. Then why bring it up here? Why? 
 We're sharing with you how we're being perceived. That's all, Julius. 
 So, what, the police will only do their job if we drop our police brutality cases? 
 Warren Hesseman suggested that we tread lightly. 
 I'm not saying we will. You're telling us about it. 
 How can that not have a chilling effect? 
 Would it be better if we didn't tell you anything? 
 No, it would be better if we dropped out of the Big Six conference. 
 We've only been invited because it pressures us into dropping our police brutality cases. 
 I disagree. We have a seat at the table. We are sitting with the Big Six! 
 It's worth all the f*cking irritation in the world! 
 They ask us to do something that we don't want to do, we just say no. 
 Is this you talking or the pundit? 
 The defense moves to exclude the testimony of Dr. William Brentwood, Your Honor. 
 Uh-huh. So, is this pretrial motion number 234 or 235? 
 Yes, it sure does seem that way, doesn't it, Your Honor? 
 Yes. I'm not buttered up, Counselor. 
 There have been just as many prosecutorial motions. 
 So who is this Dr. Brentwood? 
 The expert witness the prosecution will call to discuss the blood spatter evidence. 
 If I may, Your Honor? I'm not finished with my motion. 
 
 
 
 And we again ask that the prosecution release its discovery to us. 
 This is getting dangerously close to a Brady violation. 
 COLIN: I have a motion that takes precedence. 
 Procedural, not evidentiary. 
 You should have brought it up earlier. You're so quick to step in, I wasn't given the opportunity. 
 Oh, well, you two are really something. 
 What's the motion, Mr. Morrello? 
 A continuance, Your Honor. Another? 
 The prosecution moves to reschedule the trial to start the week of May 21st. 
 Your Honor, that's absurd. 
 The prosecution is proposing a four-month delay. 
 Absurd's a little strong. 
 A few weeks is hardly uncommon in a case this complicated. 
 This motion denies our client his constitutionally-mandated right to a speedy trial. 
 COLIN: A few months is not a speedy trial violation, Your Honor. 
 Okay. This was fun. 
 I want the two of you to go out into the hall, pull out your calendars and decide on a date. 
 Come back here in an hour, and I'll hear your proposal. 
 You are taking advantage of this situation. 
 I'm not taking advantage of anything. I'm prosecuting a case. 
 Take the next one. 
 You asked for the trial to start the same week this baby is due, and that's not taking advantage? 
 I picked dates that are convenient for the prosecution, ignoring your pregnancy, which is what you seem to expect us all to do. 
 Oh, my God, I get it. 
 You want to argue against Maia. What? 
 You know she's inexperienced. That's what this is about. 
 Okay, could you please drop the conspiracy theories? 
 There's nothing nefarious here. 
 Hi. Do you mind if I sit here? I have to get right back to work. 
 No, go ahead. I'm in a rush, too. 
 God, I hate working at a law firm. 
 Tell me about it. Where are you at? 
 Mendelssohn, Grant and Associates. 
 Oh, yeah. I heard that was hard. Which lawyer? 
 Franz Mendelssohn. Wow. 
 The top guy. Alot of clients. 
 You just signed someone new, didn't you? 
 Uh, who do you mean? Oh, someone... Ugh. 
 I saw the paperwork. Is it someone with the Chicago PD? 
 Yeah, their civil cases. 
 We don't have it yet, but we're trying. 
 Yeah, that must be it. Which firm are you with? 
 Pinwheel, Winkler and Associates. 
 Pinwheel/Winkler... I don't think I've ever heard of them. 
 Oh, we're just starting out. Oh. I better go. 
 Good luck with Chicago PD. Thanks. 
 [DIALING] 
 Diane. There's something with Franz Mendelssohn you should know. 
 Seriously? 
 That's great, Marissa. Fantastic work. 
 Okay, talk to you later. 
 [LAUGHTER] ADRIAN: Right? 
 AMBER: Your Honor! 
 The defense has rolled its eyes. Unintended, Your Honor. 
 Sometimes my eyes have a mind of their own. 
 Mr. Boseman. Refrain from all visual commentary. 
 Of course, Your Honor. Let me ask another question, uh, Mr. Kuzma. 
 Uh, one more to the plaintiff's liking. 
 Why did you print the plaintiff's name and address? 
 'Cause I hate Nazis. 
 And I really hate Nazis marching in the streets. 
 Do I intentionally inflict emotional distress? 
 I sure hope so. 
 Mr. Kuzma, where did you find Dennis Honeycutt's address? 
 Oh, it's in the phone book. It's in the phone book? 
 KUZMA: Yes. So isn't it just as likely that the arsonists found the address in the phone book? 
 Objection. Beyond the scope. 
 I can see why you wouldn't want that question answered. 
 [BANGS GAVEL] 
 I'd like all the lawyers in my chambers. 
 Why, Your Honor? Because I said so! 
 Enough showboating, Mr. Boseman. Excuse me? 
 Don't play coy with me. You are playing to the jury. 
 Your Honor, I am simply... 
 Yes, actually, I am. I am playing our case to the jury. 
 That's my job. Watch your tone, sir. 
 He's trading on his punditry, Your Honor. 
 No, I am being an advocate. JUDGE: It is posturing. 
 And I will not allow that in my courtroom. 
 I don't care how many times you've been on television, Mr. Boseman. 
 Leave it outside my court. 
 Your Honor, could you point out what Mr. Boseman should do differently? 
 JUDGE: Excuse me? 
 What is he doing that he should do differently? 
 He should stop playing to the jury. Should he stop looking at the jury? 
 That is not what I'm saying. DIANE: Should he remain seated? 
 [SIGHS] No. He knows what he's doing. 
 Your Honor, what Mr. Boseman is doing is being an effective advocate for our client. 
 You are asking him to change his behavior without telling him how to change, so I... I must object. 
 To what? 
 To your order that Mr. Boseman stop effectively representing our client. 
 That is not what my order requires. 
 Well, then you sustain our objection? No. 
 Well, then I'd like a ruling, Your Honor. 
 To quote a lawyer that I respected, I want a ruling that I can appeal. 
 Well, then try this one on for size: overruled. 
 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 You two have a winnable case here. 
 I don't know why you're doing everything you can to lose it. 
 Because you're trying to tie one hand behind our back. 
 And the jury is going to know that. Is there anything else, Your Honor? 
 Yes. Get out. Thank you. 
 Wow. 
 I thought I was the troublemaker. 
 [LAUGHS] Wait till you hear what Marissa found out. 
 ADRIAN: What do you got? 
 Your new friend Mendelssohn, he's playing you. 
 We have no news on the police investigation, but I do want to discuss and review the meeting we had with Mr. Hesseman. 
 What is there to discuss? He threw everything right back at us. 
 I don't think that's true. He had, I think, a very constructive suggestion. 
 Which was? That our police brutality cases against the department are a thorn in all our sides. 
 Not in the number of them, but in the... the scope of them, the... the fury of them. 
 Not us. We don't have cases. 
 Adrian, do you have something to contribute? 
 No. We're here to try to work together as a group, Adrian. 
 When you throw a bomb at the police department, we all feel it. 
 You don't think there's any call to change your culture? 
 Not until you drop your new client, Franz. 
 My new client? I don't understand. 
 Two months ago, you shopped yourself to the Chicago Police Department, arguing you could reduce their liability. 
 That's not true. Are you saying it's not true that the Chicago Police Department is thinking of taking its business to your firm? 
 No, I'm saying my solicitation has nothing to do with this working group's dealings with the police. 
 There's a Chinese wall. [LAUGHS LOUDLY] 
 Is this f*cking true, Franz? 
 You've been trying to talk them into going easy on police cases so you could win yourself a department contract? 
 No, this has nothing to do with my... 
 MAN: Of course it has everything to do with it! 
 FRANZ: No one here would believe that I would stoop so low to use this group for my own advantage! 
 I believe it. I guess I do, too. 
 [ALL CHATTERING] 
 Excuse us. Thank you. 
 MAN 2: Oh, boy, oh, boy. AMBER: How disappointing. 
 Well, you seem ready to go, Ms. Quinn. 
 What have you two decided? 
 Your Honor, we couldn't come to an agreement. 
 [SIGHS] 
 We didn't come to an agreement because the date the AUSA is insisting on for this trial coincides with the due date of my baby. 
 Congratulations. Thank you. 
 Did you explain your situation to the AUSA? 
 No. Because there's no need. 
 He already knows the due date. He's the father. 
 Huh. LUCCA: That's right, Your Honor. 
 The AUSA is trying to use what he knows about my situation, i.e. knocking me up, to his advantage. 
 Uh, uh, Your Honor... He wants me off the case because that'll give him a better chance of winning. 
 That's... [SIGHS] 
 Mr. Morrello, it's your turn. 
 Share your thinking. 
 I asked for the... 
 Your Honor... [CLEARS THROAT] 
 I asked for the continuance because we, the Department of Justice, need more time to prepare our case. 
 [LUCCA LAUGHS] 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Many of our attorneys have resigned, and I have inherited this case from an outgoing AUSA. 
 What Ms. Quinn is suggesting... Oh, go ahead and call me Lucca. 
 The judge knows we're on a first-name basis. 
 She's right. 
 Huh. What Lucca... 
 ...Is suggesting is incredibly cynical, not to mention hypocritical, because now she's using her pregnancy to win sympathy from you, Your Honor. 
 Yes, I noticed. 
 Oh, boy, this kid's gonna have great parents. 
 Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Here goes. 
 No continuance. 
 Mr. Morrello, no one can know your true reason for moving the trial date, but it doesn't look good, and I'm not going to indulge it. 
 Get your case ready. You're going to trial. 
 And, Ms. Quinn, your pregnancy is not going to earn you any special dispensation at trial. 
 So... you'd better get ready, too. 
 I wasn't trying to get you kicked off the case. 
 Excuse me. Do you have an appointment? 
 I wasn't being strategic in court. 
 I wasn't trying to get you bumped from the case. 
 Then what were you doing? Go over there and turn around. 
 We're having a baby. I'm having a baby. 
 COLIN: The continuance was for your benefit. 
 LUCCA: Oh, my God. I didn't think this could get any worse, but here we go. 
 This trial is going to be very stressful. 
 Okay? A double murder. 
 And we're gonna be screaming at each other. 
 Can I turn around now, please? No, actually. 
 Oh, God. 
 Do you know how offensive this is? 
 Colin, I'm very worried about your delicate sensibility. 
 Maybe it would be better if you sit this one out. 
 An AUSA in my first year, she had a miscarriage. 
 She was in the middle of the biggest trial of her career. 
 Oh, no. And the same thing could happen to me? Really? 
 Could I please just be a little concerned? 
 No. You can't. 
 Some little part of your DNA is inside me. That's all. 
 We had s*x. We both regretted it. I didn't. 
 Okay. That's your problem. 
 Goodbye. 
 [MUTTERS, CHUCKLES] 
 You know, I came here for a different reason. 
 Colin, I am okay. Really. 
 You guys represent Peeper News now, right? 
 Why? Oh, just because we arrested someone, someone that might prove useful to you. 
 Who? No, you're not interested, right? 
 No. No, I... I'm interested now. No, I'll go. 
 Who? 
 Lacey Harmon. Antifa activist and day trader. 
 Do you know the plaintiff, Dennis Honeycutt? 
 No, but I know of him. I burned his house down. 
 [PEOPLE MURMURING] 
 Okay, let's keep our voices down. 
 ADRIAN: How'd you find his house, Lacey? 
 Online. There's a picture of it with a street sign on his Facebook page. 
 You didn't find it on PeeperNews.com? 
 No. I never even heard of it till you guys found me. 
 No further questions, Your Honor. JUDGE: Okay. 
 Anything, Ms. Wood-Lutz? Just a recess, Your Honor. 
 Recess for lunch. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 300,000. No. 
 In fact, if you keep pursuing this, we will countersue. 
 Well played. 
 [PHONE RINGING] 
 Diane Lockhart's office. 
 Um, she's not in right now, Mr. Boseman. 
 I actually called to talk to you, Marissa. 
 Me? Why? Say thank you. 
 Good job getting that dirt on Mendelssohn. 
 Oh, well, uh, that was just, you know... 
 Marissa, take the thank you. Right. 
 You're welcome. You got your ten percent raise. 
 You... Seriously? Really good job. 
 Uh, thank you, Mr. Boseman. 
 This is the first raise I've ever gotten. First of many, I'm sure. 
 Bye-bye. 
 [EXHALES] 
 So, what happened to JD? 
 You did. 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] Yup. Don't get up. 
 Adrian, how are you? 
 Good. Good. Good. Great. 
 Listen, everyone at the network loves you. 
 You're smart. You're articulate. 
 The thing is, is we like it when you bring a little more heat to the panel. 
 Oh. Be the angry, black man. 
 God, no. That's an ugly stereotype. 
 Just... just go with your impulses. 
 People are riled up these days. 
 They want to hear someone saying what they're thinking. That's all. 
 We're all looking for those viral moments. 
 I'll see you out there. That's a great vest. 
 CHUCK: Why does racism only go one way? 
 That's what I want to know. 
 I see racism against whites every day, every single day, yet I'm a racist for pointing that out? 
 Adrian, what's your take? Take on what? 
 What Chuck just said. Is racism just a one-way street? 
 I think that's his opinion. 
 Look at your firm, Adrian. 
 You get the benefit of no-bid contracts because you're an African-American firm. 
 Now, as a white lawyer, what am I supposed to think of that? 
 I don't know. 
 I think Chuck is pointing out a double standard here, Adrian. 
 I mean, take hip-hop. We've talked about this on the show before. 
 You have African-American rappers saying N-word this and N-word that, but a Caucasian can't? 
 So say it. 
 Say what? Say the word you want to say. 
 I'm not saying that I want to say it. 
 I'm just saying that I can't. Sure you can. 
 Say it. Say it right now. 
 I will say it with you. Okay, this is hypocritical. 
 You know we can't. Sure you can. 
 This is America. Both of you. [NEWS THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [LAUGHS] Say it. 
 -N...N... All right, I think we can move on. 
 Why? Why move on when you want to say it? 
 Both of you want to say it. Huh? 
 N... 
 All together, everybody. 
 N...N... 
 [LAUGHS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 f*ck you. 
 Was I angry enough for you? 
 I don't think he likes me. Good job.
