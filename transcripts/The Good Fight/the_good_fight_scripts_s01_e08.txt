 [ELEVATOR DOOR SHUTS] 
 MAN: When I look around this room, I see the future defined by strength, resilience, and a determination to work together. 
 So, now, when we stood in the centre of the Pettus Bridge, and that's Selma, Alabama, we looked and we saw these troopers at the other end, with their rifles in tow, and we were surprised, you know? 
 But not one of our precious souls expressed an ounce of fear. 
 Hm? If you have anything worth fighting against, whether it's injustice or an out-of-control president... 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 ...then you stand in the face of opposition, fearlessly. 
 Now, that's what this firm represents. 
 That's what you all are. 
 You're all fighters, each and every one of you. 
 You're fighters. I'm done for the day. 
 WOMAN: Thank you so much. 
 OK, OK. We still have a firm to operate. 
 Besides, we don't wanna exhaust our founding partner. 
 That's all right, Barbara. All right, now, back to work, y'all. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Did you know he was coming? No. 
 Know what he wants? To see how we're doing. 
 Complain about how we're doing, more like. 
 Adrian. Carl. How you doing? 
 All right. How are you doing? Good, good. 
 Hey, uh... you got a minute? Yeah. Yeah, go on in. 
 Go in? OK. Yeah, go in. Barbara. 
 Diane. 
 Are you sure? I know Carl. 
 He probably just wants to talk about the police brutality cases. Come on. 
 Hey, um... maybe just the name partners, you know, maybe... 
 Oh, of course. 
 Whoa, wait, wait. Diane's on the executive committee, Carl. 
 Probably a good idea that she'd be here. 
 I mean, what the hell is going on here? 
 I turn my back and we're being indicted. 
 We were not indicted. 
 You got grand juries all over your butt, man. 
 In the meantime, I had to find out from the LA Times that you just signed with one of the whitest companies in Silicon Valley. 
 You are complaining because we brought in a company worth 86 million dollars a year? 
 Yeah, two per cent black employment. 
 We don't have anything to do with that, Carl. 
 We have to make a living, Carl. 
 No, in the meantime, I've been receiving calls from these clients who are feeling neglected. Who? 
 Nigel. He says he can't get you on the phone. 
 Nigel Rogers? Yeah. 
 Nigel Rogers has not made money for this firm since 2009, Carl. 
 Maybe because you have not returned his call. 
 COLIN: You all right? Sounds like a fight. 
 Uh... no, just a friendly disagreement. What's up? 
 I'm just checking to see if we're still on for tonight. 
 Yeah. Same place, right? No, change of plans. 
 What? Art gallery. 
 No, too many people. There'll be like eight people there. 
 No-one will see us. I'll go down on you in the bathroom. 
 You promised that last time. 
 This time, I double-dog-swear. I'll text you the deets. 
 Don't say deets. I hate it when you say deets. 
 Deets-de-deet-deets. 
 Where's your responsiveness to the community? 
 Come on, Carl. Seriously? Carl, wait. 
 We're here fighting the good fight. That's what we're doing. 
 If you'll excuse me, I have some calls to make. It's so nice meeting you, sir. 
 CARL: Wasn't that the point of this firm? 
 ADRIAN: Are you serious, Carl? 
 Diane Lockhart. Pastor Jeremiah, how are you? 
 It's so good to see you. You are looking well. 
 Oh, thank you. As are you. You get younger-looking. 
 Uh... no, it's the times. It lights a fire in your belly. 
 That and a stationary bike. Come on in. 
 Hey, Carl, I didn't know Diane was working here. 
 She performed amazing miracles in juvenile court. All pro bono. 
 DIANE: Oh, you're too kind. 
 I imagine Carl has told you about my issue. 
 I haven't told them yet. We were discussing other business. 
 Then I'll come back. Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 We're gonna go into the conference room and let my... my partners discuss their work. 
 And, uh... Diane, will you join us, please? 
 Mm-hm. Uh... certainly. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] ADRIAN: Phew. 
 He's here for two weeks and he's gone. 
 Patience. 
 It's a transitional house I run as part of my outreach ministry and Paul has started to use again. 
 Uh... that's the young man I need to evict. 
 Now, I asked him to leave but he refused and I have strict policies against abuse in the house. 
 Yeah, we don't normally deliver eviction notices, Rev. 
 I can handle it, Adrian. We won't take long. 
 Well, take Dipersia and an associate with you, in case it needs more hours. 
 I shall. It's good to see you, Pastor. Thank you, Diane. 
 DIANE: Oh, yeah, thank you. PASTOR: Uh-hm. 
 An eviction? Do we normally do that? It's a favour. 
 Are we expecting trouble? I don't think so. 
 [ELEVATOR PINGS] 
 Well, actually, he said that he would. 
 Maia. Dad? 
 Hello, Henry. Diane. 
 Maia, do you have a second? 
 Uh... no. No, I don't. I'm working. 
 It's OK. Take a minute. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, you don't answer my calls. 
 You should take that as a sign to stop calling, then, not as a sign to drop by my work. 
 Please, Maia. Mai... 
 [SIGHS] 
 Are you all right? 
 Yes. 
 I'm sorry you're going through this. 
 Thank you. 
 Drug test. 
 Do you carry a gun? No. 
 [DIANE KNOCKS] 
 You ever need one? All the time. 
 Paul Johnson? Yes? 
 You're being evicted. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 JAY: I'd pick that up. -0r? 
 Or I'll ask you politely to pick it up. 
 So, it's from Jerry, huh? 
 What an arsehole. Can't even do his own dirty work. 
 We're Pastor Easton's attorney and we need you to know... 
 So this is how you tell someone you don't want to suck their cock any more? 
 We need you to know, sir, that you have broken the rules of... 
 Really? The rules that I have to f*ck him whenever he wants? 
 The reason he's trying to kick me out is because I ended it, ‘cause I don't want a 70 year old dick in my mouth. 
 Shut up and listen. 
 You have until noon tomorrow to vacate the premises. 
 Do you need any help finding other accommodations? 
 Tell Jerry he blew it. 
 I wasn't gonna do anything. Now I am. 
 Of course he'd say that. 
 He says he's going to do something about it. 
 What? Contact a lawyer? 
 Later, Sharise, please. You may wanna deal with this. 
 A Gabriel Kovac says he represents Paul Johnson. 
 Hello, Mr Kovac. How are you? 
 OK. You need more chocolates and fewer mints. 
 OK, note taken. Marissa is going to sit in on this and take notes. 
 More chocolate. Got it. 
 Likewise, and, similarly, I have an iPhone here and I'm gonna record, if I can, uh... put record on so... 
 Um... there. That button there. Oh, great. Thank you. Yeah. 
 So, um... 
 I represent... 
 ...Mr Paul Johnson. 
 He has been f*cked over by your client. 
 Is that a legal term? f*cked over? No. 
 But it's accurate. 
 Pastor Jeremiah placed his pen1s in two of my client's orifices. 
 How's that? Hm? Does that satisfy your Harvard education? 
 I didn't go to Harvard. I didn't either. 
 DIANE: You do understand that by making this accusation, Mr Kovac, that you are inviting a counter-suit? 
 In fact, a baseless accusation of this kind would be grounds to report you to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. 
 Miss Lockhart, here's the thing. 
 I'm not a great lawyer. 
 It took me three tries to pass the Bar, but I do know this. 
 You were sent in here to intimidate me, ‘cause you're the token white lawyer, and use all kinds of words like, uh... disciplinary action, uh... court suits, things like that, that are supposed to scare me off... 
 I don't think you understand that this isn't about... 
 I don't scare easy. 
 And, uh... I'm not interested in getting into the right country club. 
 All I know is, Paul Johnson, when he was 17 years old, was raped by your client, a certified pastor, and the Illinois Civil Statute of Limitations for statutory rape is 20 years. 
 I looked that up. 
 I also know that you don't want this to go to trial. 
 Pastor Jeremiah is a pastor. 
 That's like already two strikes against him and the liberals, they're gonna look at him and think he rapes kids. 
 Hey, why don't you have him wear his collar in court and then he'd really be f*cked. 
 What do you want, Mr Kovac? 
 Money and a lot of it. 
 We won't be blackmailed. 
 Yes, you will. We won't call it that. 
 We'll call it a pre-trial settlement, and for our purposes... 
 I was just joking about the blackmail thing. 
 We are merely having a discussion about a pre-trial settlement. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Do you ever go on eHarmony? 
 No. 
 Too bad. You should try it. 
 Wow. Yep. 
 We need to arrange a meeting with the pastor. 
 [* STRUNZ & FARAH: "FORTUNETELLER"] 
 You ever f*ck a stranger in an art gallery? 
 Hm. It's the only place I'd f*ck a stranger. 
 I thought you said there'd be eight people here. 
 Yeah, there were. You're a little late. 
 OK, where's the bathroom? [CHUCKLES] 
 Wow. 
 Yeah, it's just something I found in my hamper. 
 I want to live in your hamper. Quick. No-one's looking. Kiss me. 
 WOMAN: Colin? 
 Mom? Yes, Mom. 
 Here I am in the flesh. 
 Well, who's your friend? She's very sexy. 
 Ha-ha. This is my colleague, Lucca. 
 Lucca, uh... 
 Quinn. Lucca Quinn. Quinn. Lucca Quinn. 
 Francesca Lovatelli. Are you two sleeping with each other? 
 Ah, here we go. I'm not in the habit of prying. 
 It's just that Colin never tells me anything about his personal life. 
 I wonder why. 
 MAN: You said under the green painting. 
 Yes, I did, but look who I found. My son. 
 Hey. Hi, Clarence. 
 You two know each other? Lucca, right? 
 You didn't hire me. Sorry. 
 Clarence, please, meet my son, Colin. This is my new attorney. 
 How are you doing? 
 Mom, what are you doing? Gallery-hopping with your lawyer? 
 CLARENCE: Hey, did you see what Trump is doing? 
 Oh, my God, this country. What happened? 
 CLARENCE: They're thinking of tagging all Muslims. 
 I know, microchips. I'm thinking of becoming Muslim. 
 No. What do you think about that? 
 Ooh, are you a Muslim? Maybe you are? 
 Not a Muslim, Mom. 
 Are you gonna come to the birthday party tomorrow night? 
 -I, uh... Uh... what? Yeah, tomorrow night. 
 Birthday party. 
 LUCCA: I guess someone forgot to mention it to me. 
 Colin's 32 years old, like Jesus, one year away from death. 
 But he still looks like a baby. Look at that skin. 
 Lucca's probably a little busy. No, no. 
 No. No, I... I think I can break that date. 
 Really? Thank you, Lucca. 
 Isn't that just like my son? Always trying to push women away. 
 I know. Isn't that true? I hate it. 
 Did you see what Trump said about African-Americans? 
 This... lawyer has evidence of payments you made to Paul Johnson last year. 
 Three payments totalling $9,000. 
 That's true. 
 So, you made these payments? Was it money to silence Paul? 
 No. DIANE: Well, then, what was it? 
 There's scripture, tells of a traveller beaten, robbed and left at the side of the road. 
 The only man to offer help was a Samaritan, a rival ethnic group. 
 Now, this Samaritan, he cared for this man. 
 That's what I provided, care for someone who needed help, and I will not let him turn that into something obscene. 
 You didn't have a sexual relationship with him? 
 No. 
 All I ever did was help him get on his feet. 
 I'm sorry, I don't believe him, Carl, and that's how I know we are not the right firm for this case. 
 Now you only defend people that you believe? 
 When the other shoe drops and more Pauls come forward, we're gonna wish we were nowhere near involved with this. 
 We are gonna take this case. 
 We cannot afford to be on the wrong side of this. 
 Now, think about this. 
 Black pastor rapes 17 year old child? Carl. 
 I'm invoking Article Four. 
 What? Excuse me? 
 I'm demanding a full partnership vote for the leadership of this firm. 
 We're going in another direction. 
 Uh-huh, and you're the new direction? Is that it? Seriously? 
 Yeah, I'm taking my firm back. You've driven it into the ground and in this day and age we can't afford to let it drift. 
 You got old, Carl... and you're betraying me right now. 
 But you know what? I still honour you. 
 Everything you've done in the past. 
 Truly. Now you need to go. 
 You make those inspirational speeches and you take every bit of that applause, ‘cause you have earned it. 
 But as far as the future's concerned, you got to let us take it from here, Carl. 
 You know, I've been called old for about 20 years now. 
 Every time somebody says that to me, I smile, because they are underestimating me. 
 But you know what? 
 You forgot the lessons I taught you. 
 You forgot those lessons. Now, you be careful. 
 This old man may just kick your ass. 
 Yeah, I guess you can understand what if feels like to, uh... have a firm that bears your name but lost your mission. 
 I've had my experience with that, yes. 
 So, you can understand why I'm doing what I'm doing. 
 Now, there's gonna be a full vote of the partners and I need your help so I can get my firm back. 
 We once stood for something important, Barbara, and the only thing we stand for now is making money and as far as I'm concerned, that means we stand for nothing. 
 Vote with me, Barbara. Vote with me, please. 
 Hm? Adrian, he'll have his input, but he's the head and you're the heart, as far as I'm concerned. 
 Help me put the heart first. 
 Now, you know, uh... we're having a vote. 
 Managing partner? 
 Yes, I heard. 
 Why don't you check out the lay of the land for me? 
 See who's voting for who. 
 Uh... look, I don't want to get in the middle of this. 
 I hope you understand... No, I... I know, I know. 
 Why don't you, uh... 
 ...put your ear to the ground? 
 Mr Reddick asked me to find out about this addict coming after Pastor Jeremiah. 
 Go ahead and do it, but not too many billable hours. 
 JAY: Understood. 
 He did ask me about a likely head-count for the vote on managing partner. 
 Is that something you have a problem doing? 
 Not at all. 
 I just wanted to see how accurate you wanted me to be in what I report back to him. 
 There but for the grace of God. 
 Hm. 
 Miss Lockhart. Nice to see you. 
 Welcome. And you're not Marissa. Where is, uh... where is Marissa? 
 Marissa's my assistant. This is Maia. 
 Maia, hello. Pretty red hair. I had a dog with red hair. 
 Please sit down, sit down. 
 I am just finishing up a round of Candy Crush and I just... I have to finish this. If I don't finish... 
 I'm just gonna be a bit of a... Hold on a second. Sorry. 
 God damn it. 
 Not my day today. 
 Mr Kovac, we've looked into the payments you told us about, from Pastor Jeremiah to Paul, and we're satisfied that there is an innocent explanation. 
 We're not gonna offer Mr Johnson any money. That's final. 
 Really? And who are you again? 
 Maia. Hm. 
 You keep sending out white lawyers. Why is that? 
 Yes, Mr Kovac, we're very impressed with your street smarts, but you have to stop riding the Anti-lvy League thing. 
 You either have the evidence or not. 
 OK. You'll have to explain this. 
 This is the security footage from inside the halfway house, and take a look at that time stamp. 
 Pastor Jeremiah goes into Paul's room at 11 o'clock at night and he comes back out at... 
 ...11.30. 
 That's a half-hour. Mm-hm? 
 [SUCKS] 
 Mm-hm. Yeah, yeah, I may not be polite, but... but people are worse than you expect. 
 Pastors rape little boys! 
 [SIGHS] Even clichés happen. 
 It was a drug test. 
 A drug test that only targeted Paul? 
 You didn't go into anybody else's room that night. 
 Well, there was a report that Paul, and only Paul, had a late-night visitor, perhaps a drug dealer, so I went into his room to give him a drug test. 
 This was standard procedure? Yes. 
 We have kits on site that we use. 
 I wasn't in his room for any other reason. 
 Can you play it again? Sure. 
 The reverend is the one who put this security video in. 
 He wanted to make sure no-one flaunted the rules. 
 It's insane to think he'd go into somebody's room without a reason. 
 JAY: Stop. There. Go back. 
 There's a time jump. You're missing almost an hour of footage. 
 That can't happen. 
 But look. The time code, it jumps an hour. 
 Jeremiah is a good man. He takes care of us. 
 He even takes us for long walks every morning. 
 It helps us clear our heads, keeps us in shape. 
 Why are you saying that? I'm not saying any different. 
 A lot of people want religious people brought down. 
 They don't like God or they don't like people who believe in God. 
 I just want to know the truth. 
 Then die. 
 [SCOFFS] That's how you know the truth. 
 Die, and God'll tell you. 
 MARISSA: So, there's an hour missing. What does that mean? 
 I don't know. Either someone is covering for the reverend, or Paul Johnson and his lawyer don't want us to see that his dealer entered the room. Yeah. 
 Wait, freeze. 
 It's a laptop. Just press the space button. 
 Do you want me to enhance? What? 
 I was just thinking I'm pretty good at your job. 
 I think I'll go for a detective licence. 
 Congratulations. What? 
 Do you see this? It's a Fitbit. 
 When you go on my website, you can find when I was asleep, when I was awake, when I was walking, how far I went. 
 Look. 
 OK. I'll sponsor you for a detective's licence. 
 Really? Sure. Tell me when. 
 I wasn't able to recover the deleted security footage, but Marissa noticed Paul was wearing a fitness tracker. 
 Hi, I'm Marissa. Hi. 
 Jeremiah gifted everyone at the halfway house one. 
 To emphasise healthy living. 
 They monitor your heart rate, count your steps. 
 I used to think they were stupid but now I have one. See. 
 The reverend set up an activity group for the tenants to compete, which means we have access to all of Paul's data. 
 This is what Paul was doing? 
 Not everything but some. 
 It looks like Paul was sleeping until... 
 You see that spike there? That's when Jeremiah knocked and woke him up. 
 MARISSA: This doesn't rule out s*x. 
 Not until you compare the data side by side. 
 Paul's heart rate is slowly increasing. 
 Jeremiah's is decreasing. That's not two people having s*x. 
 Would you excuse me? One second. 
 Either Jeremiah somehow drugged himself and still managed to take advantage of Paul, or... 
 Or Paul is lying. 
 Amy, what's wrong? I don't know. 
 Maybe nothing. I couldn't get a hold of you. 
 Dad's been calling me so I've been screening. 
 Yeah, he called home three times. 
 Every time I silenced it, he called back so I had to answer. 
 He told me he's always considered me family and then thanked me for being so good to you. 
 He was sobbing. What? 
 It sounded like goodbye. 
 I think you should call him. 
 Yeah.

 I love these two people more than anyone in the world. 
 I just want them to be happy and the best chance of that happening is for me to clear out and let them". 
 Look, he made me swear I wouldn't tell you he tried to do it. 
 You can't say anything. 
 [WOMAN TALKS OVER TANNOY] 
 How's Henry? 
 Go away. 
 I just wanna check on... Go away. 
 JAY: With the vote six hours away, here is where we stand. 
 Evelyn says her expense allowance is stingy. 
 Stingy? She'd like an increase. 
 And Mark feels the firm has lost track of its civil rights roots. 
 I love how Mr Reddick talks, truly. 
 But we do more good in the world, we have the capital to do good. 
 Trump's America is not my America. Is it yours? 
 We gotta keep on fighting. 
 Now that we're making more money, we don't have to be so stingy on the expense accounts. 
 That's the way we felt like in, uh... Selma, you know. 
 We figured it out. There's an easier way to live. 
 [WHISPERS] Each one of us is not as strong as we are collectively, right? 
 Is that fair enough? That's not rocket science. 
 Hi. The... the gentleman behind me. 
 WOMAN: [OVER TANNOY] Wheelchair to the hospital main entrance. 
 [INDISTINCT] 
 Sorry. 
 Aw! 
 As you can see, Mr Kovac, these are the read-outs from the two fitness trackers... I hate this thing. 
 ...and the breathing doesn't match. 
 Your client's heart rate is increasing and Pastor Jeremiah's is decreasing. 
 That is not indicative of sexual relations. 
 Oh, my God, you got me. 
 If I were you I would drop this suit, sir, or you'll be facing a devastating counter-suit. 
 You know the only problem you have, Diane? 
 I can't wait. 
 Paul can identify a distinguishing mark on the good pastor's dick. 
 Now, that is indicative of sexual relations. 
 You still want to counter-sue and take this to open court, hm? 
 You... you just let me know. 
 1 will not disrobe. 
 ADRIAN: It's the easiest way to prove him wrong, Rev. 
 Now, you don't have a birthmark on your pen1s? 
 No, I don't. So, he's lying? 
 Yes. 
 DIANE: The difficulty is, Pastor, if you don't disrobe, this will make you look guilty. 
 I understand that. I am not disrobing. 
 You can take the camera and take a photo of yourself. 
 I spent my whole life fighting, fighting for the dignity that was denied our forebears. 
 They were treated like this. 1 will not be. 
 That's what he's counting on, this little, uh... piss-ant. 
 He's blackmailing you and he's counting on the fact that you have too much pride to prove that he's a liar. 
 Then he's smart and accurate, because I won't. 
 ADRIAN: Then I think you should pay him. 
 He's gonna ruin your reputation, Reverend. 
 All that dignity that you fought for, it would disappear like that. 
 Do you believe him? It's about what we can prove. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 Reverend, I have been around too long to know better than to expect anything from my heroes other than feet of clay. 
 I don't care one way or the other. I just wanna beat this son of a bitch. 
 The fitness tracker links to an app which tracks your routes, like this. 
 That's me running around the office, talking to all the assistants. 
 And? 
 I was able to pull up Paul Johnson's tracking data for the past two months. 
 JAY: When Paul goes jogging, it's fairly random. 
 No two routes appear to be the same. 
 But about two weeks ago, a pattern started to emerge. 
 Two or three times a week, Paul's routes included a pit stop at Kovac's office. 
 Well, he's his lawyer. 
 No, Paul didn't claim to have a lawyer until we served him the eviction notice. 
 Good. 
 We need to look deeper into Kovac, any lawsuits, past crimes. 
 See what you can find. 
 Perfect timing. Yeah. 
 JAY: Uh... Miss Stanway? Yes? 
 Hi. We're from the law firm Reddick Boseman. 
 We were wondering if we can ask you a few questions about Gabe Kovac. 
 You sued him for an assault. 
 We settled and I dropped the charges. 
 Can you tell us what happened? I signed a non-disclosure agreement. 
 What if we promised not to tell? 
 Hey, you never know. Sorry. 
 Why would Kovac have you sign an NDA? 
 He didn't. His lawyer did and it wasn't with him. 
 It was with his employer, First Charter Choice. 
 First Charter Choice. What's that? 
 It's an alt-right cause. 
 OK, am I missing something? No, but I was. 
 Who are you calling? Adrian. 
 They're going into negotiations. Come on. 
 Got it, Jay. Thanks. 
 Good work. JAY: Any time. 
 Oh. Uh... come on in, gentlemen. 
 So, I guess you finally came to your senses and are ready to settle. 
 Are you at all familiar with rule 1.7 of the ARDC Code of Ethics, Mr Kovac? 
 It's been a while since I studied for the Bar. 
 Why don't, uh... why don't you sum it up for me? 
 Conflicts of interest between attorneys and their clients may result in disbarment. 
 Do I have a kind of conflict of interest with Paul? 
 We're aware that you have done business with, uh... 
 Mr Selkirk's right-wing legal foundation, First Charter Choice. 
 And we're also aware that Selkirk subsidised this lawsuit to embarrass the good reverend. 
 You're taking money from the alt right and you edited the drug dealer from that video. 
 You know what? 
 I think we're, uh... we're about done here. 
 And we are prepared to file a civil suit against you and your client for extortion. 
 Have a good day now! 
 [LAUGHING] 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] 
 [CAR LOCK BEEPS] 
 Why aren't you answering my calls? 
 I've been busy. My family is insane. 
 Why do you think I didn't introduce you to them earlier? 
 This isn't about your family. 
 It's about this relationship. It's run its course. 
 I disagree. That's your right. 
 I'm not sure what you're looking for, but I'm not her. 
 I'm not an accessory. I'm not a trophy. 
 I'm sure as hell not a wife. 
 And I never treated you that way and if anyone ever does, they have no place in my life. 
 You're making this a bigger deal than it needs to be. 
 I don't like your tone. There is no tone. 
 We had fun. 
 We both knew it wasn't for life. We don't do for life. 
 I have to go. 
 [SOBS] 
 [SNIFFS] 
 Imani's voting for Reddick, but you have Calvin Story, Eunice and Tommy Neville. 
 By my count, you're up one. 
 Good. Thank you. Julius. Saved you a seat. 
 f*cking Julius? JULIUS: Thanks, Carl. 
 Carl, Julius Cain is leaving the firm. 
 He is ineligible to vote. 
 Article 12, sub-section D puts forth that full voting rights will remain in force through the last day of the partner's pay period, which, I believe, is Thursday. 
 Then shall we commence, uh... casting the ballots? 
 [CARL CLEARS THROAT] 
 11 for Adrian and 12 for Carl. 
 I want the room polled. 
 CARL: For what reason? You lost. 
 I wanna vote for the removal of Adrian Boseman. 
 BARBARA: Wait. 
 I didn't vote, but I want to now. 
 Ah, it's too late. No, it's not. 
 BARBARA: Carl, you said this was a battle between the firm's heart and its head, but it's not. 
 It's about the past or the future. 
 Your past glories have a lot to teach us. 
 But this... this is now. 
 The fights are now and Adrian knows how to fight them. 
 I vote for Adrian. 
 So, here we are. We're split. 
 Yep. 50-50. This should be fun. 
 Huh. That's the trouble with the world today, yes? 
 You think the fights are different, huh? But you're wrong. 
 They're exactly the same. 
 [* MUDDY WATERS: "I FEEL LIKE GOING HOME"] 
 May 1? 
 To idealism. 
 Hm. And pragmatism. 
 I Late on into the evening and I feel like I Like blowing my home 
 I Whoo-hoo, well, boy, gonna stop her low-down ways...
