 I When you walk I The way that you walk 
 ♪ And you move I The way that you do I Your smile... Try a water bath canner. 
 I'm sorry? For low-acid foods. 
 It's better than a regular pot. Trust me. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 No, that's crazy. Just reduce the sugar content. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Maia, we have a fertility case. Family law. Important client. 
 OK, good. You OK? 
 Yeah. Just weird conversation in the elevator. What do you need? 
 All precedences on fertility-clinic reversion clauses. 
 Good. I'm on it. 
 And tell me if you're getting some bad-mouthing. 
 If I'm getting...? Well, people say things. 
 You know, sometimes people don't know better. 
 Is someone saying something? No. 
 I mean, no more than what you said. 
 What did I say? BARBARA: Lucca. 
 It's not your Twitter feed, is it? 
 What? It's not your Twitter feed. 
 I feel like I'm missing something here. 
 "It's hard to get excited about work when people call you lesbo behind your back." 
 Oh, my God. What? 
 Yeah, it's your name. See? Maia Rindell. 
 And you talk about your parents and your dad going to jail... 
 But I... That's not me. 
 Well, then I'd talk to someone, because, I mean, look. 
 "lI love canning peaches best. Anyone know why they stick to the side?" 
 What on earth? You're really into canning fruit. 
 I don't know why. Who's doing this? Oh, my God. 
 Yeah, you get pretty explicit. "When I go down on my girlf..." 
 Oh, my God. Yeah. You have a lot of fans too. 
 #Wetlands. This is... Who's doing this? 
 I don't know. Do you have any enemies? 
 It's the scandal. It's my parents' scandal. 
 What do I do? Tweet back to her. 
 What? Yeah, see if she says anything. 
 Maybe you can find out who she is. Here, use my account. 
 "I'm gay and like canning too. We should meet up.” 
 I want my eggs back. 
 OK. And who has them? 
 The Lake Drive Fertility Clinic. [KNOCKING] 
 Laura, this is our newest partner, Diane Lockhart. 
 Diane, this is Laura Salano, one of our oldest clients. 
 "Oldest"? My God, there's gotta be a better word than that. 
 First clients. Sorry. First and best. 
 Oh, better. 
 So when I first moved here, I needed money, remember? 
 And some Highland Park couple gave me $20,000 for my eggs. 
 We drew up that contract, right? Yes. 
 And you said there was some boilerplate in there about a reversion clause. 
 If they didn't use the eggs in a few years, um... 
 "If the intended parents' desire to gestate the resulting embryos to term is not completed within five years, then all ova, henceforth known as "property" will revert back to donor.” LAURA: Good. Exactly. So it's been eight years. They're mine, right? 
 BARBARA: Yes, according to the contract. We just need to notify them. 
 I'll get on it today. Are you planning to implant? 
 I want a child. 
 After last March, after the scare, 1 didn't think I'd get to this moment. 
 And you're well now? Yes. Um, ovarian cancer. 
 But I have a clean bill of health and I just can't get pregnant, so these eggs, they're my only chance. 
 It's just weird how your priorities change. 
 I'm sorry. I sound like a tampon commercial right now. 
 Well, let me see what I can do. BARBARA: Thanks, Diane. 
 So you're expanding? 
 Girl... Explain. 
 Who was that? That man? I don't know. Want me to find out? 
 Yes. 
 Uh, no, wait. Don't go into Mr Boseman's office. 
 You all right? Yeah. Sorry. 
 ADRIAN: All right. 
 Mike Kresteva. You sure? 
 I can go back. No, no. 
 What is he doing here? I don't know. I can ask. 
 No. Uh, Marissa, wait. 
 No, OK. Tell Adrian I need to talk to him. 
 Can't seem to get... [KNOCKING] 
 Diane needs a word with you. Now? 
 ADRIAN: Excuse me. 
 What's wrong? Mike Kresteva. What's he doing here? 
 1 don't know. We hadn't gotten that far yet. 
 You know him? 
 One of the partners at my firm, Alicia Florrick, knew him. 
 He made her life hell. OK. 
 Is there some specific reason you needed to interrupt the meeting? 
 Be careful, Adrian. Seriously. He's not straightforward. 
 OK. 
 Thank you. Thank you, Diane. 
 But... I can handle myself. 
 Want me to do something? Oh, yes. 
 Get Lake Drive Fertility Clinic on the line. 
 So what can I do for you, Mr Kresteva? 
 Well, I was just made special counsel in charge of the Department of Justice Police Accountability in the 21st Century Task Force. 
 That's a mouthful. Yeah, it is. 
 And I even left out the word "Chicago". 
 DOJP ATCTF have been asked for recommendations on how to curb police brutality in Chicago. 
 Well, you could start by putting brutal cops in jail. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Now, why didn't I think of that? 
 Nothing yet? Not yet. 
 Should we write again? No, we'll sound desperate. 
 We already suggested we meet. 
 Whoa. What? 
 She tweeted back. What? 
 "What do you look like? #WetlandSEX." 
 Oh. What are you gonna say? 
 I'll send a photo. What, of you? 
 No, I have a photo stream. No one sends photos of themselves. 
 Here's one. 
 Ask her to send a photo back. 
 What's the investigator's name? Jay DiPersia. Want me to get him? 
 Yes, and Lucca too. 
 [COMPUTER CHIMES] Marissa? You got something. 
 That was fast. Mmm. 
 MARISSA: Wow. You sent an attachment too. You're a saucy wench. 
 [GASPS] 
 What? That's me. 
 MARISSA: Really? Do you know who took them? 
 KRESTEVA: Diane Lockhart. 
 Mike Kresteva. Well, this feels like old times. 
 And what line are you selling today, Mike? 
 Why is everybody so suspicious of me? 
 I just walked into your office. I haven't even said anything. 
 So say something. OK. 
 I'm on your side. And what side is that? 
 The side hoping to curb police brutality. 
 I've just been made special counsel. 
 Good. Congratulations. [CHUCKLES] 
 That was genuine. Any advice? 
 No. 
 Diane, I think you'll learn that I've changed. 
 I'm a new person. 
 How is your son doing, Mike? 
 Well, he, uh... passed. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. 
 About a year ago. 
 Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
 Don't worry, he wasn't in pain or anything. 
 And he got to graduate high school, which was his dream. 
 Got a diploma. It was the proudest moment of his life. 
 Mike, I... 
 I'm so sorry. I... I can't imagine. 
 All he wanted was to make the world a better place. 
 That's why I took this job. 
 And if we can stop police brutality cases, then that's a pretty good start, right? 
 Anyway... let me know if you change your mind. 
 Mmm. 
 [KNOCKING] 
 A problem with the fertility clinic. 
 They say they have no record of a Laura Salano ever donating there. 
 Diane Lockhart, please. 
 I'm not sure how we can help you, Ms Lockhart. 
 At a certain age, fertility... [LAUGHS] 
 I'm not here for myself. I'm here for a client. 
 Oh. You're an egg broker? No, a lawyer. 
 You used to be the Lake Drive Fertility Clinic, Doctor? 
 Yes, years ago. Actually, two years ago. 
 OK. I would call that years ago. 
 Lake Drive had financial troubles. We don't. How may I help you again? 
 We called on behalf of our client, Laura Salano. 
 You have 12 eggs of hers in storage. 
 Actually, that was Lake Drive who had them in storage, the fertility clinic we replaced. 
 You mean the fertility clinic in the same building, with the same medical director... you? 
 Yes. Is there anything else you might need, ma'am? 
 Mmm. The location of the eggs. 
 You see, this contract was with Lake Drive. 
 It was voided the day Lake Drive closed its doors. 
 No, sir, this contract required that you contact our client if ever you were to close your doors. 
 Well, the eggs are gone. We flushed out the system when we reopened. 
 Then you can expect our filing. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. We did nothing wrong here. 
 You're welcome to sue Lake Drive but not us. 
 No, we will be suing you personally, Doctor. 
 You are in charge of a clinic with the same facilities and the same director? 
 My guess is you don't want the Secretary of State's office looking closely into a fraudulent transfer. 
 OK, hold on. 
 [TYPING] 
 Laura? Salano. 
 DOCTOR: OK, they were sent to Chicago Poly-Tech for humanitarian reasons. 
 MAN: You're saying the ovum ended up here by mistake? 
 Yes, from Lake Drive. Pardon? 
 From Lake Drive Fertility. It was donated accidentally. 
 Ah. And you want to know where they are. Well, let's see. 
 Yes, they were transferred to our stem cell research lab. 
 Good. Where is that? Where is that?! 
 Oh, you won't find them still there. 
 No, they've already been fertilised and D&Ded. 
 D&Ded? Yeah, discarded and destroyed. 
 All 11 of them. I'm sorry. 
 Wait. There were 12. No, 11. There were 11... 
 No, there were 12 donated. Where is the 12th egg?! 
 Ah, it's marked "confidential". What? What is?! 
 The egg. Can you understand what I'm saying? 
 Sometimes I find it difficult to hear myself. 
 No, I can hear you. 
 But you're a public institution, Doctor. Why is it marked confidential? 
 No, it doesn't look like rain. 
 So one of my eggs still exists, but we don't know where? 
 Yes, it was listed as confidential. 
 But none of the others were? No. 
 BARBARA: Why would they keep one egg hidden? 
 Patient confidentiality? 
 Do any of the Poly-Tech researchers see patients? 
 I can't tell you. It's listed as confidential. 
 Can you at least tell us which teaching doctors see patients? 
 What? 
 Can you tell us which doctors see patients?! 
 Oh, thank you, but it's not lunchtime yet. 
 Do you know we're lawyers, Doctor? Pardon? 
 Do you know that we're lawyers? 
 Never mind. Thanks for your help. 
 October. 
 DIANE: The ovum that you have, Dr Norwood, it belongs to our client, and she wants it back. 
 What's your evidence of that? This contract. 
 This acknowledgment of the transfer of 12 eggs from Lake Drive. 
 The genome labs' acknowledgement that they transferred one egg to you. 
 And why do you want the ovum? 
 She needs her egg back to fertilise it. 
 Regrettably, here's the problem. 
 LUCCA: You've already destroyed it? No, we've already fertilised it. 
 One more smile. OK. 
 One more smile. Look at Mom. 
 Just one more smile. 
 Tell me if you need me to say anything, because I could just stand here being intimidating, frowning like this. 
 Great. No, great. Now, keep smiling. Look at me. 
 And just turn your head a little bit to the left. 
 Just give me a second. I'll be right back. 
 What do you want? I want you to stop harassing me. 
 I'm not doing anything. You came into my shop. 
 Stop pretending, Ted. It has your photographs. 
 The photographs I let you take of me. You linked them to... 
 OK, Maia, I don't know what the hell you're talking about, but why don't you make an appointment... 
 She wants to talk to you now. 
 So this is your new girlfriend? No, but that shouldn't matter. 
 I mean, I'm not gay, but I could be. 
 It's harassment, Ted. 
 I'm a lawyer, and I could sue you for everything you have. 
 You mean all this? Wow. 
 It was four years ago. Get over it. lam over it. 
 I met someone. So whatever it is that you think that I'm doing... 
 [PHONE CHIMES] 
 You're the only one who had these photos, Ted. 
 It's a Twitterbot. Oh, Jesus. 
 I got it up and running two years ago. 
 It's just getting attention now because of the Ponzi scheme. 
 What's a Twitterbot? 
 A program that imitates a Twitter feed. 
 That's why the interest in canning fruit. 
 It's programmed to take on characteristics of hobbyist sites. 
 Adds personality. OK, so turn it off. 
 If you invented this bot, turn it off. 
 If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself. 
 It's pretending to be me. So just ignore it. 
 You're an asshole. 
 You're the one who broke up with me. Tell your girlfriend to fix it. 
 It's very adult, Maia. It's very adult! 
 Yeah, my girlfriend's pretty tough. 
 Ms Lockhart. Ms Rindell. 
 BOTH: Yes? You've been served. 
 Somebody here for me? Mr Boseman. 
 Yeah? You've been served. 
 Come on, you kidding me? By who? Kresteva. 
 And can one of you point me in the direction of a Ms Lucca Quinn? 
 Good luck with the grand jury. 
 How long do you want me to say? 20 minutes. You got a backup. 
 Got it. 
 Here they come. 
 Eight-ouncer, Mike, extra onions. How long you got? 
 15. Judge is not happy. 
 It'll take 20. I got a backup. Oh, come on. 
 Hey, it's not justice. It's burgers. They take time. 
 Extra onions, peppers? Of course. 
 Forget it, Mike. So you've been waiting in here all day for me to come in? 
 Yep, your charm is that irresistible. 
 You wanna know what I think? Can't wait. 
 You couldn't wait to see me again. 
 That's why the burger's already cut in half. 
 You got me. This is a bad habit, isn't it? 
 You teasing me, me grinning and teasing you back? 
 It's easy. As opposed to? 
 The truth? This should be interesting. Go. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Last year I went to see a therapist. Dr Gilbert. 
 My problem was that my relationships never lasted more than three weeks. 
 I wanted to know if the problem was me or them. 
 Oh, it has to be them. 
 Well, Dr Gilbert said that the ease of my life had made me treat things superficially and that what I needed to do was refrain from the thing that I loved the most for a full year. 
 God, this is such sh1t. 
 Every word I'm telling you is the truth. 
 At 8:30pm on March 14th, the year will be up. 
 And you're looking for someone to share this deep experience with you? 
 Mm-hm, yeah, laugh if you will, but I need a woman who is able to enjoy what I have. 
 Someone to share your bed with, someone to show you the true meaning of love? 
 No, God, no. No. 
 I'm looking for someone to share a milkshake at Scooter's Frozen Custard. 
 Been a very long, hard year. 
 God, they are good. Mmm. 
 Mmm. s*x is transient. 
 But a Boston Shake... OK. Am I being invited? 
 Yeah. Next Tuesday. Afterwards we could have s*x. 
 What's this? 
 It's a subpoena authorised by the DOJ for me and my firm. 
 So is this why you came in here today? 
 Yes. 
 As fascinating as I find you, Colin, I need to know what Mike Kresteva's up to. 
 This is from Kresteva? Yeah. Why? 
 He was just given the police brutality study. 
 Yes. So why is he after us? 
 I don't know. I'll check it out. 
 Thanks for the burger. You're welcome. 
 You sold me out, Mike! 
 OK, I think I helped here. With the Twitter account? 
 Yeah. Was that the first time you ever slapped anyone? 
 Yeah, I guess it was. 
 Anyway, I contacted Twitter and told them it was a Twitterbot imitating you, and they froze it until they review it. 
 That's great. 1 didn't even realise you could do that. 
 I didn't either. 
 The problem, Laura, is the last remaining ova has already been fertilised. 
 By who? That's the question. We don't know. 
 We located it at Chicago Poly-Tech, in the genetics lab, and we're bringing them to court. 
 There might be a good case here, but... 
 Do you wanna fight it? 
 Knowing that you won't be able to choose the genetic father. 
 Your ova has already been fertilised by someone. 
 Someone you may have to fight. 
 What a load of sh1t. Ms Hoff, always good to see you. 
 She really doesn't care who the father is? 
 Laura, this should be between the lawyers. 
 My guess is you're representing the family? 
 I'm representing the owners of the fertilised embryo. 
 No, you're representing the co-owner. We are representing the other co-owner. 
 She abandoned ownership. Contractually, she retained ownership. 
 My clients knew nothing of that contract. 
 That doesn't negate that contract. 
 As far as my clients are concerned, it does. 
 Your beef is with whoever voided the contract... 
 Everything all right? Yeah, I just wanna see who the dad is. 
 He'll be on the other side, right? 
 I think so. 
 The next person through those doors will be the father of my child. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 The next male through those doors will be the father of my child. 
 My client is willing to pay for you to find another egg donor. 
 How gracious. They are happy with this one. 
 Oh, come on. They have other opportunities. 
 She just has this one egg. Your client can fertilise a lot of eggs. 
 And we're willing to offer $18,500 to pay for another egg donor. 
 This family has spent years looking for a donor. 
 And we will pay for them to find another. Why does this one matter? 
 What do you think? I think that's the father to my baby. 
 LUCCA: Do you wanna keep fighting? 
 There's a kid I plan to raise and send to college. 
 18 years from now, he or she will be mine. 
 I don't see anybody else raising him. 
 Good. That's what we need to hear. 
 MAN: All rise! Let's all take our seats, please. 
 I've read your briefs. I know there's a lot of passion... 
 [ELECTRONIC CHIME] 
 [ELECTRONIC CHIME] 
 [ELECTRONIC CHIME] 
 Let me see your phone. 
 It's... It's not my phone, Your Honour. It's, uh... It's this watch. 
 Let me see it. 
 Yeah, yeah. It's just a... Just a... 
 Oh, sh... Your Honour. 
 The plaintiff would like an emergency injunction against implantation? 
 There is some question about the ownership. 
 The plaintiff relinquished ownership when she sold her ova for $20,000. 
 No, she has contractual control after five years. 
 My clients knew nothing about that contract. 
 If the plaintiff had loaned her car to a third party and that third party sold the car to us, the plaintiff's disagreement is with the third party, not with us. 
 It's not a car, Your Honour. This is an embryo. 
 An embryo that is co-owned by two parents. 
 Not two parents. That personalises... My client's DNA... 
 JUDGE: OK, OK, OK. 
 1 will grant a temporary injunction against implantation merely to give both of you time to present evidence. 
 Please return tomorrow... 
 Your Honour, my clients have a trip planned to England next week. 
 If this matters to them, they'll stay. Adjourned. 
 Excuse me. Your Honour, can I have my watch back? 
 [COMPUTER CHIMES] 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Hi. Hi. It's Yesha. 
 Yeah, I just read an article. 
 Are you about to get fired? What? 
 There's an article on American News insisting that you are being fired from your law firm. 
 What? No! Why? 
 It says that your accusations of anti-gay bias have angered your bosses. 
 Wait. Hold on. 
 ADRIAN: Yeah? 
 Am I being fired? 
 What? Am I being fired? 
 I barely even know who you are. So I'm not? 
 You're not. Go. 
 Thank you. 
 No, it's a lie. I'm not being fired. I just got a new Google alert. 
 It says that you've just bought $350,000 in jewellery. 
 What?! What? 
 It's my ex-boyfriend. He's at it again. 
 KRESTEVA: Diane. Hi. Hello. 
 Thank you for appearing in front of our grand jury today. 
 No thanks are necessary. I was subpoenaed. I had no choice. 
 Well, thank you anyway. 
 Did I visit your office yesterday? You did. 
 Did I ask you about police brutality cases in Chicago? 
 You did. 
 And did I ask you for suggestions on how to address this issue? 
 Yes, you did. And you chose not to answer. 
 I wasn't certain of your motives. My... 
 What could be wrong with my motives? 
 I think you tend to lie. 
 Your firm makes a lot of money on these police brutality cases. 
 Is that a question? Yeah, it is. 
 Define "a lot of money". 30% of its annual income. 
 Well, I'm new to the firm. I think it's best that you ask Mr Boseman. 
 When I asked you about your firm's attitude about police brutality, did you not say that the problem was the people of Cook County hated African-Americans? 
 Would you like me to repeat the question? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 When I asked you if your firm's motives were pure, did you not say the problem is that Cook County hated African-Americans and treated black lives carelessly? 
 No. 
 You did not say that? No, I said nothing like it. 
 Are you saying that my notes from our meeting are incorrect? 
 Your notes on our meeting are bizarrely incorrect. 
 Well, would you be kind enough to show me where I was mistaken? 
 Well, you came into my office, you explained the nature of your task force, we spoke about your son, and that was it. 
 I don't know where you got this quote, but not a single word of it is accurate. 
 Really? 
 And we spoke about my son? Why would we speak about my son? 
 I asked you how he was. 
 My son who died? You... asked me how he was? 
 Yes. I didn't know that he had passed. 
 How long was I in your office? 
 Six minutes, approximately. 
 And you're saying that I spent the majority of that time talking about my son? 
 Yes. 
 Really? Yes. 
 He's setting us up. 
 Why? 
 He wants to reduce the number of police brutality cases but not by reducing police brutality... by reducing the number of cases. 
 He wants to reduce us? Uh-huh. 
 But he can't, can he? 
 What does your AUSA say? 
 Yeah, he lies. 
 Does your boss know that? 
 Well, everyone lies. 
 But Kresteva is lying about us. 
 He's saying we said things that we didn't. 
 All right, here's what I could do. 
 I could argue your case to the assistant attorney general, Wilbur Dincon. 
 
 
 
 He controls Kresteva's agenda. 
 You're serious? Yeah. Why? 
 I don't know. 
 You're being nice. Well, I'm drinking. 
 I'm nice when I drink. Really? 
 Mmm. I'm mean. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 You wanna go back to my place? 
 No. Why? 
 That would make this seem like a quid pro quo, and you don't want that. 
 Why don't I want that? 
 Because, for the first time, you seem like a good guy. 
 Don't ruin it. 
 Anyway, we have a date for a milkshake. 
 f*ck, I hate being a good guy. [LAUGHS] 
 You may continue. DIANE: Thank you, Your Honour. 
 Dr Norwood, let's turn to this embryo. 
 Oh, um, excuse me, Your Honour. 
 Norwood is going to England next week too, just like the Haights. 
 Counsellor, do you have something more for this witness? 
 Yes, I do. Are you travelling to England next week, Dr Norwood? 
 HOFF: Objection. Are the doctor's travel arrangements really necessary? 
 I don't know. Are they? 
 DIANE: They are, Your Honour. They are. 
 Are you going to England to implant this embryo into Mrs Haight? 
 Yes. Why in England? Why not in America? 
 Well, it's a procedure that's approved of in England. 
 So this is a procedure that is illegal in America? 
 Well, I wouldn't put it that way. What way would you put it? 
 It's not approved of in America. 
 OK, well, why don't you explain this procedure? 
 NORWOOD: Mrs Haight has the genetic marker for Leigh syndrome. 
 It's a severe neurological disorder that results in the death of the child. 
 The procedure considered permissible in England is called mitochondrial DNA replacement. 
 What is that? And, please, explain it to me like I'm an eight-year-old. 
 Ms Salano's embryo has no trace of Leigh syndrome. It's clean. 
 We take genes from that embryo and place those genes in a new fertilised egg, the embryo belonging to Mrs Haight. 
 In that way, Mrs Haight has an embryo without Leigh syndrome. 
 What happens with the first embryo? 
 That one, Ms Salano's embryo, is used for its genetic contribution, that's all. 
 Then it's destroyed? It's not destroyed. 
 It's no longer viable. They don't want my baby. 
 They just wanna use some of my genes to make their baby whole? 
 Ma'am, let your lawyers ask the questions. 
 Can you answer her question, Doctor? 
 It's not a question of this baby or that. 
 Everything is a potentiality at this point. 
 The Haights' potential embryo needs to be made whole with the genetic material from this other embryo. 
 So you would destroy Laura's chance of creating life by taking her embryo and raiding it for its genes? 
 I don't like the word "raiding". JUDGE: OK, I get it. 
 We are in some very odd areas of contract law now. 
 No, this is about life, Your Honour. 
 Actually, no. The existing embryo is property. 
 The only question is, who does it belong to? 
 Does Ms Salano own it or Mr Haight? 
 You bring me evidence tomorrow and we'll decide. 
 Oh, God, I hate this. 
 OK, so, what? 
 The law firm Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad is feeling aggrieved. 
 They feel like the task force is unfairly targeting them. 
 I guess that means me. 
 Yeah, I guess it does. Are you targeting them, Mike? 
 No, I'm targeting police brutality. 
 By targeting the law firm suing the most? 
 That's right. It'll show the greatest progress for the stats. 
 I'm not sure what the problem is here, Colin. 
 Mike's got a strategy. He needs to pursue it. 
 I'm just worried that it's an all African-American firm. 
 It's all black? It's not all black. 
 Diane Lockhart is Caucasian. 
 It just seems like it would be a public relations disaster to go after an all African-American firm, especially to try to curb police brutality suits. 
 We're not just after them for police brutality. 
 OK, what else? 
 I'm developing leads. Well, develop ‘em fast or drop it. 
 You have a lot juicer targets. 
 Yes, sir. Thank you. 
 JAY: It's fake news. The articles about me? 
 Yes. It's click bait. People are angry about your parents' Ponzi scheme. 
 So there's an audience for these kind of articles. 
 It's from my ex-boyfriend? MARISSA: Probably from another bot. 
 It quotes your tweets about being fired... 
 Not mine. The fake tweets. Right. 
 It repackages those tweets and quotes them in an article. 
 So, I mean, how do we stop this? 
 What is this? -ATRO. 
 Awhat? Atemporary restraining order. 
 By order of the Cook County Circuit Court, you must immediately cease generating false news about Maia Rindell until a hearing can be held on the merits of her case against you. 
 You don't know much about computers. 
 I know enough. 
 Cook County Circuit Court has jurisdiction only in Illinois. 
 I bounce my encrypted software through servers in 20 states, Mexico and Japan. 
 Cook County Circuit Court can't enforce this order. No jurisdiction. 
 We've hit the limits of the legal system. 
 There's really nothing we can do? Not legally. 
 Wait. Are you trying to tell me there's something I can do illegally? 
 No. 
 Sounded like that to me. Me too. 
 OK, look, I can't be a party to whatever this is. I have to go. 
 Do you have any ideas? 
 [COMPUTER CHIMES] 
 I And you're mine I I say it all the time I From a quarter to nine... [PHONE RINGS] 
 Sweetheart, hi. 
 Hey, just slow down. Of course it's not real. Jesus. 
 How could you even ask me that? 
 Here we go. Keywords "hooker", "butt plug" and "BDSM". 
 Anything else? How about "leash"? 
 Perfect. 
 You wanna do the honours? 
 It's not true. None of this stuff is true. 
 Son, you gotta take care of this. It's right here. 
 That's fake news, Roger. I don't care what it is. 
 It was on my Facebook page. "$45,000 missing from liquor store." 
 That doesn't even make sense. I work here. I don't work at a liquor store. 
 But it's your name and your picture. 
 Roger, any hacker could do that. I could do that. 
 Please don't let me go. 
 You gotta go talk to the police, Ted. It says that they're looking for you. 
 Mr Haight, when Dr Norwood found this matching embryo and you paid for the treatment, how much did you pay? 
 Allin, $9,000. 
 And when you paid that amount, did you have any reason to believe that that egg didn't belong to Chicago Poly-Tech? 
 No. 
 Your Honour, my clients are protected by the innocent purchasers doctrine. 
 Even if that egg shouldn't have arrived at Chicago Poly-Tech, it was purchased legally and fairly by my clients. 
 Ms Lockhart, how do you respond? 
 Your Honour, if my client's car were stolen and the Haights were asking your permission... 
 Oh, dear God. Counsellor, this is not a stolen car. 
 At a certain point, analogy fails us. 
 I'm disgusted that I have to use property law to decide issues of life. 
 But the innocent purchaser doctrine holds. 
 The embryo belongs to the Haights. 
 I'm s ol ry. A m s orry. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 You're ruining my life. 
 Get out of here, Ted. I'll call the cops. 
 Yeah, just try it. You are such a bitch, Maia. 
 ADRIAN: Excuse me. 
 Is there something you wanna tell us? 
 This isn't about you. 
 Actually, if it's about Maia, it's about me. 
 Anything else you wanna say? 
 You drop your news articles and I'll drop mine. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Your business is done here. 
 Thank you, Mr Boseman. 
 No problem. 
 At this firm, we stand up for each other, Maia. 
 You all right? 
 She was pretty inconsolable. 
 I know. 
 It's tough. 
 Do you regret not having children? 
 Sometimes. 
 Not often. 
 When are the sometimes? 
 With my husband. 
 I mean, it's too late for us now, but, uh... 
 I look at him and I wonder what... you know, what his son would be like. 
 Or my daughter. 
 Yeah, it's interesting. 
 Most people think I didn't want kids and that's why I made my work my life. 
 But they don't realise, it's... it's really just the opposite. 
 Yes. Work. 
 It's what gives it all meaning. 
 Hmm. 
 The only difference is... kids survive you. 
 That's not always a good thing. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [RINGING TONE] 
 [HANGS UP PHONE] 
 You all right, Ms Lockhart? 
 England. 
 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority? 
 Britain's fertility watchdog. 
 And you called them? LUCCA: We did. 
 How? We dialled 44 and then the number. 
 I mean how in the hell did you manage to drag them into this? 
 Different country, different rules apply. 
 British law says you can't sell your eggs for more than £750. 
 Laura sold hers for $20,000. 
 So you just f*cked us over. 
 Under British law, the sale of these eggs is invalid. 
 What difference does that make? You've ruled on the ownership of the embryo. 
 For the express purpose of taking it to England for this procedure, which they have now been forbidden from doing. 
 Nicholas Haight, Courtney Haight, I take it that your sojourn to England is no longer happening? 
 That is correct, Your Honour. 
 And what do your clients want to do with the embryo? 
 They would like to have it destroyed. 
 Let me see if I can put this in a way that you lawyers will like. 
 Your clients bought a stolen car, and now rather than see it driven by its rightful owner, they wanna bring it to the dump and flatten it. 
 Mr Haight fertilised the egg. 
 It's half his. He doesn't want this child. 
 But I do, Your Honour. 
 Right. And there's the rub. 
 Your clients have no use for this embryo, Ms Hoff. 
 Ms Salano's only chance of conceiving a child is with that same embryo. 
 So it's hers. 
 [BANGS GAVEL] 
 Thank you. Oh, my God, thank you. 
 1 did not think that I was an emotional person, but look at me. 
 It's an emotional thing. 
 Excuse me. 
 If I'm able to get pregnant, I just want you to know that it will be because of you. 
 This child is just as much yours. 
 So, please, if you wanna play a role in my child's life, I would do anything to make that a reality. 
 This child needs to know love. 
 f*ck you. 
 Look. He's still sending them out. Look. There. 
 No, it's not him. Yes, it's him. 
 I mean, it's the same article. He said he was gonna stop, but he hasn't. 
 No, he has. These aren't him. What are you talking about? 
 I've been going on Reddit. 
 They're picking up what your ex-boyfriend dropped. 
 You and your family are not liked there. 
 Oh, dear God. So what do I do? 
 I mean, these articles are out there. They say disgusting things. 
 It's Reddit. That's, like, the teening masses. 
 You don't do anything. What, I can't sue? I can't... 
 Here's what you do. You wanna know? You let it go. 
 -Oh, no, I... Seriously. 
 You have to let it go, ignore it, push it out of your mind. 
 The people who know you know you and they know you wouldn't do this. 
 Come on, you have to trust that. 
 KRESTEVA: Our charge is clear. 
 It's not about police brutality with Reddick Boseman. 
 What have they done? What have their lawyers done? 
 Oh. Here we go. 
 Here's a news article about one of the Reddick Boseman lawyers now. 
 She just spent $350,000 on jewellery. 
 Where did that money come from? Who gave it to her? 
 Now, come on, people, let's go. Let's see what we can dig up! 
 Come on!
