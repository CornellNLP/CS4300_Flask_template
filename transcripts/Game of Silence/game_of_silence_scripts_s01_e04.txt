 Previously, on Game of Silence... 
 We have a witness outside ‭Darryl's home the night he was killed... care to revise that story? 
 They went after my number two. 
 This guy knows enough to come after Darryl, then you might be next. 
 I say we take them all down, and we do it in a way that no one can deny. 
 Ray (over phone) : You really don't want to kick this rock. 
 I know what you did. 
 Jessie : Nobody knows what happened. 
 It's a shame your memory's so spotty, especially when it comes to the warden's little parties. 
 What'd you do, Gil? 
 I shot Bobby. 
 We said we're gonna do this right! 
 We ain't stupid! 
 We got rid of the body. 
 Jackson : You screwed us. 
 We still have a confession on camera! 
 I'm out. 
 Afternoon, ma'am. 
 The nursery guy left that for you. 
 The nursery guy? 
 Jessie : I mean, I always assumed it was horrible at Quitman, just nothing as horrible as what I heard on that tape. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Gil : I want to tell you.

 (laughs) 
 Ah... ‭Nice. 
 ♪ I remember our room ♪ 
♪ And coming home to you... ♪ 
 You okay? 
 Me? I'm never better. No, that's not true. 
 Three times ago when you... we had your hips kind of up over, on my ear, that was good. 
 I'm serious. 
 You know, I just, I mean about... everything. 
 Yeah, I'm good. Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 You're amazing, you know that? 
 I mean, the last few days, just... you know, talking. 
 I never told anyone some of that Quitman stuff. 
 ♪ Hold on to the last... ♪ 
 Thank you. 
 (whispers): Of course. 
 But you could, you know, just, if you ever needed to talk to someone, like, I don't know, a therapist or something, just... 
 A therapist? 
 Yeah. ‭ 
 I'm okay. 
 (groans) Really. 
 (sighs) 
 All good. (groans) 
 I told Shawn I'd meet him at the café, get some coffee, get back to work. 
 Where's the job today? 
 There's no job. 
 Just trying to figure out our next move. 
 Well, what do you mean, your next move? 
 I thought that... 
 We ain't done, baby. 
 There's people need to pay still. 
 Just 'cause Jackson ran off doesn't mean... the plan goes to hell. 
 I'm not worried about Jackson. 
 I'm worried about you. 
 The Bobby Marks thing, what happened there, I'm not gonna do that again. 
 But I have zero regrets. 
 (chuckles) 
 (muttering) 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 That looks great, but you might need to bring this stake in just a foot. Thank you. 
 Uh, guys, the tables all along the back here, and the bar goes by the pool. 
 Jackson : How we doing? Running those cords down? 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 Hey. 
 I got a deal, uh, on a security system upgrade. 
 Motion-detecting cameras, panic button. 
 I figured, why not? 
 This had to happen today? 
 Did you not notice the engagement party sprouting in our backyard? 
 I know, I know. (chuckles) 
 Sorry, but this'll only take a moment. 
 Something going on? 
 No, look, I-I didn't want you to worry, okay? I... 
 Uh, I had notice of a, of a convict's release. 
 Some guy I put away when I was with the DA's office. 
 Who? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 This happens all the time. 
 I'm, baby, I'm just being careful, okay? 
 I think we should know who's around. 
 All these workers. 
 Like last week when you invited that random landscaping guy to the house. 
 The one that you invited over? 
 I-I-I'm just being careful, baby, okay? 
 What... 
 What is that? 
 Centerpieces. 
 It's Mom. She has a thing. 
 I'll see you at the office. 
 Okay. 
 Winters : He's already here? 
 You said we needed to talk to him, so I called him to come in. 
 From now on, you let me handle that. 
 Terry Bausch isn't some dime-bag corner boy. 
 He has to be handled a certain way. 
 Sorry, didn't realize we offer VIP treatment. 
 Winters : Ramon Baez, shot-caller for the PB-7 gang, gunned down last month in Greenspoint. 
 Street puts it on your crew. 
 We spoke on this already. 
 I mean, Baez wasn't exactly my favorite person, but I don't know who took him out, and I know you're not accusing me of it. 
 Winters : Here's what's new. 
 Ballistics did a bullet comparison that says the firearm that killed Ramon Baez also killed your boy, Darryl Williams. 
 Shooter took out your enemy, then he took out your friend. 
 So you tell us who killed Ramon Baez, and they go down for Darryl's murder, too. 
 What about, uh, the friends of the white boy who whooped up on Darryl in the first place? 
 Seems like that'd be an intelligent place to look first, no? 
 They've been cleared. 
 Their alibis checked out. 
 We found 90 grand cash at Darryl's place. 
 The killer didn't take it. 
 The hit wasn't about money. 
 It wasn't a gang move. 
 It was personal. 
 You know, the possibilities are endless, Detective, but my time ain't. 
 Have a nice day. 
 (door opens) 
 What now? 
 Circle back on Darryl's girlfriend. 
 See what stage of grief she's in. 
 I don't think she's telling us everything. 
 My wife, Cece, and I have been blessed with loving children and grandchildren. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 And as your lieutenant governor, I have pushed to keep traditional family values at the heart of... 
 (sighs) 
 I'm sorry, can-can we... cut, take five? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Director : Cutting. Let's take five, guys. 
 On this Bobby Marks matter. 
 Did you find him? 
 No, quite the opposite. 
 We put a trap on his credit cards, on his bank account. 
 We put an APB on his vehicle. 
 All came up nothing. 
 This guy's gone silent. 
 Yeah, right after he reminds me how much he loves to talk. 
 He's either running scared from me or his visitors returned and helped him disappear. 
 Now, who are these visitors, exactly? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I'll handle them. 
 Hey, there's my guy! 
 Oh! 
 Let's go out here and see if we can make this work, huh? 
 Shawn : I'm saying we lay low for a minute. 
 Given what happened with Bobby, we don't need that kind of heat on us right now. 
 The longer we take to track these bastards down, the harder it's gonna be. 
 Man, they're gonna scatter, Shawn. 
 I want them just as much as you do. 
 All right? 
 They got pictures of me. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Bobby said they'd take pictures at the warden's parties. 
 What if he's still got them? 
 Man, G. 
 I didn't know that. 
 You know, Red can give us a better confession than Bobby could, anyway. 
 The warden's wingman. 
 He saw everything that happened. 
 Yeah, but Amy said he disappeared. 
 So we find him. 
 Where to start? 
 I mean, I'm figuring Red wasn't his real first name. 
 Gerald. 
 Gerald? 
 I heard the warden call him that. 
 Here you go. 
 I want in. 
 If you guys are moving forward with this plan and putting yourselves at risk, then I want to help. 
 No, that's not happening. 
 Why not? 
 Because it's not your fight, baby. 
 I don't want you involved. 
 Well, I've always been involved. 
 The only reason you guys got sent away in the first place was because of me, so let me pay that back. 
 Stop-stop it! It's not happening. 
 ‭Why not? 
 Forget it! It's not happening. 
 I don't want to have this conversation right now. 
 (sighs) 
 Come here. I-I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 G, look. 
 Gerald "Red" Tyson. 
 Jessie : Jackson! 
 Stop! 
 That's who you're looking for? 
 Yeah. That's the other guard at Quitman I told you about. 
 Shawn : Says he walked off shift at Quitman back in '98. 
 Nobody's seen him since. 
 Amy was right. 
 Evil he did at that place, maybe he went underground. 
 Got scared his past would come back to haunt him. 
 I think today's that day. 
 Jessie? 
 Hey. ‭What are you, uh, what are you doing here? 
 I tried calling you all morning. 
 So, I'm sorry, I had no choice. 
 What-What's wrong? 
 Gil and Shawn aren't stopping. 
 You need to talk to them. 
 No, I told, I told them I'm out. 
 I've already got a target on my back. 
 What do you mean you have a target on your back? 
 Just tell them to drop it. 
 Go on with your lives without the plan, without me. 
 They're going after Red Tyson. 
 Hey. 
 Okay, they already started looking for him. 
 What if they stir up something about what we did to him? 
 They won't, they won't. 
 You don't have to worry about that, but you tell Gil and Shawn if they want to stay safe, they need to forget about revenge. 
 I already have. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 I'm sorry, Jessie, you can't, you can't be here. 
 That's fine. 
 Radio announcer : Tomorrow we're looking at mostly cloudy skies and gradual... 
 (lock buzzes) 
 I've been told that there is a young lady here named Jessie who rode her bike all the way from Brennan to see some friends. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Do your parents know you're here? 
 Well, you are one resourceful little girl. 
 Those Brennan boys are lucky to have a friend like you. 
 Thanks. 
 Let me tell you something. 
 Having a visitor might be, uh, rough on your friends. 
 You know, boys have a sort of funny sense of pride, and then being seen in a place like this can make them a little, uh, a little ashamed. 
 And sometimes getting a glimpse of home, especially a pretty one like you, well, that makes their time here that much worse. 
 Now, I'm happy to escort you to see them, if you want. 
 No? 
 All right, well, that's okay, too. 
 I'll make sure to tell them you stopped by. 
 Payment that needs to go to the cartel. 
 Take it to airport lot B. 
 Flight attendant's gonna meet you there and get it to Juarez. 
 It's all you today, Marco. 
 Done. 
 What the hell, T? 
 Well, with Darryl no longer with us, somebody's got to step up and take his spot. 
 Yeah, that was supposed to be me, not Marco. 
 I've been hustling for you since the Quitman days. 
 I've done everything that you have asked me to do. 
 A few weeks back, when I needed Ramon Baez put down... 
 Yeah, I was the one that blasted him, like I said I would. 
 I didn't think twice about it. 
 I hear you. 
 You wanted Darryl's spot. 
 You put in your time. 
 You'll get what's coming to you. 
 Did you find the guy or not, man? 
 G, my homie's doing us a favor. 
 I'm trying to. 
 Tyson's gone 18 years without a blip on credit, DMV, no tax records. 
 He's got no surviving family, so all of my skip-tracing tricks, they turned up nada. 
 No, no, no, no, that's not good enough. 
 I know you can find something. That's what you do, right? 
 Find something on him for me. 
 How much is he worth to you? 
 Five Gs, I can come up with a few more trees to bark up. 
 ‭What? 
 5,000? 
 ‭No, no, no. 
 We ain't got that kind of guap. 
 What's your interest in this man? 
 (knocking) 
 (door opens) 
 Jackson. 
 ‭Hey, Aaron. 
 I'd like you to meet someone. 
 A congressional candidate making the rounds. 
 Of course, yeah. 
 (chuckles) ‭Hello, Jackson. 
 Ray Carroll. 
 Got a couple of minutes for a humble politician to plead his case? 
 (laughter) 
 It is refreshing to see one of my wards find such success in this world. 
 There's a few from your time there that made good. 
 Did you know that Dennis Lowen works at a church now? 
 So you're still catching up with Dennis. 
 That's nice. 
 And his brother, Terry, too, I bet. 
 I just met this lovely young woman out there, didn't I? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, I understand that, uh, you and a couple of Quitman friends paid a visit to Bobby Marks a few days ago. 
 You know, you get Bobby talking on something, there's no telling the fishtails he'll spin. 
 I bet he told you some whoppers. 
 But the thing is, I'd like to speak to Bobby myself, but I can find him, so I thought maybe you'd be able to help me on that. 
 Well, I don't know where Bobby is. 
 I bet that's not entirely true. 
 Tell you the truth, I don't really care, 'cause he told us everything we needed to know about Quitman and you. 
 And we got that on tape. 
 You know you're not like them. 
 You were always the smart one of those Brennan kids. 
 You knew that you could build a life like this if you didn't let them drag you down. 
 So be smart, Jackson. 
 I told you not to kick this rock. 
 I'm not that kid you used to push around in Quitman anymore. 
 You don't scare me. 
 Oh, but I think I do, Jackie. 
 You know, Bobby, he was very detailed. 
 All that abuse, everything you made him and Red do to the inmates, and those sick parties you used to throw. 
 Just you wait. 
 Your time's coming. 
 So you got a drunk telling stories on a tape. 
 (chuckles) That's just the beginning. 
 Well, let me tell you what I got. 
 Hard evidence of you murdering Red Tyson in cold blood on the night he disappeared. 
 You're lying. 
 Is that really a risk you want to take? 
 18 years doesn't change a thing about it, except what you lose when it comes out. 
 Get out of my office right now. 
 Take another step, and this life you built gets torched. 
 Nice catching up with you. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 If Red Tyson is alive, he's probably holed up in some Unabomber shack. 
 I hope he's dying a slow death, haunted by the memories of what he did. 
 I don't want him haunted by memories, I want him haunted by me. 
 Look, I know you're thinking if Jackson were here, he'd know how to find Red. 
 Forget Jackson. We don't need Jackson to find this guy. 
 (phone dings) 
 We can do this on our own, Shawn. 
 Oh! ‭What? 
 Annie had her baby. 
 A boy. 
 I'm gonna get down there. 
 What? Right now? 
 You know, she doesn't have any family around, so she needs help getting home from the hospital. 
 Did she text you? 
 Yeah, I told her I'd help her out with, you know, baby stuff. 
 That'll get you home, all right? 
 Shawn? 
 Yeah? 
 Little Boots. 
 To little Boots!

 You were right about Darryl's murder. 
 It wasn't them white boys from Quitman. 
 Halleluiah. 
 It was Eddie. 
 Eddie? Why? 
 Yeah, he wanted Darryl's spot. 
 So you don't know for sure it was him. 
 He all but told me himself. 
 Now I have to put him down. 
 Listen, if you're here telling me this, that means you're hoping that there's other ways. 
 Eddie's been one of your friends for 30 years. 
 Family, practically. 
 Yeah, so was Darryl, and that didn't stop Eddie from putting three holes in his chest.

 What exactly do you want me... 
 All of it. 
 You have been distracted all week, here and at the office. 
 You disappear for hours. 
 You missed the drinks with my parents, and I saw you arguing with your friend Jessie. 
 You were there? 
 And then this stranger crashes our party, you punch him, and Jessie's the one who picks him up. 
 And I know that you're saying there's nothing to worry about, that you're handling it, but I don't want to be handled. 
 I want you to tell me what's happening to our life. 
 They were my friends. 
 Remember that client I had, Gary Nolan? 
 We were friends as kids down in Brennan, and I hadn't... hadn't seen him for years. 
 He was killed in jail. 
 I went to his funeral, and, uh... 
 ...there were a few other friends from my childhood there. 
 Boots'... 
 Gary's death... it just, it just sh... shook everyone up a little. 
 So I've been spending some time with them, just... just to help them get through it, you know? 
 We've been out of touch for so long. 
 We were all best friends. 
 Jessie, Gil from last night, and, uh... there's another one, Shawn. 
 Why wouldn't you tell me any of this? 
 I could've helped you through it. 
 'Cause I didn't know what was going on, baby. 
 I didn't know if they were gonna be in our lives. 
 I didn't know if I was just helping them out in a tough time, you know? And... 
 Turns out, that's exactly what happened. 
 I tried, and it didn't work, so it's over.

 Darryl's family's cheap. 
 Well, there's nothing cheap about that piece around your neck. 
 Wow, it's beautiful. 
 Did Darryl buy that for you? 
 We know he had some serious cash when he died. 
 He didn't spend it on me. 
 So who did? 
 Spend on you? 
 Why's Five-O care about my love life? 
 'Cause it's looking like Darryl was killed by someone in his own gang. 
 And there's one thing that comes to mind that would make a man go after his friend like that. 
 A woman like you. 
 So is your new man someone from Darryl's gang? 
 Who is he? 
 Darryl was never gonna let me go. 
 I-I didn't want him killed. 
 I didn't ask for that. 
 Tell me who the other guy is, and I'll keep you out of it. 
 I love him. 
 It's just as easy for me to take your phone and get the name from there. 
 Then I have to keep the phone. 
 Evidence. 
 His name's Marco. 
 Jackson knocked you out in front of all those people at the party? 
 Knocked me out. 
 ‭What?! (laughs) 
 It might as well have been Tyson-Douglas. 
 Man, I'm crawling around the canvas, looking for my mouthpiece. 
 Yo, that's epic, man. 
 Yeah, something.

 All right, here it is. 
 Boots' homemade movies from back in the day. 
 You know, um... 
 Hey, you sure this is the best idea right now? 
 Yeah. Baby Boots needs to see his daddy.

 ‭Come in. 
 Jackie, you made it. 
 Yeah, well, we decided why not. 
 Hi. I'm Marina. 
 Jackson's told me all about you guys. 
 You must be Annie. 
 Yeah. 
 ‭Congratulations... 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 ...on your baby boy. 
 Jessie, it's good to see you again. 
 Yeah, you, too. Hi. 
 And just to clear the air, Jackson did inform me of your seventh-grade courtship. 
 Ah. (chuckles) 
 I have been warned how charming you can be. 
 Oh, it's legendary. 
 ‭Mm. 
 But I'm gonna keep it under control. 
 Marina : Gil, I didn't realize I was meeting ‭the Gil Harris yesterday. 
 Jackson told me what an amazing friend you always were. 
 I'm really sorry I ruined your party last night. 
 Uh, we don't usually assault our guests. (chuckles) 
 At least not physically. 
 Want to hold him? 
 Jackson (chuckles) : Yeah. That'd be great. 
 Oh, look at you. 
 You got it. You can do it. 
 Look at you, you drowsy little guy. 
 Good, good. 
 (both laugh) 
 Baby, look at this. 
 This is little Boots. 
 Marina : So sweet. 
 Little Boots. 
 ‭So sweet.

 You have something you want to talk about, T? 
 Yeah. 
 Eddie. 
 We got a problem. 
 We do? 
 Now, you go back a long minute with someone, you think you know them. 
 Kind of dirt they do, what they won't. 
 And you trust that.

 Problem occurs when... they surprise you. 
 Everything you trusted turns out to be a lie.

 You're sorry? 
 For lying to you. 
 For telling you that I was the one that blasted Baez. 
 You didn't do that hit? 
 Nah, man. 
 That was all Marco. 
 I mean, I would've done it, but, man, he beat me to it. 
 I-I only said that because I-I didn't want him to come up over me. 
 (laughs) 
 Look, good meat takes time to cook. 
 Yeah, right. ‭That's the way it is. 
 Jackie, I got a cold one for you. 
 Grouchy. Thanks, brother. 
 (laughs) 
 I think my fiancée's gonna give up her law career to be that kid's nanny. 
 Man, you got a good one, Jackson. 
 Yeah, I know. It's better than I deserve. 
 You need to forget about Red Tyson. 
 You won't find him. 
 Listen, I know you made it clear you don't want to... 
 You won't find him because I killed him. 
 What? 
 18 years ago. 
 Shawn : What? Wait, wait. 
 What-what are you talking about? 
 I went back to Quitman one night, alone. 
 I wanted to... see the place. 
 Red was there. 
 I shot him and I buried him. 
 You won't find him. 
 Jackie, wait. 
 Jackie, wait, wait, wait. 
 Hang on a second. 
 How come you never said anything about this to us? 
 How come? 
 'Cause I was running from it. 
 I can't. 
 The warden knows what I did. 
 And he made that very clear when he came to my office yesterday. 
 ‭Whoa, whoa. 
 What do you mean, he came to your office? 
 Jackson : He threatened me. 
 Said we wake any more ghosts from Quitman, it all comes out. 
 So that's it. 
 We're out. We're done. 
 We ain't letting you go down for murder. 
 Nothing's worth any of us gettin' locked up again. 
 Gil : You telling me you've been hauling this secret around for 18 years? 
 Never said anything to anybody? 
 That's right. 
 You don't believe me, Gil? 
 No, I do. 
 Shawn's right, it's over. 
 Why did you do that? 
 Why did you lie about what really happened to Red? 
 To protect you. 
 No one else knows what happened that night. 
 I'm gonna keep it that way. 
 Here. 
 ‭Thank you. 
 The guilt I've felt over you guys going to Quitman because of me... 
 I owe it to you to help. 
 Jessie... you don't owe me anything. 
 You saved my life. 
 I don't want to see you get hurt. 
 Jackson : We gotta get rid of the body. 
 Jessie : Okay. 
 Jackson. Jackson! 
 Jackson : We gotta get rid of the body! 
 Jessie : Jackson... 
 Okay. 
 (panting) 
 Where's the body? 
 Where's the body? 
 I can't see, I don't know. 
 Jackson! 
 (grunting) 
 (gunshot) 
 Let's bowl! 
 ‭(laughter) ‭This were we used to go. 
 ‭Ladies and gentlemen... 
 Oh, wait,  wait, wait. 
 There's your daddy. 
 There he is. 
 ...you're about to see the great Gary "Boots" Nolan of Brennan, Texas, demonstrate his world-famous bowling skills. 
 Who couldn't love him? 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (laughter, pins falling) 
 Shawn : Baby Boots! 
 L-Listen, we need to get baby Boots some baby boots. 
 Annie : Look at those boots. 
 Shawn : Uh-oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Check it out. 
 Nobody's ever gonna forget your daddy. 
 I promise. 
 Hang on. What? 
 Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
 No, no, no, no, no... Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Watch this. No, no, no... 
 The band! 
 (laughter) 
 Marina : You had a band? 
 (phone ringing) 
 You had a band? 
 ‭Yo. 
 Yeah, we had a band. Yes, we had a band. 
 What? 
 Are you playing a microwave? 
 Whoa, I'm dominating. 
 Shawn : Right now, go play the microwave right now. 
 Let him know you still got it. 
 I still got it! 
 (laughter) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Annie, honey, what's wrong? 
 Oh, my God, Shawn. 
 Annie, Annie, what's wrong? 
 Guys... Shawn! 
 Guys! Guys! 
 Uh, um... that was the sheriff's department. 
 A man in jail confessed to stabbing Boots. 
 Shawn : What? Who? 
 (crying): Um... some, some man who was going away to serve a life sentence. 
 And he said that Boots started a fight with him, and so he killed him. 
 (Annie sobbing) 
 Jessie : Are you okay? 
 Okay, okay, okay. Come here, come here. 
 Come here. 
 Gil : Shawn. Shawn. 
 I've got you. 
 Shawn... 
 He should've never been locked in the same cell with a lifer. 
 He would still be alive! 
 He could hold his son! 
 Annie wouldn't have to go through all this madness. 
 Come on, man. 
 It's... it's just... it's just... it ain't right. 
 Gil : There's no way Boots would go after some random convict. 
 That can't be what happened. 
 We all know how it works in places like that. 
 All-all they want to do is close the case. 
 That's it. 
 So they find some dude who's doing life already, he catches the rap... 
 The whole thing is rotten. 
 Right? Tell me I'm wrong. 
 So let's make it right. 
 How? 
 Those kids in that video back there... we were fearless. 
 Brothers, right? 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying the plan's back on. 
 I say we take the warden down, every son of a bitch that hurt us, that hurt Boots. 
 We don't stop till it's done. 
 Shawn : The warden... 
 What he knows about you and Red. 
 We got plenty of ammo, Shawn, and all the things he did to us at Quitman? 
 I'll tell you this: Terry Bausch... he delivered a threat to my house. 
 He's still working as the warden's attack dog. 
 Wait a minute. The warden's hooked up with a... with a d boy? 
 ‭That's right. 
 Yeah, his crimes are not all in the past. 
 So he's just as vulnerable as us. 
 If we attack the right way, we've got him. 
 We gotta be smart, Gil, we gotta be smart. 
 He's gonna be watching. 
 We're gonna make every single one of them pay, then. 
 Damn right. 
 All in. 
 All in. 
 All right. 
 Marco Ladera? 
 HPD. We need to talk. 
 Marco : Please, T, do not do this, man, please... 
 We're friends, man. We're friends, okay? 
 It's not even my gun, okay? 
 Eddie-Eddie-Eddie-Eddie-Eddie... 
 Oh, God, please. 
 (sobbing) 
 Please, T, you do not want to do this. 
 Come on, man, I don't even know where that gun came from. 
 Honest to God, I don't know where it came from. 
 Eddie... 
 Eddie... Eddie, uh... 
 Oh, please, please... 
 Drop it, Terry! 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God, thank you. 
 Now. 
 Drop that gun. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Thank God. Thank God. 
 Oh, God... 
 (Marco sobbing) 
 (panting) 
 Oh, thank God. 
 (gunshot) 
 Dammit, Terry. 
 Why? 
 Helpful tip you gave me. 
 About the same gun being used against Ramon Baez and my boy Darryl? 
 Marco, here, still had the same pistol he used when I found him. 
 (chuckles) 
 You know he killed Darryl over a piece of tail? 
 You didn't have to do this. 
 That 90 grand that you said you found at Darryl's place... 
 Yeah. 
 Was supposed to be 100. 
 Marco wouldn't cop to it, but I'm led to believe he pinched ten from the pile. 
 Might've blown it on the girl; I heard she's flaunting a few grand around her neck. 
 This wasn't our deal. 
 I can give you intel, look the other way, but I can't watch you kill. 
 That's where you draw the line, huh? 
 I'm just saying, for both our sakes, we just need to make sure... 
 There is no line. 
 As long as you want your brother protected in prison, you will do whatever I ask. 
 And right now... 
 (gasping) 
 ...you're getting rid of this. 
 Pop a few more in him if it helps you. 
 Helps me? 
 Yeah. 
 Sell it to your unit as a gang hit. 
 (indistinct chatter, telephones ringing) 
 It's crucial, Jimmy, crucial. 
 Ray will be very appreciative. 
 Thank you, my friend. Thank you. 
 Ray! Carson's in. 
 Way to go. 
 Excuse me, ma'am. 
 Can I help you? 
 Hi. 
 Jessie West. 
 I'd like to volunteer for Mr. Carroll's campaign.
