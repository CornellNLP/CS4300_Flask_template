 Winters : Remains were found six hours ago. 
 By the time I got here, they were already processing the scene. 
 We're a long way from Houston, Liz. 
 What's your interest in this? 
 I think the victim's related to some cases I've been working. 
 Murdered in Texas, buried here, which makes it your play. 
 Parish PD's a little cranky about it. 
 Special Agent Suggs, FBI. How are you? 
 Good. 
 Now here's what we're looking at. 
 It's a single GSW, through and through. 
 The size of that skull, I'm thinking adolescent male, maybe 12 to 14 years old. 
 No, we don't know the gender. 
 Actually, we do. The bones were found wrapped in that blanket. 
 Look at that tag. 
 "Quitman YDF." 
 It's an all-male juvie facility in Texas. 
 Guys who found him think we're looking at a friend of theirs who disappeared in 1988. 
 They were all inmates together. 
 Guys? What-what guys? 
 Friends of yours? 
 It's complicated. 
 All right, let's go talk to 'em. 
 (rock music playing) 
 Shawn :  Unbelievable, man. 
 You see how the FBI dude's eyes lit up when you showed him those land records? Like he won the damn lottery. 
 Yeah. No, this could work, guys. 
 Feds don't care who Ray Carroll is, and those land records are gonna be hard to explain away. 
 Plus, we got Liz on our case, so, I think we finally got him. 
 What should I do? 
 What do you mean? 
 Carroll's still got that endorsement event tonight out at the ranch. 
 Maybe y'all need to move it to some place like the federal penitentiary. 
 I'm serious. I'm supposed to meet CeCe at the house in, like, an hour. 
 So, I feel like I should go. 
 No, she's right. 
 Who knows how long it's gonna take for the cops to get there, you know? 
 She doesn't show up, the warden might get suspicious. 
 Well, what if they show up, and she's there? 
 Gil : She'll take a damn video! 
 Think Carroll's having a picnic on the train tracks, man. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Gil : That's it. This time, the warden's going down. 
 (laughter) 
 Yeah! 
 Jackson :  Come on! 
 ♪ I need a love  ♪ ♪ To keep me happy... ♪ Warden's going down! Hey. Where have you been? Figuring out my life. (knocking) Uh, I'm gonna have to call you back. I can't do this anymore. I love you. I love you more than anything else in my entire life, and I'm-I'm not gonna let this happen to us. Baby, I... I am so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I... What happened to you? It's over. The police are questioning the warden, and I think he's gonna go down for the murder of a kid who disappeared while we were at Quitman. I want you back, baby. I want you to come home. Tell me you'll take me back, please. (sniffles) I have missed you so much. I... I love you. I love you, too. (sighs) (sniffles) You want to hear something crazy? What? I'm pregnant. (laughs) Are you serious? (laughing): We're gonna...? We're gonna have a baby? I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be doing most of the work, but, yeah. (laughter) Can you believe that? (sniffles) Tuttle : All right, the governor arrives at 6:00. We'll do the meet-and-greet before, ops on the porch. Where is Jessie? This is so unlike her to be late. At 6:30, working the room, then the program will start at 7:00 sharp, all right? Ray? Yeah. Uh, that's good. Just give me a minute. Ray Carroll? Yes. Special Agent Suggs. FBI. We need to talk. When's the last time you saw this boy alive? Like I told you before, it was right after the accident. They brought him in to the infirmary. I had one of the guards put him in a van, take him to the emergency room. Know what happened after the van left? Well, I always assumed they took him to the hospital. But when he never came back, I asked the day nurse about it, and she said they transferred him to another facility for medical reasons. Did you sign off on the paperwork? Oh, I'm sure I did. We lost all those records in the riot, but that would have been standard procedure. Do you recall purchasing land on the Louisiana border in August of 1988? Yeah, I remember this. Supposed to be good bird hunting. What about it? Well, that's where we found the remains this morning, on land that you purchased three days after this boy disappeared. You have any explanations for that? Hmm. Well... Red and Bobby. Excuse me? There were two guards that worked for me at Quitman. I took them there hunting a couple times. They knew where this land was. They must have buried him there. Why would they want to kill this boy? I don't know. They were always a problem... fighting with the inmates, running deals on the side. They were in charge of the work detail when the accident happened. Maybe they just got scared and panicked, this was their solution. You are aware that Bobby Marks is deceased, Red Tyson disappeared 15 years ago? I'm aware. That seems very convenient. You blaming two men who can't tell their side of the story. Mr. Suggs, I don't like what you're implying, so let me be clear. I'm not involved in this, and you can't prove that I am. Now I've been very patient, and enough is enough. Now I need to get about my day, and you two need to get the hell off of my property and quit accusing me of something I didn't do. Hi. Uh, there she is. Ray : Guys, give us some time. What was that all about? Well, they're investigating some guy from Brownsville for rigging state contracts, and they wanted background. Like I have time for that now. Why is the FBI involved? 'Cause they just are, CeCe. Not for you to worry about, so drop it. How are you doing, Jessie? Hi. Oh, where-where you going, Ray? Ah. I'm gonna drive myself out to the ranch, use the windshield time to work on my speech. I'll see you there later. I thought you were driving him. I thought I was, too. (door closes) Oh, my God. Um... Cece : What's wrong? My mom just texted me. A pipe broke, and there is water everywhere. I'm gonna have to go home and deal with this. You want me to have someone drive you? No. I got it. I will just go take care of this, and then, I will head to the ranch straight after. We need you there, Jessie. I'm just gonna go deal with this, okay? Oh, he is lying, Liz. You know that. So-so what do... what do you want us to do? I know. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. He blamed it on Red and Bobby. So, what? They're not gonna arrest him now? Well, they can't. It's his word against Red, Bobby and Amy. They're all dead, so they got nothing to go on. What about the human bones all over his property? What do you want me to say, Gil? We know he did it. We just can't prove it. Maybe he didn't. No way, Shawn. I saw him after the FBI left. He was completely spooked. Think about it. The warden's whole play is to leverage people. Right? Make someone else do his dirty work for him. Who were the biggest lap dogs the entire time at Quitman? Terry and his crew. What if he made them do it? E block. Right. I mean those guys had their heads so far up the warden's ass, they never had to do work detail, so, maybe if they were the ones that... They were in the same bunkroom, that means Red went to E block to get 'em. He took 'em to the warden. That makes sense. Gil : So what do you want to do? Walk up to Terry, ask him if they did it? No. We go and talk to his brother. I had the FBI at my house, accusing me of murder. Diana : Just calm down. We always knew this was a possible problem. You know who's behind this, don't you? Jackson Brooks. Did they tell you that? They didn't have to! I've been telling you for a month he's trouble, and you haven't done anything. They have the deed records, Diana. How long you think it's gonna take for them to figure out I sold that land to you? It doesn't matter. There's a contingency in place for that. You don't need to worry about it. Have a seat. I don't want to sit down. Raymond! I've worked too long, and I've invested too much in this for you to blow it for me now. You're upset, and I understand, but upset people make mistakes, and I don't like mistakes. If the press gets wind of this, I... They won't. Just trust me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to take a deep breath. I want you to pull yourself together, and I want you to go to your party. You're gonna shake a few hands, you're gonna make a nice speech, and then in six months, we will open your office on Capitol Hill. I ain't no religious man. Made a lot of mistakes in my life. When you came to me asking about forgiveness, I told you straight... I can't do that for what you did to me. But this is different, Dennis. We're talking about a 12-year-old boy shot through the head and buried in a field like a piece of trash. I know you know that's not right. And I know it bothers you. So if you're really who you say you are, now's the time to prove it. I don't know what you want from me. We want the truth, Dennis. And we think the warden did this, and we think you know what happened. Bobby and Nurse Amy told us Red came to E block and got you guys that day. You talked to them? Is it true? Did Red come and get you and take you to the warden? Darryl and Eddie weren't with us. It was just me and Terry. So you were there? What happened? Red came in. He was looking really serious. Uh, and he came and got us, and he put us in his car. Next thing you know, I'm riding in some van. With the warden and Petey? Yeah. I didn't know if Petey was alive or dead by the time I got into the van. We drove about 20 minutes into Louisiana. Ended up in a field somewhere  in the middle of nowhere. Then... That's when it happened. I've always taken real good care of you boys, haven't I? Given you special privileges, let you do things other inmates can't? That's because you've earned it. You're smart. You know how I do things, and I respect that. The three of us have a very special relationship, and I'd like to keep that going. Wouldn't you? Yes, sir. We have an unfortunate situation here. This boy is not gonna make it. (panting) And the humane thing to do is to put him out of his misery. So which one of you is gonna show me his appreciation? Which one of you is gonna be a man and step up and do what needs to be done? Show me. (Petey panting) (gunshot) I know I could have been stronger. Gil : It wasn't your fault. It was the warden that did this. Terry put a bullet in Petey's head. Cold blood, point blank. And he didn't even feel bad about it. My brother is a killer. He always has been, he always will be. You need to go to the D.A. No. You're an accessory to murder, Dennis. The warden is gonna go down for this, and don't think for a second he is not gonna take you with him. Jackson's right. Unless you tell the truth and you get immunity, you're going to jail for the rest of your life. All of this, everything you've worked for is gone. Do you understand what you're asking me to do? You want me to betray my own brother?! Shawn : Listen to me! Y'all have the same blood, but he is not your brother. You ain't like him. You're better than he is. This is the only way. This is your time to be stronger. Save yourself while you still can. ♪ (indistinct conversations) What's going on? We got him, baby. The warden? Yeah. Terry, too. His brother said the warden took them out to that field, made Terry kill Petey. He's in there telling the D.A. right now. I don't know why it's taking so long. They've been in there for an hour. Hey, they're coming. Hey, Dennis, how'd it go? Dennis. What happened? He gave us a signed statement. My assistant's putting together a murder warrant on Terry Bausch. All right, that's good. What about the warden? Who? Ray Carroll. Who's putting the warrant together on him? Didn't say anything about him. (elevator bell dings) Jackson : Dennis. Why didn't you tell 'em about the warden? Whoever this is, don't talk to him. What... Who the hell is this? You got an attorney now? Sir. Why'd you lie? Why'd you lie? Who got to you, Dennis?! Dennis! Something's wrong. What are we missing? Dennis got scared, that's all. Figured he's in enough trouble selling out his brother, doesn't want the warden to come after him, too. You can't screw with the D.A. like that. As soon as they figure out he's lied, his immunity's gone. He's digging his own grave. (mutters): Just like the one he dug in Louisiana. What was that? Huh? What did you say? Just... like the one he dug in Louisiana. Louisiana. Oh, that's it, that's it. Jessie :  Jackson! Shawn :  Hey, where you going? Jackson : We're going back to the D.A. I have an idea. It's gender-neutral, since you don't know if you're having a boy or a girl, so... Right? Not yet. 
 
 Thank you, Diana. You didn't have to come all the way here to give me this. It's okay, I-I wanted to check on you and just see how you were doing. Much better, actually. Jackson and I have patched things up. Oh, that's wonderful. I'm very happy for you. Diana, why did you hire our firm? Because of you. But you've known Aaron a long time, right? Yes, and when he told me that his partner was a terrific lawyer, whom he thought that I would like, I listened. Why? I'm concerned about your relationship with Ray Carroll. What about him? Jackson has told me some things. That he's corrupt. Well... I-I wouldn't know about that. I heard Ray Carroll is gonna be arrested for murder. Really? It involves an inmate who disappeared while he was warden at Quitman. Did you hear this on the news this morning? No. It hasn't happened just yet. You didn't know about any of this? Absolutely not. I'm shocked. This is just exactly what I'm talking about. I am lucky that I have you watching out for me, so... I'll get my government affairs on this right away. And I'll get out of your hair now, but... thanks for the heads-up. I'm really glad that I stopped by. During these times... Ray. I think we have a problem with Jessie West. The other night I was working late and I hear a noise from your office. So I went to check it out, nobody was there. But one of the drawers was half open and Jud Hamm's donor file was missing. So? So I think she took it. I think she's a mole. I think she's working for the opposition's campaign. Little Jessie? She's just eye candy. It's a hunch. She's been acting strange. You're being paranoid. That girl is not a mole. And even if she is, I'm 18 points ahead... she must not be very good at it. I just wanted to bring it up. All right. Jackson : The warden took you out to that  field, he gave you a gun  and he made you kill Petey, didn't he? I don't know what you're talking about. All right, listen to me. Your brother gave you up. He told us everything and we're going to the police, but we don't want you, we want the warden. That man is the devil. You know the only reason he took you over the border and made you do it there is because duress is not a defense in Louisiana, which means even if he put a gun to your head... and made you shoot... you're still going down for murder. You understand that? The warden manipulated us, he used us, and he's gonna take you down unless you help us. This is your way out. I am giving it to you. All of it can end right now. All the bad blood, all the fighting... everything. All you have to do... is tell the truth. Just how stupid do you think I am, lawyer, hmm? Tell you the truth? Turn around. Check him for a tail. Huh? All right, go get the car. Hurry up. Hurry up, make it quick. Officer : Suspect on the move. We got a visual! Get out of the vehicle! (officers shouting) Winters : Hold your fire. He's got Jackson. Open the door. Hold your fire. (grunts) Oh, aah! (grunting) Okay, that's affirmative. On our way. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. He got away. What? No. He got away. Aw, man. Is Jackson okay? Should be fine. I tell you what... it's the bravest thing I've ever seen. I just... I can't believe Terry got away! Look, it's the FBI... I'm sure they're gonna find him. Oh, what's it matter, Jessie? Okay, babe... you need to calm down. Listen, Terry knows if he gets arrested, he's going to prison for the rest of his life. There is no chance he's gonna let them take him alive. Which means the warden gets away, too. Maybe you go talk to Dennis again. How?! We have no idea where he is! Gil, I know that. I'm just trying to help. I know. I know. I'm sorry, it's... (sighs) Oh, we were so close. What time is the warden's party? What? The endorsement thing. We still have time to get there, right? Why would we want to do that? Because I have an idea. But I can't do it by myself. Will you help me? (phone rings) I'll catch up with you. Yeah, great. Winters. Liz, it's Terry. You alone? Yeah. What do you want? All right, good. Look, I got ambushed. Lawyer set me up. FBI's after me right now. Wait, wait, what, what lawyer? Slow down. Jackson Brooks? Look, I don't have time to explain to you, all right? Look, I need my go bag. It's in the shed behind my house, the corner cabinet. You're gonna grab it and you're gonna bring it to me and you're gonna be alone. I'm getting my ass to Mexico. What, are you crazy, Terry? There is no way I'm getting involved in a federal manhunt. I'm gonna kill your brother. You understand that, Detective? (sighs) It's as easy as a phone call away, so don't you sit there and pretend that you got a choice here. Now, you're gonna meet me at 10:00 tonight, 61st Street pier at Galveston. Bring the bag and come alone. Or the next time you see Robby, he's gonna be in a bag. Annie : I'm not letting you do this. You said we were going, so get up. What's the point? The point is, Amy was your friend. And you need to pay your respects. Don't you understand? Everything that we've worked for... everything that's happened since Boots is all for nothing. Man, Terry's getting away, the warden's getting away, the whole thing is a big damn mess, so excuse me if I don't feel like going to the funeral for a woman I helped get killed. Shawn, look at me. I woke up this morning and I curled my hair. And I did my makeup. And I put on this dress. And do you know the last time I wore this dress? It was to my own husband's funeral. And you know why I did that? For you. To help you. The same way that you have been helping me. You don't have a franchise on grief. So... go find a suit and you get your ass to my car, because we are going to this funeral, Shawn. Right now. We're good to go. I think so. I love you. I love you, too. (phone rings) Hello? Hi, Ms. Nagle, it's Janey calling from Dr. Parson's office. How are you? Hi, Janey. I'm good, thank you. So, we got the labs back from your 12-week visit, and everything looks great. Good. Do you want to know what you're having? Uh, Dr. P looked at the ultrasound, so I can tell you if it's a boy or a girl. If you want to know. Actually, I do. Well, it's a boy. Congratulations. Thank you. Ray : It's a fine school. Man : She graduated last May and moved to D.C. She wants to work on the Hill. Oh, I know somebody who just might be hiring. (chuckles) Cece : Right, Raymond? Excuse me? Maybe you could give their daughter a job on your staff. After you win this thing. Uh, yeah. Have her give me a call. Excuse me for a moment.

I know he's on the run. I know he's... probably won't answer, but I'm assuming you two are in contact, right? 'Cause I am not giving up on this. I'm not letting him get away, so I want you to call him. You tell him whatever you have to to get him to meet you and then you're gonna arrest him. I think you've had a long day. You need to go home. Liz. Liz. You don't have to worry anymore. I took care of your brother. I spoke to the D.A. I told her he's an informant in one of my RICO cases. He needs protection, and they've already moved him. He is safe. Terry can't get to him, and you don't have to be afraid. Okay. You okay? We've been in touch. He called me an hour ago. What did he say? He told me he's fleeing the country, and... he needs me to get his go bag and to meet him at the 61st Street Pier in Galveston. 61st. At his warehouse or else Robby's dead.

So why don't you tell me who you're working with and what you're hoping to accomplish here. You're making me uncomfortable. I want to go. I'm sorry about that. But I'm sure you'll understand why I prefer to have this conversation now. (phone buzzes) (crickets chirping) Marina. All right, what's this big news you got for me? I'm hoping it's... (car engine starts) (engine revving, tires screeching) No. No! (indistinct chatter) How you doing, Warden? You like that picture I sent you? Hey! Did you hear me?! You get out of my daughter's stuff! Jackson! Oh, God. Out of my way. Out of my way. What in the hell are you up to? Hey! Don't you dare! You come back here, Jackson! Jackson! I tell you what, how about we forget the gun? We go hand-to-hand, just like old times. You always did like a good fistfight, didn't you? 'Course, now it'd be a little different, though, wouldn't it? I'd kick every single one of your teeth down your throat. Yes, you would, son. You're the toughest son of a bitch I've ever met in my entire life. (scoffs) I mean it. First time I saw you, I thought, "This kid is different. This kid is special." You... had more guts inside of you than boys twice your age. I always admired you for that. You need to shut up. We used to talk about you, you know. The guards and I used to sit back and marvel, saying, "This kid, this Gil Harris, he's a survivor. He's gonna come out of this stronger on the other side." Quitman didn't bring you to your knees... it brought you to your feet. I know it's hard to understand. I know that you're angry. But we can sit down man to man. I'm sure we can work this out. (panting) I've been thinking about this moment for 25 years, Ray. Payback. For everything you did to me. What are you gonna do, Gil? You gonna shoot me? With the governor and... half the Texas Highway Patrol right outside? I'm not gonna shoot you. It's much worse than that. Let's go. (indistinct chatter) Jessie  (over microphone): Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? What the hell is that? My name is Jessie West, and I'd like to say something before we get started. Tonight I have the pleasure of introducing you to the real Ray Carroll. What the hell does she think she's doing? Let her go. She's having her moment. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so... how about we start with this? (gasping) This is a 12-year-old boy who was an inmate at Quitman. During his time there, he was systematically drugged, abused, and tortured by Ray Carroll. (gasping) Get her off the stage! This is a man who exploited children not only for profit but for his own sick pleasure, Tuttle! Kill the projector! and it's time to tell the truth. Ray Carroll is a predator. He doesn't belong in Congress. He belongs in jail. (indistinct chatter) Give me that. She works for my opponent's campaign! She's lying! Let's go. Now. Governor, this whole thing was a setup! (indistinct chatter) She's a liar! (camera shutter sound effect) Where's my fiancée? Jackson... You tell me where she is or I put a bullet in your brain. Look, I don't know what you're talking about. Where is she? What have you done with her? I don't know. Where is she?! I swear to God, I don't know. (grunts) (panting) You son of a bitch. I'm gonna give you three and I'm taking your head off. You tell me where she is. I'm telling you you're wrong. You tell me where she is. I did not touch your fiancée. One, two... You're wrong. Tell me where she is! I don't know! Winters : Jackson, don't do it. Don't do it! Everything's changed. He's taken Marina. Come on, man. You are not a killer. Drop the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun, man. I got him. I got him. The hell took you so long? Shut up. Get on the ground! Put your hands behind your back! You're under arrest for the murder of Petey Curtis. (chuckles) Don't let him go. I will drop you. You lost your damn mind? You drop me, and I kill your brother. Yeah? Give me a reason. Liz, don't let him go! Terry, stop. Liz, don't let him go. Drop him, Liz. Don't let him go! Always plan for the unexpected. (chuckles) I'll admit that I didn't think Ray Carroll would go down quite that way, but I always knew it was coming eventually. And I'm prepared. I have a dozen just like him waiting in the wings. Important thing here is that Terry's been arrested. So we have to stick to the plan. We've got to keep our heads on straight and just keep moving forward. With you in charge now. I expect good things for you, Dennis. To a bright future together. What about Jackson Brooks? I wouldn't worry about him too much. I've got that situation under control. (indistinct chatter) Jackson, I'm so sorry. That's okay. You hear anything? No? No. Nothing yet.
