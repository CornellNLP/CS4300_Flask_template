 Let me see that thing. Wow. 
 How did you know? 
 He asked me if women know their ring sizes. 
 And I was like... 
 "Of course. I mean, I do." 
 Real smooth. 
 (Chuckles) So smooth. 
 You know, I'd almost lost faith until you guys. 
 Maybe there's still hope for me. 
 Let me see it again. 
 Aw... Wow. 
 It's gorgeous. 
 Whoa. Hey. 
 Are you okay? 
 Rose. 
 I've got a bad feeling. 
 His name was Death. 
 And hell followed with him. (Gunshots) 
 Oh, my God! Rose! 
 Rose! Rose! 
 Rose! 
 Somebody get a doctor out here! 
 Man : We've got a gunshot victim! 
 Rose! Hey, hey, hey, hey, Rose. 
 Stay with me. Stay with me. 
 I got you. Somebody help! 
 Help!

 Were you nice? You said you'd be nice. 
 He said that we're looking for E.T. in the middle of a budget crisis. That's what he said. 
 So you weren't nice. 
 (Chuckles) I just made one observation. That was it. 
 You know, that I'm sure he's just as qualified to judge the work of a team of radio astronomers as he is to hold public office. 
 I'm really worried about where this is going. 
 His daddy's oil money obviously qualifies him for both. 
 You said that to him? You said those words to him? 
 Vera, the man is a U.S. congressman. 
 The man is an idiot. 
 An idiot who holds the purse strings! 
 (Rapid beeping) 
 Vera : What? 
 Whoa. 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Panting) 
 Qué pasó, amigo? 
 What the hell took you guys so long? 
 Five years underwater, man. My cover's blown. 
 I got what we need. Now I'm out. 
 You hear me? I'm finished. 
 We got you, okay? Don't worry. 
 You're out. We get it. That's why we're here. 
 We're gonna get you back across the border. 
 No. Not just across the border. You take me home. 
 I'm done. 
 Absolutely. 
 You earned it. 
 We got El Jefe over a barrel now. 
 You did get the coordinates, right? 
 Yeah, I got the coordinates. 
 Shipment's on the plane. 
 Ha. 
 You are one hell of an agent, amigo. 
 (Children laughing, chattering) 
 Wow. You're getting good at those sunrises, Van Gogh. 
 I don't want to be Van Gogh. He cut off his ear. 
 Oh, and your ears are so cute, too. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 (Chuckles) In the car, kiddo. Buckle up. 
 Hello? 
 Amy. 
 Okay, mommy. 
 Hello. Who's this? 
 Ronnie. 
 Ronnie, if that's you, I swear I know what you are trying to do and she is not going with you. 
 You hear me? 
 As long as I live, never again. 
 I'm hanging up. 
 (Jazzy music playing on piano) 
 Director : One minute to showtime, preacher. 
 You're gonna kill it. You always do. 
 It's like opening for the Stones. (Chuckles) 
 You are just as good as your father. 
 Besides, Jagger's getting old. It's time for the next generation. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Shouldn't you be sitting? The doctor... 
 Does not know squat. 
 Come on. 
 30 seconds to air. 
 Hey, you could be onstage with my dad. 
 The view's better from back here. 
 Go on, preacher man. Knock 'em dead. 
 (Cheering and applause) 
 We're on in five, four, three... 
 (Rock music intro plays) 
 Does God want us to fear him? 
 Audience : No! 
 Is that what you think? 
 Audience : No! 
 No. No, I don't think so either, friends. 
 See, my father's teachings show us that God, well, God just wants us to love. 
 Yes, he does. Yes, he does! 
 He just wants us to love. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I ask you to remember John 10:10. 
 "I have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly, more abundantly."

 Girl : Hey. 
 Hey, Peter. 
 Hello? Peter. 
 Space cadet. Are you even listening? 
 What? Sorry? 
 I'm trying to ask you when you're heading to Lindsey's party tonight. 
 Oh, yeah, um, uh, I don't know. 
 I don't think I'm gonna go. 
 Just be too... 
 Uh, too... 
 Much fun? Come on, Peter. 
 You can't swim laps all night. 
 And, besides, I wanted you to drive me home. 
 Hey, Petey. 
 You know, hanging out with this chick, it ain't fooling anybody. 
 Hey, Sam, is it true Susan broke up with you 'cause you have a really small... 
 You'd better shut up. 
 Vocabulary? 
 I was gonna say "vocabulary." 
 You think I was saying something else? 
 You know, next time I see you, you're dead. 
 Let's go. 
 (Rapid beeping) Are you getting it? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Seriously, what is this? 
 Wait. 
 Come on. Move. Move. 
 This thing's really close. 
 (Distant boom) 
 (Distorted voices) 
 Man :  There's a lot more at the drop site,  right? 
 Along with some evidence that's gonna put El Jefe away for good. 
 Well, we got to call in the location so we can get a team over there right away. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, my man. Are you listening? 
 Are those fishes delicious? 
 Can we go to Texas this summer? 
 I've never been to Texas. 
 You haven't been to a lot of places. 
 You're six. 
 I know. 
 Well, I do have a cousin in Houston. 
 I'm not going to dad's anymore? 
 No, sweetie. 
 Did he do something wrong again? 
 (Audio on radio distorting)

 I pray you may prosper in all things, just as...

 Man : Joshua! 
 Joshua! 
 (Murmuring) 
 Call 911. Get help! 
 Vera. Vera. 
 Vera! 
 (Panting): Hey, Vera, hey. Wake up. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, God, no. 
 Oh... 
 (Panting) 
 Joshua. Joshua. 
 Did someone called 911? 
 What's going on? 
 I don't think he has a pulse. 
 Maybe it was a heart attack. 
 Michael! 
 (Panting): Vera... 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine, I'm fine. I must have... 
 Must have been dehydrated. 
 Okay, hold on, just stay sitting. 
 No. 
 I called 911. 
 No, no, call them back. 
 I'm fine. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
 Because my name's Alan. 
 When you woke up, you said "Michael." 
 Look, we have to go figure out what the hell it was that fell down over the horizon. 
 No, just take a second. 
 I'm gonna grab you some water. Just... 
 Let's go. 
 (Siren blares) (Indistinct radio chatter) 
 Easy. 
 Let me get the legs free. 
 What are her vitals? 
 Nothing. She's gone. 
 (Gasping breaths) Stay down! don't move! 
 Amy. Where's Amy? 
 Where's my daughter? Where is she? Amy? 
 Ma'am, please! 
 Amy! 
 Paramedic : Female, critical condition. 
 Let go! Amy! 
 Please, ma'am, come back. 
 Man : Get us some help! 
 (Coughing) 
 (Coughing) 
 Let's go. 
 What the hell? 
 What happened? 
 We thought you were dead. 
 (High-pitched whirring) (Grunts in pain) 
 You all right there? 
 Male voice :  Remember the training. It's three to the chest. 
 What's wrong, buddy? 
 It's just a headache. 
 Nah, you're all right... It's just been a tough day. 
 Male voice:   Isabel... We're doing this for you.  (Groans in pain)  Three to the chest. 
 Who's... who's Isabel? 
 Isabel? What are you talking about? 
 She's my wife. How the hell do you know her name? 
 Whoa, slow down, slow down. 
 We're all on the same team here. 
 You're gonna kill me, aren't you? 
 Three shots to the chest, right? 
 No, nobody's killing anybody. 
 He knows... What's it matter? 
 Yeah, we're gonna kill you. 
 You want to do this?! 
 Just let me go. 
 Man : No! don't do it! 
 (Gunshots, grunting) 
 (Crows cawing) 
 (Gasping) 
 (Panting) Baby! What happened? 
 Are you okay? Hey, talk to me. 
 Baby, what's wrong? What happened? 
 Talk to me. 
 We thought you were gone. 
 I need to make a broadcast. 
 Tonight. 
 Anything, son. 
 We must share our miracle. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey, can you... can you please tell me what's going on? 
 She's still in surgery. 
 We'll know something soon. 
 Where the hell is she? Where's Amy? 
 It was an accident. 
 It was... 
 Nothing's ever your fault, is it? 
 Our daughter is in here, and this is what you do? 
 You did this! 
 Ronnie : You did this! She's in here because of you! 
 The police report's gonna say you were drinking, again. 
 But that's not true. 
 It's true if I say it's true. 
 Don't do this, Ronnie. 
 I swear to God, Erin, if she dies... 
 (Crying quietly) 
 Man :  So, I know high school  can be a difficult time, Peter, and you sometimes feel hopeless. 
 Hopeless? 
 Yeah. 
 About the present or the future. 
 Is this how you interrogate people who almost drown? 
 Your previous suicide attempt is in your file, Peter. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 It doesn't have anything to do with today. 
 I was swimming, and the next thing I know, I'm coughing up water. 
 That's the end of it. 
 I have practice tomorrow, early. 
 We'll need to notify one of your parents, then you can go. 
 Notify the group foster home... 
 Where I live. 
 Or is that not in your file? 
 (Bird screeches in distance) 
 Definitely calling the cops, bro. 
 I seem to find myself in need of some clothes. 
 Not sure I can help you. 
 But I insist. 
 I understand completely. 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 Thanks. 
 It's so strange. 
 What? 
 Houston says they've got it under control. 
 I mean, they're 700 miles away. 
 So maybe they know something we don't. 
 It's a meteor event... I mean, it's definitely our territory. 
 Yeah, well, if it is a meteor, then, you know, it'll still be there tomorrow. 
 Alan, the energy from the impact knocked me out. 
 That's weird. 
 Did I just try to advise caution? 
 I'm sorry. My mistake. 
 Whatever it is... 
 We're gonna be the ones who find it.

 Alan :  You know, Vera, when I first got to you back there,  maybe it was just me being panicked, but... I couldn't find your pulse. 
 My heart's still beating, obviously. 
 No, I can see that. 
 I'm just... It was still pretty scary. 
 (Radio playing) Wait. 
 Newsman : Government sources are telling us that you can thank a giant solar flare for a burst of radiation, which disrupted radio signals across America today, causing cell phones, computers and various small electronic devices to go on the fritz. 
 Currently, it's 3:00... 
 What? 
 It wasn't a solar flare. And what government source? 
 We're the government sources. 
 I mean... who told the news it was a solar flare? 
 Why are you looking at me? I was with you the whole time. 
 It definitely made impact... 
 Why don't they just say that it was a meteor? 
 Please let it be aliens. 
 No. Not again. Seriously? 
 A guy mistakes a drone for a UFO one time and he loses all credibility? 
 I'm turning up the radio.

 Vera, you know where we are? 
 33.6773 North, 106.4754 West... 
 I know exactly where we are. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 Trinity? 
 So we're saying that a meteor just happened to land at the exact spot where the first nuclear bomb was tested? 
 Vera! 
 Okay, maybe we shouldn't just run up the m... 
 Hey, just slow down a second. Just... 
 This is incredible. 
 You're telling  me. 
 Whoa. 
 The sand's melted from extreme heat. 
 It's like tektite. 
 That's what I'm thinking. 
 And that smell. 
 Definitely sulfur. 
 Exactly. 
 That plus melting... Suggests it was a meteor. 
 Yeah, but... 
 Doesn't the location of Trinity feel, like, a little too convenient, no? 
 Like what, you think it was aimed like a weapon? 
 I mean, it's either another weapons test, or someone is trying to make a point. 
 Yeah, but we traced the trajectory... it didn't come from Earth. 
 Look, this is something that somebody (helicopter approaching) didn't want us to know about. 
 What makes you say that?

This is our site as much as it is anyone else's. It's for your own safety. You could have been exposed to environmental toxins. (Laughs) Would that be from a solar flare or some other cover story? What is it that you're hiding? See that? I know what that is. You're taking core samples. I need to be a part of this. This could be a very important scientific site. Sergeant Andrews will escort you to your car. I'm not leaving. Take me to Guantanamo, whatever-whatever you have to do, but I'm not leaving here without answers. Alan : Okay, don't say "Guantanamo."

Great. Now I owe you. Yeah. You owe me. A lot. You see the striations? If we can identify those impurities, we can figure out what this is. You sure you don't want me to drive you home? No. Because I worry about you. Generally, because of the emotional detachment, and specifically because of the passing out. Not to mention, who is this Michael guy? I'm sorry. Maybe that was... He's someone that's been gone a long time. You don't need to worry about me, okay? Okay. Good night, Alan. Oh, I'm sorry. (Classical music playing) This episode you had... Was very traumatic, I know, but it's no excuse. We counsel hope, not fire and brimstone. I have a new message. What you're saying could bring us down. This has nothing to do with you.
