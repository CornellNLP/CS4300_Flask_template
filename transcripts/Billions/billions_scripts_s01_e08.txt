 The only deal with teeth would have to take him out of business forever. 
 That's the only deal he would never take. 
 I can get him to come to you. 
 Orrin : The defendant agrees to an aggregate financial penalty of 1.9 billion dollars. 
 Didn't he say that he would never settle? 
 [check rips, rustles] 
 Take a look at Chapter Ten. It's a problem. 
 Orrin : It isn't flattering. 
 Looking at some pretty serious reputational damage here. 
 He made some shrewd trades around 9/11. 
 You know, he did what he had to do. 
 You have an informant in Axe Capital. 
 Bryan : Our tech guys were able to pull metadata that established he'd been in contact with insiders. 
 We had him boxed up. He broke like a Mexican condom. 
 Do all guys in my position hate themselves for doing this? 
 I'm still gonna need you to keep me informed. 
 Then you're not really recused. 
 I am. Officially. 
 You used to be one of the most open people here. 
 But you've... withdrawn from me.

My boss is here, and he's got a book with a redacted chapter that you'll be interested in. Come here. Albus. I wanted you to meet my friend, Kate Sacker. We were in Tiger, in together.

[door opens] [door closes] Okay, if this is about Axelrod, I can't be here. Why'd you text me? Kate : You just need to read this thing I found. It'll make your day. Tell me. The reason Axe wasn't in the Towers on 9/11 with the rest of his company was because he was at his attorney's office going over his severance package. That's what's great about you, Sacker. Always ears out. So they were brooming him? Bryan : Big-time. Partners thought his trades were over the line, maybe illegal. 9/11... their deaths... saved his career. It allowed him to take over the firm, rename it for himself. Bryan : And it gets worse. Listen to this... "Bobby claims that he was supporting the rescue efforts on 9/11, but like everything else in his life, this is a lie. Because after the dust settled..." [sighs] "...the whispers began.

Uh, I might've shown him the manuscript, told him the sitch. Why would you show him... I...uh... I tell my dad everything. And when I brought that book home, I needed some advice. I knew what would happen with it, and I didn't know if I could or  should  be involved in that. And he convinced me to bring it in. Thanks for setting her straight. I advised her it was her duty to share it with her superiors, even if something unethical might happen with it after. Unethical? Dad... Maybe it's inevitable that Axelrod's darkest secrets will be made public. Inevitability is a problematic moral justification for anything. Look, Mr. Sacker... Call me Frank. Frank...

I appreciate your discretion. Of course. Please. [exhales] Well... You probably know I have standing offers from a number of firms. I chose to set this meeting with you. We respect that. Our firm has a lot to offer. [glass clatters] Now... I know this is not about money for you, but I also know that your current annual salary, 185,000, is what you would make in a week at Horvath. Hmm. And what would you expect from me in exchange? Your expertise, image, prestige. You would never have a boring day because you would never have to do anything you don't wanna do. If you wanna be a rainmaker, you can make rain. If you want to play golf, you can be on the circuit every Monday. Company box at sporting events, partner junkets to the Super Bowl. Four weeks vacation every year. Well, eight if you prefer. In due time, your name would be on the firm, of course. ♪ pensive music ♪ All you have to do is say yes. ♪♪♪ Hall : We got him. An investigation we dug up at the SEC. He got picked up, leveraged, turned against you. Don't be surprised. Happens all the time. On a long enough timeline, everyone you know will turn against you.

I'm running a story on you. I'm hoping to get a comment. That's not why you're here. You could've called. You're here 'cause you have something big... to you. Something you think you can hurt me with. Goes like this... September 11, 2001. You're in a lawyer's office. You're being fired by your partners. A plane crashes into the North Tower. [cover closes, iPad clicks] People are burning and dying. And everyone you work with sees it happen. So you call a broker... Lincoln Chang in Jersey City... and have him short aviation stocks in the European markets. Then US hotels, shipping. You go against it all. The second plane hits. Everyone you work with is dead. People are lining up to give blood. New York's bravest, your wife-to-be's brother, runs into the buildings to help. He never comes back out, while  you  sit back in your chair with a smile on your face making hundreds of millions of dollars. And you take that money and the rest of everything your dead partners had, and you call it Axe Capital. That about right? ♪ tense music ♪ Congratulations.
