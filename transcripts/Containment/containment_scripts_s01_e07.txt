 So what's going on? 
 Possible flu outbreak. 
 The virus can replicate at an accelerated rate. 
 We're placing your zone of the city under complete quarantine. 
 It's bad, baby, but your office is probably the safest place that you can be right now. 
 Tony : There's someone in the garage. 
 I'll take that. 
 Unh! 
 [shouting] 
 Jana : He saved my life! 
 Dennis : Well, he's not coming in when your 48-hour quarantine is over. 
 He knows everything about this building, and we need that. 
 I think we're being lied to. 
 I saw two bodies. They were both dead before Patient Zero. 
 Tell me what I can do. 
 Did you check the backup security tapes? 
 Yeah. They tape over them every two days. 
 There must be backup drives. 
 Now from the very beginning, you believed that they were lying to us. 
 What if we can prove that you were right? 
 It's corrupted, and whatever it is they're trying to hide, they're doing a pretty good job of it. 
 Get it to Jana. She's the only person I can trust with this, and I know she can fix it. 
 I've got the only open line of communication in the cordon. 
 How much would that be worth to you? 
 Welcome to the Old Fourth Lords. 
 He's sick in that storeroom. You can't still think we're safe here. 
 Walk left down this aisle, hug the wall, and go out the back door. 
 You know where we're going. 
 I'll follow as soon as I can. 
 We got visitors. 
 Sam : You know them? 
 Let them up. 
 No. 
 What? 
 Teresa : That's my mom. 
 [static] 
 [Leanne gasps] 
 _ 
 Everybody, listen up! Listen up! 
 I want our phone back, or Mom gets it. 
 We have your phone. We didn't know. We swear. 
 Let's just stay calm. 
 I don't care, lady. Let me in and give it to me. 
 Can you let him in? 
 Jana : Suzy, please. 
 Dennis : Don't do it, Suzy. 
 Hey! You sure about that, hmm? 
 Leanne : You don't even have the guts. 
 I'll kill her right here and leave her. 
 Let them in, Suzy, please. 
 Hey, don't! 
 Don't, Suzy! 
 Let them in now! 
 Jana : All right. This guy and his gang are trying to make money of the cordon situation, and you don't make money by shooting people. 
 All right? So the smart choice is for him to come through, take back the phone, and leave us. 
 [beep, air hisses] 
 [whimpers] 
 [whimpers] 
 Now where's the phone? 
 There. happy? 
 Yeah. happy. 
 But Mom's still coming with me. 
 No! 
 We gave you the phone. 
 Trey says he needs her back at the store. 
 Says to bring those two, also. 
 No. Don't even think about it. 
 Jana : Hey, hey, hey! 
 All right. All right. 
 Stairs back that way? 
 Why? 
 Because I'm not stupid enough to get caught in your glass box. 
 Let's go! 
 All right, all right. 
 Back up! 
 SUZY, WHISPERING: Jana. 
 Xander : All right. 
 Man : Come on. Let's go! 
 You're gonna point a gun on a pregnant woman? 
 Look at me. Look at me. 
 We gave you the phone. Now go on your way. 
 Naw. I ain't going nowhere without the Moms. 
 Trey would kill me. 
 [gun cocks] 
 The Mom stays. 
 Cannerts : I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 Lommers : I recommend we institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 Lex : What I need is the truth. 
 Jake : Yeah, I'm in the middle of the damn hot zone, Lex. 
 Jana! If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 Jake : Go on. And you. 
 There you go. 
 Yeah. There you go. 
 Take your stairs. 
 Well, it seems like you got everything well in hand in here. 
 Thank you. 
 Leanne : Hey. Hey. You're the guy that helped us at the grocery mart. 
 Yeah. You got those security cameras working yet? 
 It's Xander, right? 
 Yeah. 
 You must be his girlfriend. 
 OK. I'm gonna need a flow chart to make sense of all this. 
 Tony : What's the cop doing here? 
 Good question. 
 Jake, what are you doing here? 
 Special delivery from Lex. 
 MAN ON P.A.: Maintain a safe distance from the perimeter. 
 All persons, maintain safe distance from the perimeter. 
 Captain Scott. 
 Scott : That's right. 
 It's Carnahan, right? 
 Yeah. 
 You in charge of this DMZ? 
 Well, we don't like the term DMZ. 
 Safe zone. 
 Hundred-yard buffer between the cordon wall and healthy society. 
 It's a good idea. 
 That remains to be seen. 
 What can I do for you, Major? 
 Detail assignments. 
 You have my unit on perimeter sweep. 
 So? 
 That's sanitation work. 
 We're a police force, not waste management. 
 And now you're under National Guard purview, my purview. 
 A lot of healthy, non-cordon people being displaced because of this DMZ... safe zone. 
 You know where all these people are going? 
 We set up shelters in 6 sectors. 
 Not what I'm asking. What I'm asking is do you know where these people are going, each person individually? 
 Shelter assignments are allotted on a need-based rolling system. 
 So in other words, you don't know. 
 You know, I did my homework on you, Carnahan. 
 I know you've been chosen to run point on this. 
 I also know you're walking on thin ice. 
 No more PSAs, a failed food drop. 
 Not a coincidence the Guard got the call. 
 You may not be a guest at this party much longer. 
 Oh, I don't consider it a party. 
 This is my city. 
 I want you to do better. 
 These people deserve it. 
 Jake : Hey. Do you think, um, if I had worn this on our one and only date we would have gone out again? 
 It's an improvement on the trucker hat. 
 Aw, come on. 
 But it does not make up for the meal. 
 What kind of guy trying to impress takes a girl to Waffle Train? 
 Oh. I mean, you got to love Waffle Train. 
 I mean, come on. 
 Yeah, um, no. You actually don't got to love Waffle Train. 
 [beep] 
 I know that face. 
 What, it's not good? 
 Hmm. Uh, no. This is not gonna be so simple. 
 Someone went through and manually corrupted this file. 
 So first I have to recover the data, and then I can decrypt it. 
 What's on this thing again? 
 It's surveillance footage from the day the outbreak started, proof that we're being lied to. 
 How did Lex even get this? 
 You don't want to know. 
 Wait. Lex, my Lex broke the rules? 
 Uh-uh. Is he all right? 
 It's not great on the outside either. 
 [Teresa moaning] 
 She's in pain. What if it's preeclampsia? 
 It's not preeclampsia. What do you even know about that? 
 I've read 8 pregnancy guides, and it's in all of them. 
 What makes you so sure that it's not? 
 Well, because unlike you, I've actually had a baby. I don't need a book. 
 Hey. She going into labor? 
 Hi. I can still talk, and to answer your question, no, not yet. 
 Probably Braxton Hicks. 
 I need to lie down. 
 Jana : I'll put her in a clean suit and bring her back to Clean Room 3. 
 It's quieter. You can rest. No germs. 
 Is that... 
 Thank you. 
 So I have some towels and a few blankets. 
 I wish I had more. 
 You've already done so much. 
 You are gonna have a hell of a story to tell your kid. 
 And then she'll roll her eyes like kids do at their parents' boring stories. 
 [loud bang] 
 Uh, s-s-stay right here. 
 What was that? 
 Gunshot. 
 Sounded like a 9-millimeter. Could be that thug's gun. 
 Guys, check this out. 
 Jake : I know these guys. 
 They're tweaked out of their gourds. Bad news. 
 Suzy : What do you think they want? 
 I think we're gonna find out. 
 I just don't understand what they want. 
 It's a computer lab. 
 I ran into those guys in the streets. 
 They're part of a work release program for drug addicts, usually meth heads and aggressive. 
 There's got to be a dozen of them. 
 Yeah, maybe more. I mean, if they even think that there are chemicals to huff in here, they'll run through walls to get in. 
 We got a lot of cleaning agents, hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid, trichloroethane, and we just got a delivery of methylene chloride. 
 Jake : Oh, good. Sounds like you're a couple Sudafeds short of a meth lab. 
 Suzy : Why now? 
 Those guys have been down there for days. 
 So the thug could have given them access, maybe even told them what we got in here. 
 He could have seen all the chemicals. 
 OK. They're trying to get in, so we need to secure this office. 
 We've got a pregnant girl who needs her rest. 
 We're gonna keep it on the QT. 
 Sam, you know this building the best. 
 This place isn't the ivory tower you think it is. 
 Sure you've got a code-secure elevator, ceiling vents are closed circuit, but the floor vents are accessible, and there's a fire exit on the roof that leads to the stairwell. 
 OK. So we lock down the fire exit, and we secure the vents. 
 I'm sorry. I think we're looking at this wrong. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 So how should we look at it, Tony? 
 Everybody wants something. 
 They want chemicals to smoke. The cop said it. 
 I said huff, not smoke. 
 You smoke chemicals, you explode. 
 Huff, smoke, whatever. 
 Let's make a deal for the chemicals, and we all walk away happy. 
 OK. You see how we're all debating this rationally? 
 I guarantee you those tweakers down there aren't having the same kind of civilized conversation. 
 They're straight up bent, and they want to stay that way. 
 That's as far as their logic goes. 
 Whereas you as a cop, you can see the whole chess board. 
 All right. I'm going up to the roof to seal off the fire exit. 
 Dennis : I'm gonna help you, Jake. I have a gun in my safe. 
 Wait. You have a gun? Since when? 
 I mean, I've had a gun in my safe for years for emergencies. 
 And what have we been dealing with exactly? 
 You can come. 
 Yes. 
 OK. Let's do this. 
 [door opens] 
 Hey, baby. 
 You look cute. 
 No, no, I don't, I don't. 
 Why are you closing the blinds? 
 Just trying to keep it a clam space for you. 
 Gonna close those vents, too. 
 Is this because of that noise? 
 What was it? 
 It was... it was probably nothing. 
 Ohh. It was a gunshot. 
 OK. 
 You're quick at this. 
 Hmm. My family owns a masonry business. 
 Laying bricks... I hated it. 
 Hard work, huh? 
 I thought I was so smart to get into tech. 
 Now I'm wishing maybe I wasn't so damn smart. 
 Yeah. 
 We really should get her to the hospital. 
 Just getting there would be hard for her. 
 I mean, we can't exactly Uber it. 
 Plus word on the street is the hospital is where you go to get the virus. 
 Well, it's also where you go to get the medicine. 
 No hospital. I just need to rest. 
 I know my own body. 
 So when Teresa finally has the baby, you really think this is the better place to have it? 
 This place is as clean as you're gonna find in the cordon. 
 Heh. Yet another decision that shows me you are not ready to become parents. 
 Hey! 
 Leanne, a word now. 
 Okay. You gonna tell me what a great dad you're gonna be? 
 Because I think you have absolutely no idea how difficult it is being a parent. 
 I don't give a damn what you think, but I do care what she thinks, and right now, she doesn't need a debate. 
 She needs a unified front because right now in her state stress could throw her into labor, so that means you and me, we hold back all our dirty laundry until after this baby is born. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Yeah. You're right. 
 What? 
 You're right. 
 The focus should be on Teresa. 
 We should support her. 
 Jake : Just follow my lead. 
 I should be able to tie this door off pretty quick. 
 Yeah. Hey. Look. I got you covered, OK? 
 Whoa, whoa, OK. Just try not to shoot yourself or me. 
 Yeah, right. I mean, that goes without saying. 
 All right. Here we are. 
 Man : Raah! 
 Unh! 
 Ugh! Agh. 
 Raah! 
 [gagging] 
 DIFFERENT MAN: Ohh! 
 [Dennis' gun clicking] 
 [gunshots] 
 [Dennis panting] 
 Heh. 
 Dennis : Ohh. Damn it. 
 It jammed. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I saw. 
 When's the last time you cleaned that thing, huh? 
 It just jammed up. 
 All right. Hey. Listen. Listen to me. 
 Take a breath. Hey. Take a breath. 
 What's next? 
 We tie this thing off and get the hell out of here because I guarantee these guys aren't the only ones. 
 I'm starting to feel like Mother Superior, telling everyone what to do. 
 Sam : Mother Superior can be valuable in a situation like this. 
 I once was in a group home run by nuns, and they all scared me. 
 Mother Superior terrified me. 
 Wait. 
 What is it? 
 [thudding] 
 Are they in there? 
 Knowing the duct work of this place, those sounds could be coming from anywhere in the HVAC line. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Tony : Suzy, help! 
 [man grunting] 
 Aah! Aah! Aah! 
 Hey! 
 Stay with Teresa. 
 Stay with Teresa, please. 
 [shouting] 
 Suzy : Jana! 
 Suzy, lighter now. 
 Tony : Hurry! 
 All right. Stay back! 
 [screaming] 
 This is messed up. 
 Tony, are you OK? 
 This is messed up! 
 It's all right, buddy. It's over. 
 Don't "buddy" me. 
 I told you we should have negotiated with them, and now they're attacking us? 
 This is so messed up on so many levels. 
 Damn it. 
 Tony. 
 You're not always right, Jana. 
 Sam : No. Let him go, let him go. He's scared, he's scared. 
 [low chatter] 
 Mind if I sit down? 
 It's a free country. 
 At least it was. 
 How'd you find me? 
 They set up 6 shelters. 
 This is the fourth one I checked. 
 You getting everything you need here? 
 Older I get, the less I need. 
 I just need people to leave me alone. 
 When did you start drinking tea? 
 I thought you were a black, two sugars man for life. 
 Nothing is for life, son. 
 Life changes, surprises you, it bites you in the ass. 
 That's a lovely sentiment. 
 Well, I'm sorry I can't be all chipper for you, but I'm living in a church. 
 It's not even a Methodist church. 
 I'm gonna get you a coffee, Dad. 
 
 
 
 Sam : Banging on this thing, she's got a flamethrower. 
 What happened to Mrs. Clean? 
 The guy breached the airspace. 
 The clean rooms are now dirty. 
 Hey. What the hell happened? 
 The guys were coming in through the vents. 
 I took care of it. 
 How's the roof? 
 Sealed off. Should hold. 
 You think these guys are gonna give up? 
 Heh. Office full of huffables? No way. 
 Dennis : Where's Tony? 
 Huh? 
 Where's Tony? 
 I... 
 He was just here. I... 
 [elevator moving] 
 The elevator. 
 He was talking about negotiating with those guys. 
 That's a bad idea. 
 Jana : Sam, can you stop the elevator with your override key? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 [elevator moving] 
 Wait. It's coming back up. 
 Maybe he's come to his senses. 
 You think it's safe? 
 [elevator stops] 
 [Suzy gasps] 
 [screaming] 
 Ugh! 
 Jake : Stop. 
 Suzy : Oh, my God. 
 Suzy. 
 He might still be alive! 
 Jana : Suzy, don't. 
 Come here. 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Jake : Get back, get back. 
 Go on. 
 [growls] 
 [coughing, gagging] 
 [gasps] 
 Guy was infected. 
 You think? 
 [church bell ringing] 
 Here. 
 [keys jingle] 
 You can stay at my place. 
 Just until you're allowed home. 
 I don't need your charity. 
 Since when is a son taking in his father charity? 
 Maybe when they hardly speak. 
 And whose fault is that? 
 Seen you on the TV. 
 Jana must be proud. 
 Jana's inside. 
 Oh, man. 
 This whole situation is so bad. 
 I agree. 
 Yeah, but you part of it. 
 Spokesman. Mr. Wonderful. 
 I'm not a spokesman anymore. 
 My position with the force is complicated right now. 
 The Chief definitely isn't happy. 
 Well, welcome to my world. 
 Always told you be careful. 
 No. You told me to be angry. 
 Yeah. Hell, yeah, and you angry, ain't you? 
 I guess I am. 
 Don't guess. 
 Back when I had my situation, I was always a pain in the side of the stripes, speaking truth to power. 
 My white watch commander called me that hateful word, and I decked him. 
 So you told me. 
 You lost your cool, you lost our pension. 
 Yeah, but this is the part I didn't tell you. 
 After I hit him, he lay there on the ground, smiling because he had won. He played me. 
 I don't regret what I did. 
 I just wish I had slit his throat in the night and not got caught. 
 That's how you treat your enemies. 
 That's your advice? 
 That's always been my advice, but you're just now willing to hear it. 
 I want you to do something for me. 
 And what's that? 
 Take the keys. 
 Be angry at the world, be angry at me, but take the keys. 
 [sighs] 
 All right. Let's see. 
 [computer beeping] 
 OK. Data's recovered. Now I can start decryption. 
 You really think there's a conspiracy going on here? 
 Something doesn't pass the smell test. 
 Katie's right about that. 
 Katie. You gonna finally tell me about her? 
 You are a nosey one, aren't you? 
 I am. Ha ha! So spill it. 
 What? 
 She's... she's great. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She... she's got a son, Quentin. 
 She's... she's beautiful and... 
 Yeah, you told me all of that before. 
 Come on, Jake. 
 What else do you want to know? 
 I want to know why we're talking about her. 
 Oh, I cannot believe that you of all people are telling me to open up. 
 Quit stalling. 
 All right. 
 She's strong but vulnerable. 
 She takes care of me. 
 She needs taking care of, and this is the crazy thing. I mean, here we are in the middle of this outbreak situation, right, and... she's all I can think about. 
 I was almost killed up there in that stairwell, and the thing I was worried about wasn't... wasn't death. 
 It was that I wasn't gonna see her again. 
 You tell her that, OK? 
 Don't hold back. 
 I missed my shot with Lex. 
 Don't miss yours. 
 You'll get your shot with Lex. 
 Hey. 
 I know it. 
 Hey. 
 How are my girls doing? 
 We're fine. 
 Yeah? 
 No more pain? 
 No. Resting up. 
 Good. 
 What's wrong? 
 This. Everything. 
 It's too much. 
 Hey. We're gonna make it through. 
 Exactly. 
 We're not talking about the excitement of having a baby or the thrill of our future as a family. 
 We're talking about making it through. 
 Listen. Making it through is all we can do right now. 
 Lots of parents, lots of families, even outside the cordon, are just trying to make it through. 
 Sometimes, that's all you can do. 
 That's life, T. 
 What if my mom was right? 
 What if we're not ready to become parents? 
 T, no. 
 Suzy : Hey. Uh, any of you guys hungry? 
 Uh, I'm... I'm good. 
 What about you, Teresa. 
 I know you're pregnant and you're probably always hungry. 
 We have some juice in our bag, but it's, uh... it's by the entrance. 
 That's OK. I'll get it. 
 Thanks. 
 Sam : Need traction. Hand me that. 
 [beep] 
 Hello?! 
 They cut the power. 
 [Suzy banging on door] 
 Help! Help! 
 Stay 4 to 6 feet away from each other. 
 Lex : You all have your orders. 
 Anything suspicious, you let me know. 
 If you see something, say something. 
 [shouting orders indistinctly] 
 Carnahan. 
 I got to say, after our last conversation, I'm a little shocked to see you here. 
 Life changes, surprises you. 
 I like that. Carry on, Major. 
 Help! Help! 
 Suzy. 
 I don't have enough air. 
 There's plenty of air, Suzy. 
 You just need to calm down. 
 I can't. I'm hyperventilating. 
 Ugh! 
 Suzy, look at me. 
 Just keep breathing. 
 Whenever you tell me to keep breathing, I get nervous. 
 And then you do keep breathing, and everything turns out to be fine, and then we have a good laugh later, hmm? 
 If there is a later. 
 Drinks on me when this is over, OK? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 Come on. How about some peach wine coolers for old times sakes, huh? 
 [thud] 
 What is that? 
 Oh, my God. There's something in the elevator. 
 Jana, come on. 
 Um, Suzy, I'll be right back. 
 No. 
 [banging, metal scraping] 
 They must have stopped the elevator just below to use as a platform. 
 Cutting the power releases the electric locking mechanism on the elevator doors. 
 These guys are smarter than we thought. 
 I'll take care of this. 
 There's a generator override switch in the telemetry area downstairs. 
 I was here when they set up the system. 
 I know the code. I can throw it on. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No. Stay here. 
 It'll take me 5 minutes down and back. 
 The more people defending the elevator, the better if it comes down to that. 
 Jana, that stairwell is not secure. 
 OK. I just need to do this quickly because if Suzy finds out that people are gone, she's gonna lose it. 
 Look. She's claustrophobic. 
 She needs you here. 
 OK. If you're not back in 5 minutes, I'm coming to find you. 
 Deal. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [door shuts] 
 Unh! 
 [gasping] 
 Suzy : They've got the doors open! 
 Man : Get it! 
 It's OK, Suzy. 
 They're coming in! 
 It's OK. Just stay calm. It's gonna be fine, all right? 
 Man : Get in there! Open it. 
 Suzy... 
 [typing] 
 [hard drive whirring] 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Man : Almost, almost. 
 [Suzy breathing heavily] 
 The power's up, the power's up. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Get the other door. 
 Suzy : Dennis! 
 [men shouting] 
 No, no! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Ohh! 
 Oh, my God. 
 [cell phone chiming] 
 Hello? 
 Lex, it's me. 
 Jana? How... how are you calling me on a... on a APB sat phone? 
 Lex, help, please. 
 Look. I don't... I don't know if the police have some sort of emergency plan out there, but this is an emergency. 
 We need help. I need help! 
 Jana, what's... what's... 
 Raah! 
 Lex! Aah! 
 Jana? Jana? 
 Aah! 
 [phone beeps] 
 There she is! Get her! Come on, go, go! 
 Come on, lady! We want to be friends! 
 Come on! 
 Go! 
 Get her! 
 Yeah! 
 Let's go. Come on. 
 Good job. Sam got the elevator. 
 Those guys, they're everywhere, OK? 
 I saw them in the monitor. 
 I mean, there are so many more than I thought, and they've got power tools. They're coming in here. 
 We've held them off this long, right? 
 It's only a matter of time. 
 Right? Hey. Look at me. 
 Look at me, look at me. 
 I need you calm, OK? 
 Are you infected? 
 No. 
 Are you infected? 
 No! This is bad, Jake. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 What would Lex do? 
 Lex would solve it. He solves everything, but I am not Lex. 
 Yeah. Me neither, OK, but we got to do what we can to figure this out right now. 
 I have an idea, OK, but it's crazy. 
 OK. Crazy might be just what we need right now. 
 Soldier : Freeze! 
 [alarm blaring] 
 Evening, Major. 
 Quiet spot, which of course you would know since you helped set up this cordon. 
 Party's over. 
 [power tools whirring] 
 How's it going, Jana? They're breaking through! 
 Almost done! 
 Vents are clear. 
 Go! 
 Jana, get out of there! 
 [men shouting] 
 Jana, now! 
 Ready? 
 We're good. We're ready. 
 Go, go! 
 Man : Come on! 
 Move! 
 Break it down, man! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 [shouting] 
 Where is it, where is it? 
 There it is! 
 Stuff's in there! 
 Break it! Just break it! 
 [cheering] 
 Now, Jake! 
 [men shouting] 
 Whoa! 
 [coughing] 
 Look at this. 
 Are they all dead? 
 Raah! 
 Aah! 
 They are now. 
 Teresa : Mom? 
 Teresa : Mom? 
 Aah! Ohh. 
 He bit me. 
 Fleurie : ♪ How can I say this without breaking? ♪ 
♪ How can I say this ♪ 
♪ Without taking over? ♪ 
♪ How can I put it down ♪ 
♪ Into words when it's ♪ 
♪ Almost too much for my soul alone ♪ 
♪ I loved, and I loved, and I lost you ♪ 
 [Scott whistles] 
 Move out! 
 ♪ I loved, and I loved, and I lost you ♪ 
♪ I loved, and I loved ♪ 
♪ And I lost you ♪ 
 That's the last of the bodies. 
 Sam's said he's got the rest of this handled. 
 Here. Recovered and decrypted, all the footage restored. 
 I hope you can find something on there you can use. 
 It survived. 
 I pocketed it before we blew up the place. 
 Thank you. 
 I need you to call Lex when you get back to the hospital. 
 Tell him I'm OK now. 
 [chuckles] 
 No. I probably scared the hell out of him. 
 Yeah. I'll tell him you're a badass is what I'll tell him. 
 Also, the satellite phone the thug brought in, it had a government serial number on it. 
 Lex thought I was calling him from an APB phone. 
 That's weird, right, that they had it? 
 Very. 
 Yeah. Let me look into that. 
 [sighs] 
 You guys gonna be OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Just poor Teresa. 
 Her mom can't stay, not if she's infected. 
 I know. 
 Doesn't make it any easier.

 How are we ever gonna clean this up? 
 We're not. 
 What? 
 Just trying not to die, it's no way to live. 
 We have to find a way out of the cordon. 
 The sooner, the better. 
 Mommy, you don't have to go. What if you're not infected? 
 What if I am? 
 I need to self-quarantine. 
 We can come with you. 
 Absolutely not. 
 You stay here, stay safe. 
 Teresa, get some rest, get healthy. 
 It'll only be 48 hours. I'll be back soon. 
 When people are young, they think they know everything. 
 One of the nice things about getting older is that you realize you don't always know everything. 
 People make mistakes. 
 I made one. 
 No. No. You were just trying to look out for me. 
 That's what mothers do. 
 I'm sorry I ever told you to give up the baby. 
 You're both gonna be great parents. 
 I know it. 
 You've got a good man in Xander, and you're gonna love that girl. 
 That's all that matters. 
 No. Th... there has to be another way. 
 I don't want you to leave. Please. 
 I'm always with you. 
 I love you.
