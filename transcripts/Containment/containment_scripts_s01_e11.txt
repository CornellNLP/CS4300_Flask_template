 Given the threat of bioterrorism,  this is now a matter of national security. As such, I recommend that we institute top-level containment measures to protect the citizens of this city. 
 If this was just a moment in time, I just want you to know I'm still glad I met you. 
 Jake :  There's no version of my life that doesn't have you in it. 
 That doesn't look good. I'll go ask Dr. Cannerts  for some medicine. 
 Scott :  We have a situation. The group of protesters is growing. 
 Give me that! No, stop! (groans) 
 Where's Mary? 
 We had to leave her. 
 Britney : She got sick. 
 What, you mean, like, sick sick? 
 Put her down. Please. Just put her down. 
 The whole damn thing is Lommers. She's playing you. 
 I want you to resign. 
 I'll call a press conference... 
 And you will resign. 
 You look good. 
 (coughs) 
 (gasps) 
 (radio static crackling) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (sighs) 
 Proud of you. 
 You look good, son. 
 Thanks, Pop. 
 I know this won't be easy, but you'll feel better when the press conference is over. 
 So you ready? 
 I'm ready. 
 Lommers :  Thank you for coming. 
 I have prepared a brief statement. 
 I won't be taking any questions. 
 Over the last 16 days, this city has been stretched to its breaking point by a crisis that has tested all of us. 
 I'm here today to confess that you have been misled. 
 (quiet murmuring) 
 The Syrian national, Sayid Nassir, was not Patient Zero. 
 In fact, Mr. Nassir was nothing more than an innocent victim. 
 The virus was manipulated in a lab here, in our own country, through a dangerous and irresponsible gain-of-function study. 
 Though sometimes beneficial in this day and age, where the threat of bioterrorism looms large, these studies are currently not permissible in the United States, due to the potential for accidental outbreaks like this one. 
 And that's what this was. 
 An accident. 
 Nothing more. 
 Disclosing this information publicly is difficult, but I promised you transparency, and so here we are. 
 (cameras clicking) 
 This virus was created by a scientist at the CDC named Dr. Victor Cannerts. 
 When another researcher was accidentally exposed, Dr. Cannerts lied to his superiors and to the world about its origin. 
 He was conducting these experiments with neither the approval nor the support of the CDC. 
 When I learned of his culpability, I immediately called this press conference. 
 I offer apologies to Syria for the unforgiveable accusations... 
 (quietly): Are you kidding me? 
 ...and to the president... 
 What? Oh, my God. 
 ...and the American people for the misinformation and the lies. 
 Now that the American people know the truth, I believe we are capable of looking past the actions of one rogue scientist... 
 Cannerts :  I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 Lommers :  I recommend we institute  a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 Lex :  What I need is the truth. 
 Jake :  We are in the middle of the damn hot zone. (screams) 
 Lex : Jana!  If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 (coughing) 
 (distorted screaming) 
 (panting) 
 Jake :  I mean, there has to be something we can do. 
 You haven't set foot out of that lab since Katie coughed up blood. 
 Hey, tell me. 
 Come on, just tell me. 
 I've been working on isolating Thomas's antibodies to create a passive immunization. 
 It's not a cure, but it may allow someone to live longer. 
 Yeah, so you need a human trial. Sign her up. 
 (sighs) Without more time or resources, there could be a risk of an ABO incompatibility reaction to the antibody serum. 
 Her body could reject it. 
 So? 
 She's already dying. 
 This particular Thomas strain of the virus may be deadly, but it's kinder than its predecessor. 
 Patients remain asymptomatic until past the 40th hour, death is delayed beyond the 48th hour, and the body's ultimate disintegration happens quickly, with precision. 
 Still a terrible outcome, but a shorter one. 
 You're saying it could make death worse. 
 Significantly. 
 Or it could save her. 
 Do it. 
 Cannerts is working on the serum now. 
 Did he eat enough today? 
 Yeah, I got him to eat half an MRE for breakfast. 
 I'll make sure he gets a good lunch. 
 Do you think he understands what's happening? 
 He's being so strong. 
 Yeah, I think he's being strong because he understands exactly what's happening. 
 I, on the other hand, am a mess. (chuckles) 
 But you're still here. 
 For a guy who likes to run, that's kind of a big deal. 
 (chuckles) 
 I won't run. 
 Thomas : I'm special. 
 I'll never run. 
 I'm the only one who can't get sick. 
 Quentin : Shut up, Thomas! 
 She's only sick because of you! 
 Whoa, hey. 
 Quentin... 
 Quentin! 
 I'll get him. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 (grunts softly) 
 (groaning) 
 (groaning) 
 (grunting) 
 Ow! Oh... 
 Ow! 
 (pants) 
 Ow. 
 See the press conference? 
 She slithered right out of it like the snake that she is. 
 Print the damn story. 
 It's too late, Lex. 
 She turned all the evidence we had against her into evidence against Cannerts. 
 She got so far out ahead of our story, we'll never catch her. 
 Yeah, but we could still take her down. 
 Leo : Not anymore. 
 Besser just got promoted to Chief Operating Officer of Atlanta, second to the mayor. 
 Give you three guesses who made that happen. 
 What about the phone call? 
 All right, we can still prove that Patient Zero called her first. 
 Yeah, I circled back with my friend at the NSA. 
 Burns's phone records have been wiped clean. 
 No, no, she won. 
 We can't touch her. 
 And I'm starting to think it's better not to try. 
 Are you kidding? 
 What, you think this-this dog and pony show is actually about Cannerts? 
 Nah, Cannerts is a warning shot, man. 
 Lommers is tying up loose ends, and we're next. 
 You've done nothing for the past two weeks but preach about challenging the system and fighting for the truth! 
 And you know what you've been preaching back at me? 
 Proof. 
 If you're gonna shoot at the king, you don't miss, right? 
 Well, you know what we have? Documents we obtained illegally, we've got computer files we've hacked, the verbal confession of the man who's running the city of Atlanta now, and we're up against a woman who just threw the only doctor with a hope of finding a cure under a triple-decker bus! 
 How do you think we'll fare? 
 Now is not the time to get cold feet. 
 "Cold feet"? 
 This is the Arctic, man. 
 This is the first stop on the Polar Express. 
 I have dug myself out of oblivion once already in my career. 
 Credibility is all that I have right now. 
 If she takes that away from me, I am not a journalist anymore, I'm just a loser with a sad story. 
 I'm out. 
 Leo... 
 If you're smart, you'll get out, too. 
 Leo! 
 Cannerts :  How could she do this to me? 
 MacIntyre : I am so sorry, Victor. 
 I will make sure that your name is cleared. 
 It won't matter. 
 Even if I'm only a small part of the lie... this will follow me forever. 
 My parents... do you think they've seen the news? 
 It's everywhere. 
 They've seen it. 
 (sighs) 
 I'll call 'em after the... 
 David? 
 Quentin :  It's not fair. 
 Why does Thomas get to be healthy and you're not? 
 This all happened because of him. 
 You want to play the blame game? 
 All right, then. 
 Blame me. 
 But it's not your fault. 
 Sure it is. 
 I'm the one who took us on this field trip in the first place. 
 Remember? 
 But you didn't know. 
 Neither did Thomas. 
 You can't blame him any more than you can blame me. 
 You're better than that. 
 Thomas doesn't have anybody left. 
 If Dr. Cannerts can't fix me, you still have your grandma and your grandpa and your cousins and Aunt Sally, and maybe one day your dad will get better and be the kind of dad he should be. 
 But Thomas is all alone. 
 Remember that the next time you want to be mad at him. 
 I'm sorry, Mom. 
 I'm not the one who needs the apology, kiddo. 
 Now... go tell Dr. Cannerts I'm ready for my treatment. 
 Promise me you will get him out of here alive. 
 Hey, you're gonna be right here to help me. 
 Just promise! 
 Please. 
 I promise. 
 (sobbing softly) 
 (sniffles) 
 Please be okay, Bert. 
 Please. 
 (panting) 
 (grunts) 
 (wincing) 
 (grunts) 
 (quiet chatter) 
 Thank you. 
 No bartering. Cash only. 
 I need to speak to Trey. 
 Lucky me. 
 How can I be of assistance? 
 Teresa and Xander sent me for supplies. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Baby soap, formula, diapers. 
 Baby stuff's in the corner. 
 Since what's mine is technically hers, it'll be on discount. 
 (knocking) 
 (door opens) 
 Here you go, man. 
 We good? 
 (door closes) 
 Meese? 
 Jana, hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Lex said that you were on the outside with him and the rest of the guys. 
 Yeah, I was. 
 But, um... 
 I volunteered to help. 
 Ended up getting stuck in here, so I turned it into a business opportunity. 
 Got any cash? 
 Um, not really. 
 Find some. 
 Because for 5,000 a head, I can bust you out of the Cordon. 
 I got no evidence. 
 No allies. 
 Leo Green... he's the one guy to drag me into this, like a dog with a bone, and now he's out. 
 It makes no sense. 
 Well, aren't you mad? 
 Of course I'm mad! 
 I fought the man and-and I lost. 
 Like father, like son. 
 Yeah. 
 I got beat down. 
 And you know the one thing I regret more than anything? 
 It was not getting back up. 
 Get up, son. 
 And do what? 
 I might know a guy. 
 (sighs) 
 (door opens) 
 Hi, Katie. 
 How you feeling? 
 Like my muscles are slowly turning to stone. 
 I can give you some medication for the pain if you'd like. 
 No, um... 
 I worked too hard to get away from all that stuff. 
 If there's a chance I can make it through this clean, I'd like to try. 
 Narcotics Anonymous is a great program. 
 I particularly liked step four. 
 Make a fearless moral inventory of yourself. 
 What do you suppose you'd find, Dr. Cannerts? 
 (clears throat) 
 Courage and integrity. 
 That's the moral code my parents raised us under. 
 This will pinch. 
 Science runs in our blood. 
 The whole family. 
 After university in England, my father arranged a position for me to work with one of the premier researchers in the U.S. 
 Dr. McIntyre took me under his wing. 
 He was more than a mentor. 
 He was like a father to me. 
 He reminded me so much of my parents. 
 Brilliant, fearless, honorable. 
 17 days ago, his wife Sabine called and asked me to quarantine two doctors who'd accidently been exposed to a new viral strain. 
 When I said Sayid Nassir's name as someone who may have also been exposed, she... 
 She told you to say he was Patient Zero. 
 The true Patient Zero was Henry Burns, a researcher conducting illegal viral testing. 
 There was an accident, he became infected, and passed it on to Dr. Sanders here at the hospital. 
 If our contact tracing was correct, it would only have been 48 hours until the danger passed. 
 No one else would've died. 
 You need to confess this to someone who isn't on their deathbed. 
 I know I need to be held accountable for what I've done. 
 But I'm not telling you the truth because I think you're going to die, Katie. 
 I'm telling you, because more than anything in the world... 
 I hope you live. 
 Kind of surprised to hear the lieutenant governor likes you. 
 I didn't think anyone liked you. 
 I paid him to like me. 
 He was the lawyer on my suspension hearing. 
 He fought hard for me. 
 He lost. 
 He's still pissed about it. 
 You think he'll help us? 
 Well, when I knew him, he liked to go to battle against the big guns. 
 And he is one now. 
 So I guess we'll see. 
 (door opens) 
 Is the medicine working? 
 We won't know for a little while. 
 Do you think it will? 
 I want it to. 
 Do you have a mom? 
 I did. She died. 
 Was it awful? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it was awful. 
 And I tried to be strong, but I-I kind of fell apart. 
 I won't do that. 
 You won't? Why not? 
 Because I don't want to be like that in front of her. 
 I don't want her to worry. 
 Yeah, I get that. 
 I get that, but a little bit of advice? 
 You know, one guy to another? 
 She's gonna worry no matter what you do. 
 So I think she'll want you to be like however you feel like being, okay? 
 (sighs) 
 We're not supposed to touch. 
 I know. 
 (sighs) 
 (Bert grunting) 
 (groaning) 
 You okay? 
 Trying to be. 
 It's taking me some time to get home to my wife. 
 Well, um, you might be waiting on the bus for a while. 
 (laughs) 
 It's not too far. 
 Just need to rest for a minute. 
 Not much in the way of food or drink out here. 
 Here. 
 Keep it. 
 I never put my mouth on it, so it's clean. 
 Promise. 
 Thank you. 
 Two days out on these streets and... you're the first person to even look at me, let alone help out. 
 Well, yeah, I... I don't think anyone in here is their best self. 
 Including me. 
 Here. 
 There's some food for you and your wife. 
 And you can use the cart as a walker, take some pressure off your foot. 
 Thank you. 
 Truly. 
 You're one of the good ones. 
 (chuckles) 
 Don't let this place convince you otherwise. 
 Same to you. 
 
 
 
 (door opens) 
 Man : Well, again, congrats. 
 One more promotion, maybe I need to start looking over my shoulder. 
 (both chuckle) 
 All the best, really. 
 (patting on back) 
 I, uh, took the liberty of canceling your appointment. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Besser : Easy now, Roy. I'm just trying to protect Lex's future. 
 He's got a bright one, if he can, uh, fall in line. 
 You mean "sell out." 
 That's the problem with you Carnahan boys. 
 You just don't know when you're beat. 
 (chuckles) 
 (labored breathing) 
 (groans) 
 (groans) 
 (gasping) 
 (sobbing) 
 Dr. Cannerts! 
 Dr. Cannerts! 
 Dr. Cannerts! 
 Hey! Help me, please! 
 Something's wrong! Please help me! 
 Hey! 
 Quentin : Mom! 
 Quentin? 
 Katie : No! 
 (Quentin screams) 
 No! 
 No! 
 (gasping) 
 Thomas : Miss Katie? 
 Thomas. 
 Hi. 
 They said you wanted to talk. 
 Uh, are you mad at me? 
 No. 
 I'm not mad at you, Thomas. 
 Not even a little bit. 
 No one is, not even Quentin. 
 I didn't mean to make Mary sick. 
 Of course you didn't. 
 You're a superhero, remember? 
 Maybe I can give you some of my special healing powers, too. 
 (grunts) 
 (gasps) 
 Whoa. 
 Do you think it worked? 
 Yeah, I think it did. 
 (laughs) 
 (door beeps, opens) 
 Hey, buddy, clear out. 
 The lady and I have a special date. 
 Well, have fun, Miss Katie. 
 Thank you, Thomas. 
 What are you doing? (chuckles) 
 Get your blanket and lay it out against the window. 
 I raided pediatrics. 
 Those kids really know how to live it up down there. 
 What is all that stuff? 
 Finally having that date we planned. 
 Movie under the stars. 
 Forget about him. It doesn't matter. 
 Does matter. 
 All my life, these people, they say "jump," they want you to jump. 
 No questions, no debate, just jump. 
 Be a good boy, work the system, you know, fall in line. 
 It's all bull, Lex. 
 You either suck up and rise the ranks or you fight back, and then they give you the boot. 
 And there ain't no pride in any of that. 
 We just can't win. 
 It's not about winning, Pop. 
 Never was. 
 About the people inside that didn't ask for any of this. 
 You know, you've come all this way without my chip on your shoulder. 
 Must have learned that from your mother. 
 Hey, know what I learned from you? 
 Never stop fighting. 
 You get beat down, you get straight back up. 
 Gonna make a stop. 
 Where? 
 Leo Greene got me into this mess. 
 Makes no sense for him to bail so easy. 
 Something must be up. 
 That's beautiful. 
 Katie (reciting with movie) : Oh, he's okay, Maurice. 
 There's his little foot... 
 Oh, there's the other one. 
 (chuckles) 
 You know all the words, don't you? 
 (chuckles) 
 Quentin and I saw this 42 times by the time he was seven. 
 (clears throat softly) 
 Oh, look. 
 What? 
 A shooting star. 
 Romantic. 
 There's Orion over there under Orion's Belt or whatever total mess you made of it. 
 (scoffs) That's not... that's not Orion's Belt. 
 That's... that's  O'Brien's  Belt. 
 Oh. 
 Orion's lesser known Irish cousin. 
 (both laugh) 
 (coughing) 
 (breathes deeply) 
 You okay? 
 (inhales deeply) 
 It's weird. 
 That medicine. 
 I feel better, but not, you know? 
 Listen. 
 Just in case, there's something I want to say before it gets bad. 
 So you know I mean it. 
 We are gonna have our entire lives to say things to each other, okay? 
 Just listen. 
 I love you. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 I love you, Jake Riley. 
 (crying): Don't say that. 
 (sniffles) 
 You don't get to say that... until I can hold you when you do. 
 (gasps, gags) 
 Katie. 
 (coughs, gags) 
 Katie. 
 (screaming) 
 Katie. 
 (breathes deeply) 
 Katie. 
 What happened? 
 What happened? You just kind of disappeared on me. 
 You all right? 
 Do me a favor and go get Dr. Cannerts. 
 Tell him I'm gonna take him up on those pain meds after all. 
 Okay. 
 And bring me my son. 
 I need to... 
 I think it's time to start saying good-bye. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'll be... Okay, I'll be right back. 
 (panting) 
 Sam :  I'm not going on another wild goose chase. 
 How do you know it's legit? 
 This guy has got the one thing we were severely lacking last time: an actual plan. 
 I think we can finally get out of here. 
 Why aren't you telling the others? 
 Because I don't want to get anyone's hopes up until I... know if this is even a remote possibility. 
 I mean, Teresa and Xander are kids. 
 On a good day, Suzy has about $19 in her bank account. 
 How much money do you have? 
 If I can find a working ATM, enough for half a person. 
 This will cover the other half, plus one more. 
 How? 
 Minute we got locked in here, I started taking money out every day until my account was empty. 
 We have enough for two. 
 And as much as I like to play the hero from time to time, I'm not giving up my spot. 
 You willing to leave the others behind? 
 Leo? 
 (line ringing) 
 (tones beep) 
 Woman (recorded) : We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. 
 They're quite strong. 
 They should ease the pain considerably. 
 (Katie sighs) 
 I still need to talk to Quentin. 
 (groans) 
 I need to be able to think clearly. 
 Start with one. Take it from there. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm so sorry, Katie. 
 No. 
 You don't get to be sorry. 
 You talk about courage and integrity. 
 Well, I'll tell you the same thing I tell my 11-year-old son. 
 Be brave and take responsibility for your mistakes. 
 You don't need me to hold you accountable. 
 Just fix this. 
 You're the only hope people in here have. 
 (door beeps, opens) 
 Jake, can you...? 
 Jake : Yeah. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Hi, sweet boy. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 You still scared? 
 Yeah. 
 You want to know what the scariest moment of my life was? 
 The day you were born. 
 I held you in my arms, and I was so terrified... 
 (laughs) 
 ...I couldn't even move. 
 So you know what I did? 
 I moved anyway. 
 And I kept moving. 
 And the fear eventually went away. 
 Quentin... 
 ...being your mom has been the greatest adventure anyone could ever ask for. 
 And I know you feel like someone blew a hole up in your heart, but you can fill it with memories. 
 Remember me happy. 
 Can you do that? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 I need you to be brave. 
 I need you to move and to keep moving. 
 Can you do that? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 Are you still scared? 
 (crying): Yes, Mom. 
 I'm so scared. 
 I'm not. You know why? 
 Because you have made me so proud. 
 In the deepest part of your heart, I know you're a good man. 
 Like Jake? 
 Yeah. Just like Jake. 
 He's gonna need a friend in here, so be good to him, okay? 
 I love you, Mom. 
 (sighs) 
 I love you, too. 
 Now what do we say when we're home? 
 There are no monsters under the bed. 
 No monsters in your head. 
 Tomorrow brings a new day of light. 
 Sweet dreams, my prince. 
 Good night. 
 It's embarrassing. 
 Embarrassing? 
 We indicted another country for a mistake that we made. 
 It's immoral, it's irresponsible, and worse than that, it's racist. 
 He's got to have other friends who know where he is. 
 I wouldn't be so sure about that. Leo Greene is about as popular as you are. 
 (chuckles) 
 You think someone took him? 
 I don't think he ran. 
 (knocking at door) 
 Hey. 
 I didn't order pizza. 
 Are you Lex Carnahan? 
 Yes, but I did not order... 
 Perfect. 
 We got thick crust, works, prepaid by, uh, Major Mouthpiece. 
 Not sure that's a real name. 
 Thank you. 
 What's going on? 
 Leo Greene is what's going on. 
 (groaning quietly) 
 Hey. 
 (clears throat weakly) 
 I was thinking of going for a run. 
 You want to come? 
 (both laugh) 
 You are so beautiful when you smile. 
 Promise me you'll smile at least once a day for the rest of your life.
