 Previously in Major Crimes... 
 Provenza. 
 Captain Raydor was transferred... from Force Investigation division to Major Crimes, Making her your ranking officer, effective immediately. 
 We're changing the focus of Major Crimes. 
 You're talking about plea bargains. 
 We don't have the legal authority to make deals. 
 Prosecutors do. 
 You want to arrest someone for murder, then turn them over to the courts to decide their fate. 
 I want to walk them directly to their prison cell. 
 This is a chance for us to properly finish what we started, and that is something that I really like. 
 You are a material witness in a murder trial. 
 And until then, we need to find a safe place for you to stay. 
 From what I can tell, Rusty is in good hands here... 
 Nno, you are happy to lock me up until I testify in your stupid murder trial, which is why nobody is bothering to look for my mom. 
 Rusty, we're doing everything we can to find your mother. 
 I've got a want out on her and her boyfriend. 
 We are going to come across them any day.

 [ tires screech ] 
 [i]Look out! 
 [ horns honk ] [ indistinct conversations ] I just want to have a good time, and that's all. [ laughs ] Yeah, right. You just want him to see what he's missing, girl, and you know it. Yeah, that's why she got those five-inch heels. No, it's not, and I don't even care if I ever see ... Watch out! [ woman screams, glass shatters ] [ indistinct conversations ] [ siren wails ] [ woman crying ] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, this bitch is drunk off her ass! Man : Hey, that's my brother! That's my brother on the ground over there! What the hell is wrong with you?! Leave me alone. Woman : Do you even know what you did?! Huh?! Hey! Come on! Get off her! Oh, man! Hey! Hey, someone's over here! Someone's under here! Help me! Pull her out! [ voice breaking ] Oh, my... oh, my god! Somebody ... somebody, please! Do something! [ siren wailing ] That's enough, Buzz. Do something! Turn it off. [ siren wailing ] The name's Vanessa Farrelly, 21, UCLA junior. And, uh...? Oh, including those two, that makes three dead. Nine injured ... four critically ... all on their way to the hospital. What do we know about the driver? Well, I just spoke to the paramedic taking her to St. Stephen's. He said she's pretty banged up ... broken arm, broken nose. The crowd knocked her unconscious, sir. Paramedic say anything about booze on the suspect's breath? No. But he did say she was slurring her words, and she seemed pretty wobbly on the video. Well, that could've been from the impact. Sir, we did have a 911 call placed less than two minutes before the crash. Caller was on Wilshire. Said he was nearly run off the road by the driver of a silver S.U.V... Wilshire's just a few blocks thataway. You know, I talked to S.C.I.D. They've been over the vehicle. Steering's fine. Brakes are fine. No mechanical malfunction. Yeah, and no skid marks, so she never even tried to stop. Did we find any evidence of alcohol or drugs in here? No, but there might be something in the purse down on the floor, but patrol saw it, and it was zipped shut. Well, let's open it and say it spilled during the crash. No, no, no, no, no. Too many victims. We need a truce with Ray... Captain Raydor on this case. Sanchez, you make sure the hospital gets the blood-alcohol content of our suspect. Tao, Sykes, and I will handle the notifications. Flynn, do this one by the book. Whatever's in this purse is not going anywhere, so... you get a warrant before you dump it out. Got it? Got it. You wouldn't believe how many judges are out of town this weekend. Suspect still lights out? - Last I checked, Lieutenant. She's not going anywhere. Is that the warrant? Yeah. What about her blood-alcohol content? Well, the lab's gonna call you with the results as soon as they come in. Let's open it up. [ sighs ] Name's Leslie Nolan. Silver Lake address. She's an organ donor. She's also a Doctor. So let's assume she'll have a lawyer. Oh, I bet she'll have a medical condition, too, with symptoms that fit with her accident. Suspect's a resident in neuropsychiatry. Probably gonna blame the crash on narcolepsy or some other psych B.S. Which won't matter if her blood alcohol is through the roof. But just to be safe, let's see the results of any other tests she's undergone since she arrived. "Oh, hey, Rusty, what are you doing here?" Nothing, just, uh, being dragged out of bed at 6:00 in the morning because I must be supervised 24/7. How about you guys? "Oh, just exhausted from all of the hard work we've been doing on your behalf." Wow. I can't thank you all enough. You guys are [snaps fingers] fantastic. Oh, you're through already? 'Cause that was hilarious. Excuse me, Detective. Your suspect is conscious. Uh, Lieutenant, don't say anything, but Reno P.D. alerted me. They may have already found Rusty's mother. No kidding. Reno P.D. What a surprise. So maybe now you'll get rid of the little psycho, huh? Oh. M-maybe. DCFS and a judge will decide that. But in the meantime, don't say anything to Rusty until we absolutely confirm the woman's identity. If Reno police calls back, ask them to hold for me, please. Detective Sanchez, will you join me with miss, um, with Dr. Nolan? You did get a warrant to search that purse? Come on. You think I'm new at this? Hey, funny guy. You sing and dance, too? [ door closes ] How are you feeling, Doctor? My head... I feel groggy. They probably gave you painkillers. You had a tough night. What ... what happened to me? Why don't you tell us the last thing you remember? I left the restaurant and ... Um... I left the restaurant and then... I don't know. Um... What happened? Around 11:00 last night, you were in a car accident. Oh, my god. Am I in trouble or something? This is just for our notes, Doctor. The police are here to protect you. You say you were at a restaurant. Were you having dinner? Yes. Dinner. What restaurant? Abby's or Aaron's. Something like that near downtown. Um... I paid for the valet and then... You don't remember getting into your car? Driving away? No. Everything goes black after the valet. Oh, god. Well, you're all right now. That's all that's important. Well, instead of thinking about the crash, see if you can remember what you had for dinner last night. What I had for dinner? Why? Small memories can trigger big ones. You remember how your food smelled, or how your drink tasted, and before you know it, ma'am ... Leslie, don't answer any more questions. What? Who are you? What's going on? Tom? Les, this is James Corbett. He's a lawyer friend of mine from the club. A lawyer. Why? What for? What? You didn't tell her what happened? She's not under arrest. Arrest for what? Evereone out! I'll see you out in the hallway in a minute. Tom, arrest for what? I just heard the blood they drew for the B.A.C. is no good. What? - They put it in the wrong vial, if you can believe it. And the crash was seven hours ago. Have them repeat it anyway. I want a tox screen, too. Get someone over to the restaurant where she had dinner. Let's try and find out what else was in her system. Michaels : Morning, Captain. I just spoke to the lab. Shame about the blood test. DDA Michaels, glad you could make it. [ sighs ] Has anyone questioned the suspect? We didn't get very far. Her lawyer kicked us out. Claims she doesn't remember anything. Like I said, neuropsych-whatever. She'd know how to fake amnesia. You're holding my client in your custody, and you didn't even mirandize her? No. No. The hospital is holding her, not us. Your client's free to walk out whenever she'd like. Then why is a patrol officer guarding her room? Well, she killed three people and injured nine others, several of whom are being treated on this floor, sir. Dr. Nolan's already been attacked once. We want her protected. So thoughtful. Mr. Corbett, we have video of your client stumbling out of her car moments after the crash. She was disoriented by the impact. There were no skid marks at the scene. She never even made an effort to stop. So clearly she was disoriented before the impact. Have you got a blood-alcohol content yet? They're working on it. There's no way she was drunk. I was with her. She had one cocktail. Tom, please. The results of the B.A.C. will be negligible. Dr. Nolan suffers from a medical condition, which was responsible for the accident. You don't say. Excuse me. Who are you? Tom Ross. Leslie's my girlfriend. Tom, how would you feel about coming downtown with us, help us fill in the gaps in the story? I'm afraid that won't be happening. It's fine, James. She's got nothing to hide. I want to go. Later this morning, though, okay? Mm. [ chuckles ] [ cellphone rings ] [ door closes ] Oh. Uh, Captain Raydor. What? Are you're sure it's her? Put her on. Hello. Yes. I'm with him right now. One moment. Rusty. Your mother's on the phone. What? Mom? Is it really you? Reno P.D. found Sharon Beck in a rundown motel room off the interstate. Now, she's agreed to come to L.A. and resume her role as Rusty's mother as long as we wire her $500 in cash. [ Tao chuckles ] Hold on. Hold on. I've got s-s-seventy... $73. She can have it all if it means I don't have to babysit him anymore. [ clears throat ] $500 for a bus trip from Reno? It's little steep, is it not? We're paying for her bus fare plus $400 her loser boyfriend, Gary, says she owes him. Hey, look, we don't have a warrant for her arrest, so it's this or nothing. Please. Ohh. I don't give money to my own kids. Cough it up. So, when will she be here? Around 8:00 tonight. A-and why's she taking the bus? I mean, doesn't Reno have an airport? Well, the city has to approve travel like that beforehand, and a one-way, same-day plane fare from Reno is very expensive. So everyone here is putting in to buy a bus ticket. Right. Right. I gue... I guess I just didn't realize it was so complicated. Everyone put money in? That's right. Well, I'll, uh ... we'll be sure to pay everyone back just as soon as we can. Don't worry about it. So, how did your mom sound on the phone? [ chuckles ] Happy. Glad to hear my voice. I-I-I knew Gary had forced her to leave. And, you know, she only went with him because she was afraid that he would, like, go off on me or something. But now ... now she's getting away from him, and it'll be back to being just us. Listen. Um, I want to be perfectly clear with you about something, okay, Rusty? You can spend time with your mother tonight. Lieutenant Flynn has volunteered to take the two of you out to dinner, but I cannot release you into her custody right away. Well, uh, look. She never dumped me anywhere before. Mm-hmm. People ... people have bad days. That may be true. But there are child-endangerment issues... I-I-I just told you that Gary forced her to ... giving custody again will be up to the judge, Rusty. Will ... will I be able to see her at all? You'll have supervised visitation until the judge ... God! I mean, really? More rules? They're not rules. They're laws. [ sighs ] We found your mother, Rusty. Concentrate on the positive. [ sighs ] Okay. Captain... Sharon. [ chuckles ] Thank you. I'm very grateful, and I want to make this up to you. And I will. You don't have to make anything up to me. I was perfectly happy to help you out. Mm. I guess I don't have to worry about filling out these school forms anymore, huh? I guess not. [ knock on door ] Suspect's boyfriend is here, Captain. Okay. Thank you. [ cup clinks ] [ sighs ] All right. Dr. Nolan sent a text last night at 10:32, about a half-hour before the crash. It's to a Ralph Tolson. It says: "Running late. Sorry. I'm on my way." Any information on him in her contacts? Just Tolson's name and phone number. There's a couple texts that go back a couple weeks. Sounds pretty friendly. Uh, talks about getting together for drinks, stuff like that. Sykes : I got the dinner bill the suspect's boyfriend signed for last night. There's no dinner on it, though. All they had were drinks ... six of 'em. Didn't the boyfriend say that she only had one? Yeah, well the bartender said they were ordering two at a time, so that doesn't fly. They closed out the bill at 10:14, almost 50 minutes before she drove into the wall. Yeah, and it's only 15 minutes by car from the restaurant to the crash site. Provenza : So what did she do with that extra half-hour? I-I don't know. The valet was a little backed up. They brought my car around first, so I left. [ scoffs ] Who said chivalry was dead? Dr. Nolan was okay to drive? Absolutely. I told you, she only had one drink. And how many did you have, sir? One or two, I guess. Your bill says six. Maybe I ordered her another one. I [sighs] I don't remember it. A-and these other two, they ... they were for the couple sitting next to us. Oh, I see. Uh, by any chance, do you remember their names? No. We joked a bit, so I bought 'em a round. Amnesia must be going around. I'm telling you, I know how this looks, but Leslie wasn't drunk when I left. And yet she drove her car into a crowd of people. What about drugs? What? What about 'em? Lots of Doctors self-medicate. Maybe Leslie was, uh, using something to help her sleep. No. [ chuckling ] No. No, h-h-her lawyer said she had a T.I.A. It's a ... it's a medical thing. And her lawyer would know this how? Is he an attorney and a Doctor? Has he conducted medical exams? T.I.A. ... It means "transient ischemic attack." Temporary loss of blood flow in part of the brain. I'll check with the hospital. Okay, let's forget about this. Why don't you tell us about Leslie? Uh, how long have you two been together? Six years. We ... we were undergrads at USC. Moved in together after college. You go into medicine, too? [ chuckles ] No. No, I, uh, I play golf. Really? Yeah. Came in second in the NCAA once. Did good in the amateur. Just working as an assistant pro at Westside now until I qualify for the tour. We ... we put a lot on hold, you know, to get Leslie through med school. Man. The two of you left separately last night. Why was that? We got Leslie an apartment closer to the hospital since her residency starts this week ... Just a place she can grab a nap. Or sleep off a bender without him knowing about it. Is that where she was going last night? Uh... Yeah. Why? Do you know who Ralph Tolson is? Tolson? Dr. Tolson? That's ... that's, uh, that's Leslie's new boss. He's ... he's the, uh ... what do you call him...? The attending physician i-i-i-in her department. I'll run a background check on him and have Dr. Tolson pay us a visit. Why? What does he have to do with this? Oh, probably nothing. We found a text that Leslie sent to Dr. Tolson last night, shortly after you left her at the valet stand. What did it say? Tolson : "Running late. Sorry. On my way now." I-I'm not a big texter. It's the first time I'm seeing it. And where was she meeting you, Dr. Tolson? She wasn't meeting me. It was a reception for all the new residents ... A place called Ginger. And do you recall if she ever made it to Ginger? No. But there was a lot of people there. Um, honestly, I don't know her very well. I-I'm not even sure I could pick her out in a crowd. But she has your cell number, sir. All my residents do. Evidently, you don't know how a hospital works. Look, whoever called me down here could've asked me these questions over the phone. Evidently, you don't know how a police department works. Detective? Sir, these are a series of texted conversations between you and Leslie Nolan going back several weeks. Now, it looks like you went a little beyond the usual teacher-student relationship, sir. Uh, she asked me about housing. She wanted a place near the hospital. I helped her find one. That's not really unusual, Detective. Captain, would you like me to explain this part? I handled investigations like this when I ... That's all right. I've got it. Thank you. Okay. Sanchez : So ... um ... Goodbye. Okay. 
 
 Sir, when you helped Dr. Nolan find this apartment, was she with her boyfriend? I, uh... oh, I didn't know Dr. Nolan had a boyfriend. Dr. Tolson, what does the name Katherine Alvarez mean to you? [ chuckles ] What is this? Or Monica Ward? Do you remember her? They have nothing to do with this. They were residents of yours as well, and they both filed sexual-harassment claims against you when they were working... We're done here. If you have any more questions, consult my lawyer. All right, Leslie and Tom closed their bar tab at 10:14 pm. 18 minutes later, the suspect texted Dr. Tolson to say she was on her way. At this point, there's 28 minutes until the crash. She could've driven east to Ginger for a drink with Tolson. Or? Or she left Aaron's, got lost downtown, and drove around until she crashed. I'll find the other residents who were at Ginger, see if Dr. Nolan made it there or not. Uh, pardon me, Lieutenant. But how long will that take? Don't worry, Buzz. I'll be back in time to pick up Rusty's mom. Why don't we try getting the suspect's boyfriend ... that dumb golfer dude ... to admit that she had more than one drink? He is her only alibi. Will he give her up? It won't be pretty. But, yeah, we can manage it. I have the suspect's medical records. She's young, she's healthy, no history of high blood pressure, so the lawyer's claim that she suffered a T.I.A. Is doubtful, Captain. What about a seizure? Well, normally you'd look for a spike in her prolactin levels, and this is terribly interesting ... Tao! No seizure. So no medical condition. Which brings us back to where we started. Yeah, we have a suspect who killed three people while under the influence. And we still have no way to prove it. [ indistinct conversations ] Hey! Hey! Are you drunk or something, lady? Hey! Hey! Hey, this bitch is drunk off her ass! Hey, that's my brother on the ground over there! What the hell is wrong with you?! I know this is difficult for you, Tom. She didn't do anything wrong. But you see our dilemma. We need a reason Leslie ran off the road. And your mention of that T.I.A., well, that just won't do the trick. You paid for six drinks last night. I told you this morning, if I ordered her a second drink, she hardly touched it. And two of those were for the couple sitting next to us. A couple you can't name. So you think I'm lying? No, I think this looks like someone who had three stiff drinks. And that's what that receipt implies. [ door opens, telephone rings ] Lieutenant Flynn still isn't back. He will be. He has a few people to track down. You'll make your mother's bus. I promise. Well, yeah, but, i-if he's late ... I'm calling Lieutenant Flynn right now. You wibe there when your mother arrives. Sanchez : Tom, my friend, your girl was bombed. It's obvious. I've told you over and over now. That didn't happen. Sir. Maybe she really did have more drinks with Tolson. Tolson? What? Why would she ... She didn't mention to you that she might stop by at a reception last night? What reception? At Ginger for the new residents and her new best friend, Dr. Tolson. Oh, I can't believe that she didn't tell you that. Makes me wonder what else you don't know. Look. Let me fill you in. Leslie is sneaking around behind your back with another guy. No, she is not sneaking ... Well, you're going out on a limb for your girlfriend, and she's going out with her new boss. What? Oh, my. What, do you really think that she got that second apartment  so that she would have a place to crash? Your girlfriend is cheating on you, Tom. Why are you protecting her? Are you ... are you sure about this? Oh, we can't show you the evidence, but, yes. We're very sure. [ sighs ] I didn't want to get her in trouble, okay? But she... You know, she took samples sometimes. From the hospital. Sharon : No! You must have the tox screen I ordered by now. No! You cannot call me back! I'm the police! Fine. I'll hold. Sykes : It'd be a hell of a thing if drugs show up in her blood work. I just found out all the new residents had a mandatory drug test on the books for this morning. Brandon Rios, one of the critically injured ... he didn't make it. He passed away about 15 minutes ago, Captain. Tao : Rios was 24, assistant manager at his family's restaurant. He graduated CSUN last year. I ran backgrounds on everyone injured or killed. I just wanted to make sure Dr. Nolan didn't have a reason to bulldoze that crowd on purpose. {*vid.cut*} Lieutenant, anything new from the hospital? No. Just some catchy hold music. Any news? Rusty's mom just called from a pay phone in Bakersfield. She's changing buses on her way to L.A. Hey, uh, how long do we have to wait before meeting this judge? Um, I don't know. A week, maybe. But let's take it one step at a time, okay? Provenza : Captain. Excuse me. Okay, the second blood-alcohol can't tell us anything, but the tox screen says that Dr. Nolan had high levels of Valium and Ambien in her system. How high? More than the blood work shows because these two drugs together create a ... Well, it's a thing called, uh... I've got it here. Uh... Synergistic amplification. By combining the two drugs, you increase the potency of each. Thank you. In english, she was extra high. It's also easy for Doctors to get their own meds. I'll get a warrant, ask the state medical board to let us review all the prescriptions associated with Dr. Nolan's reference number. And, uh, we'll search her apartments. See if the drugs are there. Uh, Captain. Um, y-you know, um, Flynn can pick up Rusty's mother and ... and take them to dinner and get her settled. It's ... it's no big deal. But if ... if you would like to go with Rusty yourself... I would. But I don't think his mother would appreciate my being there, and I want it to be as easy for Rusty as possible. Thank you, though. Tao : Captain, I think we have her. Copies of Leslie Nolan's prescriptions for the last four months ... A total of 127 of them, all phoned in to pharmacies on the Westside and ... This is very telling ... every one of them paid for in cash. Oh, my god. This is the smoking gun. These prescriptions aren't for Leslie. And how do you know the people they are made out to aren't patients of hers? Hospital residents and interns rarely prescribe, and not that much. Provenza : And look at the drugs. Nothing but Ambien, Valium, and Vicodin. But none of that was in her purse, and both the apartments you searched were clean. If she has the stuff, where is it? Why don't we ask her? You'll notice that some of the drugs ... the Valium and Ambien, anyway ... show up in your tox screen from last night. In my tox screen? Wait. This is my blood work? It is. Leslie, I strongly advise you, as your lawyer... Oh, my god. ...not to say another word. Mr. Corbett, if I show a jury the footage of your client stumbling from her car moments after killing now four people, and then I prove to them that she wrote a pile of illegal prescriptions and that she was driving under the influence of those drugs at the time of the accident ... Please, Mr. Corbett. There ... there are so many people dead. So much... Oh, my god. I should tell them what I think happened. Please. Let me explain. Just so you know, I made arrangements for her to stay at a decent hotel. Great. [ sighs ] Uh, wait. The... the hotel. It won't have a minibar, will it? She doesn't like minibars. Right. No minibar. I'll make sure. You know, if you want, we can just skip dinner altogether and drop her right off at the ... No. No, no, no. I ... I just don't want you to judge her. I-I-I don't want her to feel like people are down on her. I need her to see that she made the right choice by coming back, so, if you could just smile, maybe, and um... uh, be happy for her. I mean, I really just need you to say nice things. You bet. No problem. [ bus approaches ] Oh, here we go. [ air brakes hiss ] [ slow music plays ] Hold on. Excuse me. Have you seen this woman? She was supposed to be on your bus. Got off in Bakersfield, I think. Yeah, some guy picked her up. Really? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Rusty? I think I should be in there. There are a lot of things I need to ask her. Man. Well, first, the D.A. and her attorney have to get their questions answered, videotape her statement, and make a deal, sir. A deal? What deal? Is she going to jail? [ sighs ] This is all some kind of mistake. I know it. Look, Mr. Ross, there was one mistake, and it was ours, and I'd like to apologize for it. We were wrong about Dr. Tolson and your girlfriend. There was nothing going on between them. Really? Oh, my god. That is such a huge load off my mind. I mean, I-I didn't believe it, but... thanks. [ door opens ] James, what's going on? D.A.'s offering four counts of manslaughter. Manslaughter?! Mr. Corbett's not permitted to discuss the specifics of the deal. Can Leslie? She could. And if you really care about her, you'll convince her to take our offer, sir. We'll see. Tom! Why are you considering a deal? You didn't do anything wrong! A jury might disagree. Would you excuse us, please? Absolutely. I'm sorry, Doctor. [ cellphone buzzes ] Buzz, did you get the earwig up and running? I did, but talk softly. I don't know if this plan of yours is gonna work. Would you like to suggest an alternative? Are they talking about jail time? 20 years, Tom. 20 years? Based on what? Look at these. They tracked my D.E.A. number and found all these prescriptions associated with it. And if they find even one of these pills in either of our apartments, I could go to jail for the rest of my life. [ sighs ] That's why Corbett wants me to take the deal. And if they don't find the drugs? The charges could get reduced to involuntary manslaughter, and I'd do two years, but it's a huge risk. [ sighs ] [ sniffles ] Tom, I'm so scared. I don't think that I can get through this without you. Are you ... are you really gonna stick with me on this? So, now you're worried about me sticking with you, and last month you were worried I was holding you back. No, no. I was wrong. I was very wrong. Oh, so there was trouble in paradise. Dr. Nolan claims she started a soft breakup two weeks ago with her boyfriend. Hence the new apartment. You were the one person in my life that I could count on. And this whole terrible nightmare has made me realize just how stupid I was to push you away. I love you, Tom. And I need you to be here for me. Don't take the deal, Les. Are you sure? What if they... Listen to me. Don't take it, okay? Okay. I can make sure they don't find those drugs. How? You remember when you stopped getting me all those different drug samples for the problem I was having with my back? Yeah. Well, the pain got so bad that I-I couldn't manage my swing. I took your reference number. I called the prescriptions in myself. But it w-was just so that ... that I could get some sleep,  really, while you were figuring out how much space you needed. Sharon : We need the evidence, Doctor. Okay. [ sniffles ] But, um, if the police find those drugs, they're gonna think that they're mine. I mean, what if they search the apartment ... No. What if ... No. Everything is in my locker at the club. I will go by there the second I leave here and dump them. That's it. You have it. Hold on. She's almost there. Trust me, Leslie. Those drugs will never be found. You know what to say, Leslie. But, Tom. [ sighs ] My blood work shows that those drugs were in my system. And I completely blacked out. [ sighs ] Oh, god. How ... how many drinks did I really have? [ sighs ] One. And that one drink, did you put something in it? Tom, look at me. I love you, but if you were trying to kill me... Trying to kill you?! Are you kidding me? Leslie, I just ... I just wanted you back. That's all. I-I figured that if your residency didn't work out, that i-if you failed your drug test, that you would come back home, and ... Wait. Wait. This was about the drug test? I am so sorry, okay? I never meant for anyone to get hurt. I-I just thought, since the Ambien was time-released... It isn't time-released... that you would be home long before ... if you crush it up! How stupid are you anyway? Hey, hey, shh, shh. My god, you're an idiot! Listen to me. What I did was wrong, okay? But I only wanted you back. I ... okay? [ breathes heavily ] What is it? What's the matter? Hello? Do you have enough? Yes. You're good. We got it. Who are you talking to? You stupid son of a bitch! You're not just pathetic! You're a murderer! I guess someone should break it up. Yes, please. You know what this is? What did you do? I recorded your crazy confession for the police. That's what I did. You lied to me! Aah! [ door opens ] [ grunts ] Ugh! I'm beginning to like Sykes. What is that anyway? You ruin my career and then win me back? How were we gonna support ourselves? What, on your ability as a pro golfer? What kind of fantasy world do you live in? Oh, and these prescriptions? They're all written out to your friends from the club! [ sobs ] What have you done? Four people are dead because of you! You made me kill four people! You made me kill four people... [ cries ] I want a deal. You offered her a deal. Don't I get a deal?! Michaels : Oh, sure. I got a great deal for you. Northern California. Nice, state-run facility. You can work on your swing for the rest of your life. All right, get him out of here. [ Leslie sobs ] You're all right. You're all right now. [ cellphone buzzes ] Lieutenant Flynn, I am so sorry I was unable to take your call earlier. We're in ... What? What do you mean Rusty ran off? Ran off where? Look at those all drugs. Tom had a pharmacy lookin his locker. Still doesn't prove pre-meditation. Best we could do is get him to agree to four counts of murder two. Tao : On the bright side, we got the hospital to save Dr. Nolan's spot in the residency pool. Poor kid. Starting out her career as a Doctor and kills four people. That can't be good. Yeah, how could tom say he loved her while trying to ruin her life? Oh, now, now. So cynical, Amy. Weren't you ever stupid in love? Not since my 19th birthday. What happened on your 19th birthday? You'll never know. Lieutenant, anything? Yeah, we have multiple units searching the streets around the bus station. Sheriff department in West Hollywood's got his picture. And everyone we can spare is out looking for him. Okay. Okay. Captain, look, I'm sorry. I turned my back for one second, and he was gone. I ... If I thought for one minute that he would run away ... Lieutenant, it's not your fault. We'll keep looking. Good night, everyone. Great work, all around. [ voice breaking ] Everyone, really great work. Captain. I, uh ... Flynn and I will stay here tonight till the kid turns up. And he will. He'll turn up. [ keys clatter ] [ sighs ] You're home late. I was wrapping up a case. Rusty, I'm sorry about your ... Don't ... don't talk about it. She lied to me. I believed her. And that'll never happen again. I don't honestly think that ... I-I really don't wanna talk about it. Please. Okay. But I have one question to ask you, and I need you to answer truthfully. Why did you run away from Lieutenant Flynn? I don't cry in front of people. And I started to cry. So I left. Mm. How much money exactly did she steal from everyone? Don't worry about it. We can, um ... we have it covered by, uh, our bosses. [ slow music plays ] What's that? Oh. I was behind on filling out these forms for school, and y-you said you needed them tomorrow. You still want them? Yes, I do. [ sighs ] Okay. Rusty. Your mother is the one who's losing out here. Nothing she's done has a thing to do with you. I hope you know that. I thought she loved me. And letting go of that is what's hard. But holding on to someone when they're gone is even harder. Thanks for trying to bring her back. [ door closes ] [ chuckles ] Lieutenant Provenza, thank you for picking up so quickly. Um [clears throat] you can tell the department to stand down. When I came in the door, Rusty was here, so... Yes. So, I guess he ... uh, Rusty is home. Thank you.
