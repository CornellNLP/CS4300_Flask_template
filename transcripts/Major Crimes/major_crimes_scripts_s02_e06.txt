 Boys Will Be Boys 
Original Air Date July 15, 2013 
 [ Echoing distorted voices ] 
 Dispatcher : 911. What's your emergency? 
 John :  My... my daughter is... [ Clears throat  ] 
 My daughter hasn't come home. 
 I-it's not like her to stay out this late. 
 How old is your daughter? 
 She's 13. She's only 13. 
 And when was she last seen? What time did this call come in? Last night... two minutes after midnight. She called my wife, her mom, to get a ride home, and then she wasn't there. And we responded immediately. We've called her friends. We've looked everywhere for her. Where was your daughter last seen? John : Well, she called from the mall, wanting a ride home, but when my wife went to pick her up, she wasn't there. Sykes : And where's your wife now? Mom's out driving around, looking for Michelle. John :  And... and she was... She had a bully. This kid at the mall... He bullied her last weekend. Dispatcher :  She was bullied? Yes! This kid and his friends... They followed her into the bathroom last week, and they assaulted her. You told the 911 operator that your daughter was bullied? Yeah, last weekend at the, um, at the same mall. This bully... he got a group of boys together, trapped her in the bathroom [sighs] Pulled down her pants, and took pictures. We don't call that bullying, Mr. Brand. We call that sexual battery of a minor. Flynn : Why didn't you report that? Because Michelle begged us not to. She... she didn't want to draw any more attention to herself. She already feels ostracized enough as it is. And why is that? Dispatcher :  Does she have any defining tattoos or birthmarks? John :  No, no, no, no. She's a tomboy. Just tell the police to look for a tomboy in a white skirt and pink top, I think. Is Michelle... a boy? She used to be Michael. Now she's Michelle. How long ago did this transition begin? Well, she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder in the first grade. Sykes : Other than last week at the mall, has anyone else attacked Michelle or taken pictures of her? No, she was teased a lot, but that was the first time that anybody ever hurt her. Any chance she ran away? John : No. No, no, no. Flynn : Was your daughter depressed? Did she ever talk about hurting herself? No, look, I already told you that I was worried that damn boy at the mall might have attacked her. I mean, that's why she called home for a ride, because she saw him again, and she got scared. I mean, maybe she's running away from him. Dispatcher :  Can you describe this young man? John : [  Scoffs  ]  Look, I wish I could, but I've never seen him. Okay, what's his name? John : Uh, he doesn't go to her school. I don't know. I can get his screen name. Those pictures from the mall bathroom... He posted them. Why didn't you tell me that? Michelle didn't want you to know. I'm so sorry. I would have told you, but she was so embarrassed. Oh, my God, you did it? You called the police? John : What did you expect me to do? John, you're overreacting. She's been missing since 7:00. She's probably at a friend's house. No, I already called all of her friends. Look, I can't just sit here. Shh. Excuse me. Is this Michelle's computer? May we take a look at it? Yes, of course. Tao : Finally. "Mr. T... the Tranny Hunter... "Has sent your male junk to every e-mail, Facebook, and web link you have." Matt: Can you click on "junk"? Ugh. Oh, my God. Freaking tranny, huh? Oh, look at this. What are you doing in the girls' bathroom, kiddo? What are you doing here? You think you're a girl, huh? Girls don't have this, do they? Ohh, girls don't have that, huh? [  Laughter  ] Who's seen this? How many people has he sent this to? These pictures have probably gone viral. You see, this is exactly why she wanted to change schools. What are we supposed to do... Sell our house, uproot our family in the middle of Matt's senior year of high school? That's insane. No, the harassment of our daughter is what's insane. Anne : Oh, my God. We have turned our lives upside down to accommodate that child. What else do you want from us? John : Look, what do you expect her to do... go back to school after that's all over the Internet? [ Door slams ] Is there any way you can take those pictures of the kid offline? I'm working on it, Andy, but our bully is hiding behind a moderately sophisticated proxy server, and I need him to log on so I can trace his I.P. Provenza : Well, there's a large, wooded park between the house and the mall. Sharon : If our missing child walked home or tried to get away from somebody, it'd be a likely place to hide. Well, I need evidence dogs to search the park... as many as I can get. One second, lieutenant. Don't hang up. How long since the child was last seen? 15 hours... since 7:00 last night. Okay, let's call it a critical missing. Give Provenza all the resources he needs. Thank you, Chief. Just find her... or him... Or whoever he is. I want a 40-block grid search. Half your guys start at the mall where she was last seen. The other half start right here. Am I supposed to tell them to look for a boy or a girl? Birth certificate says male. Well, a lot's changed since then. Just find the kid alive, okay? John : You know, when, um, when Michelle was still in diapers, and I kid you not, she used to correct us if we called her a boy. He'd say, "God made a mistake. He gave me the wrong body, mommy." John : We fought it for years. I mean, you know, took away toys that were feminine, dressed her like a boy. Nothing worked. Excuse me, folks. Um, we need some unwashed items from Michelle's laundry basket... Something the dogs can get a scent from. [ Computer beeps ] He's logged on. I have him. I have our bully. Lewis Gates. Woman : Coming! Hello, Mrs. Gates. Can I help you? Is Lewis here? L.A.P.D.! Stop! L.A.P.D.! Stop! [ Tires squeal ] [ Horn honks ] Woman : Hey, watch it! [ Tires squealing, sirens wail ] [ Grunts ] [ Dogs barking ] [ Police radio chatter ] Go that way. [ Dogs snorting ] [ Barking ] Flynn : Looks like a girl's scrunchie. I'll get the Command Center up here. Call the captain. [ Police radio chatter ] Well, I don't know if it's good news or bad, but I'm pretty sure it belongs to Michelle. Oh, God. Well, I may have the guy who can tell us how it fell off. [ Camera shutter clicking ] How'd you scratch yourself, Lewis? It must have happened when you beat me. Any luck? Buzz : Well, if you call the mall having 500 security cameras lucky. I downloaded a new facial-recognition program. Good. I'll need it. Rusty : Hey, Buzz. Lieutenant, you remember Kris, don't you? Buzz. Lieutenant. Hi, there. Work, work, work. Hey. What are you looking at, faggot? I'm sorry. I thought you were in the doorway. I'll get back to you, lieutenant. Um, let's just... let's just go study. Tao : I uploaded a photo of our bully, and now this new facial-recognition software will scan all the security-camera footage for a match. Lewis :  I don't know what you're talking about, lady. I wasn't anywhere near that ugly mall. Were you at the park last night? What park? The park between the mall and Michelle's house. Michelle? Oh. You mean Mikey... the tranny? No. I like to stay as far away from that freak as I can. [ Barking ] Really? Is that why you attacked her last week in the bathroom, pulled her pants down,  took photographs? And posted them all over the Internet? Look, it was using the girls' toilet, man. Guys aren't allowed in there. That's sick, and everybody thinks so. I'm just the only person that had enough balls to do something about it. You call Michelle "it"? It isn't a girl... [ Barking ] And, uh, it says it's not a guy, so it isn't anything, and it needed a lesson. You call it a lesson? We call it sexual battery. How old are you? 15. How old are you? Old enough to recommend you get tried as an adult. You could be going away for a very long time. It was a joke! - It wasn't funny! This happened over a week ago, man. Why are you guys hassling me about it now? Because Michelle is missing. [ Dog growling ] We got something! Lieutenant, over here! Right here! [ Barking ] Freak probably ran away. Look, I have ran off plenty of times,  and you guys have never come looking for me. Do you think they'll treat you like a boy or a girl in jail? I'm not going to jail. And do you want to know why? Because Mikey got what  it  deserved. There Lewis is... 7:09 P.M. Buzz : And look who's right in front of him. Captain, we have Lewis on camera at the mall last night within 15 feet of Michelle. Okay, Lewis, you lied about not being at the mall. You lied about not seeing Michelle. What else are you lying about? [ Dog growling ] [ Sighs ] Sharon has to work late, so after tense negotiations, she has agreed that I should drop Kris off at her house and get you some dinner. But no burgers. Fine. Pizza, then. Oh, uh, did you guys find that trans kid yet, or...? Her body. Yeah. Oh. Wow. How old was she? 13. Oh, my God. So, it's a hate crime? Every murder is a hate crime. You know, the last guy I dated ended up being gay. Really? He wasn't, like, a cross-dresser or anything. He just liked other boys. Yeah, I think that's how it works. Have you talked to the victim's parents yet? No, but they're on their way in, so... Even tougher than working Internal Affairs, huh? Mm. Come on, kids. Let's go. Let's get while the getting's good. I'll save you a slice of something. Be careful on the way home. Deanna, take a mold of this impression from the shovel, please? Uh-huh. [ Police radio chatter ] Patrick, take pictures of all of this. [ Camera shutter clicking ] It bothers me a lot. How so, lieutenant? Look at the way the body's arranged. Her eyes have been closed, and she's turned a little bit on her side. Is that a tissue in her mouth? Yeah. It's like whoever put her in the grave didn't want the kid to breathe in any dirt. You mean she was buried alive? That's unlikely. The whole side of her skull is crushed in. Provenza : Kendall, uh, any chance that the child was killed somewhere else and then moved? No. This was the place. Blood here. Blood there. A little bit of bone in the grave. Okay, maybe our bully secretly had the hots for her. Maybe that's why he pulled off her clothes last week and took pictures. Maybe it wasn't him. Maybe it was a family member who did this. Considering how she was laid to rest, let's search the Brands' house while they're with the captain. Family first, as I always say. Family first. John : Is there, uh, any news yet? Any news at all? I'll let you know the minute we confirm something. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Uh, right this way. Okay, so, Michelle called the house a few minutes after 7:00 last night, wanting a ride home from the mall. What happened next? First I chewed her out because she wasn't supposed to be at the mall, and then I put the dinner in the oven, and I got in the car to go get her. You were home, too? I was watching the Dodgers game. I should have gone to the mall with mom, but... When I got to the mall, Michelle didn't come out. I-I waited. I tried her cell. I-I figured that she caught a ride with somebody. I wish I had gone in to look for her. I should have gone in the mall. And you, Mr. Brand? Just stuck on the 101 Freeway. And what time did you get home? Um, 8:30 or 9:00. I don't know. You know, by then I'd already talked to Annie, and she told me Michelle was missing. We all just started to panic. Oh, my God, that's him! Matt. Wait, Matt! That asshole killed my sister! Hey, asshole, what'd you do to my sister, huh? Anne : Matthew! Son of a bitch! John : Matt! Matthew! Matthew! Get up here! Lewis : Get off me! Sykes : Stop! John : Matthew! Go! Go! Go! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? Let's go. [ Police radio chatter ] The victim's cellphone run out of juice? Battery's missing. [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Cellphone vibrates ] Sykes. Provenza : Yes, I want you to go to the victim's house. Bring a few boxes. Go through their bedrooms, gather all their shoes, and, Sykes? Yes, sir? I want you to bag them and tag them separately. Dr. Morales : There were no signs of sexual abuse. Thank God. Is it possible that he was under a lot of... She. Let's stick with "she." It helps me to identify with the victim, okay? Okay. It sounds like this child was in an extremely stressful situation. Is it possible that she committed suicide? And then buried herself? Lawyers. I'm writing down homicide, Rios. The murder weapon appears to be something like a heavy length of pipe, only tapered at the end. See how the wounds go from narrow to wider? You're describing a bat. Oh, God. An aluminum bat... could be. She's running. She looks back. The bat swings to the side of the head. She falls to her knees. The bat swings again. And one last time... just to make certain. Poor kid. This kind of thing... I can't get used to it. Let's hope we never do. Captain, do you have a suspect in custody? Yes, but I have issues with charging him. You have to, or you have to let him go. He's a juvenile. We can't keep him more than eight hours. I'd like to hold him a little longer than that, Emma. How much longer? Two or three years. Lewis has confessed to sexual battery. And distributing lewd pictures of a minor. But his behavior and his personality are inconsistent with our victim's burial. If you look at the crime scene where we found Michelle... Somebody who cared about her did this. [ Inhales deeply ] So, the brother or the father? Excuse me, captain. I just wanted to report that I bagged and tagged all the shoes in the victim's house and took them to the lab to be processed. Thank you, detective. Thank you. Buzz, wire up Detective Sykes and myself with video cameras, please. I want to document this family's reaction when we give them the death notification. Sykes : I'm afraid we have bad news. [ Sighs ] Oh, God. Oh, no. Sharon : We found Michelle's body less than a mile from your house. Anne : Oh, my God. This is not happening. You mean [Clears throat] you mean she's dead? Yes. I'm so sorry. We've confirmed it's her, but while we're still trying to make our case against the murderer, Was it that monster? Was it... was it Lewis? We are holding him, but we can't say more than that. [ Clears throat ] [ Sniffles ] I, uh... I want to see her body. Is that possible? John, please. I want to see her, okay? Look, I-I have to see her. Him  you want to see him. No, her. I said "her," and I meant "her"! For God's sake, John, I told you that this would happen, and you wouldn't listen to me. Are you happy now? Are you happy that you bought him those dresses, that you gave him makeup, that you let him grow his hair out? Mom. And they're off. I'm not having this argument again. You let him pretend himself to death, and no one could talk you out of it! Would you stop blaming me?! Oh, somebody's got a temper. I didn't... I didn't make her what she was. Sorry to interrupt, but to get out of your way and finish up our investigation against Lewis, we need to hear your timeline again. Our times for what? You already know who did this. Could you just listen to someone else for a minute? Are you never tired of getting it wrong? What... what did I get wrong? If you'd only stood up to him. Oh. If you hadn't encouraged him... I tried to accept her, which is more than you ever did! [ Voice breaking ] Look, what are you guys doing? Look, Michelle is dead, so can you please stop pretending that all of your arguments are about her? You hate each other. God! What's the dad's alibi? Stuck in traffic. Let's see what's going on in his finances. [ Sighs ] Even now, you're... you're still calling her a boy. If you had only backed me up. Sharon : Excuse us, please. We'll leave you two to talk this through. We're very sorry for your loss. Captain? Wait. I have a right to see my daughter's body. [ Sighing ] Oh. Mr. Brand, I don't think you understand. Your daughter is at the morgue, and that is not a place that you want to be right now. I promise you. I have the right to see her body as a parent, don't I? I want to see my daughter's body. Again? I want to see my daughter's body! 
 
 I think that transgender kid was brave as hell. It took a lot of guts to live in the open like that, and her father deserves credit for having supported her. Her father gave her dresses. He might as well have put a target on the back that said, "beat me." She asked for those dresses, and I still say brave kid. Besides, it could be just as dangerous pretending to be somebody you're not. A lot of kids that repress that kind of feeling end up killing themselves. You can't hide who you are, as I'm sure you know. Sure I know what? Well, as you know from... from... [ Sighs ] from being a foster child. Am I right, or am I right? Sharon, could that young lady have hidden her identity? From what I read, gender identity dysphoria in children is not a choice. Hmm. Pancakes? Oh, um, yes, thank you. She only wants one. Who eats only one pancake? Uh, your wife. [ Cellphone chimes ] Uh-oh. Incoming. It's just Kris. We're reading "Romeo and Juliet" right now. We both missed it in 9th grade, and I-I think it's making her emotional. So, are you two dating now? Rusty : No, no. We're just hanging out. I mean, I like her a lot, but it's... it's hard to date when I have to take a police escort everywhere I go. [ Chuckles ] Excuse me. You know what? I'm gonna need to move, so... Uh, oh, you've got it. Okay, thanks. Mm-hmm. I thought you told me he'd been hustling men on the street. Is he not gay? He hasn't told me anything about that, and I am not asking. Maybe he's confused. I could help him sort out his priorities. Listen, I only told you about the  abuse  that he went through so that  you  could be sensitive to his issues, not so that you could push him in one direction or the other. I never push people. You spent virtually no time with our children when they were Rusty's age. Why are you so interested in him? Look, I am brutally aware that I am not a good parent, Sharon, but it's not necessary to remind me every five minutes. Oh, it is. Well, maybe I'm interested in the kid because you are. I wish that you would develop the same interest in finding yourself an apartment. There was no wreck on the 101, captain, but even if there had been, I checked with Mr. Brand's office, and he took the whole afternoon off. So, why'd he lie? Well, maybe he spent the day getting ready to kill his daughter. Murders take planning. [ Door buzzes ] He seems to love her. Maybe too much. Oh, God. Let's not go there. I traced a credit check from a landlord in Santa Monica to Mr. Brand. He signed the lease for a one-bedroom apartment the day of the murder. What else is he covering up? He moved money out of his bank account... $80,000. And he ordered furniture for the new place online. I need some way to ask Mr. Brand about these things, but first I'm gonna shake him up. How? By giving him what he asked for. Flynn : You sure you want to do this, sir? 'Cause who you see in there is not gonna be your daughter, and that image is gonna be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. Have you ever lost a child? [ Sighs ] Not exactly. Well, then you probably wouldn't understand. [ Sighs ] [ Breathes deeply ] What happened? Her head was crushed in with a baseball bat. [ Sobbing ] [ Crying ] My baby. Does he look like he's bluffing to you? No, he looks guilty. A lot of murderers fall apart when they see their victims. John : What in God's name are you implying? You think renting that apartment means... means what? That I was having an affair. Is that it? We don't know what to think. Maybe you can tell us who the apartment was for. [ Sighs ] It was for me and Michelle. Flynn : You two were planning on moving in together across town, away from your wife? I was renting the apartment to establish residency so Michelle could go to high school in Santa Monica. After that Lewis kid attacked her at the mall, she begged me to let her start over someplace where nobody knew her. Did your wife know about this? I signed the lease the day that Michelle was... I planned on... on... telling my wife, but then I... [ Sighs ] Oh, God, time has come to a complete stop. Do you know that? No, you don't know that, 'cause you're all running around, doing this and doing that, but for me, the world has completely stopped spinning, and I'm just... stuck in this one horrible moment, this one terrible mistake. [ Sighs ] What were you asking about? My apartment. That's right. [ Sniffles ] I didn't tell my wife because she already thought Michelle was spoiled. I was just thinking about how to say it. What about the money? What money? Oh, I gave, uh... Gave them the security deposit and the first month's rent. You also cashed in your joint-retirement account. You took $80,000 out of the bank. That was for Michelle. For Michelle? Were you planning on telling your wife about that? Not right away, because she was very much against what we were gonna do with the money. What were you going to do? Hormone-replacement therapy is very expensive... I mean, very, very, very, very expensive. And it's not just that insurance doesn't cover it. It's the whole idea of shooting a Tsunami of hormones... Hormones from the opposite s*x... Into my son's beautiful body before he started puberty. Would you do that? How much money was this going to take? Michael would have developed breasts and hips, and it's permanent. That's a huge decision for a 13-year-old. How much? $75,000. Now, I know that Michael wanted to transition, but that's a lot of money for an otherwise healthy child, and who knows what the long-term effects would be? I didn't want him to do it. I just wanted him to wait until he turned 21 and his judgment was better. Does that make me a bad mother? No. But to me, this shovel brings your parenting skills into serious question. That's not mine. Strange... we found it in the trunk of your car. Your fingerprints are all over the handle. That's because I borrowed it from the office. I'm a realtor. I used it to plant a "for sale" sign the other day. Where? New listing, not far from our house. Why is that important? 'Cause the dirt on the blade of this shovel matches the dirt in your daughter's grave. And the dirt on these shoes of yours... It also matches the dirt from your daughter's grave. That's probably because the house that I told you about... It backs right up to the park. And I'm not a geologist or whatever, but I bet that's why the dirt is the same. You know, that's a really good explanation, Mrs. Brand. Now, could you also explain how you know that your daughter was buried in the park? Because we never told you that. You... you said, uh... you... Mrs. Brand, we have arrived at that point in our relationship that the lying has to end. I am a good mother. I'm a good mother. [ Voice breaking ] I'm a good mother. And I want a lawyer. You'll need one. Because as of this moment, you are under arrest for murder in the first degree. SID says the girls phone was wiped clean. How Clean? Let's put it this way... the texts are gone forever, and they might have been useful. You'd like "Shakespeare In Love." I cannot believe you haven't seen it yet. It's such a good movie. It's basically "Romeo and Juliet" crossed with "Twelfth Night." Rusty : Okay, so, explain to me how two boring plays make one good movie. Shut up. It's playing at that place you like... Hollywood Forever. Oh, you mean "The Graveyard"? Yeah. Rusty says they take these movies and project them onto this big wall... Kind of like a drive-in movie theater, only without the cars. Everyone brings blankets and lawn chairs. And pot. And beer. Actually, it's more of a wine crowd. And not everyone partakes. I don't. Ah, quoth the girl in the cop shop. Hi, Rusty. Rusty : Hey, Emma. Have... Have you met my, um... Kris? Kris, this is the always-creepy Emma Rios. Creepy Emma, Kris. Hi. She's the prosecutor in that murder trial I'm supposed to testify in... the one who's basically wrecking my life. You were doing a good job of that before I ever showed up. Rusty. Jack. Emma, I believe the captain is expecting us. And that lady's the reason why I can't go with you to see "Shakespeare In Love," unless you want to hang with the really popular kid who brings a police escort to the movies. I'm sure the potheads would love that. All right. Time to study. This way. And it doesn't help anything to call Emma "creepy." Aw, poor little Kris. "Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind, and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind." Sir? You're weird. I am, indeed, detective, and thus, I take my leave of you. Emma : There's nothing unique about that shovel. Provenza : I'll tell you what's unique about it... Her prints are all over it. You can buy a shovel like that at any hardware store... Is that unique enough? That's what her lawyer will say. Well, what will her lawyer say about the dirt from the grave that's on the shovel, on her shoes? He'll say what you already know... That you can't prove when the dirt got there, and he'll go out and prove that the dirt does not have the unique qualities we need, and it won't. Couldn't you have waited a little longer until she... No. We pushed her to lawyer up. Now, here we are. Let's review. Right. Her daughter's body was buried in the same position that the kid probably slept in. No, no, don't you dare turn away. Now, you want this case, you grow up, and you look at these pictures side by side. You know they'll put the victim on trial... The girl in the boy's body, the gender bender, the misfit... how much trouble she was to her mom. Where's Hobbs? Captain, for the love of God, call Hobbs. It only takes one vote, one juror, to ruin the entire case. I'd like a prosecutor who isn't afraid of losing in a good cause. Emma... Emma, y-you think I understand boys who think they're girls? I'm just as much at sea as your jurors will be, but I know when a kid has had his head bashed in. Now, capt... captain, are... Are you even listening to me? Mm. What are you looking at? Phone records. Phone records? What about phone records? Kids don't call. They text. The only person that Rusty calls on his cellphone is me. Kris, he texts. And? I promise you, Mr. Brand, we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that your wife buried your daughter. I don't believe it. My wife could never, ever murder her own child. It's impossible. Yeah, mom didn't kill Michelle. We all loved Michelle. Is that why you keep calling her cellphone, Matt, even though you know she's dead? Provenza : But you didn't call her... not a single time... the entire month before she died. You texted each other a lot, but you never called. Until night before last, when you dialed your sister's number over 100 times in a row, before you supposedly knew she was missing. Why? I think I know why. Your mother was in the park, looking for Michelle's body, hunting for where you left it, by following the ringtone. Is that how it happened? What are you saying? Mr. Brand. [ Dial tone, dialing ] And yesterday and today, you've gone on calling because you miss the sound of her voice. Is that it? Michelle :  Hey, everybody, if you're talking to this phone, you must be somebody I love. If you love me back, leave me a lovely message. Bye. [ Beep [ Inhales deeply ] Matt, you want to tell us what happened now, or do you want your mother to sit in jail for the rest of her life? What reason would my wife have for killing our daughter? [ Voice breaking ] Maybe because you and Michelle were leaving us. Maybe because mom didn't want you to move out. No, no. Your mother didn't even know about that. Oh, my God. Matthew? Sharon : Michelle called the house. Your mom was making dinner, and you got into the car, and  you  went to the mall to pick her up. What have you done? Yeah, I picked her up. Dad and I are moving to Santa Monica. Matt : She told me all about your little apartment in Santa Monica. It's true. We're moving, and I'm gonna start at Santa Monica high school. The kids there are so cool. She was all happy. She was excited about tearing our family apart. Dad's moving out? Are they getting a divorce? That's why she wanted to go to the mall. She wanted to say goodbye to her friends. I don't know. I mean, who cares if they get a divorce? She said, "I don't care if they get a divorce." We weren't divorcing. She was just changing schools! She was destroying everything! I'm supposed to lose my family because she wants hormone shots? Matt. Everything... everything has always, always, always been about her. It's been like living in an insane asylum from the moment she was born. So you put a stop to it. I mean, if you had seen the expression on her face when she told me that you two were leaving. God, why is everything always about you? Why can't you be happy for me? She thought I'd be happy for her. That's how crazy selfish she was. All those years explaining her, protecting her, and I'd had it. Just let me out. I pulled the car over, and she got out... And ran toward the park. I chased her. With a bat? With a bat. I hit her with it. And then after you killed her? I wasn't trying to do that. Oh, yes, you were. You hit her in the head three times. You  did  mean it. And then you went home and you told your mom. Sykes : And she went out and buried Michelle. And took the battery from her phone. Hoping we wouldn't find her... hoping to protect you. Well, maybe... maybe... maybe she thought that we could just go back to being a regular family again. [ Sighs ] [ Voice breaking ] You chased your little sister down, and you beat her to death with a bat? Yeah, I chased her. And you know what, dad? What? She didn't run like a girl. Okay, Matt. We've already arrested your mother, and to let her go... and so she can't continue to act as if she's the one who did this... I need you to tell me... where'd you put the bat? Just one more thing to do. I didn't murder her. [ Sighs ] No. You murdered her family. You made it your mission to make this kid feel like a monster, but you're the monster. And do you know what we do to monsters, Lewis? Kill them with a pitchfork? That would be great, but as it is, we can only lock them up in jail, which is where you're going till you turn 18. What the hell are you talking about? I didn't do anything to this freak. Not true. These pictures prove that you committed sexual battery, which is good enough to put you away in juvie. What? You can't. You can't... you can't do that. I can. And, hey, have a miserable life. Michelle :  Hey, everybody, if you're talking to this phone, you must be somebody I love. If you love me back, leave me a lovely message. Bye. [  Beep ] [ Sniffles ] [ Chuckling ] Oh, oh, oh. I just had another flash of what I modestly call "genius." He has. What better, what safer, what more trustworthy cop to accompany our young students of "Romeo and Juliet" to the movies than you? Tonight? Mm-hmm. They're showing "Shakespeare In Love" at Hollywood Forever. Blankets, picnic, mistaken identities, romance, role reversals, outrageous fortune. The kids really want to go, but they can't without you. What say you, madam? Kris? My parents are okay as long as I'm home by 11:00. Easy-peasy. I can transport our young Juliet home, and you can return Romeo here to his own balcony. It sounds like a lot of fun. Doesn't it? Okay. Everyone wants to go. Let's go. All right, whoa! Tallyho. Let's go. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] Hey, it's just like old times, eh? Yeah, really, really old times. Elizabethan, I think. Tell me something... was this your idea or Rusty's? Oh, we're in it together, and at our core, we're really all alike. Right? We should hurry. The Cemetery fills up early.
