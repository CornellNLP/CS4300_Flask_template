 ANDREW: So there I am sitting in the VIP area...     
 LIZZIE: Wait, where is this? Hey, do you want some coffee?     
 Oh, no, I'll get it. So, sitting in the VIP area at a private members only club...     
 Cigars, velvet upholstery...     
 Very strict policy on not approaching celebrities, which I would never do, by the way. Ugh.     
 So tacky.     
 So I'm talking with my friend and then this... agreeable looking man comes up to me and he introduces himself as Versace.     
 Yes. I say to him,     
 "Honey, if you're Versace, I'm Coco Chanel."     
 - No, you didn't. 
- I said that.     
 It's so embarrassing. And I had to make it up to him later, when he actually did establish himself as... you know, Versace.     
 I'm not really a fan of his clothes, per se, it's just so... bright.     
 It's too much,     
 - but they say... 
- (MOUTHS)     
 ...that Armani designs clothes for wives.     
 I think that Versace designs clothes for sluts, and don't you look at me like that.     
 Please, I know the score.     
 There's a lecherous fag on the prowl.     
 - I didn't know he was gay. 
- Hey, faggot is not a nice word.     
 ANDREW: Not nice when it's said by the wrong person.     
 But what are we supposed to call them?     
 Homosexuals? Hmm? Sounds so... scientific.     
 Anyway, I don't have a problem with it; it doesn't bother me.     
 At all. Which is why I agreed.     
 Wait, you agreed to what?     
 Oh, didn't I say?     
 He invited me to the opera.     
 He's designing the costumes for Capriccio.     
 It's a minor work, but even so.     
 I guess even in minor works, one must wear clothes.     
 (MOUTHS) And you said yes?     
 My dear, sweet Lizzie.     
 Versace has invited me to the opera.     
 Of course I said yes.     
 ANDREW: So I said,     
 "Lizzie, I'm not crazy about Versace, but I certainly wouldn't mind going to the opera."     
 - Is it real? 
- What?     
 Versace.     
 What do you mean?     
 The other day I heard you say you were half Jewish.     
 Well... that's complicated.     
 No, it isn't. You're not Jewish, you're Catholic, same as me.

 I thought you'd be happy about it.     
 - About what? 
- About Versace.     
 That you'd brag about a date with Versace?     
 - It's not a brag. 
- You can't even tell people you're gay.     
 I tell people all the time. 
 I've told people for years. I...     
 You tell gay people you're gay and straight people you're straight.

 To adjust a dress, the most important thing is that I look at your face.     
 It's that I see your face.     
 I learned that from my mother.     
 She was a dressmaker.     
 She had a little store in Calabria.     
 My mother, she would stand with her clients...     
 Who she considered her friends...     
 In front of the mirror and study their expressions.     
 Not the fabric, not the dress.     
 Their faces and only when they were happy, only when they smile, when they relax, her work was complete.

 (GLASSES CLINK)     
 What do you do for work?     
 This and that. And for my first job,     
 I worked for my father on his pineapple plantations in the Philippines... Can you imagine that?     
 Picking them in the midday sun. You should've seen me.     
 My father was a-a military man.     
 He was a pilot for Imelda Marcos,     
 - The First Lady of the Philippines. 
- Really?     
 Yes. He flew one of those old planes, the, um, the type that Buddy Holly died in.     
 Beechcraft Bonanza, they're called, if you know them.     
 He would fly them low to the ground because Imelda was terrified of crashing, and that is a true story.     
 My father would tell her, "Imelda, when you're flying a plane" at     miles per hour in a rickety tin can,     
 "it doesn't, it doesn't matter how high you are."     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 And then you moved to America.     
 My father wanted me to have the very best education.     
 Which, of course, I had.     
 He's retired from the military now.     
 He runs all of his businesses from abroad, 'cause he can.     
 Who knew that there was so much money to be made in pineapples?     
 He was here the other day, he was just in town.     
 He was driving around in his Rolls-Royce with his boyfriend as a chauffeur.     
 Boyfriend?     
 - Please, don't ask. 
- Your father has a boyfriend?     
 He left my mom and ran off with one of the young men who worked on the plantations.     
 It was cute, I guess.     
 It's all so crazy.     
 I'm writing a novel about it.     
 - You are? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 I wish I had the patience to write a novel.     
 But my mind is always moving, you know?     
 I think you need great stillness to write a novel.     
 And I'm never still.     
 Maybe you just need a crazy family.     
 For me, family's everything.     
 - Everything. 
- Hmm.     
 The first dress I ever made was for my sister Donatella.     
 Maybe every dress I make is for her.     
 That makes me want to cry.     
 Makes me smile.     
 Uh, yes, well, that, too. Yeah, of course.     
 The Medusa logo, from my company...     
 You know it?     
 So sophisticated.     
 As children, we used to play in ancient ruins close to our home in Calabria.     
 And one day, I saw the Medusa's head with the...hair of snakes carved on the stone and I fell in love.     
 I know that many people call it pretentious, but I don't care.     
 How could my childhood be pretentious?     
 I agree.     
 My hope is that when people...     
 - wear my clothes, 
- (LIQUID POURS) they will get to know me a little bit, you know?     
 They will get to know my character, my-my love for life.     
 And I think that the same will happen with your novel.     
 People will get to know you a little bit when they read your book.     
 - I'll send you an advanced copy.

 You think I should change my name to something a little more literary?     
 I was, I was thinking Andrew DeSilva.     
 No. You should be proud of your name.     
 When they make a movie of my book, you must design the clothes. You have to.     
 You... for Imelda, think of it.     
 She was a fashion icon, it'll be perfect.     
 You know she had  ,    pairs of shoes.     
 I know, but I don't design shoes.     
 Well... But maybe I could try, for your movie.     
 Hmm?     
 Maybe.     
 I'm so happy right now.

 These other men, uh, did they consider themselves to be Versace's partner, too?     
 - No. Of course... 
- You see why I'm confused?     
 What's the difference?     
    years.     
 I lived with Gianni for    years, that is the difference.     
 Okay. That-that's, um...     
 (SNIFFS) that's a good length of time.     
 Could you give us their names? These other men.     
 I can, I can find out.     
 Were they paid?     
 Oh, yes, no.     
 Most of the time they just fell for him.     
 He was a genius.     
 He cast a spell.     
 Hmm. Were you paid?     
 Was I paid?     
 To love him?! Was I paid to love him?     
 I'm sorry.     
 I know you're upset, but... this is new to me, I'm just trying to get everything clear.     
 - Don't want to make presumptions. 
- Yes, and I'm trying to help, but...     
 Did you see the man who shot Versace?     
 No.     
 Well, might it be one of these men who killed him?     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 Get them out, please.

 That's not what I need from you right now.     
 What do you need from me?     
 What were you saying to the police?     
 I don't know, they were asking some questions.     
 About Gianni's life.     
 What about my brother's life?     
 They will find out, Donatella.     
 What? What will they find out?     
 Everything.     
 (SCOFFS)     
 Nothing was ever asked of you     
 except to take care of him.     
 And you couldn't even do that.     
 You are not to speak to anyone about my brother without consulting me first.

 DONATELLA: Please sit down.     
 Well...     
 Thank you for coming.     
 For me to talk about business at this time, it's... kind of crazy, no? (SNIFFLES)     
 As you know, my brother, who I love very much, is dead.     
 And now, the press and the police will rake through his life.     
 Every rumor, every indiscretion.     
 They'll judge the killer, yes, but they'll judge the victim, too.     
 At first people weep.     
 Then they whisper.     
 (SNIFFLES)     
 Gianni grew his company from one small store in Milano.     
 On Via della Spiga.     
 With a single rack of clothes, a little wooden bench, and a pietra grigia stone floor.     
 The same stone that's in our family chapel.     
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)     
 Our mother was there, Franca.     
 She was so proud.     
 From that to all this.     
 Everything you see around us.     
 This house, this company...     
 He was a creator, he was a collector, he was a genius.     
 And this company was his life.     
 When he was sad, it made him happy.     
 When he was sick, it kept him alive.     
 And my brother is still alive, as long as Versace's alive.     
 I will not allow that man...     
 That nobody... to kill my brother twice.     
 MAN: The family thanks all those who have paid their respects... and marked their grief with silence.     
 This is a heinous and inexplicable crime.     
 Neither Gianni Versace, nor any of his family, knew or had any contact with the suspect known as Andrew Cunanan.     
 Thank you very much.

 That was the last night official statement from the house of Versace.     
 Lydia's at the scene.     
 LYDIA: With the death of Gianni Versace, Miami is now at the center of one of the largest FBI manhunts of all time.     
 The police have named Andrew Cunanan as the suspect.     
 MALE REPORTER: Please call the Channel    tip line if you have any information. Operators are standing by.     
 This is a nationwide manhunt. Be on alert.

 I gave him $    cash for that coin.     
 Okay, I did everything right.     
 I did everything by the book.     
 I asked him for his I.D., he gave me a U.S. passport.     
 Andrew P. Cunanan.     
 I asked him for his address.     
 He gave me this address, right here. Okay?     
 I handed the paperwork into you guys, July  .     
 Seven days before Versace was shot.     
 We got an address on Andrew Cunanan.     
 DONATELLA: Gianni had hoped to be the first Italian designer to list his company on both the Milan Borsa and the New York Stock Exchange.     
 The papers with Morgan Stanley were signed.     
 They were signed a week ago.     
 That's why he was here, in this country.     
 So, I know how much it meant to him.     
 We can still go ahead.     
 He would have wanted us to.     
 Yes, he would have wanted that.     
 He would have wanted his death to change nothing, but it changes everything.     
 If we pull out, we won't be able to try again for many years, Donatella.     
 Maybe. But if we are a public company, we are in the hands of strangers, Santo.     
 They can turn against us.     
 For good reasons, bad reasons, fair reasons, unfair ones.     
 This is not a time for strangers.     
 This is a time for family.     
 Tell Morgan Stanley...tell them we will not be listing on the New York Stock Exchange.     
 We'll remain a private company.     
 A family company.
