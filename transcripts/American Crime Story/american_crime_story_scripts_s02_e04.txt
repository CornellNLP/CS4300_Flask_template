 The name "Minneapolis" was formed by combining   
 The Dakota Sioux word "mni" for "water" with the Greek word "polis" for "city."   
 And so it's no surprise that water features prominently in the identity of this remarkable city, situated on the banks of the Mississippi River with no less than    lakes.

 "University of Minnesota Duluth,     
 "President's Award, for the architecture student with the most outstanding thesis."     
 - Top of the class. 
- Wow.     
 Really is something.     
 But you did the work. You always have.     
 You put in the hours.     
 You deserve this.     
 Dad, I'm gay.     
 You mind if I take a moment?     
 I don't want to say the wrong thing.     
 I won't lie... and say that it doesn't make a difference.     
 You know what I believe.     
 And maybe this isn't what you wanted to hear.     
 Maybe you wanted to be told     
 I don't have a problem with it.     
 I can't say that.     
 But what I can say is I love you more than I love my own life.     
 Don't cry.     
 There's no need for that.     
 I do have a question.     
 You waited until you won this award... to tell me?     
 Good news, bad news.     
 [door squeaks]     
 [birds chirping]     
 [whimpering softly]     
 David.     
 You're not wearing any shoes.

 [indistinct chatter]     
 Remember where we met?     
 - Market Street. 
- San Francisco.     
 It was a year and a half ago.     
 You were wearing expensive tailored clothes and drinking vintage wine.     
 You were alone at the bar.     
 You were surrounded by your high society friends.     
 I sent you a drink.     
 I thought to myself, "Who does that?     
 In real life, who sends a stranger a drink?"     
 Well, you looked lonely.     
 I was lonely.     
 Well, that's why I invited you to join our table.     
 You had everyone laughing.     
 Your friends, the waiters.     
 I thought, "I want to be like him--     
 rich, sophisticated, erudite."     
 That's the kind of word you'd use, isn't it?     
 I mean, you were throwing money around like it didn't matter.     
 I was hoping you'd invite me back to your room.     
 But I figured, what's this man gonna see in me?     
 Small-town boy.     
 I couldn't wait to invite you.     
 My God, the Mandarin Oriental.     
 $ ,    a night.     
 That hotel...     
 Well, we had a bay suite.     
 You told me you'd changed rooms three times     
 - because you didn't like the view. 
- [laughing]     
 You wanted to see the Golden Gate Bridge.     
 Uh-huh.     
 [sighs] Best night of my life.     
 Oh, I never told you this, but I took my pair of white slippers home.     
 I felt so cheap.     
 They were only supposed to be worn once, and anyone who belonged in a room like that would never take them.     
 I remember thinking,     
 "How hard do I have to work to live like him, like Andrew?     
 'Cause I'll do it."     
 Except it was all a lie.     
 You've never worked for anything.     
 It was an act.     
 What's wrong with you?     
 Is that why you killed Jeff?     
 You loved him.     
 It was so obvious.     
 But he figured you out in the end, didn't he?     
 Took him a few years, but he finally saw the real you.     
 And you killed him for it.     
 You think that night in San Francisco was great?     
 You just wait till we get to Mexico.     
 I can make way more money there than I ever could here.     
 And there's a Mandarin Oriental down there.     
 We can stay there for more than a night-- for a week, for-for a month, however long we want, with the best room.     
 Patio terrace, ocean view.     
 We can tell the cute little Mexican waiters that we're movie stars from L.A.     
 You can't do it, can you?     
 I can't what?     
 Stop.     
 Why did you ask me to open the door?     
 [chuckles]: What?     
 Why did you send me down to bring Jeff up?     
 I don't want to talk about it.     
 You knew you were gonna kill him. You knew.     
 And you wanted me to be there.     
 You wanted me to see.     
 You wanted me to be a part of it.     
 You planned it, didn't you?     
 You didn't lose control. You planned it.     
 I don't want to talk about it.     
 All weekend, while we were eating and drinking and dancing, is that what you were thinking about?     
 - I don't want to talk about it, David. 
- What?     
 Are we outlaws?     
 On the run, together, you and me.     
 - Is that it? 
-I don't want to talk about this, David!     
 I'm nothing like you!     
 I don't want to talk about it.     
 Stop the car!     
 - [engine revving] 
- [tires screeching]     
 Stop the car!     
 [gun cocks]     
 Hey... Why are you always talking about the past?!     
 - We had a plan! We had a future! 
- Hey. Andrew...     
 We had... a future, David.     
 [brakes squeal softly]     
 ANDREW: We had a plan. There was a plan.     
 We had a plan, David.     
 DAVID: We still have a plan.     
 Andrew.     
 [panting]     
 Andrew, we-we still have a plan.     
 No. No, we don't. 
You don't get it. We don't.     
 We do. Yes, yes.     
 Tell me! Convince me!     
 Uh, first, we'll-we'll go and visit your friend in-in Chicago.     
 Uh, Lee. Um, Miglin.     
 L-Lee Miglin,the-the property developer.     
 And he'll give us some money.     
 And then we'll... we'll drive.     
 Across the country. 
It'll be an adventure.     
 We'll find work... and a place to live.     
 You don't believe that.     
 - Yes, I do. 
- No, you don't.     
 I can see it clearly.     
 The place where we'll live.     
 It's... next to the sea.     
 And-and we'll learn Spanish.     
 You're so smart, you'll be speaking it fluently in no time.     
 I'll be struggling, but you'll help me learn.     
 You've always helped me.     
 We'll be happy?     
 Y-Yes, we'll-we'll be happy.     
 It could've been true.     
 Andrew.     
 Listen to me.     
 It's over.     
 We need to go to the police.     
 This has to stop.     
 Why couldn't you run away with me?     
 If it had been Jeff,you would've run away with him, but not me.     
 You'd rather go to prison.     
 It's not real.     
 It could have been.     
 No.     
 It couldn't.
