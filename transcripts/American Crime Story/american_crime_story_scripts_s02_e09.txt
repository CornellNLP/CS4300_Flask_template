 MAN (ON TV): Dan Rather from CBS News Headquarters in New York.    
 RATHER: Good evening. Fashion designer Gianni Versace was murdered today, gunned down outside his mansion in Miami Beach, Florida.    
 Versace was a fashion icon.    
 (VOLUME INCREASES): 
His empire spanned the worlds of the famous and perhaps the infamous.    
 Investigators are probing whether he was targeted by organized crime or perhaps a serial killer.    
 Our CBS News coverage of the death of the designer begins at the scene of the crime, with CBS News correspondent Jim Axelrod.    
 AXELROD: The blood on the steps of the most famous house in Miami Beach belonged to one of its most famous residents, designer Gianni Versace, murdered this morning.    
 I saw Gianni Versace laying face down on his steps with his head blown off, with his face shot off.    
 - (LOUD POP) 
- Oh! (LAUGHS)    
 MAN: execution-style, shot in the head right on his steps...    
 NEWSWOMAN (ON TV): The death of this famous idol and icon reverberates greatly through this small community where Versace was a popular presence.    
 Police are now confirming the suspect is a young man, Andrew Cunanan.    
 An eyewitness describes Cunanan approached Versace    
 - and fired two shots... 
- Oh, my God.  
 at point blank range.    
 Mr. Versace collapsed immediately.    
 - The suspect then... 
- Oh, my God.

 NEWSMAN (ON TV):  Police named  alleged serial killer Andrew Cunanan as their only suspect in the execution-style murder of world-famous fashion designer Gianni Versace.     
 OFFICER: Cunanan is known to be a male prostitute who services affluent clientele.     
 Cunanan is well-educated, well-dressed and is very articulate.     
 Cunanan should be considered extremely dangerous and armed at this time.     
 NEWSMAN: Andrew Cunanan is already wanted in connection with four murders.     
 He was recently added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.     
 Police did not specify whether Versace knew his alleged killer.
