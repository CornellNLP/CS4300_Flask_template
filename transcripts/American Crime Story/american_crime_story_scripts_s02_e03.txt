 WOMAN: And we're live in three, two...   
 Marilyn Miglin started her career as a dancer at the legendary Chez Paree nightclub in Chicago.   
 - Many years ago. 
- [laughs]   
 But performing under those bright stage lights, she found that her makeup was always running.   
 And that's how your interest in cosmetics began.   
 I-I thought to myself: "There must be something better."    
 And since there wasn't, I created my own.    
 We are so lucky to have you here today...    
 - Oh, thank you. 
- ...to talk about your best-selling line of fragrances: Pheromone.    
 - Indeed. 
- Now, I read somewhere    
 - that you have sold... 
- Oh, dear.    
 ...so many bottles that they now call you the Queen of Perfume.    
 They-they do, but I started from nothing.    
 Just an idea, and a longing to explore what perfume is truly about.    
 What is that? Tell our viewers.    
 Perfume is about our bodies    
 talking to each other without words.    
 LEE [on recording]: You've reached the Miglins.    
 Lee? I don't know where you are.    
 I'm still at the airport, but I can't wait any longer.    
 I-I'm gonna catch a taxi.

 His fielding percentage is always at the top,

 Lee?    
 Marilyn?    
 Something's wrong.    
 Wait outside. Call the police.

 I'll go.

 Wait here.    
 Their Lexus is missing.    
 [Barbara screaming]    
 [gasps]    
 [whispering]: I knew it.    
 [indistinct chatter]    
 [Marilyn laughing]    
 Well, Lee and I have always been very interested in education.    
 And so the idea was that we would offer aspiring women at the beginning of their careers a mentor in their chosen field.    
 Have you two always been so involved in each other's lives?    
 Oh, my goodne... [laughs]    
 Lee helped me paint my first boutique.    
     East Oak Street.    
 [laughs] And I wouldn't be where I am today without Marilyn.    
 I-I can't imagine where I would be.    
 Certainly not at a table like this, that's for sure.    
 - Not true. 
- I'm honored to call you my friends, and not too displeased to having you raise funds for me, either.    
 She's the one. She's the one.    
 Please, don't ever decide to run against me.    
 Now that you mention it...    
 [laughter]    
 MARILYN: So often we are told that the American Dream is dead.    
 Except, I say, look at my husband Lee.    
 One of seven children, the son of an Illinois coal miner.    
 He began his career selling premixed pancake batter    
 - out of the trunk of a beat-up old car. 
- [laughter]    
 And today, Lee manages   million square feet of commercial property across the Midwest.    
 He built the Chicago Bar Association building, the   -story Madison Plaza, the global headquarters of Hyatt, and as if that wasn't enough, he helped me achieve my dreams.    
 He is my partner in every sense of the word.    
 And he is so much more than that.    
 He is an incredible father, a perfect husband, and I'm so proud to say, without a hint of cynicism, that my Lee is the American Dream.    
 Ladies and gentlemen, Lee Miglin.    
 [applause]    
 [Lee speaks indistinctly]     
 MARILYN: And he's funny, too.     
 [laughter]     
 LEE [laughs]: Tha-Thank you, Marilyn.     
 Thank you, folks. 
Thank you all for being here.     
 That went well, I think.     
 - Very well. 
- Mm. And...     
 I really appreciated your introduction.     
 I wasn't expecting that.     
 Do you remember what color we painted the Oak Street store?     
 What color? [chuckles]     
 That was years ago.     
 We painted it pink.

 While I was away, Lee's secretary delivered $ ,   .     
 That's missing, along with two leather coats, two suits, some inconsequential pieces of jewelry--     
 uh, Lee had gold coins.     
 He gave them as gifts.     
 They are unusual, and should be easy to trace, should the culprit try to pawn them.     
 And, um, a dozen pairs of new Sulka black socks.     
 Aren't you going to write this down?     
 I'll have an officer take your statement.     
 Marilyn, this is Superintendent Rodriguez.     
 I know who he is.     
 I happen to be friends with a great many police officers.     
 Do you think I called     earlier? No.     
 I called Commander Ettore DiVito, who was present at the Wallenberg Award celebration a few weeks ago, and asked to speak to him directly.

 Poor Lee, he wouldn't have had a... chance.     
 He wouldn't have fought back.     
 Mrs. Miglin, maybe we can talk at another time.     
 Talk now. Why not?

 What items?     
 Pornographic magazines.     
 Homosexual pornographic magazines.

 Well, they must belong to the killer.     
 It would mean he brought the magazines in with him.

 Find him. Catch him.     
 But don't talk to me about what might or might not be going through his mind.

 Yeah. He might've stayed the night.     
 He must've known Marilyn was coming home.     
 Where did you get those?     
 Mrs. Miglin.
