 Now listen up, all of you. When you're supposed to be at chow by 7:00 p.m., that means 7:00 p.m. 
 Not 7:05, not 7:09. 
 Who the hell is you supposed to be? 
 Where's Deputy Adam? 
 Ma'am, please check the tone of your voice before I have to arrest you. 
 No, you need to check your tone. 
 We ain't in prison. 
 Where is Dep... ? 
 Oh, there he is. 
 Yeah, there. 
 (indistinct clamoring for Deputy Adam) 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 
 One at a time! Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Some of them are late. 
 Adam : It's only five past, and it's dinner. 
 They've had a long day, it's fine. 
 Let me just have a word with them. 
 You guys, listen, I am sorry, but we've been rotated out, all of us. 
 Why? I don't really know. 
 Why do we never know why anything happens? 
 We were supposed to be here for two months. 
 It's been eight months! 
 I mean, this is like some psychologic experimental torture or something! 
 Eight months locked up in a hotel with no TV and no magazines! 
 I am going crazy. I'm going crazy! 
 I mean, I see my wife once a week. I can't drink! 
 I can't talk to nobody! 
 We can't talk about this case. 
 I don't know what you bitching and moaning about, Lionel. 
 Everybody knows that you ain't got nothing going on in the real world no way. 
 What did you say?! 
 I will smack the taste out of your mouth. 
 (indistinct angry chattering) 
 Please! Please, that's enough! 
 Let's just settle down. 
 For me. Please. 
 Tracy : I don't even want to eat anymore. 
 I've lost my appetite. 
 I've got to get out of here! 
 Let him get on out. 
 Run. 
 Thank you. 
 Man : How you doing, brother? 
 Wow, I've never been in a hotel this nice before. 
 Hell, I'd take a Motel 6 as long as I can get away from the wife for a couple of weeks. 
 Amen, brother. 
 I'm-a raid the minibar, sit back and watch my Niners in the Super Bowl. 
 This is the Super Bowl, man. 
 And we get to pick the winner. 
 Francine : You know something I don't? 
 Looks like you think we're gonna be here a while. 
 (chuckles) No, I just want to look professional when I go to court. 
 I'm an alternate. 
 I could probably wear my pj's and nobody'd care. 
 Hmm. (chuckles) 
 Ah, yeah. 
 (grunting) 
 Some TV. 
 Oh, boy. 
 See what's on. 
 What the... ? 
 Sir! Stop! 
 Swimming pool's off-limits! 
 (pounding on door) 
 Please report to Conference Room 4 in six minutes, 230. 
 Okay, I'll... 
 And that will be reviewed and returned to you if appropriate. 
 Adam :  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, listen up. 
 This sequester has very simple rules. 
 You're not to talk about the case with anyone. 
 That includes each other. 
 You're not to talk to the other hotel guests at any time, for any reason. 
 Once in the hotel, you will not be permitted to leave your floor. 
 You're not allowed in another juror's room for any reason. 
 Deputies will be on duty in the halls and elsewhere to supervise you at all times. 
 Clerk : Do you and each of you understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court, so help you God? 
 Jurors : I do. 
 You may be seated. 
 Since day one, we've had four out-and-out "not guilties" 
 In Speed, En Vogue, Easter Island and Queen Bee. 
 Johnnie : After those gloves, I looked in my sweet jurors' eyes, and I said, ♪ Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier. ♪ 
 But now we're going for acquittal, and it's all because of you, Bob! 
 Yes. 
 Ah, thanks, Johnnie. 
 Thank you. 
 But, honestly, I can't believe they went for it. 
 I mean, to make that mistake on the biggest case of their lives. 
 Uh, to our team. 
 To our team! 
 Yes. 
 All : Cheers. 
 The most colossal disaster I've ever seen in courtroom practice, and it's ours, it's all ours. 
 We will rally. 
 We still have the DNA and the forensic evidence. 
 That is our silver bullet. 
 Nobody understands goddamn DNA, Marcia! 
 But everyone can tell when a goddamn glove doesn't fit on a goddamn hand! 
 (door slams) 
 They did fit. 
 (sighs) 
 It was the latex. 
 Get out. 
 Woman :  Okay,  so we've received a few complaints about talking during TV time. 
 If you have something to say, please try to keep your voice down and your comments and laughter to a minimum. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Speaking of, Blockbuster sent over a fresh batch of VHSes today. 
 Hey, did they send  Martin? Martin,  that's my show. 
 Man, don't nobody want to watch that clown. 
 He's a comedian, he's supposed to be funny. 
 Didn't you hear the woman say we can't laugh? 
 I'll laugh if I want to. 
 I wouldn't mind an episode of  Seinfeld. 
 What is a "Seinfeld"? 
 It's a TV show. 
 I never heard of it. 
 Seinfeld  is a much better show. 
 Man,  Seinfeld  ain't about nothing. 
 We'll be watching  Seinfeld. 
 (angry chattering) 
 I'm just making a decision here instead of listening to you people argue. 
 What do you mean "you people"? 
 Oh, no, don't start that crap with me, pal. 
 I'm part American Indian. 
 You need to bounce up out of here with that bull. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, you guys. 
 Come on, I'm sure we can find something we all want to watch. 
 Look, why don't we just take a vote? 
 Well, that's a great idea. Thank you, Armanda. 
 Who votes  Martin? 
 Oh, hey! Duh. 
 Oh! 
 What I'm talking about. 
 Now if you want to watch  Seinfeld. 
 (man hums bass line)

 Martin  it is.

 O.J. : And then he has to apologize to the chimpanzee. 
 (chuckling) What? 
 I'm telling you, they got to give that Kramer his own show. 
 All right, you're up. 
 I'll check. 
 The Juice is loose, y'all. 
 I'm all in. 
 I fold. 
 Oh, don't be that way, Todd. 
 Come on, Bobby B. 
 I'm out. 
 It's too rich. 
 Really? 
 Oh, well, that's too bad, 'cause... I got nothing! 
 Oh, you b*st*rd. 
 (O.J. laughs) 
 On a roll, Juice. 
 Got that right. 
 Tell somebody. 
 Tell a friend. 
 Man. 
 You know, playing cards with y'all like this... 
 Ah, you mean "consulting with your material witnesses." 
 O.J. : Ooh! 
 Thank you. 
 Well, almost feels like I'm back home, just for a minute, you know? 
 You know, after that glove thing, they should just call off the rest of this trial. 
 What are they throwing at you tomorrow? 
 DNA. 
 Whatever that is. 
 (laughing) 
 So, again, the four pieces to DNA are adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, abbreviated by their first letters: A, T, G and C. 
 They also come in pairs. 
 Now, the non-Watson Crick base pairing is what really gets interesting. 
 It, uh... 
 Mr. Fung, while all this can seem complicated to a non-scientist, the results are astoundingly accurate in terms of matching a suspect to tiny traces that have been left behind. Would you agree? 
 Oh, certainly. The matching process is many, many times more accurate than a fingerprint. 
 "Many, many times more accurate than a fingerprint." 
 And what were the results of the blood analysis from the Bundy crime scene? 
 Well, the RFLP pattern from item 47 shows us that... 
 Marcia : Oh, let me rephrase. 
 Other than the two victims, did this incredibly precise DNA matching show anyone else's blood and DNA at the scene of the murders? 
 It did, uh, just one individual. 
 And does this same DNA match the blood you found on the back gate at Bundy? 
 Yes, it does. 
 And does it match the blood you found inside Mr. Simpson's Bronco? 
 Yes, it's all from the same individual. 
 And does it match the DNA and the blood you found leading up to Mr. Simpson's house and on the sock at the foot of his bed? 
 Yes, it's all from the same individual's DNA profile. 
 Could it be anyone else's DNA? 
 That blood has a particular set of characteristics that could only occur approximately in one in 170 million individuals. 
 One person... in 170 million. 
 Is that one person who matches all that DNA in this courtroom today? 
 Yes, he is. 
 Could you please point him out for the jury? 
 Let the record show that Mr. Fung is pointing to the defendant, Mr. Orenthal James Simpson. 
 (groans) Where is everybody? 
 Todd said he had to work late. 
 Spencer said his kids had a tennis match or something. 
 Ugh. 
 And that's more important than poker night? sh1t. 
 I think it's... 
 I... I think it's the DNA. 
 I think maybe they're having trouble wrapping their minds around the, uh, the numbers. 
 You know, it... it raises some questions. 
 What questions? They know me. 
 I think... I mean, well... one thing they were wondering is-is about Nicole's blood. 
 How it got in your Bronco. 
 How the hell do I know? 
 How the hell do I know, Bobby? 
 The police. 
 Faye's Colombian friends. I don't know. 
 Yeah, but it's everywhere. 
 (sighs) 
 Nicole's house, the Bronco, your driveway, your socks. 
 It... 
 And this is  them  asking? 
 Yeah. 
 This is them asking. 
 Adam :  Ladies. Gentlemen. 
 There's been another postponement. 
 (jurors groaning, murmuring) 
 I know, I know, believe me, believe me... I'm in the same boat as you. 
 I'm working on two hours sleep. 
 Deputy Adam, you need to find more time for your family. 
 How are Christine and the baby? How are they doing? 
 She's great. 
 Yeah? 
 Christine's complaining about baby weight, but I think she's beautiful. 
 Look at that...  She's beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Knox. 
 Judge Ito needs to see you in his chambers. 
 Woman : Uh-oh. 
 What he want with me? 
 Let's go. 
 Okay, okay. 
 (mumbles) 
 Ito :  Have you ever been arrested  for kidnapping, 620? 
 What? (laughs) 
 I-I think I'd remember something like that, Judge. 
 Uh, o-okay. 
 Now I know what you're talking about. 
 See, that was my ex. 
 But she's cool with it now. 
 We cool. 
 All I... 
 I just locked the car door and-and I drove around the neighborhood a-a few times. 
 That's all. 
 You know how ladies can get. 
 You know with this... 
 I fail to see how this is grounds for dismissal. 
 It was a slight incident a long time ago. 
 It seems quite behind him now, Your Honor. 
 Yes, Counsel, I'm sure that you and your client are sympathetic to putting domestic violence in the rearview mirror. 
 I do not appreciate that kind of innuendo, Your Honor! 
 620 lied on his questionnaire. 
 He lied about his police record. 
 He lied about domestic violence. 
 I'm dismissing 620. 
 What happened? 
 620 was dismissed. 
 Why? 
 What?! 
 (jurors gasp) 
 Sorry, guys, you know that's all I can say. 
 (jurors murmuring) 
 Kennedy : Is anyone really surprised? 
 The guy was taking bets on the verdict. 
 I just hope I get a seat. 
 Tired of playing JV. 
 (chuckles) You know, those deputies are gonna find all kinds of ways to get rid of us brown folk. 
 They always are. 
 All the time. 
 And they're always watching me. 
 I think they put a camera in my room. 
 There's this little blinking red light above my door. 
 I'm pretty sure it's a smoke alarm. 
 No. Mmmm. 
 The deputies are just doing their jobs. 
 I mean, they've been here as long as we have. 
 When my daughter was having some trouble, Deputy Adam let me talk to her on the phone past curfew. 
 Hmm. (laughs) 
 Master Adam sure is good to you, ain't he? 
 (laughter) 
 I see how it is. Oh, I see how it is. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Oh, come on now there, Missy. (chuckles) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Kardashian : Barry? 
 Hi, Robert. 
 What's up? 
 The numbers. 
 One in 170 million. 
 Yeah, it bothers you, I know. I can see it. 
 It's-it's just so overwhelming. 
 Listen. 
 The crime scene was mishandled. 
 Terribly. 
 It's compromised. 
 Tainted. 
 All of it? 
 No. 
 Some of it, but that's just as bad. 
 If some of it is tainted, untrustworthy, then all of it is. 
 And that's what I will show. 
 Leave it to me. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 All right, Mr. Scheck. 
 Good morning, Mr. Fung. 
 Would you agree it's inappropriate for a criminalist to ignore misconduct by law enforcement? 
 Objection. 
 Withdrawn. 
 Mr. Fung, you received from Detective Lang the blood sample taken from Mr. Simpson, correct? 
 Yes. 
 And where did you take possession of that blood sample? 
 Hmm. 
 Let me remember. 
 Well, maybe I can help. 
 The blood was handed to you at the Rockingham scene while you were examining that scene, correct? 
 Yes, that's actually true. 
 So, Mr. Simpson's blood was literally handed to you by LAPD at the very location where you found evidence of his blood on the carpet, in the driveway, in his socks? 
 Well... yes. 
 (laughs): Well... this might explain a huge unanswered question in this case. 
 Are you aware, sir, that 1.9 milliliters or one quarter of the blood collected from Mr. Simpson is missing?! 
 Your Honor. 
 Sustained. 
 Scheck : Mr. Fung, when did you realize that the blanket covering Nicole Brown's body was actually from inside her own residence? 
 Um... later. 
 Would you agree, sir, that a blanket taken from inside her residence placed by law enforcement over her dead body could be thought of as a contamination of that scene? 
 It's, uh... possible. 
 And that if Mr. Simpson had been in that home previously sitting or-or lying on that blanket, his hairs could be on that blanket... 
 Would  be on that blanket... 
 And thus, would have been in the crime scene? 
 Yes, it-it-it's possible. 
 (Scheck exhales) 
 Scheck : That is a terrible mistake for a criminalist to make. 
 Isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 Mr. Fung, have you made some bad choices in this case? 
 I-I-I don't remember. 
 I'm-I'm not sure, maybe. 
 No further questions. 
 Ito : All right, Mr. Fung. 
 You may step down. 
 Is he seriously shaking their hands? 
 Now, we having some Fung now.

 (knocking)

 (door opens) 
 Thank you. 
 462, um, the reason why I asked you here today is that the sheriff's department reviewed some court records, and it appears that you once accused your husband of abusing you physically? 
 No. No, Your Honor. 
 It was never a domestic violence type of thing. 
 I was never physically abused. 
 And that's why I didn't say anything. 
 I mean, anybody in a relationship with anybody knows that there are times when things are difficult. 
 Johnnie :  As she said,  this was simply a misunderstanding. 
 She lied. She's out! 
 She didn't lie. She said... 
 She said no to the question "have you ever been a victim of domestic violence?" Her husband raped her twice. 
 Bailey : Actually, it wasn't legally rape in '88. 
 I mean, between a husband and wife. 
 You just said that. 
 Out loud. 
 Ito : All right, so let me get this straight. 
 The defense is arguing to keep a victim of domestic abuse and the People are arguing to dismiss her? 
 Somehow, I get the idea if this juror were white, we'd be having a different conversation right now. 
 I have no choice but to dismiss 462.

 We lost two not-guilty votes. Two.

 Ito : Clerk, please read the replacement from the remaining alternates. 
 Number 353. 
 (very quietly): sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. 
 I know what you're up to. 
 You want to tell me or am I supposed to guess? 
 Who tipped the sheriff off about 620 and 462? 
 Hell if I know. 
 But I'll take it. 
 You had something to gain. 
 Back alley stuff isn't my game. It's yours. 
 You're always talking about the truth. 
 Well, the truth came out. 
 Toughen up, Cochran. 
 This is the smokers' lounge. 
 Day care's on the first floor. 
 Apparently, Ms. Clark thinks she can steal this verdict, but we gotta start punching back. 
 What does that mean, exactly? 
 It means we do everything legally possible to ensure that nothing gets past us regarding the remaining jurors. 
 The alternates. 
 Now, we can't do anything about the guilty votes we lost. 
 But we can be out ahead of who might be taking their places. 
 The Demon. 
 She's our biggest threat. 
 We cannot let her  on the voting jury. 
 Bailey :  During voir dire, she said she once turned an entire jury from 11 to one not guilty to 12-zero for conviction. She's a nightmare. 
 Chris : Juror 1290's our Holy Grail. 
 Marcia : God, we need her. 
 A voice in deliberation who's going to focus on the facts. 
 (exhales) 
 And have you seen the way she looks at Johnnie? 
 Bailey :  Okay. 
 So, who else is gonna be a problem? 
 (chatter, laughter) 
 Juror 2017. 
 The judge would like to see you. 
 Were you aware that your arthritis doctor, Dr. Bertram Maltz, also treats Mr. Simpson for his arthritis? 
 I was not. 
 Ito : And why were you keeping notes about other jurors' conjugal visits? 
 No. I mean... Your Honor, maybe I glanced at the list a couple of times, but... 
 We checked your notebook, sir. 
 Now, these notes wouldn't be for a book, would they?

 An anonymous letter claiming to be from a literary agent's receptionist, and it says, I quote, "An older white female juror is shopping a book proposal called  Standing Alone: A Vote for Nicole." 
 May I? 
 Well... this is clearly an attempt by the defense to remove a juror they don't like. 
 I suggest you throw it in the trash where it belongs. 
 I certainly hope you're not suggesting that we sent that letter.

 Down at the courthouse, they're calling it "the juror revolt." 
 It's unprecedented in judicial history, Larry. 
 And my sources say the whole thing was over some deputies being transferred. 
 We've lost control. 
 Now we have no idea what's going on. 
 Half the people wearing black were in our damn not guilty column. 
 Now we have no idea who's who or what's what.

 The people love him. He gets on the stand, talks about how much he loves his wife, gets emotional. 
 Interesting idea, uh, O.J. 
 I-I'm not against it. (groans) 
 Now you're talking. Now that's what I'm saying. 
 Hold on a second, O.J. What? 
 It is a terrible idea! 
 I mean, are you doing this just to screw with me? 
 Amazingly, this is not about you, Bob. 
 This is about winning this case. 
 What is your idea? Another plea bargain? 
 If Marcia Clark cross-examines him, it will be an unmitigated disaster, and you know it. 
 What if we do a mock-cross? 
 See how he handles it. 
 (sighs, phone beeps) Juice? 
 I-I-I pray to the Lord, sweet baby black Jesus, you put me on hold one more time, Negro. 
 Apologies. 
 We were thinking that it might be a good idea to do a test run first. 
 What you mean, test run? 
 Like, like, a rehearsal or something? 
 Exactly, a rehearsal. 
 (group murmuring) 
 (murmuring continues) 
 (distorted murmuring) 
 (screaming) 
 Well, that's one way to do it. 
 (sobbing) 
 Okay. 
 Enough. Whatever you and Marcia are doing, it's gotta stop now, Johnnie. 
 You get a mistrial, and we have to do this whole thing over again. 
 There is no way you will win. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 I hear you take your coffee black with two Sweet'N Lows. 
 Mr. Simpson, isn't it true you were married when you met an 18-year-old Nicole? I was. 
 But our marriage was pretty much over by then. 
 I mean, we were friends, but we weren't in love. 
 So you felt it was okay to commit adultery? 
 We weren't even living together. 
 I'm not proud about the way I acted, but, uh, we'd moved on by then. 
 Mr. Simpson, is there some reason that you find this funny? 
 (chuckles) 
 No. 
 You argued often with Nicole, is that correct, Mr. Simpson? 
 All married couples disagree, don't they? 
 Is it true that some of these arguments became physical? 
 That's what they'll tell you on the news. 
 We'd... we'd scuffle around sometimes. 
 You know. Wrassle. Mmm. 
 (mouths) 
 Is this "scuffling around" what led to her hospitalization on January 1, 1989? 
 Well... that New Year's, you know, we had a couple of drinks. 
 Uh... she must have fell. 
 They'll be ready in a minute. 
 (children chattering in distance) 
 Hey, Kris, can we... can I just have a second? 
 Why? 
 I don't know. I thought we could talk. 
 (scoffs) What do we have to talk about? 
 I think we might get him off. 
 (scoffs) 
 Congrats. 
 (crying softly) 
 He was my friend for 20 years. 
 I can barely look at him anymore. 
 Robert, just... leave. Just quit the case. 
 You don't think... you don't think I've thought of that? 
 I can't. I-I mean, it would just become this-this huge thing. 
 I mean, how would it look? 
 It would convict him. 
 I would convict him. 
 And it would make everything else worse for us and for you, for them. 
 I mean, it's hard enough with half the country hating you. 
 No, I just... I just have to sit there till it's over. 
 And then he's out of our lives forever. 
 Okay? 
 Okay? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry, Kris. 
 (phone rings) 
 McKenna :  O.J. tip line. 
 Whoa, whoa. Say... Wait, wait, wait. Say that again. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay. 
 (scoffs)
