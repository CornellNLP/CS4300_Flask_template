 VERSACE: I've arranged an interview.   
 DONATELLA: With who?   
 With The Advocate magazine.   
 The American publication.   
 For gay readers.   
 To say what?   
 VERSACE: I've never said it.   
 I'm gay.   
 - To print? To publish? 
- Yes.    
 I handle publicity for this company.    
 This is my responsibility.    
 Yes, but this is not about you.    
 And this is about more than you.    
 In what way?    
 The magazine has a modest circulation.    
 How can you decide this without consulting me?    
 Uh, consulting you?    
 Okay, I'm consulting you.    
 What would you advise?    
 ANTONIO: Yes, what would you advise?    
 Ah, this is your idea.    
 You want to be famous.    
 Known around the world as Versace's lover?    
 For    years, I've been mistaken for Gianni's assistant.    
 And your pride is more important than this company?    
 ANTONIO: I've lived unseen.    
 In great comfort, that's for sure.    
 I never imagined being publicly acknowledged.    
 I know my place, unlike you.    
 And what is my place?    
 - (POUNDS TABLE) 
- Enough! Enough, both of you.    
 I will not... fight over this.    
 It was my idea, it was my idea.    
 Donatella, walk with me.    
 Come.    
 I want you to support me.    
 You know that.    
 All these people's lives depend on you.    
 We're opening stores in countries where it is illegal.    
 Where it is a crime.    
 You have to visit those countries.    
 They might refuse your entry, refuse a visa, refuse to do business with you.    
 Tell me, honestly... what do you think could happen?    
 (SCOFFS)    
 The rock stars, the actors, the royalty whose endorsements we cherish... they might not want to be associated with us.    
 Well, at least we keep Elton, no?    
 You joke?    
 Joke?    
 We're talking about the survival of the company.    
 Is that what you believe?    
 You live in isolation.    
 Surrounded by beauty and kindness.    
 You have forgotten how ugly the world can be.    
 The women we design for, they're strong, yes?    
 They're fearless.    
 They're not ashamed.    
 - This is not the same. 
- It's not the same.    
 Is the brand of Versace braver than the man?    
 Are you angry with me or with the world?    
 When we list the company on the New York Stock Exchange, what will your admission cost?    
 $  million? $    million?    
 Or will it make this company worth nothing?    
 You're exaggerating. 
Don't be ridiculous.    
 Perry Ellis.    
 When he walked onto the runway dying of AIDS, so weak, his assistants caught him when he took a bow...    
 - Perhaps his most important show. 
- After that,    
 - people stopped buying his clothes. 
- Some people.    
 - No, Gianni, a lot of people. 
- No, no, no. Some people.    
 Some people.    
 ANSWER ME THIS: why now?    
 Because I was sick.    
 And I didn't die.    
 I have a second chance.    
 It's a miracle that I'm alive.    
 And yet I ask myself every day, what have I done to deserve this?    
 Why am I still here?    
 To be afraid?    
 No.    
 I'm alive and I must use it.    
 AMERICAN EXPRESS OPERATOR: Mr. Cunanan, I appreciate that your credit history used to be impeccable...    
 ANDREW: All I need to do is make one more purchase, and that's for a one-way ticket to Minneapolis on Northwest Airlines.    
 OPERATOR: Sir, American Express is not in the business of loaning...    
 Well, once I get to Minneapolis, I can fix everything.    
 Then I will be your very best customer again,    
 - I promise you. 
- OPERATOR: I don't know    
 - what's in Minneapolis. 
- My two best friends.     
 I'm moving in with my friend David, and Jeff actually owes me more than $  ,   .     
 But once I get that money, they're gonna help me turn my life right back around.     
 OPERATOR: Will you be making a repayment?     
 Well, yes, once I get to Minneapolis.     
 OPERATOR: Mr. Cunanan, to be clear, you're requesting that American Express extend your credit to cover a one-way ticket in order to make a repayment, correct?     
 Yes, that's all I need.     
 OPERATOR: (SIGHS) Let me talk to my supervisor.

 Where was the Gridley?     
 Persian Gulf in '  .     
 After that, we were docked in San Diego.     
 They were refitting her, but they changed their minds and decided to decommission her.     
 Still makes me sad. She was a good ship.

 SAMSON: Well, I was never gonna become an officer,     
 - so I figured... 
- JEFF: I was an officer.     
 - You were? 
- Graduate from Annapolis.     
 My brother's a navy corpsman, my sister's in the air force.     
 You married?     
 No.     
 Waiting for the right one, I guess.     
 Why'd you leave?     
 I haven't heard of many officers leaving to work at a place like this.     
 - This place is okay. 
- Sure, it's okay.     
 For a man who went to Annapolis?     
 I made the decision.     
 SAMSON: Right.     
 My wife always says I ask too many questions.     
 I made the decision, okay?     
 I offended you. I'm sorry.

 Someone named Andrew called, left a message.     
 Says he'll see you at the airport.     
 (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.)     
 - Hey. 
- Didn't think you were gonna show.     
 I didn't think so, either.     
 Do you know why he's coming here?     
 - Nope. 
- I don't get it.     
 Nothing's happening this weekend.     
 He's got no one. He's got nothing.     
 Everything he's told you about his life's a lie.     
 You know that, right?     
 Do you even like him?     
 He was there for me once.     
 I owe him. It's not the same.     
 - I feel kind of sorry for him. 
- Don't.     
 - He's lonely. 
- For a reason.     
 Look, I'm gonna give him this weekend, for old times' sake, and then I'm done with him.     
 He's here for three nights.     
 He can have my apartment tomorrow night.     
 I'll stay at my sister's.     
 But don't tell him where I am, okay?     
 He's so crazy, he might just show up.

 Oh, good. Good.     
 - Jeff. 
- Andrew.     
 Oh, we're gonna have so much fun this weekend.     
 It's gonna be just like old times.     
 Not like old times.     
 Why would you say that?     
 I'm not gonna be able to hang out with you guys tonight.     
 Oh, why not?

 What did I do?     
 My company has a sales conference.     
 I'm away till Sunday.     
 But I'll be sure to write you a postcard.     
 Oh, are you still annoyed about that?     
 I thought we talked about this. I expla...     
 I accidentally sent Jeff's dad a postcard.     
 I put "Stan Trail" instead of "Jeff Trail."     
 And they don't know that he's gay, and I signed it "Love, Drew. Kiss-kiss."     
 I made a mistake. I'm sorry.     
 So what?     
 You can stay at my place tomorrow night.     
 I won't be at home.     
 Why do I need a place to stay?

 You don't have to give me an answer right now.     
 You can think about it for the next few days.

 Never sent a postcard by mistake.     
 You've never made any mistakes in your life.     
 No.     
 - I know.

 I'm not gonna hang out with him.     
 You shouldn't let him have that kind of control over you.

 I'm throwing him in the water.

 Are there gay soldiers currently serving who are open about their sexuality?

 Wait, wait a second, this is your first time in any gay bar?     
 - Ever? 
- Uh...     
 What if I said yes?     
 Well, I-I'd be duty bound to inform the bar staff immediately.     
 You know that they keep a supply of indoor fireworks for occasions just like this.     
 They cover the entire bar with sparklers and fireworks...     
 Oh, no, no, no, that's not necessary.     
 Oh, no, no, no, it's wonderful. 
It's a whole thing.     
 They-they spell out your name in a, in a shower of yellow sparks.     
 You're joking?     
 Oh, my God.     
 You're too cute.

- Okay.     
 Well, thank you.     
 For what?     
 For stopping this night from being a humiliation.     
 I might not have tried again for another five years.     
 Oh, it's... it's my honor.     
 Really.

 You're gonna remember this moment.

 Wait, so CBS News wants to interview you?     
 - H-How does that, uh, happen? 
- They canvassed the base.     
 They're interviewing straight soldiers.     
 They want to hear from the other side.     
 Are you crazy?     
 They'll kick you out.     
 I'll be in shadow. 
No one will see my face.     
 How humiliating.     
 All the straight soldiers, the ones saying, "No fags in the military," they get to be out in the open, right? With their uniforms on.     
 Looking dignified.

 Mr. Versace, I'm Brendan Lemon, for  The Advocate .     
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)     
 (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)     
 All we'll see is your outline against the backdrop.     
 And the military police can't force you to tell them who I am?     
 I-I'd never reveal my sources.     
 I also need to make sure that you're comfortable with the fact that this interview will be on the record.     
 Yes.     
 Okay.     
 SCHLESINGER (CLEARS THROAT): On December the Department of Defense, under orders from President Bill Clinton, issued Directive     .  , known as "Don't ask, don't tell," defined as prohibiting homosexual conduct.     
 As a gay man serving in the armed forces, how important is life in the military to you?     
 It's all I've ever done.     
 It's all I've ever dreamed of doing, ever since I was a child. Um... it's my life.     
 That's the only way I can say it.     
 It's...     
 it's my life.     
 Are there gay soldiers currently serving who are open about their sexuality?     
 The majority of gays in the military are closeted and will always be closeted.     
 LEMON: So, uh, I think I'd like to start...     
 Mr. Lemon, would you excuse me for a moment?     
 Absolutely.     
 Antonio.     
 Mr. Lemon, let me introduce you to Antonio D'Amico.     
 - Brendan Lemon. 
- Pleasure.     
 We have been together for    years.     
 If that's okay, I would like to conduct the interview together.     
 Absolutely.     
 Please.     
 SCHLESINGER: What about you?     
 I can't help the feeling that, by talking to you, it's the end of my career.     
 But, honestly, maybe my career died a long time ago.     
 Because... they know.     
 They have never promoted me.     
 I'm a good sailor, but... I'm a good sailor going nowhere, because they know.     
 How do they know?     
 I saved a sailor's life once.     
 He was being beaten to death for being gay.     
 And if I hadn't have been there, if I hadn't have stopped them, no one would ever have suspected me.     
 I did a good thing, the bravest thing I've ever done... and I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about taking that moment back... and letting him die.     
 Just so that people wouldn't know about me.

 I don't know why you keep it around.     
 You never served your country. 
You don't understand.     
 No, I-I don't understand. 
Look how they treated you.     
 You have never believed in anything except yourself.     
 I believed in you, didn't I,     
 - when they certainly didn't. 
- Everything you gave me... the bars, the meals, the men... it means nothing.     
 I want my life back.     
 My real life, my life as a soldier.     
 They don't want you.

 Oh, honor?     
 Oh, please, you're not in the Navy anymore, sweetie.     
 You're a washed-up queer in a shitty job in a shitty condo bitching about how you could have been someone.     
 You're not wrong about that.     
 When I found you that night at the bar, I was there for you.     
 I saved you.     
 You destroyed me.     
 I wish I'd never walked into that bar.     
 I wish I'd never met you.     
 You're confused.

No, you're-you're confused, and you-you can't even see it.
