 ♪ 
 Man :  Uh, one officer rendered, uh, six kicks, and one officer one kick. 
 Man 2 :  It's probably the worst case of police misconduct that I've ever seen in my 27 years of law enforcement. 
 Man 3 :  The four police officers who were videotaped repeatedly beating an unarmed man were found not guilty. 
 Man 4 :  I think it is devastating to the image of this city and especially to our police department. 
 It's going to take years to recover from that. Man 5 :  What happened today with Rodney King was unjust! Woman :  It set off this country's worst riots this century. Rodney King :  I just, I just want to say can we, can we all get along? [crowd clamoring] [sirens wailing] ♪ [door opens] Hey, sorry I'm late. I overslept. I had to take a shower. Hope we can still make the flight. Mr. Simpson, I have to apologize if-if I was staring before. I've, um, I've never picked up a celebrity. Oh, that's cool. I remember the first celebrity I ever met. Willie Mays. [chuckles] Boy, did that blow my mind. He was so great. I was just a kid, but it made me go, "That's what I want to be when I grow up." [quiet laugh] [dog squealing] [dog barking] Hey, what's wrong? What happened to you? Did you step in some glass? Let me see. [dog panting] [clicks tongue] [barks] [dog whimpering] [gasps] [indistinct radio transmission] [exhales] [exhales] [siren wailing] Hey. Officer Riske. What do you got? The female... is Nicole Brown Simpson. She's the property owner. The male is unidentified. Lot of blood. It has a clean heel print. There's also a glove, hat and an envelope. Down that path is a set of bloody shoe prints. They exit through the rear. He's bleeding from the left hand. Nothing's disturbed. It's probably not a robbery. Man : Mark? Yeah? We got to withdraw from the case. They kicked it upstairs. To who? Detective Vannatter. Where are the kids? They're being held at West L.A. Have we I.D.'d the male? What about O.J. Simpson? Anybody notify him yet? We don't want a Belushi situation. Can't have him learning about this from his TV. Riske : There's no media here. This is a double homicide in Brentwood. They'll show. So, anybody have Simpson's address? I know where O.J. lives. I'm Detective Mark Fuhrman, West L.A. Homicide. I was there years ago. Family dispute. It's a few minutes away. ♪ I don't think I've ever been up here before. [doorbell buzzes] Car's in the driveway and the lights are on. Someone's home. I'm gonna look around. Let me try again. [doorbell buzzes] Hey, you should see this. Vannatter : We're gonna need a criminalist to confirm that that's blood. Why don't they answer the door? ♪ [knocking] Hey, uh... hello. Sir, we're with the LAPD. Is O.J. Simpson home? I-I don't know... I don't-- what? Is-is he not in the house? Is...? Um, what time is it? Was there an earthquake last night? 'Cause I heard these crazy, um, thumps. These loud thumps by... Sir? Are you on a substance? [laughs] What? No, um, look, I'm not, like, an official person. I just kind of... I live back here. Sir, we need to speak to Mr. Simpson. Where is he? Oh, wait. He, um, he's in Chicago. You sh-- uh, you should go talk to his daughter. Arnelle? She's... [clears throat] [line ringing] Woman : Chicago O'Hare Plaza. O.J. Simpson, please. One moment. O.J. : Uh, hello? Is this O.J. Simpson? Yeah, who's this? This is Detective Tom Lange from the Los Angeles Police Department. I have some bad news. Your ex-wife Nicole Simpson has been killed. Oh, my God! Nicole has been killed? Back there, there was this loud bang on my air conditioner. Seriously, I thought my walls were gonna fall down. Oh, my God, is sh-- is she dead? Yes. I'm so sorry, Mr. Simpson. I'll be on the first flight out of Chicago tomorrow. I'll be back in L.A. tomorrow. [heavy breathing] What is it? He didn't ask how she died. Got to show you something. It's right here, under the air conditioner. This is a crime scene. Please, stop playing with your food. [boy speaks indistinctly] I'm serious. Please eat. You have 90 seconds. I don't want cereal. Well, that's too bad. That's all we have. I don't like it. Well, tough, eat it. He got puzzles. Oh, no, no-- seriously? Why are your puzzle pieces in your...? Okay. You know what? That's it. You guys are gonna starve. I hope you make it to lunch. I'll be hungry then. Yeah, you should've thought about that. [phone ringing] Yeah. Mama! Marcia, Phil Vannatter. Got a sec? I need your opinion on a double homicide. Mom. Boys, please go get your stuff. What have you got? We've got two victims in Brentwood on Bundy Drive. It's pretty brutal. Brentwood? Nobody gets killed in Brentwood. Well, one of the victims is the ex-wife of O.J. Simpson. Who? Marcia, O.J. Simpson. You know, the football player. Yeah, I have no idea who you're talking about. Marcia, O.J.-- The Juice? He's a movie star. You know, he's in  The Naked Gun  movie. He's the guy in the, uh, the, uh, Hertz commercials. Oh, yeah, that guy. Huh, well, will you just tell me what happened, please? Come here. Let me tie your shoe. Well, there's a lot of blood at the murders. And here at O.J.'s house, there appears to be blood on one of his vehicles. And we can see drops of blood leading into the house. There are also two bloody gloves. One at each location that appear to match. Wow. What were you doing at Simpson's? We were here notifying a family member. We just didn't realize he turned out to be a suspect. Well, it sounds like you have enough to arrest him. This is major. No, no, no. One step at a time. Right now, I just want a search warrant. Just wanted a prosecutor's opinion, that's all. Well, this prosecutor says go get him. Boys, in the car now! [indistinct chatter] [siren wailing] [indistinct radio transmission] [phone ringing] [on answering machine]: Hey, it's Nicole. You know what to do. [machine beeps] Girl [crying] : Mommy, where are you? Why are we at the police station? Mommy, please call back. What happened? Mommy! Please answer! Please answer the phone! Okay, bye. [machine beeps] [sirens wailing] [indistinct chatter] What's going on over there? [officer speaking indistinctly] [indistinct chatter] Marcia : Thank you. Good morning, Marcia. Good morning. Have we heard from the LAPD? Uh-huh. What time does Simpson return? He lands at LAX around noon. Oh, Westwood Flower Garden called. They want to know if the baby tulips can be peach, not pink. Your lips are moving, but I don't know what they're saying. Lynn's baby shower. Oh, Jesus! Today at lunch. What time am I supposed to be going? Marcia, you're not  going. You're throwing it. Well, not anymore. I'll tell her. She'll understand. And Gordon's lawyer called. He... I don't have time for this today. Got it. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Tell Gil I'll be right over. Uh-huh. Man : What time did he fly to Chicago? 11:45 p.m. What time do you ballpark the murders? Between 10:00 and 11:00. The male, Ronald Goldman, worked at an Italian restaurant nearby. He was 25, an actor/waiter. He left at just before 10:00. Wow. You think O.J. had time to do it? Well, he is fast. Let's stay on point. What about motive? Don't know. Ex-wife with a younger man? "A warm bath and candles." Was he her boyfriend? It's unclear. He was returning glasses that were left in the restaurant by her mother. "By her mother." That sounds ridiculous. I agree. I've never heard of a restaurant that offers that service. [knocking] In any case, we can assume that the killer walked in on the two of them-- thank you-- or that Goldman walked in on the killing. Crime scene photos. Oh, Jesus. These are really vicious. She's practically decapitated. Lawyer : I just can't picture O.J. Simpson doing it. I met him once at a golfing event. He's the nicest guy. Yeah, I met him. He's charming. Lawyer 2 : He's not so terrific. Simpson has a prior. Five years ago, he pled no contest after he beat up Nicole. Never even did his community service. He just got out, celebrity-style. He raised money for Camp Ronald McDonald. [indistinct chatter] Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Whoa. Sorry. Excuse me, can I get through, please? No, sir. [stammers] O.J.'s expecting me. I'm his friend, Robert Kardashian. I'm sure I'm on the list. There's no list. [car door shuts] Howard! Howard! Howard! I know him. It's okay, Officer. He's with me. Can you believe it? It's like a circus here. I came as soon as I heard. Kris called me. She and Nicole were gonna have lunch today. I know, it's horrible. How is he? He-He's doing okay. He's trying. Where is he? He's on his way. [car tires screech] Is that him? [crowd clamoring] O.J.! Sir, sir... O.J. O.J.! [knocking] It's me. sh1t. Back up! [clamoring] I am his lawyer. Officer : Stay back, sir. [exhales] ♪ What's happening? Why are you here? Mr. Simpson, we're here because of the death of your ex-wife. We found a trail of blood. A trail? Aw, man. God. [quietly]: Aw, man. Mr. Simpson, let's get away from the cameras. Let's go around the corner. Officer : You need to back away. Sir, you need to step back. All right, you fellas want to tell me what happens next? Aw. What are you doing? Howard? Whoa, whoa! Slow down here! Is that necessary? No, it's not. I only wanted him detained. Everybody, just calm down. sh1t. I'm going through a lot here. Mr. Simpson, I am very sorry. [grunts] But we do have some questions about the death of your ex-wife, Nicole. Would you be willing to come down to headquarters? Have a talk? Howard : O.J., O.J. You don't have to talk to them. You're wrong, Howard. If I don't talk, it looks like I have something to hide. Yes, Officer, I'm happy to cooperate. Great. So, what happens now? O.J.'s a suspect. Honey? Honey, where's my Hugo Boss? I swear that girl hides my clothes. I-I-I got nothing to wear! Johnnie. I got a thousand million things to do today. I got to stop by the DA's. Meet with the Taylor family. Do a TV appearance. So I can't dress too festive. I need to be strong, uplifting. Okay, what about lime green? Lime gre-- that would be exceptional. Except... then I got to run out to Neverland. MJ's got some new pile of commotion, so I can't wear lime-- Michael's afraid of that color. I never met someone with so many phobias. [laughs] Nobody said your job would be easy. All right, what about purple? Purple? Well, that would be fine-- no, I don't want to look like no grape. Afternoon, Chris. You finish your investigation of the Taylor shooting? Uh, yeah. I didn't want to just send over the report. I thought it'd be better if we talked in person. Save your breath, my brother. Well, let me explain. Come on, I had your job. I know the drill. The police commission determined the officer acted in self-defense. The officers were scared. There were seven of them with guns up against one mentally ill woman with a knife. Johnnie, I tried. You know all they had to claim was that their lives were in danger. Danger. They shot her in the back. You know, it's remarkable to me how many black folks get shot in the backside while they're attacking. Like they're going backwards and forwards at the same time. Johnnie, I wish I could prosecute. I-- it's terrible. Look, if you check the report, you'll see that I slipped in that the officers may not have been 100% truthful. Oh, please! One sentence nobody's gonna read makes you feel better about yourself? What do you expect me to do?! You know what we're talking about! Choose a side! Look. I know your heart is in the right place. But these four walls, they, they box you in. It's just an endless cycle of bullshit. Can I be honest with you? Always. I hate this place. I mean, I hate S.I.D. I'm thinking of quitting. Good, now you're finally talking some sense. And I know you're capable of more. The world needs more black men willing to make a difference. That means a lot to me. You know, I've always looked to you as a mentor. Indeed. Onward and upward. Now, if you'll excuse me. Oh. I've got to go deliver the bad news to the Taylor family. Fortunately, I've got a plan "B." I'm gonna advise the family to sue the city for police brutality and wrongful death. See, the way things are sometimes, money is the only way to get justice. Hey, uh, take... This is outrageous. Eight 911 calls. The police were called out there eight times. Nicole had a bruised face, black eye, bleeding lip. O.J. broke a windshield with a baseball bat. God, the system failed her. You can't get so upset. You know what really pisses me off? This went on for years. All that battering before he was even arrested. It's the LAPD and a famous guy. Woman : Marcia. Yeah. The tape is here. Vannatter : O.J., when was the last time you saw Nicole? O.J. : Yesterday when we were leaving our daughter's dance recital. It ended at about, uh, 6:30, 6:45, something like that. Vannatter : And what time did you get back home? Oh, 7:00-something. I'm trying to think. Did I leave? You know, I had to run and get my daughter, uh, recital flowers. Then I called my girlfriend Paula as I headed to her house. And Paula wasn't home. What-what did he say? Did...? Did he buy flowers before or after the recital? Did he even go to Paula's house? Shh. Vannatter : And when did you park your Bronco on Rockingham? O.J. : 8:00-something. 7:00, 8:00. 9:00-- I don't know. Around that area. And then I was sitting with Kato. He hadn't done a Jacuzzi, so we went and got a burger. 7:00, 8:00, 9:00. That's not an answer. Guys, lock him to a time frame. Pin him to a version of the story he can't change later. And what about your left hand there? How did you get that injury? Oh, I don't know. Uh... the first time I was in Chicago. Yeah, and then I got back to the house, and I was running around and, uh, I broke a glass. Oh. Yeah. And then one of your guys just called. Uh, actually, uh, uh, I cut it before. Maybe I opened it. But it's no big deal. I bleed all the time. I golf, you know. [chuckling] It's always something. Nicks and stuff, yeah. That's it. Well, I can't tell. Did he cut his hand in Los Angeles or in Chicago? How did he injure himself? This is a fiasco. Why did the cops tolerate it? Gil :  'Cause they're not used to grilling a star. He's The Juice. He rushed more than 2,000 yards in one season. I have no idea what that means. But you know what? It shouldn't matter. He got away with beating her. He is not gonna get away with killing her. Here, Simpson's blood. Okay, but you'll have to wait 48 hours. We need to be super cautious if we're gonna run the DNA. All right. O.J. :  Why don't they just leave?! I told them all the facts! They're acting like I did this or something. I didn't kill her! We know, Orenthal. It's all becoming a big mess! It's just shameful. They should let the family mourn. Male reporter : Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman... Kato : Juice, you need juice? Kato, cut that sh1t out! [reporter continues indistinctly] It's about time, A.C. Sorry, O.J., but that traffic out there is a mother. I'm starving. Is there a lot of people out there still? Packed, right? Is this the cheeseburger? [mumbling] Kato, you like them burgers, huh? Oh, I love them. You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right? Hmm? Yeah. [clears throat] Mm-hmm. You did, huh? Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Good. 'Cause that's what happened. Mm-hmm. See, I need support, y'all! I need lots of support from everybody! You've got it, Juice. [reporter speaking indistinctly] Who called? Any of my friends leave me a message? Hey, Dad, it's that shot again. Reporter : O.J. Simpson in cuffs... Oh, see, now, that pisses me off! They got The Juice in handcuffs! I was handcuffed for five seconds! They ain't got no other footage of me? This situation is very worrisome. What's the lawyer say? I don't know! I don't even know where the hell Howard is. Hey, where's Howard, A.C.?! I-I couldn't find him. Well, find him, man, come on! We've tried. I'm drowning over here. O.J., you need your counsel. 
 
 Woman : Robert, are you a lawyer? Yes. [stammers] Well, I used to be, but not criminal. O.J., is it, is it impolite to ask? No, man, talk to me. I mean, what is Howard's game plan? I don't know what Howard's... That's what I keep telling you. I mean, why'd he let you get cuffed like that?! That's what I'm saying! Why was I cuffed on...? And now it's all over TV! Not only that, why did he let you get interviewed? Whatever they asked me, I talked to them! 'Cause I told them I had nothing to hide! What do I got to hide?! Juice ain't got nothing to hide! Why in the hell were you in there alone? I don't know, man. I don't... These are good questions. So you're saying I need a new lawyer? I'm saying your lawyer should be here. O.J. : That's what I'm saying... [door opens] Oh, come here. Come here. Daddy's gonna take care of things. Reporter : Also, new reports that a bloodstained glove... So Brando came to me, weeping. He said, "My son is facing life in prison. Bob, can you help?" So I'm busy, but it's Marlon, so I go to the DA and explain you cannot prove premeditation. Guns go off. Cut a deal, everyone's happy. His son pled to manslaughter. He's out in five. Oh, look. Look. Oh, enough, Bob, come on. I don't want to be late. We have tickets to the premiere of  I Love Trouble. Hang on. I want to say hi to Ovitz. Mike! Excuse me, Mr. Shapiro? Sorry to bother you, sir, but you have an emergency phone call. Emergency? ["Sadeness (Part 1)" by Enigma playing] Thank you. Robert Shapiro here, who is this? O.J. : Bob, I'm glad I found you. Who? It's O.J. Simpson. [elevator bell dings] We're putting off filing until we get the blood test. Obviously, this sort of makes me crazy. It's ridiculous that he's back in the house. [elevator bell dings] He could be destroying evidence, intimidating witnesses... Marcia... I think we put our best witnesses in front of a grand jury this week. Block them from the defense. Marcia. I want to pair you with Bill. This case is too big for one prosecutor. A partner'll be good. Bill runs a little cooler than you. You're perfect for the case because you care, but I think this'll be useful. You know, little checks and balances. I... understand. And, frankly, you're gonna be drowning in paper. There's no way we're gonna keep up with the defense's resources. Well, nobody is more organized than Bill. I'm here to help. Okay. [clears throat] [phone ringing] Chris : Yeah, things are hopping. But I'm not really a part of it. You know, since O.J. broke, meetings have been canceled, everyone's tripping over themselves to get on the celebrity case. You know, I was thinking I'd take a long weekend. Come up and visit you guys. [laughs] Ah, trust me. Nobody'll miss me. Huh. ♪ Shapiro :  Believe me, Howard Weitzman is a very capable lawyer, but I agree with you. You can't afford any more missteps. In a situation like this, you have to stay ahead of the events. It's the same thing I told Johnny Carson when I represented him. You have to hire the best experts, the top investigators. Already? Yes. And you have to stay ahead of the leads to make sure they don't grow stale. And just so you know, the DA is going to throw all their resources at this. They have a very bad rep for losing cases to the rich and famous. They're gonna do everything they can to win. O.J. has a very good relationship with the cops. They come over for tennis sometimes, uh, Saturday pool parties. That's useful. That's good to know. You know, I wonder... Rob, what do you think of the idea that you join the team, too? You could reactivate your license, and you might provide a special insight to us. Absolutely. I think that's a great idea. Bobby understands me. Kardashian : We've been friends forever. When Kris and I broke up, The Juice was there for me every night. I-I'd do anything for this man. Good. Okay. Okay. Now, there's one final thing. There's something I need to talk to O.J. about privately. Do you mind, Rob? No. Of course. [door closes] Any time that I take on a new criminal case, I always ask the client a question. Now, I won't be judgmental, but I think it's crucial that the attorney and the client are truthful with each other. So anything you tell me is completely confidential and will never leave this room. So... O.J., did you do it? No. I loved her. Don't you hate having to see lawyers? Just makes me sick to my stomach. Marcia : What is going on? Gordon isn't accepting the proposed terms of divorce. He wants to go to trial. Goddamn it! I don't have time for this! Marcia, you filed on Thursday. You knew what you were getting into. Well, I didn't know O.J. Simpson was going to kill his wife on Sunday. You have a lot on your plate. Divorce usually isn't so simple. I know that. I've done this before. Then you know how emotionally draining it is. This could go on for a year. As your friend, I'm worried for you. You're taking on too much. ♪ Man :  Brothers and sisters,  today's guest is the esteemed Dennis Schatzman, lead writer for the black-owned  Los Angeles Sentinel. Dennis, how are you? Todd, I'm not good. I am disgusted with how O.J. Simpson's been treated by the LAPD. He has not been charged with a crime and yet they handcuffed him. They put him chains. Now, let me ask you a question. You remember Jeffrey Dahmer? Oh, yes. Jeffrey Dahmer was a mass murderer. Jeffrey Dahmer was a cannibal. He literally ate people. Well, how many times you see Jeffrey Dahmer in handcuffs? Todd : Come on, now. Schatzman : The black/white double standard endures, brother. Daryl Gates and his nefarious chokehold, guns drawn on Olympic legend Al Joyner, the Rodney King verdict, as affirmed by an all-white jury. Of course we rioted. The LAPD's war against African-Americans has got to be stopped. Todd : Brother, you done touched a nerve. You got the phone lines lit up. All right. Look, I-I-I ain't been this popular since the riots. Famous black man in trouble, the TV shows go down the list: Jesse, Sharpton, me. Oh, are you on the case? No, no. My plate is full. I'm busy with a single mother been shot nine times by LAPD. Nine times? Nine times. Oh... Tragic, typical, but it ain't sexy, so they kick it to the back of the newspaper. Man [over radio] : His lawyer Robert Shapiro is heading his defense team. Robert Shapiro. [chuckles] You know him? Yeah, he's great if you smash your Rolls drunk on Mulholland, but he's a plea bargain guy. He ain't no litigator. What if O.J. asked you to help? Me? Oh, no. No. I like to win. Four... This case is a loser. Three... ...two... ♪ Well, thank you very much for having me. First and foremost, we should all extend our prayers to the Simpson family. You saw him? Yeah. Sunday night, about, uh, 10:45. I was driving to the, uh, Souplantation on-on San Vicente-- they have amazing frozen yogurt-- and then all of a sudden, just out of nowhere, a white vehicle just goes screeching up Bundy, and it was totally crazy. It-it ran right through the red. And me and this other car, we just swerved so that we wouldn't crash into it, and it honked at me. Like  I  did something wrong. [honking] O.J. : Move your damn car! Move it! [tires squealing] The driver was O.J. Simpson. How did you feel that night? I was nervous. Um, at 10:40, I buzzed the gate, but he didn't answer, and I got scared, because I didn't want him to miss his flight, so I called my boss, um, my mom... I didn't know what to do. Then what? Um... just before 11:00, in the dark,  I saw a man go into the house. Anything else unusual? Well, when we drove away, I saw a white Bronco parked on Rockingham. It wasn't there when I arrived. Marcia :  Goldman left the restaurant  just before 10:00. Neighbors start hearing dog barking at 10:15. O.J. screams at the salad bar lady at 10:45. O.J. runs into his house a little before 11:00. Our timeline totally holds together. Bill... I know that you know I wanted this all for myself. But I'm glad we're doing it together. Okay? [breathing] Examiner : What is your name? Orenthal James Simpson. How many years were you married to Nicole Brown Simpson? Seven. Have you ever thought about killing Nicole? No. Do you know the whereabouts of the knife that was used to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman? No. Is the person who killed Nicole in this room? [sighs] I don't think he's holding up. It's like he's not really The Juice anymore. Bob... Hmm? ...whatever happens inside there today, neither of us says a word to anyone. Agreed? Examiner : So... [clears throat] I administered Mr. Simpson a zone of comparison exam. The polygraph measured three physiological responses: heart rate, breathing and electrical sensitivity of his skin. I tabulated Mr. Simpson's answers and responses. He scored a minus 24. Minus 24? What-what does that mean? It's a flunk. It's the worst you can do. There's no way he could have done it. I'm gonna need you on this, Bob. There's no way-- there's no way he could have done it. Of course I failed it! She just died! I'm so emotional! I mean, every time they mentioned Nicole's name, my heart went crazy! All right, calm down. Don't worry. And these things don't work! These machines don't work! Kardashian : We know. That's why we can't use them in the courtroom. We know. This-this was just for us, it doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything. Bob is right. Just to give us, um, something to talk about. Shapiro : And it's not admissible. I mean, every time... What did they think was gonna happen? You ask me that. Somebody say something! What did they think was gonna happen? They're talking about the mother of my children dying and they're asking me these questions! Of course the needle's gonna be jumping! And you two are supposed to be representing me! You're supposed to be in the room. Why am I paying your ass? Come on. Let's-let's take a break from this. Kardashian : I think that's a good idea. [clamoring] [clamoring continues] [muffled clamoring continues] I can't believe she's gone. She was my personal angel. I wouldn't have gone to rehab if it weren't for her. [children running, giggling] Kris : Khloe. Kourtney. Stop running. Put away that candy. Do you... [very quietly]: You think he did it? Oh, Kris. She was terrified of him. I just wish we'd done something. It was right in front of us. He always had that temper. He'd be smiling and then she'd mention some guy and he'd start screaming. Did you ever see the pictures of her face after he laid into her? And you know she hid them away, just in case something happened? [clamoring] Man : You did it, O.J.! Shapiro : O.J., let me handle this. [reporters clamoring] There's your ex. No pictures. Please, no pictures. Please, respect the family. Joe... Who the hell brings their lawyer to a funeral? ♪ [shouting] ♪ He came. He has no shame. ♪ 
♪ Sweetheart, I'm sorry, I-- I can't come home yet. Mommy is waiting for something important. I know, but if you're hungry, have Alba make you some food. [door opens] What? Sweetie, I have to go. I have to go, I'm sorry, I have to go. Well? Do we have him? Yep. The DNA came through. The blood drops at Bundy are Simpson's type and the Rockingham glove matches a mix of Simpson and the victim's blood. Well, thank God. Let's put him behind bars. Shapiro :  Tom, how long have you known me? Look, I know you have a warrant for his arrest, but there's no reason you have to come and get Mr. Simpson when I can bring him to you. And-and let's be clear: no perp walk here. Bob, I'm in no mood for games. I was up all night prepping this paperwork. You have a client charged with double homicide with special circumstances. [sighs] It's-it's 8:30 now. Why don't, why don't I bring him in at noon? What? Why do you need three and a half hours to drive him from Brentwood? 11:00. 11:00! Yes, yes. That's good, that's... I'll bring him in at 11:00, and you have my word, and my word is gold. I'll see you then. [sighs] Your word is gold? [sighs] That was a heap of bad news. They're arresting him, of course, but they're using "special circumstances," which means no bail. He'll be in jail until the verdict. God! Well, is he back at Rockingham? No, no. He's-he's at the hideout. ♪ [doorbell ringing] [rapping at door] Where is he? He's sedated. He's-he's still asleep, Bob. He, uh... he was really upset after the funeral. Shapiro : Juice. Juice... Wake up. It's Bob. Now, look, we've got a lot of work to do today. What's happening? Now, here is where we're at. Now, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we must be pragmatic about these things. Well, what are you saying to me? Honey, what's going on? Paula, go back to bed. They issued a warrant for your arrest. You have to be downtown at 11:00. I-It's fine. No. I'm gonna fix this. No, no! I can't do that, Bob! Look, we're going to... I can't go to jail! Oh... Okay, just-- we'll just work through this together. Oh, God! Now listen to me. It's very important that you understand this. O.J. I can't go to jail, Bob! Yes, you can. And you have to understand one thing: This may be the last time we get to speak without anyone eavesdropping, so if you have anything to say, I'll clear the room. What are you saying to me? [doorbell rings] Oh, who is that? Bob, get out of here. What is that? They're already here? No, they're just friends. They're-they're here to look at you. We have this plan. Let's not do that. No significant wounds or abrasions. What about here, on the torso? I see some swollen lymph nodes. Is there any family history of cancer? Paula : O.J. looks sad. Can he lie down? You let them do their thing. This is best defense money can buy. I want to call Mama. Take a shower. [doorbell rings] [door opens] Kardashian : Yes? Man : Dr. Faerstein. Kardashian : This way. Shapiro : Hello, Saul. Thank you for coming. Would you make it quick? Another doctor? [whispering]: That's Saul Faerstein. Expert psychiatrist. Just in case. In case what? Just in case we need a "diminished capacity" defense. What do you-- what do you mean? Plead guilty? What are you saying, he was, he was insane? I'm saying, we keep our options open. I've got 11:05. He is late. This is unbelievable. We cut him every favor possible. Self-surrender, plenty of time... You know what? Call him. Call him. [line ringing] Shapiro : Tom, I have to apologize. We're a few minutes behind. Lange : Bob, you are in your car? Well, almost. We're-we're about to leave. What? No. No, no, Bob. Do not jerk me around. But he's-he's washing up. He's-he's getting dressed. He's moving a bit slowly. Shapiro! We have a press conference scheduled for 12:00. Marcia's gonna blow a gasket. [dial tone sounds] Mr. Kaelin, do you live on the property of Mr. Orenthal James Simpson? I, uh, I respectfully decline to answer and assert my constitutional right to remain silent. On the night of June 12, 1994, were you in the company of Mr. Simpson? I... I respectfully decline to answer and assert my constitutional right to remain silent. Marcia : Mr. Kaelin, you are a witness, not a suspect. You have no right to invoke the Fifth Amendment, so I am going to ask you again. On the night of June 12, 1994, were you in the company of Mr. Simpson? Lange just called. O.J. has not turned himself in. [door opens] We gotta get you dressed, Juice. Call up the Browns. Tell Lou and Judy I want them to be the guardians of my children. What... what are you doing? This is my will. This is a statement to my fans. This is a letter to Mama... and to my kids. Juice, Juice... a will? It's just easier for everybody. Juice... Juice... This situation has gotten real bad. Juice... Don't! Don't. Come here. Come on. Come here. Come on, Juice. This is out of control. I have left the grand jury to make this call. Where is your client? Shapiro : Marcia, I'm sorry, but he's with a few doctors. He's very depressed. Yeah, well, he should be depressed. He killed two people, he's going to prison. Now what is your location? Here's one of the doctors now. Saul, handle this. Um... Hello? Who is this? I'm a psychiatrist. Who is this? This is District Attorney Marcia Clark. Where are you? We have a warrant for this man's arrest. Now, Doctor, as I am sure you are aware, there are laws relating to the aiding and abetting of a fugitive. If you are not aware of these laws, let me make them clear to you now... Bob, I am not going to jail for this. Marcia, Bob. I am so sorry how this unfolded. I apologize. Do you have a pen? I'll give you the address. We're in Encino. Kardashian : Juice! O.J., no, please. This-this is where my daughter sleeps. Come on, O.J., please. Do not kill yourself in Kimmy's bedroom. Give me the gun. Gi-Give me the gun. Come on, come on. We can beat this thing together, just... W-We all love you. We all love you. Your kids love you. God... God loves you. Juice... Okay, okay. Just... you-you don't want your kids to grow up with-with no parents. You want your kids to lose both parents? [car pulls up] Come on... Look, it's A.C. Juice, it's-it's A.C. Come here! Come here! It's A.C., come here. Come here! A.C.'s here. [gasps] Oh, God! Paula, okay... [sobs] What's going on? No. Just stay with him. Don't leave him. I'm getting A.C., Juice! A.C.'s here! [Paula crying] Jesus Christ. Who are all of these people? Kardashian : A.C.! You gotta come handle this. What? What's happening? It's, uh, come on, it's O.J. He's-he's got a gun. What? He's-he's suicidal.
