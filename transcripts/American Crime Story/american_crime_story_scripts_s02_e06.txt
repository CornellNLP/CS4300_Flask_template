 What do you think?    
 - Oh, it's perfect. 
- Yeah.    
 Oh! Oh.    
 - Be careful. 
- Thank you.    
 GALLO: Happy birthday!    
 Welcome.    
 - Hi. Good to see you. 
- Oh.    
 David, come on in. 
It must be at least ten minutes    
 - since you've had a drink. 
- Oh, what a relief.    
 I was worried we were gonna have to get along.    
 After you.    
 I hope you don't mind I invited a few of my friends.    
 Oh, no, not at all. 
You know I love your friends.    
 Yes, it's been noticed.    
 I might have preferred to have two parties, though... one for my friends and one for yours.    
 Only the Queen of England has two parties.    
 I'm afraid you're not that sort of queen.    
 Oh, Gallo, you're like a jukebox of bitchy hits.    
 LIZZIE: Happy birthday, shmoo!    
 - Hi! Hi. 
- (SQUEALS, LAUGHS)    
 - Thank you for coming. 
- Oh.    
 ANDREW: This whole party is about one thing... getting David.    
 That cute blonde from San Francisco?    
 The man of my dreams.    
 Can I ask... are you officially gay now?    
 You know I don't like labels.    
 Neither do I, but sometimes it's nice to know what's inside the can, especially before you... eat it.    
 - You're disgraceful. 
- Okay, okay.    
 But what are you gonna tell your dream man about this place?    
 - Oh, he doesn't know about Norman. 
- What?    
 - How can he not know? 
- Because I like to keep them separated.    
 I... That's why I wanted to have two parties.    
 But I couldn't not invite David to my birthday.    
 That's why I need you to help me explain to him what I'm doing here with Norman.    
 What are you doing here?    
 I curate his art.    
 I find pieces of antique furniture.    
 Are you sure there isn't something else that you've been curating?    
 Lizzie, that's not even a play on words.    
 - I know. 
- There's nothing sexual between us.    
 Then why can't you tell David the truth?    
 You're a handsome, young interior designer who's living with his wealthy, older client.    
 - I see the problem. 
- God.    
 I-I can't lose him.    
 I-I can't, I just can't.    
 Hey, you've got it bad for him.     
 He's a house.     
 He's a, he's a home.     
 He's a yard and a family and...     
 picking kids up from school. He's...     
 (SIGHS) He's a future.     
 And up until now, I've only dated the past.     
 Who are you trying to be?     
 Someone he can love.     
 (DOORBELL RINGS)     
 (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)     
 WOMAN: Hi.     
 ANDREW: Hi. Come in.     
 - Happy birthday, buddy. 
- Uh...     
 No, come with me.     
 Yeah, I thought we could go on some hikes.     
 Give the bars a rest for a weekend.     
 For the party, I really want you to wear these.     
 (SCOFFS)     
 And you need to give me this.     
 You want me to pretend that that's my gift to you?     
 You know that friend I was telling you about.     
 Oh, yeah. David.     
 He's coming, and I want him to see that I have... really good friends.     
 Well, I am a good friend.     
 Yes, of course you are, but...     
 I...     
 I need you to... to look the part.     
 - What does a good friend look like? 
- I'm not asking you to do anything you don't want to do, I just...     
 I just want a little bit of help.     
 I've helped you with countless guys.     
 (LAUGHS): Okay, but how is this gonna help?     
 I just need him to see that I'm loved.     
 I do love you, buddy.     
 I need him to know that.     
 Okay.     
 Whatever you want.     
 It's your birthday.     
 Oh, uh, before I forget... I told him you're an officer in the Navy.     
 You're a lieutenant on the aircraft carrier the USS Independence.     
 Are you out of your mind?     
 I'm not in the Navy anymore.     
 I'm aware of that.     
 Andrew, I'm not gonna impersonate an officer.     
 But, Jeff, being an officer in the Navy just sounds... so impressive.     
 I know it does.     
 So be in the Navy.     
 Wear those shoes, it's...     
 (SCOFFS) I'll wear the shoes.     
 I won't wear the uniform.     
 ♪ ♪     
 Who are all these people?     
 Friends of free food and free champagne.     
 - (SCOFFS) 
- Hey, he's here.     
 (BACKGROUND CHATTER FADES)     
 David.     
 Oh, I am so glad that you could make it.     
 All the way from Minneapolis, too.     
 That's the farthest anyone has ever traveled to see me.     
 I wanted to see where you live.     
 You've been so mysterious.     
 Uh... happy birthday.     
 You two are adorable.     
 Uh, I'm David.     
 - It's nice to meet you. 
- Hi, I'm Lizzie.     
 Lizzie's my best friend from San Francisco.     
 Oh, right. Yeah. From when you were designing costumes with Versace.     
 We've been, uh, friends for what? Eight years?     
 Uh, we met at a debutante ball.     
 I'm also the godfather of her son.     
 Andrew is the kindest, smartest person I know, and I've never heard him talk about anyone the way he talks about you.     
 Oh, you stop it. She's embarrassing me.     
 I love it. I really do.     
 - You haven't opened it. 
- Oh, I don't have to. It's perfect.     
 I don't think I'll ever open it. 
I just want to look at it.     
 So this is where you live?     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- It wasn't clear from your letters.     
 Is this your home address or your work address?     
 It feels like it should be my home, I've done so much work on it.     
 This is quite a party.     
 Oh, wow. This view is incredible.     
 - ANDREW: Isn't it? 
- DAVID: I want it.     
 ANDREW: We'll have a house like this one day.     
 Maybe this very one.     
 JEFF: Hey, buddy.     
 - Happy birthday. 
- ANDREW: Uh...     
 Jeff. Oh, you shouldn't have.     
 (LAUGHS): That's so kind.     
 And on a military salary.     
 They're from that designer you always talk about.     
 - Uh, Versace. 
- Ferragamo.     
 Versace doesn't make shoes.     
 That would require at least some degree of craftsmanship.     
 - Hey. 
- Oh.     
 I'm Jeff.     
 David.     
 You must be the superstar architect.     
 Ah, not yet. I-I've still got     
 - a way to go. 
- Well, I'm sure you'll get there.     
 You're the naval officer.     
 Well, it's a long story.     
 DAVID: I like long stories.     
 How about sad ones?     
 (CHUCKLES) Yeah, those, too.     
 (SCOFFS)     
 Um, let's move this to the terrace.     
 Yes.     
 I'll-I'll join in a second.     
 Just a little birthday pick-me-up.     
 Cocaine or crystal?     
 I don't do gutter drugs.     
 I have a birthday present for you.     
 - It's a piece of advice. 
- Oh, advice, how delightful.     
 Do I have to unwrap it right now?     
 You think Norman's the lucky one, don't you?     
 But you're wrong; you're the lucky one.     
 - Is that so? 
- Norman's a conservative old queer.     
 He likes the fact that you can carry on a conversation and decipher a wine list.     
 Most men would make it clear that you're an employee, but he wants you to feel like you're an equal.     
 I am his equal.     
 (SCOFFS) No, not even close.     
 - He built a company from scratch. 
- Yes, I know.     
 If you'll excuse me, Gallo.     
 I care about him a great deal.     
 He was vulnerable the night he met you.     
 His lover had suffered terribly.     
 You don't need to lecture me.     
 I volunteer at an AIDS charity.     
 I know all about Norman's partner.     
 You know nothing about him.     
 What it's like to lose a man like that, to watch him waste away.     
 I won't allow Norman to be hurt again.     
 You must be a very unpopular party guest if all of your gifts are this dreary.     
 I don't mind being disliked.     
 Well, how fortunate for you.     
 What a volatile mix you are.     
 Too lazy to work and too proud to be kept.     
 I need to get back to my party.     
 That room is full of people that love me.     
 Then that room is full of people who don't know you.     
 (BOTH LAUGHING)     
 Jeff, is your boyfriend coming tonight?     
 Uh, no. No, he's not.     
 - That's a shame; he's so funny. 
- Mm.     
 Is he still working at that mall?     
 He works for a living, yes.     
 I was just trying to figure out where you sleep.     
 Well, what do you mean? (CHUCKLES)     
 Well, I found a bedroom with a master bed and two mattresses.     
 Norman spends a lot of his time in Phoenix, and I often have to go back to my New York apartment.     
 - Your New York apartment? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 - I thought I'd be sleeping here, but... 
- Oh, you must!     
 I have a couch.     
 His couch is hard and filthy.     
 (DAVID LAUGHS)     
 Uh, let's talk about it later, okay?     
 Who wants more champagne?     
 LEE: Andrew.     
 I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.     
 Oh, you're so kind.     
 Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sure we've met before. I...     
 Lee.     
 Lee Miglin.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 - From Chicago. 
- Yes! Yes, Lee.     
 Of course, I remember.     
 Um, I'll-I'll join you in a second.     
 - If you'll excuse us. 
- Mm.     
 - Sorry about that... 
- I asked you not to approach me.     
 I couldn't wait any longer. 
I've been staring at you across the room for that whole thing.     
 You look so exceptionally handsome...     
 - That's very nice of you, but... 
- No, but I-I had to talk to you.     
 Does that make me pathetic?     
 - I get the drift. 
- I-I got you a birthday present.     
 But I'd like to give it to you in private.     
 - We can arrange a time. 
- Promise?     
 I-I promise. Now, we need to get back to the party,     
 - because I don't want people to talk. 
- Okay.     
 David! I want a picture with David. Photo time.     
 I'd love a photo. Come on.     
 Shouldn't it be a group photo?     
 No, no. I'll-I'll take it.     
 Oh. No, come on, Jeff.     
 - David, come here. 
- Oh, Norman.     
 - Good to have you here. You sure? 
- DAVID: Norman.     
 - Yeah. 
- All right, I guess it's picture time.     
 - All right. 
- I'll take it.     
 - Thank you, Lizzie. Everybody together. 
- Okay. Are you ready?     
 - All right, squeeze together. 
- (CHUCKLES)     
 All the people I love.     
 - Okay, everybody, smile. 
- (CHUCKLES)     
 (CAMERA CLICKS)     
 You're so cute! (LAUGHS)     
 NORMAN: What's this?     
 A list of requirements.     
 If we are going to stay together.     
 List of requirements.     
 Increased living allowance.     
 First-class flights.     
 International and domestic.     
 Of course. A Mercedes SL   ?     
 It's the car of my dreams.     
 And you wish to be written into my will as my sole heir.     
 Well, we've been together for over a year.     
 I've devoted my life to making you happy.     
 I've made enormous sacrifices.     
 What have you sacrificed?     
 Love.     
 Whose love?     
 My parents' love.     
 Ah. Yes.     
 The New York millionaires.     
 They disinherited me when they found out I was living with an older gay man.     
 Andrew, do you know how I became successful in life?     
 By working very hard.     
 And by doing due diligence.     
 Okay, what are you saying?     
 I'm saying that your name is not Andrew DeSilva.     
 It's Andrew Cunanan.     
 Who told you that? That's not true.     
 Two years ago, you were working in a Thrifty drugstore.     
 - That's not true. 
- Earning $ .   an hour.     
 - That's-that's not true. 
- Living in a small condo with your mother, Mary Anne.     
 ♪ ♪     
 Andrew.     
 You investigated me?     
 You investigated me.     
 We didn't meet by chance, did we?     
 You knew which books I liked, which music.     
 You researched me, and you pursued me.     
 You're not my prisoner.     
 You're not even my partner anymore.     
 When's the last time we were intimate, three months ago?     
 If you give me everything on that list, s*x can become more regular.     
 Andrew, I will increase your living allowance.     
 God knows you have no savings, because every dollar I give you, you spend on other people.     
 But as far as the first-class flights, no.     
 I'll pay for you to return to college and to finish your degree.     
 (SCOFFS) I already have a PhD.     
 No, you do not have a PhD.     
 You started a history major at UCSD, and you quit after a year.     
 I'm not going back to school!     
 It's-it's insulting!     
 What is it about having an education and the idea of work that you find so insulting?     
 It's ordinary!     
 Andrew, you're smart.     
 But being smart is useless unless it's in the service of something.     
 I want that list.     
 Or I'm leaving.     
 (SIGHS)     
 You've made a beautiful home.     
 I want you to be happy. I really do.     
 And I don't mind that you tell a few lies to smooth over the discomfort of this arrangement.     
 Hell, I-I can allow you all of the lies that you want.     
 EXCEPT FOR ONE: that I'm a fool.     
 Do you get that I probably lost the love of my life by living with you?     
 That handsome young man at the party.     
 David.     
 Hmm.     
 Oh, boy.     
 Tell me something.     
 If I make you my heir, would you still want me around?     
 Or have you already started dreaming of the day that I'm not here?     
 You can have this life.     
 You can have it for yourself.     
 If you work for it.     
 But if you don't, you must share it with me.     
 There is no third way.     
 If I can't have love, I want that list.     
 So is it a yes or a no?     
 No.     
 Fine.

 Hey, Dad. What's up?     
 Uh, who sent you a postcard?

 Sure. Sure.

 Oh, he'll come around.     
 You had a good thing there.     
 He had a good thing.     
 Did you send my dad a postcard?     
 - What? 
- To my home address in DeKalb, Illinois. Addressed to Stan Trail.     
 You signed the postcard "Love, Drew." You don't remember that?     
 Uh, I-I...     
 I remember sending a postcard. I...     
 My dad called me asking who you were, why you signed a postcard "Love, Drew,"  and why I'm buying you expensive shoes.     
 How funny.     
 What did you tell him?     
 Did you do it deliberately?     
 What, send your dad a postcard?     
 Kind of felt like a threat.     
 A threat?     
 - It was a mistake. 
- You're lying.     
 You want to tell my parents I'm gay? Is that it?     
 Why would I want to tell your parents that you're gay?     
 They probably just assumed that you gave up your great naval career to be a faggot.     
 Stay away from my family!     
 Don't talk to them, don't write them, don't call them! Do you understand?     
 You're hurting me!     
 I'm sorry.     
 I never thought that you were capable of being violent.     
 Ever.     
 Certainly not towards me.

 In Minneapolis.     
 Minneapolis.     
 - It's not 'cause of David. 
- Mm, just by chance then.     
 Is that it?     
 Just a random pin that you put on a map?     
 You just pulled the letter "M" out of a Scrabble bag and thought to yourself, "Oh, well, it's, "well, it's either gonna be     
 Memphis or...     
 "Minneapolis."     
 David told me about the company, but he's not the reason I'm...     
 Jeff, the guys you've had, the-the guys that I found for you, and you are trying to steal the one guy... the only guy... that really likes me!     
 I'm moving for a job, okay?     
 I'm moving because it breaks my heart every time I pass the harbor and see a naval ship.     
 I'm moving because I'm unhappy, and I'm tired of being unhappy.     
 I'm leaving.     
 I thought you should know.

 All expenses paid. We'll stay at a five-star hotel.     
 I already bought the ticket. I'm gonna FedEx it over to you.     
 Andrew, I wish you hadn't bought the ticket without talking to me.     
 You won't have to take any time off of work, and I won't take no for an answer.

 You don't need to buy these for me.     
 Shh. I am buying it.     
 If you don't want it, you can throw it away, but I am... buying it.     
 (CREDIT CARD MACHINE CLACKING)     
 Thank you.     
 Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.     
 Thank you.     
 Thank you, sir.     
 (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)     
 I owe you an apology.     
 For what?     
 I shouldn't have come.     
 All this...     
 it's too much.     
 Uh... I-I'm gonna pay for half.     
 Please stop. Put-put that away.     
 Andrew, I'm not the one.     
 I'm sorry.     
 Hmm.     
 You are the one.     
 Yes, you are.     
 I know that I... overexaggerate sometimes, but not about this.     
 David Madson, you are the only one I have ever really, truly loved.     
 We had a great time in San Francisco.     
 One great night, and-and maybe there was a chance, but...     
 I get the feeling you don't have many great nights with people.     
 Am I right?     
 So when you do, it feels huge, feels life-changing.     
 It did change my life.     
 This meal, this hotel, this weekend, it... it's like you're trying to recreate our first meeting.     
 Oh, it's like we're stuck on a first date.     
 You know what I mean?     
 So then, why did you come out here?     
 I haven't traveled much.     
 You called me up. 
I was... I was excited.     
 So, you didn't come out here for me at all?     
 Yes.     
 I wanted to see if we could take the next step.     
 And you don't believe we can do that?     
 I wasn't sure.     
 S-So?     
 So... know me. Get to know me.     
 What, what-what do you want to do? I'll do anything.     
 We get rid of all this.     
 (DAVID SIGHS)     
 Okay. Yeah. (LAUGHS)     
 - Uh... 
- Okay.     
 - The truth? 
- The truth.     
 Your parents... who are they?     
 My dad was a stockbroker.     
 He made a fortune.     
 He was listed in California's top     brokers.     
 Uh, he worked at Merrill Lynch, and when he left them, he returned to the Philippines to run vast pineapple plantations.     
 And your mom?     
 She ran a literary publishing house in New York, and now she's retired.     
 Estranged from my dad.     
 Do you get along with them?     
 They love me more than anything in the world.     
 When I was growing up, they'd give me anything I wanted.     
 - Master bedroom. 
- Wait.     
 What? You had the master bedroom?     
 Master bedroom, a credit card, a car of my own.     
 What about your parents?     
 They run a small hardware store.     
 In Barron, just outside Minneapolis.     
 - (SLAPS TABLE) 
- I completely forgot. Sometimes when the food at school wasn't exactly up to scratch,     
 I could call my mom, and she would bring me a lobster dinner, just like this one.     
 She'd have to hand it to me over the gates.     
 I'd share it with all my friends.     
 Your parents must have loved you very much.     
 Next question.     
 Uh, I'm tired.     
 I'm gonna crash.     
 David?     
 I'm a good person.     
 Who wants to be good to you.     
 One day, you're gonna make someone very happy.     
 I know you will.     
 (MACHINE BEEPS)     
 MALE VOICE: You have no new messages.     
 (BEEPS)     
 And we stayed at this beautiful hotel... five stars... and that's where I asked him if he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.     
 - What did he say? 
- He said yes!

 Good afternoon, Mr. Versace.     
 I happen to believe that I am the most generous person that ever lived.     
 What? You don't believe me?     
 I don't have an opinion, sir.     
 Well, what could be more generous than spending everything on other people and being left with nothing?     
 I couldn't say.     
 What could be more generous than finding soul mates for other people and then ending up alone?     
 People have taken from me... and taken from me and taken and taken from me.     
 Now I'm spent.     
 And they say, "This man, this man has nothing left to give."     
 And a man with nothing to give is a nothing man.     
 That is very poetic, sir.     
 This world has wasted me.     
 It has wasted me.     
 While it has turned you, Mr. Versace, into a star.     
 Was it the world, sir?     
 Oh, you think you're better than me.     
 Is that it?     
 You think you're better than me. You're not better than me.     
 We're the same!     
 The only difference is you got lucky.     
 Not the only difference, sir.     
 Oh, yeah?     
 What else you got?     
 I'm loved.

 Whenever I cried, my mother would sing this lullaby to me... the same lullaby her mother sang to her.    years later, I sing it to you.     
 And one day, you're gonna sing it to your children.     
 That's how it is with family.     
 I'm not gonna have any children.     
 (MARY ANNE INHALES SHARPLY)     
 What?     
 That's nonsense.     
 Life means nothing without children.     
 How can you not have children?     
 That's...that's no life.

 You remember that boy you went to school with... handsome, but not so bright?     
 - Charley... Charles Walker. 
- Mom...     
 His father was a big shot banker.     
 After college, that boy couldn't get a job.     
 Even with his big shot banker father pulling all of his     
 - big shot banker strings. 
- Hey, Mom?     
 And sometimes I see the mother, who always looked down on me because we didn't have a big house...     
 I'm unhappy.     
 I saw her the other day.     
 I told her... you were making costumes for Italian operas.     
 Traveling the world with the legendary Versace, visiting Tokyo and Sydney and Moscow and Milan.     
 All the places that I have never been.     
 And her face.     
 You should have seen it, Andrew.     
 She was so jealous.     
 Because we always had so little.     
 And they... they always had so much.     
 And their son... (SNIFFS) their son has done so little.     
 And my son... my son has done so much.     
 I gave you everything.     
 But it was worth it... for moments like this.     
 I wish you could stay with me.     
 But I have to share you with the world.     
 (MARY ANNE SIGHS)     
 Okay.     
 So... what city are you visiting next?     
 Minneapolis.     
 They have an opera house in Minneapolis?     
 No, Mom.     
 I don't think they do.     
 (KISSING RAPIDLY)

 Bye, Mom.
