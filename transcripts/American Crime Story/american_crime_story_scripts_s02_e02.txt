 There are no journalists here.   
 There are drugs.   
 The therapies are complex, difficult.   
 But we have options.   
 When I was a child...   
 I had an older sister.    
 Before Donatella was born.    
 Her name was Tina.    
 At ten years old, she became very ill with peritonitis.    
 My parents sent me away to live with my aunt and my uncle while they nursed her.    
 But I couldn't be away from my family for long, so... one day, I ran all the way back home.    
 And when I walked into the house, I saw her, my older sister, in an open casket surrounded by white flowers.    
 No one had told me she had died.    
 Until that moment, I always believed that if you get sick, you can also get better.

 This house, this life.    
 You wanted more.    
 More fun, more men.    
 I understand. That is your business.    
 But why bring him into it?    
 'Cause he chose to.    
 No, he chose you.    
 He went along with it because of you.    
 Because he knew what you were thinking.    
 "Not handsome enough for handsome Antonio."    
 I am not a villain.    
 And he's not a saint.    
 My brother has a weakness for beauty.    
 He forgives it anything.    
 But I am not my brother.    
 But we can agree on something.    
 You knew he wanted a family.    
 Why didn't you give him one?    
 'Cause we're not allowed.    
 You could have found a way.    
 He celebrated your marriage.    
 He shed tears of joy in church for your f*cking union!    
 What have you done but belittle me and criticize his choice?    
 What have you done for him?    
 What have you given him?

 I was never bitter before.

 Hello. I don't have a reservation, and I know it's very unlikely because this hotel has such a great position right next to the oceanfront, but by any chance,

 Have you ever been?     
 To Nice? No.     
 It's beautiful. You should go sometime.     
 I hope to go back soon, maybe raise a family... but first, I need to make my way in the world.     
 I'm a fashion student... I traveled all the way here just so I can share a few words with Mr. Versace.     
 I hear he's very open to having conversations with young, aspiring students.     
 - A fashion student? 
- Don't judge by the clothes.     
 I don't have a dollar to spend on them.     
 But I think Mr. Versace will find my conversation very excellent.  
 I would say, "Sir",  "nothing is more inspiring to me than that one outfit that Carla Bruni wore."     
 It was a skirt of crinoline, like a giant floral handkerchief, fastened with a gold belt, and daringly mismatched with a denim shirt.     
 I don't know much about crinoline or Mr. Versace, but how does $  .   a night sound?     
 Cash only. Paid in advance.     
 No exceptions.     
 Are you saying that some people actually leave here without paying?     
 All the time.     
 I chased one man.     
 Ran two blocks.     
 - Did you catch him?

 EVANS: Andrew Cunanan,    years old. He's killed four men.     
 His murder spree began in Minneapolis.     
 Next murder was in the countryside by East Rush Lake.     
 Third victim was in Chicago.     
 The fourth man was in New Jersey.     
 - Why do you think he's now in Miami? 
- We don't know where he is.     
 Well, he's made the Bureau's Top Ten Most Wanted, which means right now, every FBI office in the country has agents looking for him.

 We could visit these places in a day. I'm happy to take you around.     
 Let's get the flyers out, meet the bar owners, community leaders...     
 All right. Detective... (CLEARS THROAT) you haven't read the case files, but Cunanan won't be a regular tourist.     
 He's a predatory escort, which means he's going to target closeted, older, wealthy homosexuals.     
 Now, I've been told that bars in Fort Lauderdale serve those kinds of men.     
 So, you don't want to canvass South Beach as well?

 I'm worried, Gianni. 
Our shows were the future once.     
 When did I become the past?     
 People see the same models, and they say the same thing.     
 "Versace, great, masterful, but I know this guy.     
 I knew him ten years ago, and here he is again."     
 Donatella, I get better every day, stronger.     
 It's a miracle.     
 Maybe one day, I will tire of being thankful that I'm alive.     
 Maybe one day, it won't seem like a miracle, and I will be able to produce a show as dark and as morbid as you desire.     
 But until that day, life is special.     
 Life is precious, and that is how I feel.     
 And my shows must be about what I feel.     
 If not, they are about nothing.     
 Do you really think people will hear those words when they see your clothes? They won't.

 We're family, it's okay to fight. We'll fight.

 Not a virgin bride, a Versace bride.     
 She will be a woman who's loved many men before.
