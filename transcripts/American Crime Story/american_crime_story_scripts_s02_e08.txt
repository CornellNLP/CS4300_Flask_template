 Ciao.   
 Gianni.   
 Come with me.   
 I see you watching me work.   
 There is no need to hide.   
 Let me see.   
 FRANCA: Mm.    
 I wanted to be a doctor when I was your age.    
 My father told me, "That's no job for a woman."    
 So I became a dressmaker.    
 At the same time, I vowed I would never tell my children what job they should do.    
 You must do what you love, Gianni.    
 What you feel inside here.    
 But it takes hard work and practice.    
 You must learn how to sew, how to understand the fabrics.    
 I'll teach you, if you want.

 It's beautiful.    
 We make it for real.    
 Yes?    
 I can't. It's too hard.    
 Success only comes with hard work.    
 Many hours, many weeks, many years.    
 And it's never easy.    
 But that's all right.    
 That's why it's special.

 INTERVIEWER: Modesto Cunanan.     
 Please, everyone calls me Pete.     
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)     
 Frankly, uh, we don't call in to interview many candidates like you, at least not to be stockbrokers.     
 - Like me? 
- Uh, night-schooled.     
 You've really pulled yourself up by the bootstraps, haven't you?     
 - Yes, sir. 
- TEACHER: Andrew Cunanan?     
 Right this way.     
 MODESTO:  Gentlemen, I'm aware that you have a long line  of eager Ivy League educated young men queuing up to be brokers at Merrill Lynch, but ask yourself, how many of them started from nothing?     
 Can you tell me why you want to come to Bishop's?     
 Because it's the best school in California and one of the best schools in America.     
 - Who told you that? 
- My father.     
 Mr. Cunanan, can we talk a little more about business and a little less about your biography?     
 But biography is business.     
 My life is a tale told in dollars.     
 I was born in Baliuag village, the Philippines, in a house any of you gentlemen can buy with the money in your wallets.     
 I served in the U.S. Navy for $   a month, not for the money, but for the opportunity to live and work in the United States of America, the greatest country in the world.     
 - We thank you for your service. 
- Yes, thank you.     
 No, sir. I thank this country. I thank it every day.     
 Because after I arrived, not far from the Navy docks,     
 I bought my first home. 
$  ,   , it cost me.     
 A few years later, I moved my family to an $  ,    home.     
 Now, is that biography or business?     
 Because I will tell your investors that's what I plan to do with their money.     
 I will cross oceans with it. I will take it to new lands.     
 I'm talking about growth they can't imagine.     
 TEACHER:  If you could have one wish,  what would it be?     
 A house overlooking the ocean, two Mercedes, four beautiful children, three beautiful dogs, and a good relationship with God.     
 Is that one wish or five?     
 - Did I make a mistake? 
- No, not at all.     
 I'll ask it again.     
 Andrew, if you could have one wish, just one wish, what would it be?     
 To be special.
