 Previously on "Chasing Life"... 
 You're like the first person I've ever dated that I can actually see a future with. 
 How long since you've been diagnosed? 
 About a week. 
 How did your family react to the news? 
 I haven't told them yet. 
 Hey, Stan? 
 I quit. 
 This was just a lot all at once. 
 Thomas Carver. Any relation? 
 My dad. 
 This is really gonna help the campaign, Mr. Hendrie. 
 Danny: Hendrie was here? 
 April : Yeah, I saw him in the elevator with his obnoxious son Leo. 
 I have a pitch for my first piece... 
 Bruce's son Leo. 
 Lawrence : We can't go there. Why? Leo Hendrie is off-limits. Have you thought about going to a support group? April : I'm not really the support-group type. I know I haven't stopped by in a while. You all probably thought I died, which is... funny, 'cause it could be true. For those of you I haven't met, I'm Leo. Um, the tumor on my brainstem is Leo Jr. (People chuckle) He's a little too shy to come out and say hello right now. But don't worry, he's getting more and more confident every day or... What's the word my doctor used? Aggressive. Grade II astrocytoma, which as it turns out is a good grade, so I'm proud of the little guy. (People chuckle) For anyone who knows my family... Well, let's just say my dad recently decided to drop our... Small brood into the public spotlight. And while I'm used to microscopes at this point, having spent so much time looking at my own brain through one, the scrutiny of my dad's decision has made dealing with Leo Jr. even... worse than the last time. Anyhow, moral of the story: Don't get a brain tumor, kids. They suck. (Murmuring) Man : Right. (Applause) (Woman sighs) I have a question. My fiancé has decided to shave his head  in solidarity with me... Man #2: Nice. But he does not have the face for it. (Laughter) How am I gonna break that news to him? You know? (Chattering) So you're not the clerk from Bloomies. (Clears throat) Excuse me? That's what I thought at first. I mean, you look so familiar and just check out what you're wearing. Then it hit me... Parking garage outside my dad's office. You're the reason I dropped a grand fixing my bike. I think you've got the wrong person. Then I saw you again at "The Boston Post." In the elevator? Which means you're here to get the big scoop on Bruce Hendrie's cancer kid, aren't you? I... No, unfortunately for you... (Whispers) I never forget a face, (Normal voice) Which is surprising, I know, considering... (Chuckles) Now I'm not a religious man... I didn't... But I do think that stalking someone at an anonymous cancer support group will definitely earn you a spot in hell. I'd have to check the Bible first and get back to you, though. Leo, just let me explain. Are we on a first-name basis? Oh, I didn't catch yours. I'm just... One letter, I'm a really good guesser. You've got it all wrong. Really? (Scoffs) Or "rhymes with" could work. Anything. I'll find out who you are, and so will my dad. Only the guilty run! ♪ You bet your soul, honey ♪ 
♪ you bet your soul ♪ 
♪ just right ♪ 
♪ You could stay all night and never wanna go home ♪ 
♪ 'cause we can't stop ♪ (Alarm clock beeping) Brenna : April. (Alarm stops) April. Wake up! April. What are you doing? Your alarm's been going off for like the past 20 minutes. What, are you drunk or something? (Sighs) Yeah, I'm stealing a move from your playbook. Wait, really? No, I just feel tired... And late. God, I'm so late. (Door opens, closes) You're welcome. Sara : You've got to stop worrying about it. (Beth chuckles) The point is you have all the time in the world. Who are you talking to? Hey, dude. What are you doing here? It's 7:00 in the morning. I'm used to opening a coffee shop at 5:00 A.M. every day, so this is like... lunchtime for me. Beth is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, and I was reminding her... Use this time for some positive identity building. You know, your mom's not bad with the advice. I can see why she charges so much for it. This is caffeinated, right? Sara : Yeah. Were you up late, honey? Oh yeah, just working on this last-minute rewrite. Uh, I'm... I'm okay. Beth, promise me you'll get my daughter out and make sure she has some fun. As long as you promise me you're gonna take that tango class tomorrow night. What tango class? Oh, your mom booked a class at this dance studio, but she was thinking of not going. Why? You've been talking about learning tango for years. Why wouldn't you go? 'Cause I signed up with Ben as my partner. Now he's not in the picture anymore, I can't go alone. You know... Both : Two to tango. Right. What about grandma? She's at her bridge tournament in Baltimore. It's fine. Then I'll do it. Really? You were just saying I need to take a night off. Why not? Well, you don't want to spend your free time with your mother. I'm sure you'd rather go out with your friends or go on a date with... Stop. The only person I want to have a date with tomorrow night is you. Just one thing, though. What? Do we have to clench roses in our teeth and stare at each other? 'Cause that might get a little weird. (Laughs) I really lucked out in the daughter department. Mmm. Bye. Beth : Bye. Are you really okay? It's not the C-word is it? No, I'm just... I'm tired, and I'm late for my biopsy thing. You mean the thing where they screw a needle into your hip bone and suck out the bone marrow? I'm coming with you. No, you are staying and you are gonna figure out what you wanna do with your life. I can totally handle this on my own. The only C-words I am worried about today are caffeine and concealer. (George speaking softly) Uncle George? I'm sorry to interrupt. Yeah, okay. Would you excuse me for a moment, okay? I'll be back. Uh, April, I'm in the middle of a consult. I showed up at Mass Medical and they said you left. Well, I assumed you were blowing it off, as per usual. I wasn't, I promise. I slept through my alarm, and then because I overslept I missed the train. Right. Well, sorry. You're just gonna have to reschedule. But I got myself all psyched up. And today's supposed to be a slow day at work. All right... no, wait. Why'd you oversleep? What do you mean? I work hard, I play hard. I get tired. Or it's a symptom. You had any nosebleeds, bleeding gums, fainting spells? No. The severity of the symptoms lets me know just how rapidly the cancer is progressing, which would definitely change some things. Like what? Like you working at all. Then it's a good thing I feel fine. (Scoffs) I... Gotta get back to my consult. Do me a favor: Go see the nurse and reschedule as soon as possible. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Yeah, and April? Next time don't be late. (Sighs) (Knocks) You wanted to see me? You're a staff writer, right? Uh, yeah. Oh, okay. I was confused since we had a staff meeting this morning and you weren't here. Sorry, I had a doctor's appointment. It's funny. I think the only time I've taken off work for health reasons was when I had to have my appendix taken out. Actually, no. Wait, I did that on a Sunday. Did you need anything else? Yeah. I need you to look over my notes from the Waterfront Union piece. Double-check my sources and cross-reference the facts in case I missed anything. Shouldn't legal department do that? But you're so great at it. And get it done as soon as possible. I want you free to proof my piece on Bruce Hendrie. We already ran your Hendrie piece. Not that one, a new one. The one I'm gonna write tomorrow night after his campaign kickoff party. Just got my (singing voice) press pass. I'm sure there are gonna be some stories. These kickoff events can get pretty wild. (Laughs) I still remember Obama's. (Whistles, laughs) It was amazing. Every sentence, every word. And the stuff that he's saying about the effect of capitalism on modern romance... Wow. I can't believe you read my dad's book in, like, two days. I can't believe I haven't read Thomas Carver before now. I guess it's my own fault for... avoiding anything other people tell me is good. One of these days I'll learn to embrace pop culture. (Sighs) Speaking of pop culture. Friends of yours? Do they look like friends of mine? They go to my school. Brenna! (Chuckles) Hey, I'm Greer. Sorry to interrupt, but I've sent you like a dozen emails on that history assignment we're supposed to do together. Yeah, sorry. I have a really narrow spam filter. (Laughs) Uh-huh. Well, since you're here now, how about we set a time so we don't encounter any technical difficulties? Umm, wanna say... 4:30-ish tomorrow? Also, let's meet here. Our kitchen's being renovated, so it's really loud at my place. Fine. Great. (Mockingly) Oh my God, don't you just hate kitchen renovations? (Chuckles) Welcome to private school. At least she's cute. Don't get any ideas. She's gay. Oh, now I'm getting a lot of really awesome ideas. Shut up. (Chuckles) ♪ Even when the heart don't try to ♪ 
♪ I still like you... ♪ (Elevator dings) Danny, where are you going? Taking the stairs. I don't need to spend the next 60 seconds of my life trapped in an 8x8 cube watching you guys exchange longing looks. (Elevator dings) (Exhales sharply) (Chuckles) So how was your day? Taking it home with me. Ouch. I'm just trying to clear my plate in case I can score a press pass to Hendrie's campaign kickoff party tomorrow night. Well, if I thought you could be mistaken for me, I'd give you mine. You're going? No, my editor wanted me to. He asked if I wanted to write a piece on the fashions of the evening. I mean, I know I work for Arts & Leisure, but I just can't bring myself to care about what kind of twill looks best with... See? I can't even care enough to finish that sentence. God, I'd give anything to get in there. Just eavesdropping on the cocktail conversations alone would give me a few great stories. Don't you have any connections? Mmm... I might have one, but I'm not sure how ethical it would be to use him. Him? Don't get jealous. I won't be if you give me a kiss. (Elevator dings) When you say you're taking work home... Is that limited to those files? (Chattering) Good night. (Soft rock music playing) ♪ Digging up the past ♪

Patient was diagnosed with osteosarcoma on 2-16-10. Achieved remission following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (Beeps) Hey. Wait wait wait. I thought we rescheduled to see you tomorrow. I know and I'll be there. Early. Well, good. So why are you here now? What's going on? I fell asleep on the "T" last night and ended up at Braintree station at 1:00 in the morning. I don't know what happened. I've been sleeping eight hours a night. I'm eating normal. And yeah, I've been working really hard, but it's nothing I haven't dealt with before. Still, it's just like... like... It's like you're... sick? Yeah, well, so how'd you get home? Somebody pick you up or... finally tell your mom? Oh no, I didn't want to tell her like that. Well, I wish you'd called me. I took a cab. I was fine. (Chuckles) Well, you really don't like to let people help you, do you? I'm here, aren't I? So is there anything else I should know? (Sighs) My gums started bleeding. April, you can't lie to me about this stuff anymore. I know, I know, but we'll do the biopsy... tomorrow, and that's gonna change everything. We'll know what kind of leukemia I have and just how bad it is, and then... I can start treatment, right? Right. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for three different kinds of antibiotics to prevent infection. The fatigue you're feeling is the result of anemia, so I'm gonna order a C.B.C. for you, and right now I want you to get a blood transfusion. Blood transfusion? Don't worry. It's not as scary as it sounds, and it will help you significantly. Okay. I'm glad you seem to be You've got to be careful about what you make your priorities, you know? You put the wrong thing first for too long, you won't just be waking up at the wrong train stop. You'll be waking up in the wrong life. (Chuckles) I feel like I already have. (Chattering) (People chattering) Seriously? I thought I scared you off last time... But maybe I overestimated how intimidating I am. Maybe I should start hitting the gym. It's not what you think. Please, just let me explain to you why I'm here. You know what? Hang on one second. Everyone! Hi. Quick announcement before we get started: This chick's a reporter and she's covering my dad's campaign, so don't say anything you don't want blasted on the front page of "The Boston Post." (Murmuring) (Sighs) Just... just let me explain. Hi, my name is April and he's right. I am a reporter and I am covering his dad's run for office, but... I was also diagnosed with leukemia. (Murmuring continues) And that's why I'm here. I found out about this place from someone else. I didn't even know you were sick. But you are? I just had my first blood transfusion. (People chattering) Well, then... grab a seat. Looks like you just started the meeting. Me too. Yeah yeah yeah. So that was pretty intense. (Sighs) Leukemia. Uck! I hear it's pretty tough to treat. Thanks. That's helpful. Well, hey, at least you don't have a brain tumor. Are you seriously competing with me about whose diagnosis is worse? Oh, gear it down. I thought we were cancer friends now... Or at least until one of us kicks it. Okay, you know how I promised to take off my reporter cap as soon as I walked through the doors of this place? Yes. Well, I totally intend to honor that promise 100%. But... Your dad has a campaign kickoff party tonight and I need a favor from someone on the inside in order to get on the list. Well, that is direct. You're right. I'm... I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. You do realize this party is gonna be full of tools in monkey suits whose heads are stuck up their self-important asses, right? Yeah, tools in monkey suits with stories that could give me a scoop. (Sighs) I'll get you in. Seriously? (Laughs) Thank you. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Thank you. You made me feel I just granted your make-a-wish wish or something. You totally did. You did. You have no idea how much this means to me and my career. I just... I'm so... I'm... I have to go get ready. (Laughs) Hey, cancer friend. You know what would be... really great though? Big scoop. What big scoop? The story of a candidate's son with an impending expiration date... That is if you wanted it. You would give me your story exclusively? Find me at the party. I already granted one wish. I believe it's customary to grant three. (Cellphone plays tune, beeps) What's up? Brenna, I need you to do me a huge favor. I need you to take mom to tango class tonight. (Laughs) That's a good one. I'm totally serious. She was supposed to go with Ben, and she's really sad about it. She needs a date, but I have the most incredible work thing that just came up. You always have a work thing. I know, I'm totally gonna be kicking her ass. Come on, help a sister out. I have to finish a project with this girl from school. Mom's class doesn't start until 8:00. What, you need more time to think of other excuses? Yeah, just give me a second. Brenn! Okay, fine. I'll do it. You're awesome. Thank you. Mom's gonna be so happy. That makes one of us. (Chattering) (Phones ringing) Here are your notes... Cross-referenced and alphabetized. Wow, you are... awful happy about that. Sorry, I'm just excited. I love parties. Parties? Oh yeah, I scored an invite to Hendrie's campaign kickoff party. You mean a press pass. No, an actual invite. Well! And how exactly did you manage that? A good reporter never reveals her sources. What are you wearing tonight, by the way? I mean, I wouldn't... I wouldn't want us to clash. Surprise! (Bag rustles) (Drawer shuts) 
 
 What happened to knocking? Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. I just wanted to show you something. Your favorite dress. I thought it might be fun if we dressed up for tango tonight. (Sighs) Brenna didn't tell you. Brenna didn't tell me what? She's taking you. I can't go. (Laughs) Yeah. I'm serious. She has all the details and she's really excited. I'm sure she's not excited, but she's sweet to do it. I'm sorry for the last-minute switch, but I have a huge work thing tonight, actually, I totally need this dress for. How's it look? Wow. Have you lost weight? You're swimming in that thing. It is a little big, huh? Yeah, maybe I'll take it to Stella, see if she can do a rush job. Do you have any safety pins? Oh, April! What? What happened? Oh, uh, I, um... I bumped into a shelf at work the other day. I was walking with Lawrence, and he walks so fast. I wasn't looking where I was going and I just... Honey, that looks painful. hit this metal thing. Do you need some ice? I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I... I really should start getting ready now. I'll call Beth and see if she can bring me something else to wear, but thank you. Have so much fun at tango. (Chuckles nervously) (Rock music playing) So I think we should start our calendar on the year 1347... That's when the outbreaks started... And I think we should lead with the term "black death." It's so freaky, you know? (Cellphone chimes) Brenna? You with me? Yup, "black death." Do you even know what that is? Yeah, it's... (Cellphone chimes) Hang on. This is taking twice as long as me doing the whole project myself. Congratulations. You're smarter than me. That's not what I meant. You're just not even trying here. Kinda defeats the point of having a partner for an assignment. Chill. I'm reading it now. (Cellphone chimes) Seriously? So, you play tennis? Yeah. Why? I was just thinking if working with me was so difficult, how about we battle this out on the court? Loser has to do the project all by herself. Do you even play? I've hit a ball around a couple of times. How hard could it be? I think we should just do our assignment like we're supposed to. (Cellphone chimes) Fine. (Sighs) Okay, screw that. You're on. (Knocks on door) (Giggles) Oh. Yes. So what's this about a bruise? Oh. Oh, that looks nasty. It doesn't hurt, and I'll have Uncle George take a look at it tomorrow. Right now I just need you to help me hide it. (Pop music playing) (Sighs) Thank you. (Chuckles) That's the one. Right? Dominic is going to lose his mind. Actually, that's the great thing... he's not gonna be there. How is Dominic not seeing you in this get-up a good thing? Dominic doesn't know I have cancer. Leo does. The last thing I need is them meeting and sharing stories. Yeah, a good call. Still, though, you'd better watch it. In that dress, even I want to jump you. (Both laugh) (Jazz music playing) (People chattering) (Cameras clicking) I guess you found your in. Dominic, you came. My editor insisted. Apparently, it's breaking news that... Herringbone is making a comeback. Now that I see you're here, I'm glad that it is. You look amazing. I'm gonna get a drink. Sure. There's a bar right here. This one has a shorter line. That's what I heard. From whom? Well, well, well, we meet again. Leo. Hi. This is Dominic. Boyfriend? Um, no. No, co-worker. Nice to meet you, man. Nice to meet you too, Dom. Sorry. Can I call you "Dom"? Just... those dimples made me feel just so immediately comfortable with you. Bam! There they are again. How do you guys know each other? Well, let's see. Bruce Hendrie's my father, so that's how we met. And then we ran into each other again... Maybe she told you about that? No. Didn't tell me anything. Well, let me say it was at the weirdest place. The hardware store. Yeah, she was... yeah, she was buying a... Chainsaw. Don't really know what that's about. But if I were you, I'd start sleeping with your eyes open. But if you're just "co-workers," I guess you don't have to be worried about how you're sleeping. Leo, when did you want to sit down and do that interview we talked about? After. I promise. Nice to meet you, Dom. You're interviewing Leo Hendrie. It was his idea. Wow. (Mimicking) "I'm April Carver. I'm adorable and people just throw exclusive interviews at me. I don't even have to try." Spot on impersonation. Water, please. So what's your angle going to be? You are just gonna have to wait for the front page like everyone else. Woman: And for you, sir? Scotch.

Oh man, that guy must have such a warped sense of what's funny. They laughed at every single thing he's said. That's what I'm going to have to do when I finally get to talk to him. (Cameras clicking) And that's what I'm going to have to do right now with Raquel. Let's hear your fake laugh first. (Mock laughs) That's how you laugh at my jokes. Gotta go. Raquel, hi. I love your dress. Love yours too. I think I almost bought it, actually. I can't remember. It was a really long time ago. April, I don't think you've met Sanya Badal, Bruce Hendrie's campaign manager. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. April is the writer with the invitation I told you about. Oh yes, who invited you again? It was Leo. He's giving me an exclusive, actually. An exclusive? That's what he said. I just spoke with him five minutes ago and he didn't mention a thing. Seems like there may have been a miscommunication. (Humphs) Everything okay? (Microphone feedback) Leo : Ladies and gentlemen, Now is the point in the evening where we bum you out. No, we're not gonna ask for donations... Yet. (Laughter) But seriously, I'd like to talk about something that's come up since my dad decided to run for office a few weeks ago... A little something about the size of a walnut  lodged in the back of my brain. That little guy I'm talking about made his debut six years ago as a benign tumor, Make a comeback. I know, I know. Like I said, "bummer." But I totally survived it the first time. And the real reason I'm telling you about this now is to point out that the first thing my dad did when he learned about my relapse was ask if I wanted him to drop out of the race. And my dad is one of those rare men who have their priorities in order. That's why I told him that he couldn't drop out of this race. Massachusetts needs a governor like him. The honesty... and care that my father, Bruce Hendrie, has shown me is the same care and attention that this great state needs. (Applause) Oh no. That wasn't your big exclusive, was it? (Angrily ) Why did you do that to me? (Humphs) A little narcissistic, are we? What? Well, let's see... I just told a room full of reporters that I had a brain tumor and you're making this about you. No, I'm not. I just... Why would you tell me I could break that story if you were never planning to give it to me? You showed up to a cancer support meeting looking for an invite to a party. I was hoping that my double-cross might make you rethink your priorities. But why go out of your way to manipulate me like that? Especially when you know that... I'm sick too. Oh yeah, keep your voice down. You don't want people to know the most important thing about you! It's not the most important thing. Well, if you're saying that, you haven't been sick for very long. You'll see. Look, I know it's hard to hear, but that's the beauty of being sick... There's no room for anything but the truth. Here's some truth: You're an ass. Well, I'm an ass with a new bike that goes zero to 60 in 2.7 seconds, so if you'll excuse me. Yeah, you've really got your priorities straight, living it up on daddy's dime! What? You think he just gave it to me? Bruce Hendrie is a businessman. I had to earn it. What are you talking about? "The same honesty and care that my father, Bruce Hendrie, showed me is the exact same care and attention"... You gave that speech in return for a motorcycle? Ooh... No comment. (Engine starts, revving) (Groans) (Tango music playing) (Chattering) All right, everyone, please find your partner. We're about to begin. (Chattering) (Beeps, rings) (Beeps) Hey, it's Brenna. Leave a message. (Chirps) Match point. One point away from not having to do history homework for the rest of the year. (Laughs) Why are you laughing, loser? Do you mind if I call you "loser"? 'Cause you're about to be. I just got hustled, didn't I? Admit it, you're a hustler. Sorry, not sorry. Hey, the game's not over till it's over. (Chuckles) It's over. (Grunts) Ow. (Laughs) That wasn't even on purpose. Just luck. Amazing. Wait, are you okay? (Chuckles) I don't know. I shouldn't have gone for that shot. I'm way too competitive and you're still smiling. Why are you so happy all the time? What? Because I'm a lesbian, I'm supposed to be all angry like you? I don't know. Oh my gosh! Are you smiling? Yeah. I'm imitating you. (Laughs) Here. (Both laugh) (Jazz music playing) (People chattering) I don't get why he lied to you. I don't get how I messed up such a huge break... Again. It wasn't you. The guy sucks. I don't care if he has cancer. It doesn't give him the right to jerk people around. Maybe he just doesn't care about hurting people anymore. You think? Do you think that's what happens when you get sick like that? You just stop caring about being a good person? I hope not. Well, I feel bad for his family. If this is what he's like to a complete stranger, imagine what he must be like at home. I don't know if I could deal with that. With... With what? (Sighs) Just someone that sick. Maybe you'd feel differently if you were close to them. (Sighs) Okay, this is just getting depressing. We have an important decision to make. What stupid '90s sitcom are we gonna pretend to watch while making out at my place? Actually, I'm just gonna go home. I thought you were coming over. I didn't bring a change of clothes. We'll raid Graham's closet. He's a vegan hipster. I'm sure he wears the same size pants as you, if not smaller. No, I have to be somewhere early. Okay. (Cellphone chimes) (Beeps) - (Sighs) You've gotta be kidding me! (Sighs) (April knocks) Brenna? Brenna, open up! What are you doing here? I was showering. I just played tennis for like two hours. You're supposed to be with mom at tango! Oh my God. Are you kidding me, Brenna?! I'm so sorry. I forgot. Didn't she call you? I don't know. My phone's charging. You can go look. (Sighs) I can't count on you for anything. Look, this girl and I were working on a history project, and we had this bet... Just stop, okay? I can't deal with any more of your lame excuses. Chill. I'll go to the stupid tango class right now. Just forget it! I'll go. I handle everything else on my own, why not this too? You know, you've been a real bitch lately. Just because you have a job doesn't mean that your life is that much harder than anybody else's. Sorry to say it, Brenna, but it is. Okay, I'm wrong. What else is new? You wanna know what's new? I have cancer! That's not funny. No, it's not. It's really not. But if you don't believe me, you can call Uncle George and he'll tell you! In fact, I'm gonna go see him tomorrow morning for my first biopsy, so he can tell me exactly what my chances are of not dying! (Crying) Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go make sure mom's okay at her stupid tango class. (Soft rock music playing) ♪ Does it matter if I can't ♪ 
♪ clear my mind ♪ 
♪ there's a right and a wrong time ♪ 
♪ woe is me ♪ 
♪ sentimental you ♪ 
♪ and faithful me ♪ 
♪ I will be the one to gaze on you ♪ 
♪ discreetly ♪ 
♪ slow your speed ♪ 
♪ turn yourself around ♪ 
♪ and follow me ♪ 
♪ 'cause I will be the one ♪ 
♪ who preys upon you sweetly... ♪ Brenna? ♪ On a ladder from there to here ♪ 
♪ I'll climb ♪ 
♪ all this clatter between my ears... ♪ Oh, hey, you're up. I'm on my way to a job interview and I need a pep talk from your mom. She left already. Baby, you all right? Is this about the biopsy? I'll cancel my interview. I'll come with you. No, no, you need a job, and I'll be fine. What is it? Brenna knows. Oh. We were in a fight and it just came out. (Sighs) You know, I thought I had everything under control, and now I just feel like I can't do anything right. We're barely into this new chapter of your life. It's bound to be a bit confusing. How about debilitating? Of course it is, Trust me. I really hope you're right, because right now it... Doesn't feel like it. Hey. Good morning, kiddo. How you doing this morning? Just ready for this to be over. So are we waiting for anybody? What do you mean? I didn't think you'd want to go through this by yourself. It's okay. I'll be fine. Okay. Lay on your side. And pull your legs up. (Soft rock music playing) Just gonna numb this area with some Lidocaine first. You might feel a slight sting and burn. Okay. Okay. (Door opens) Am I too late? (Door closes) George : You're right on time. (Mouths) (Sighs) You're gonna feel this now, okay? (Breathing shakily) Here we go. (Inhales sharply) (Crying) (Sighs)
