 Previously on "Chasing Life"... 
 My mom thinks I'm at work. 
 Sweet. Let me grab you a beer. 
 Have you been drinking? 
 I just want this to stop being awkward. 
 Can we just call a truce? 
 You don't get to be the one that calls a truce. 
 It's not the right time. 
 Sara, there will not be a right time. 
 The thought of losing you to the tumor was tragic. 
 But the thought of losing you like this is just stupid. 
 So glad I was able to convince you to sit down for a drink. 
 Feeling restless professionally. 
 Maybe it's time for me to move on to the next thing. 
 You are in perfect health. 
 Does that mean I'm good to donate? 
 When the time comes, you're the man. 
 (Music playing) 
 Is that really how much bone marrow they have to take? 
 According to Dr. Hamburger. 
 (Laughs) It's Hamburg. 
 I know. 
 So here's to your last night in Boston. 
 I know this trip hasn't been easy, but I couldn't be more grateful for what you're doing. 
 I owe you big time. 
 Hey, what are illegitimate half sisters for? 
 (Chuckles) 
 Crazy that this is what had to bring us together. 
 Yeah. 
 Sort of bummed I have to go back to Florida tomorrow. 
 Really? 
 God yes. 
 There are so many cute guys here. 
 Case in point. 
 Hot bartender at 3:00. 
 Can I get you something else? 
 Uh, thanks, but we're fine. 
 I can see that. 
 You did not just say that. 
 How many times have you used that line? 
 I can't count that high. 
 And does it actually work for you or are you just hoping that one day it will? 
 Oh, so you're a mean girl? 
 You know, I like that. 
 And I like guys that like mean girls. 
 I'm tired. Do you want to head out soon? 
 What? It's so early. 
 Yeah, this cancer stuff has aged me in a super fun way. 
 I'm usually in bed by, like, 11:00 now, so... 
 Want me to call you a cab to get you back to your hotel? 
 My last night in the city? 
 If I go back to my hotel at all, it'll be with him. 
 If he can prove he's worth the effort. 
 On the house. 
 I'm calling it "the mean girl," just for you. 
 Worth it. 
 No, thanks. 
 Ooh! 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Knocking) 
 Who is it? 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Can't remember the last time you knocked. 
 Well, felt a little strange just walking in after, you know. 
 What, our last conversation? 
 Yeah. That's pretty. 
 I've been thinking about what you said, and I don't think that that's... 
 Hey, guys, want to watch a movie? 
 We downloaded it from that series we like. 
 What's it called again? 
 "Saw." 
 We're about to start number four. 
 She liked all of them except for "Ssaw III." 
 Yeah, well, plot problems. 
 I'll watch, until George starts pointing out the medical inaccuracies  as usual. 
 George :  Yeah. "She would never bleed out that fast." "He couldn't conceivably cut off his own leg." Yeah, well, you won't have to endure my running commentary tonight, 'cause I can't stay. And actually, I... I have some news. I wanted to tell your mom first, but... All right, so...  I've got a really exciting job opportunity with the World Health Organization. I'd be running their pediatric oncology outreach unit. Wow. Yeah. I'm really really happy for you. But I have to ask, will you still be able to talk to Dr. Hamburg about my case? Yeah, of course. I'm going to keep in touch with Susan. And at the very least, I'll be able to video chat. Video chat? Well, my job's in San Francisco. What? Yeah. They need me there Monday. So I have to leave by the end of the week. ♪ You bet your soul, honey ♪ 
♪ you bet your soul ♪ 
♪ just right ♪ 
♪ you could stay all night ♪ 
♪ and never want to go home ♪ 
♪ 'cause we can't stop ♪ (Door opens) Congratulations. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tell everyone at once like that. No, it's fine, I just... I mean, I know we weren't feeling exactly optimistic about us after our last conversation, but I didn't think we'd reached any conclusions. I definitely didn't think you'd be making  any big decisions like this. It's not like this isn't hard for me. But I don't know what else to do, really. You know how I feel. Yeah, you feel like I'm letting my feelings for Thomas get in the way of being in a relationship with you. It's not just that... it's not. It's everything. It's... You and I are complicated. And we always will be. Life is complicated. It sounds to me like you're just leaving because you're afraid. Oh, Sara. You're taking the easy way out. God. Honestly, what's wrong with taking the easy way out? Really. Hasn't life been hard enough already? What if we just really commit to trying this? Enough hiding, enough sneaking around, enough dwelling in the past. Are you talking about a hypothetical here? Or is this something that you're actually considering? I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you either. But if this is something that you're serious about doing, then you have to tell me. Soon. So your uncle's moving across the country, your half sister is on a plane as we speak. Tell me, what's your secret to driving people away? Oh, I'm just that annoying. That was my theory. Thanks for confirming. Yeah? And then what did you get for dessert? Carrot cake? Yummers! You love carrots. You're my little bunny rabbit. (Laughs) Ooh, you're bad. Wait, is your boss there? Close the door. Oh, hold on. There's people here. Yes. Yes, there are people here. Like the other person who lives here. So I'm going to give you a gun, and if you hear me talk like that to a guy I'm dating ever, you have permission to put me out of my misery. Um, no guys you would like would ever go for that, even the ones in comas. I love how you say "guys in comas," like, plural. It's not even happening with the one guy who was in a coma. Leo and I never talk about what happened between us before his surgery. I mean, the hospital isn't the most romantic setting. But, I mean, he gets out this week, right? Yeah, his parents set him up with a place in one of their buildings. I'm just kind of nervous to, like, be alone with him again in, like, the real world. What would one of those dating guides say? Hmm. "Boys with brain tumors, the ultimate mind game." (Laughing) Oh, wow. Hi. Hi. Why are you so happy? Did Orin tell you you can start wearing jeans again? You know he hates my butt in jeans. Why does he decide what you wear? Well, I'd rather keep the man than the pants he doesn't like... and it's working! Orin asked me to move in! You mean he actually has his own place? Yeah! And it's great. And he wants me there, like... like, by the weekend. So... so you're moving right away. Hey, yeah. I know this is really hard for you, because I know that you and Graham have been dating for way longer than Orin and me. That doesn't even matter. Sometimes it takes guys longer to get ready for that next step. What? No. No, that's not why I'm upset. I'm just realizing that I have to find a new roommate, like, now. You know I can't afford this place by myself. Yeah, I know. It sucks. Hey, you know, my coworker is about to get evicted. So I'll give her your number. Yay. (Laughs) Eviction! Not a great sign. (Sighs) You know what? Honestly, whoever she is, it'll be an upgrade. So say a guy asks you out, and... okay, he asks me out, and he claims he just wants me to come over to watch TV. That's, like, for sure he just wants s*x and not a relationship, right? Probably. Oh, good! - Aaron:  Carver crushed it. I did? Your cancer piece got the most hits of any article this week. Congrats. I'm impressed. Thanks. So we're making some changes. Readers love the personal touch, and so we're doing away with two sections... "arts" and "calendar." Instead merging to one... "lifestyle." Fewer articles, more personal. Okay, great, because I have this idea for this really personal... You are personal enough. Everybody else, dig deeper. Follow April's lead. What's your niche? Mine that, work together. Like tomorrow night, there's a cancer benefit concert. Cancer, concert. Go. Oh. You mean... Wait wait, you never worked together before? It'll be great. Hey, so that concert... I'm just as surprised as you. I know. So you'll take the lead. I mean, music's your thing and it's... It'll be fine. Totally. I mean, this doesn't have to be... Doesn't have to be awkward. We can handle it. (Brenna talking, indistinct) Guess who's staying in Boston. Surprise, bitches. (Softly chuckles) I thought your flight was this morning. Yeah, I missed it. She spent the night at Tiege's. Who? Tiege. The hot bartender from the Charles. His name's Tiege? Isn't that sexy? So you just decided to blow off your flight for... for Tiege? No, I just didn't set an alarm for this morning. I figured, if I woke up in time, great, and if I didn't, it was a sign I should stay in Boston a little more. It was a sign that you didn't naturally wake up before 6:00 A.M.? I didn't think that hard about it. I'm just sick of Florida. It's boring. I'm between jobs, and I love my mom and all, but I'm so over living with her. So what's your plan? My plan is to hang out in Boston until I don't want to anymore. Tiege told me I could stay at his place for the next couple weeks. Oh, and he's going to give me some shifts at the Charles so I can make some extra cash. A free bed, a new job and a hot guy? I'd stay here for two out of three. Brenna : It's so nuts. Like six months ago, we didn't even know that Natalie existed, and now she's living in Boston. We probably won't see her that much. She seems to have a pretty different lifestyle than us. Yeah, speak for yourself. Well, then you can go to the tailgate parties with Natalie, Mom, because Brenna is still grounded. Oh, yeah, I forgot, I'm still grounded. Thanks for reminding me, Mom. Man, Natalie's staying, George is leaving. When are things in this family just going to be normal again? We should do something for uncle George, like a going-away dinner. We totally should, but I have to get to work right now. Here you go. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Love you guys. I'll see you later. - Bye.  I'm gonna go back to bed. One more week until school starts. Gotta enjoy my last few days of sort-of freedom. (Chuckles) Great. Just when I'm weighing my relationship with George, my daughters tell me they want things to go back to normal. Well, that's understandable. Look at the year they've had... Cancer, lesbianism. What kind of mom would I be if I dropped another bombshell on them right now? I mean, maybe they'd be okay with it though. I mean, they love George, they're sad to see him go, they want me to be happy. There's just no way to know, is there? What do you think? I have no idea. But I guess that's where the old saying comes from. What old saying? "Women who lie down with brothers-in-law wake up alone." Thank you, Confucius. (Knocking at door) (Soft music playing) Oh, hey there. Hey. You're a free man. (Exhales) I almost didn't recognize you without your floral-print gown. Oh, yeah, that was such a good look for me. Here... housewarming gift. Thank you. Wow. Yeah, well, it's a slight upgrade from my last place. But I guess you never came over, huh? No, the only place we've really hung out outside the hospital was the support group and the strip club. And the funeral home. Yes, the funeral home. Seems like we've kind of been doing things out of order. To say the least. (Sighs) Well, maybe we should change that. What would you think about going on a first date like normal humans do? Except for the fact that it'll probably have to be here. Right, because unlike normal humans, you just got out of a coma. So it's a date? 7:30? Tonight? Um, I have to work. Ah. What do you have to do? Nothing exciting. Tomorrow? My family is having a going-away dinner for George. I'm sorry. Okay, now you're just playing hard-to-get. I guess this is what it's like to date you. I should have known. Shut up. I can come over after dinner, if you don't mind starting late? I was just in a coma for months, so I think I can wait a few more hours. Hey. Oh, hey, man. How's it going? (Exhales) April Carver, hey. Hey, Kev. Hey, nice haircut. Did you just watch "Les Mis" or something? (Laughs) Or something. How's it working at "The Sentinel"? Ugh, cheap. At least you two get to work with someone you're sleeping with. Kev. Um... What? Oh, am I talking too loud? You guys still keeping your relationship a secret at work? Kevin. What? Oh, I... Sorry. Ahem. Let's split up. You know, divide and conquer. Sure. ♪ Teeth fallin' out in my dreams ♪ 
♪ I think it means I miss you ♪ 
♪ Sheets tearing up at the seams ♪ 
♪ That's when I leaned and kissed you ♪ ♪ And it's so dry here ♪ 
♪ and everybody looks like rain ♪ 
♪ I could die here ♪ 
♪ with no one even asking my name... ♪ So how did it go? Interviews with the singer and the lead guitarist, but I couldn't get close to the event host... Monica Bradley. There's a whole line of reporters to talk to her. Um, she's actually gonna to meet us right after the show. How'd you manage that? I have cancer. Now she tells me. ♪ I could die here ♪ 
♪ with no one even asking my name ♪ ♪ but I see clear skies ♪ ♪ Pour out your eyes ♪ 
♪ lightning strikes twice... ♪ How you holdin' up? I'm in remission, so fingers crossed. Uh, Monica, this is my colleague, Dominic Russo. Work... We're... Sorry. Sorry. We're covering this event together. Would you mind if I ask you a couple of questions? Not at all. As long as we can sit. Oh, sure. I'm exhausted. (Sighs) So, Monica, you seem to have picked your bands pretty carefully. I was wondering, how did you choose who you wanted to play tonight? Well, I pick bands that play what I like to think is music to fall in love to. I'm always trying to put cancer survivors together in romantic settings... sort of a matchmaking hobby of mine. Why is that? Well, they say being in love can help your chances at remission. It's hard to start a relationship or keep one going after cancer. Often it's easier to date another survivor. Have you found that to be true? I... well, I... Yeah. She's dating a cancer survivor. Uh, Leo and I haven't even been on our first date yet. Guess you guys didn't even need a first date. So he knows about your illness? Yeah, he found out pretty early on. Yeah, the person you're dating should know about your cancer. Dominic. Uh, we were in the same cancer support group. Well, all relationships are tough. That's why I love this event. Because music can bring people together, counteracting the cancer, which can drive them apart. Hi, I'm picking up an order... April! Wow, hey. You really are working here. Yep. I'm a trainee. Apparently it takes a lot of training to learn how to pour things into cups. (Laughs) You want a beer for the road? I could use a little practice pouring into the to-go cups. I don't think you're allowed to do that. Hey. What's wrong? I thought you... I thought you were into him. I was until I starting staying with him. You know how once you have s*x with a guy, you kind of feel obligated to keep sleeping with him? Not really. You know, he's letting me stay there for free. It's not like I can be all, "no, I don't feel like having s*x tonight." Yes, you can. Natalie, if he's making you do things you don't want to do, that's not okay. Oh, stop. I'm fine. Look at the guy. It's not bad to have s*x with him or anything. He's just clingy and sometimes I need my space. You know? You want me to ask my mom if you can stay with us? No. My mom would freak. No offense. I've got some money saved up. I just need to start looking. I'm not desperate or anything. Okay. Good night. Good night. (Tiege whispering) Hi. Hi, are you Beth? Hi, Jessica. I'm Morgan's friend. Hi. You're early. Yes, I know. I'm always early. We were supposed to meet on my lunch break, and I'm just leaving for work, like, right now. Uh-huh. (Both giggling) 
 
 Hey, can you stop running? Yeah, sorry. So I'm really glad I caught you. My day just got crazy. Is this area safe? Looks kind of sketchy to me. But that's okay... I take self defense. Can we go inside? I'm actually kind of late for work. Oh, that's okay. I don't have much time before zumba anyway. Right. So are you neat? 'Cause you know, there's neat and then there's clean. A lot of people don't realize that there's actually a huge difference between the two. Ooh, and we should talk about food. I'll email you a list of my allergies. I guess I'd have time to make salmon if I marinate it this afternoon between patients. Mom, when I said that we should do a dinner for uncle George, I didn't mean that you should have to cook this whole big thing. No, honey, that's okay. We should do something special for him. Well, at least let me help you cook something. I feel like I owe you. For what? Um, almost being kicked out of school, getting drunk with Natalie, breaking into Greer's. Okay, just checking to make sure they were all things I already knew about. How are things with Greer? We haven't talked since that night with her parents. I was kind of assuming that she would try and reach out to me, but whatever. Are you nervous about seeing her next week at school? I'm dreading it. How are you supposed to get over your ex when you see them every day? Honey, I know it feels impossible right now, but you will move on. I mean, look at me. When Daddy died, I just thought that was it. But now I'm feeling like I might be ready to be in a relationship. How would you feel about that? I mean, I know that there were some issues with me dating last spring, but... If it was the right guy. Yeah? How would you define the right guy? Look, Mom, it's Quincy's Kitchen. Isn't that where we took you for your birthday? Oh, yeah. That was good. Yeah, I stop in there sometimes on my own when I'm on that side of town. I guess he's catering now. What if we had him do George's dinner? That way we're doing something special, but we don't have to stress about it. Oh, that's not a bad idea. Good. I mean, it's uncle George. It should not be stressful. Should we just put our quotes together and pick the catchiest one for the headline? Yeah, sure. (Phone ringing) Hey, what's up? You like threesomes? What? Well, my parents hired a nurse for me. His name is Pete. Full-time? Practically. He's like my new life companion. Pete and I watched the morning news together. And let's just say my dreams of walking around naked, well, they've been squashed. Unless you ask nicely, Pete. I don't care what you wear as long as you stick to your schedule. Oh, right, my schedule. My schedule which leaves me zero time to myself. Um, it's okay... I'll just... I'll come over and we'll figure it out. Did you find any good quotes? Yeah, actually, I... I remember one from you when you said, "I told the other guy I was sick right away." That was very, very enlightening. Dominic, Leo knew because of the support group. It wasn't like a decision to tell him. I know. It's just... (Sighs) You know what? Forget it. No, hey, come on. I get that you are still mad at me. But I really thought we were moving past this. Four months ago, last night... it would have been so much fun. It would have been like the perfect date. And now it's... it's hard to even be around you. And I'm not sure it's hard for you at all. You two, my office now. I just had the pleasure of talking to the host of the cancer benefit, Monica something... nice lady... and she asked me about you two, as if there were a you two. "Tension," she said. There was definitely tension. It won't happen again. What won't happen again? What's going on? You two dating? - We used to.  But it's over now, totally? 'Cause it clearly wasn't over last night or this wouldn't have happened. And by the way, I don't like how long it's taking you to answer this. So is it over, yes or no? Yes. Back to work. Hey. I'll take first pass at the article. If you have any edits, just email them to me. Dominic, wait. I... You what? I'll send you the edits right away. April : But what I wanted to say  is that it's hard for me to be around him too. But that's not fair to Dominic or Leo. Well, you're not going to tell Leo, are you? 'Cause, I mean, he really doesn't need to know. I know, but I just, from now on, want to be the kind of person that tells the truth when they're in a relationship, even when it's painful. Oh, you won't start doing that with me, though, will you? Oh, no, I'll keep telling you what you want to hear. Oh, thank God. I'll be getting enough honesty from my new roommate. Oh, you met her? What's she like? She works out compulsively, she hates television, I'm pretty sure that she's on something, and she already emailed me a chore calendar. But, I don't know, I'm desperate, so... Have you actually told her she's got the apartment yet? No, I'm going to call her tonight. Hold off on that. I want you to meet someone first. George : This is such an indulgence,  having my farewell dinner prepared by a professional chef. (Laughs) Uh, a professional chef who realizes that he unprofessionally, embarrassingly forgot his souffle dish. Oh. Oh, wait a second. I think we might have one of those. Really? Yeah. Your father insisted that we register for one when we got married, and then never used it. Perfect. So you two, you're not married? No, George is... was my... my husband... my... Brother-in-law. Yes. Oh. That's good to know. I've always noticed you in my restaurant. You stand out... a beautiful woman dining alone. Uh, we could start the salad course if you'd all like to take your seats. Uh, Quincy is totally flirting with you. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Mm-hmm. Brenna's right. He's cute. And he cooks. Yeah, but he forgot his souffle dish. Sounds irresponsible. Probably uses drugs. Come on, uncle George, back us up here. Yeah, I got a little something I can say. (Clinking) Don't panic. It's gonna be quick. Okay, so, uh... Well, to put it mildly, I'm going to miss this family. You've of course always been very close to my heart, but never as close as in these last few months. And we've been through a lot together. And the distance will be difficult, but I don't think the distance will be enough to break us apart. I miss you all already. It's just a little cream and sugar, three to five minutes. It's so easy. I don't understand why anyone buys whipped cream at a store. Oh, no! Guilty. (Both laughing) Sorry. They're pretty cute together, don't you think? Yeah. It's sweet how you look after your mom like that. Well, she can be pretty clueless sometimes. Just promise me you'll keep looking after her when I leave, huh? I promise. Okay, just let this sit. Here, try it. Okay. -  So good.  It's good, huh? (Knocking at door) Hi. Whoa! Sweet place. Thanks. April told me about what happened with that bartender guy. So, you know, just to be clear, you don't have to sleep with me to stay here. Well, then never mind. (Laughs) Your room's that way, kitchen's there. We can split utilities down the middle. And, you know, you can just pay month to month until you figure out your living situation. Cool. I can't plan more than a month ahead anyway. (Laughs) Perfect. Okay, so I gotta go finish getting ready. I'm going out in a bit. I love going out. Like, all the time. Yeah, I had a feeling. Where are you going anyway? Oh, I have to stop by my boss's place and then I'm meeting up with my boyfriend. You guys going somewhere fun? We're just going to the Charles. Well, you may see me there. Gotta have a talk with bartender dude. Gotta tell him that I'm not just moving out, I'm moving on. But that's what you're wearing? Yeah, why? Let's just say you're not exactly going to be making it easy for him to move on. (Laughs) Okay. Here, let me help you. No way. Come on. You are the guest of honor. All right. You can keep me company though. Yeah, will do, will do. Oh, you know, I read that article you did in the paper a couple of days ago. It was really great. Really? Yeah. Did you cry? My boss keeps telling me I need to make my readers cry so he can sell more newspapers. (Laughs) It's gonna be weird not having you around. Well, you'll be in great hands with Dr. Hamburg. No, I don't... I don't mean about the medical stuff. I mean around here and our family. You know, I feel like we know you better now than we ever have, even when my dad was alive. I'm just really glad we got the chance before you found this job. Definitely. But... You must be excited. I mean, new job, new city. But I love Boston. I mean, I have so many great memories here. We'll see. I have no idea what my new life is going to be like. So many great things that have happened to me have come as a complete surprise. I'm gonna go say goodbye to everybody. Mom, you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. Transitions are always hard. Yeah, I've been thinking that a lot too lately. I had to start working with Dominic again. Do you miss him? Sometimes. But now it's like there's so much baggage. Being around him is just too complicated. I guess it always will be. Or maybe you're just telling yourself that because it's easier than trying to make it work. I think about that too. It's... it's impossible to tell what the right answer is. I guess you have to trust your instincts and just do the best you can. (Footsteps approach) And that becomes the right answer. Walk me out? Yeah. So... Quincy thought we were married, huh? Sorry. Not exactly the best way to send you off. Well, so, you're sending me off, huh? I've been thinking about what you said, about us both deserving to have our lives just be a little easier, a little less burdened, and it really hit home with me tonight. And not because I have feelings for the chef or anything, but I couldn't help but think, what if I did? It wouldn't be hard to tell the girls. There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past. No, I get it, I get it. I do. You deserve that. You deserve to be happy. We both do. Hey, uncle George? Hey. I love you. Love you too. So how did you get Stalin to let me out of the  Gulag? It was easier than you think. Let's just say don't underestimate the power of "Nurse Jackie" on DVD. And I promised I'd stick to your schedule. What is on the schedule for tonight? Bath at 9:00. Oh, and look at the time. And look at this giant bathtub in front of us. That pool is really cold. Not when you heat it up to 95Â°. Oh. Do you wear your underwear in the bath? Because I'm just saying, if we're going to be authentic here, I'd... Don't push it. Okay. Ah! -  Oh. (Gasps) (Laughs) Oh, God. Need help? Nope, no. I got it. I got it. - Oh.  (Laughs) (Moaning) Don't worry. I'll be there in two shakes of a... oh! Aah! Aah! (Leo grunting) (Laughing) Hey, hey. Yeah? I have to tell you something. Pete is going to join us for the bubble bath? (Laughs) I wish. No, um, that work assignment I had last night was with Dominic. Oh. Okay. I... I mean, nothing happened or anything. I just, I wanted to tell you so it's all out in the open. Remember how you said the thing about dying is that there's no time for anything but the truth. I said that, huh? That's a good one. You're kind of full of those. Anyway, we might not be dying at the moment, but I still want to live like that. What's it like now with you and Dominic? If we're being honest, I'm just curious. Honestly, it's hard. Are you thinking about how much easier it'd be if you were with a guy who didn't have brain cancer? Sometimes I think that. But I'd still rather be here with you. Is that a weird thing for me to admit? Sort of. (Laughs) Well, I think we should let go of the idea that this will ever be normal... what you and I have. That's kind of what I like about it.

Yeah, have a drink. Chill out. Well, I would if I could find the bartender. I think he went out for a smoke. I'll get you. You new here? I'm so new I don't officially exist. Now what do you have in terms of specialty vodkas? You have anything from northern Lithuania, maybe? You look so familiar. Is that a good thing? I don't know. It depends. Did I do something bad to you? Not yet. Or any... any vodka would be great. On the house. Hey, you see that guy over there? The bartender that was supposed to be serving you? I'm trying to get him off my back. I told him I have a boyfriend down in Florida, but I don't think he believes me. Why wouldn't he believe that? Because I'm lying. You want to help me out? Pretend to be my Florida boyfriend for a few minutes? How do you do this? As a favor to the new girl. Is he looking now? Mm-hmm. I'm looking now. Hello. Uh, okay. I'll just... (Chuckles) There he goes. He's not happy. Poor guy. Your girlfriend, whoever she is, is one lucky woman. I don't have a girlfriend anymore. Then I guess I'm the lucky one. Okay. Hey.
