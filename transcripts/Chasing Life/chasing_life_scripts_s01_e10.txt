 What the hell? 
  You have Greer. She's your lover and your new best friend  all rolled into one. April : Danny... I'm on a deadline. I can't even remember  the last time I did something that dumb and impulsive. Please have the surgery. I made this decision long before you. Honestly, I don't need you in my life if you're on a mission to make me rethink that. I'm about to go fight for my life. I can't be around someone who has the chance to do that and won't even try. Goodbye, Leo. Have a nice life. April : Oh God, this weather is like perfect. Do you hear those birds? They're freaking out. Well yeah, 'cause they're doing it. (Laughing) Ew. I can't believe this is the last time I'm gonna be outside for a month. Brenna : I still don't understand  why you have to be in here for so long. Isn't chemo only seven days? That's just how it works with leukemia. Every other kind of cancer you can recover at home. I wish you had lymphoma instead. (Chuckles) Right? Or at least like... gallbladder cancer. Hmm. Rectal would be nice. Sara : Sweetheart? Do you think they heard me say rectal? Sara : I don't want to interrupt  your conversation, but it's time to go in. Did I hear the word "rectal?" ♪ Here it comes again ♪

"Finding Chemo" Are you like the youngest person here? It feels like it. You're not. I'm here to take you back to your room for lunch. I'm April, what was your name? Lailani. That's pretty. I don't know how I'm gonna eat. Do you feel sick? Not yet. You will, it's only day one. By tomorrow you'll be feeling more fatigue, maybe some swelling, possibly nausea. And the steroids we have you on cause some patients to hallucinate. Ooh, jealous. Nothing to be jealous about. Trust me. I was kidding. Never mind. You guys didn't have to do all this. Beth : Please, there was no way I was going to let you stay in a room without flowers. And there's no way I was going to let you stay in a room without Candy Crush. Man : I wouldn't play those. You're asking for a big old migraine once the chemo kicks in. And you are? I'm Sol. I'm right next door. Oh, great. Then it'll only be a short walk back there. Wow, this is a tough room. Yeah well, it is a hospital room. (Muttering to himself) Well well well, the gang's all here. Hey, Dr. Hamburg. So I see you're about to experience the joys of hospital food. (Sighs) I can't wait. So how's your appetite? Are you hungry? Um, not really. But I'll try and eat. I'm just kind of nervous, waiting for everything to kick in. Every patient is different, so try not to anticipate too much. Like George said, every patient responds differently. So if you have any concerns... You can call me any time if you have any questions at all, okay? Well, I got better grades than him in med school, so you might want to ask me. (Polite laughter) So, George... At some point you're gonna have to let me do my job and you can do yours. Well, what's my job? Be her uncle. (School bell rings) I just walked behind the counter and started flipping burgers. No one even noticed I didn't work there for like half an hour. So cool. I need to talk to you. I'm in the middle of something. Hey, can you give us a second? Thanks. Okay, so whenever you want to hang out I have to drop all my other friends. Hey, double standard. Are you even friends with that girl? I've never seen her before. Yeah well, you've been kind of distracted lately. How are you attacking me right now? You're the one who made out with Kieran in my room. You weren't even into him. You ditched him for some shallow rich girl. Let's say I can relate. Greer is not shallow. You're right, I forgot. She's in Eco Club. Are you listening to yourself? You're always sitting around bagging on rich people, talking about how closed-minded they are. But you're the closed-minded one. Just because Greer doesn't hate everything, that makes her shallow? Well, guess what? I don't either. There are more important things in life than making fun of everything all the time. When you realize that, maybe we could be friends again. (Scoffs) Well, thanks for the life lesson. Have fun putting ribbons in your hair and listening to Top 40. I'll be over here not selling out.  (School bell rings) (Huffs) Nice PJs, mom. Thank you. I just bought them. I wanted to look presentable. I'm not used to sleeping in public. Yeah... me neither. (Door opens) Did I hear we have a mama in the house? Yes. I'm Martine. I'm Sara. (Whispers) Martine's my favorite nurse. Ah, you say that to all the nurses. I definitely do not say that to Lailani. Just checking in before you go to sleep. Oh, and don't panic if you hear an alarm in the middle of the night. We have your bed set to alert us if you get up. Every time I get up? Yes, and sometimes when you don't. That alarm has a tendency to malfunction. I pressed my call button 10 minutes ago. Sol, you pressed it less than one minute ago. Well, it felt like 10.  (Martine groans) If I'm not out of there in 15,  please press your call button. (Sighs) There's no way I'm gonna be able to fall asleep in here. I thought that might happen. And I came prepared. (Unzips) Oh my God. Where did you find this? In the attic. Remember, dad taught you how to read with that book. And we would read it to you when you couldn't sleep. It's not that I couldn't sleep, I just hated sleeping. You used to wake up every morning crying because you were just sure that all the grown-ups were up all night, having fun without you. Wow, I was pretty insecure. (Laughs) No, you just didn't want to miss anything. All right. "Frog and Toad together." You ready? Mm-hmm. Chapter one... ♪ It's scary to be fragile ♪

We were in Romania and I got mugged and it took me forever to get a new phone. Great, so some Romanian thief knows I have cancer too? I'm sorry that I haven't been in touch these last couple of weeks while I've been traveling. How did all of this happen? Um... it's kind of a long story. I remember you weren't feeling well before I left. Like that night you thought you had food poisoning. Do you think that was all because of this? Um... maybe. I don't know. Well, here's a little something to make you feel better. It's... It's a playlist. I put it on a drive because it's really long. How long? 10,080 minutes. That's how many minutes are in seven days and chemo is seven days. Right? Dominic, this is... (Sighs) I have to tell you something. Yeah, what's up? I actually found out I was sick a while ago. Well, when? The night of our first date. I just didn't... I didn't know how to tell you. And I know... I'd had this crush on you for so long and it was finally happening. I just wasn't ready to have that all fall apart. So the whole time we were dating? Well, it wasn't just you. I didn't tell anybody except for Beth for a while. I don't really understand. Did you not trust me or something? Or... did you think I would leave you? Well, I mean... Kinda. You were always talking about how you hated girls with drama. And the night you found out Leo Hendrie was sick, you said you didn't know if you could deal with that. So I... You mean the night Leo screwed you over. I was just... I was mad at the guy for what he did to you. None of that means that I wouldn't have been there for you. I'm sorry. I handled this all wrong, I know. I should run home and drop off my stuff. I came straight from the airport. How long are you staying in town? Still figuring that out. (Alarm beeps) (Chuckles) Time's up. Brenna Carver. Ms. Gregorian wants to see you. Is everything okay? Come with me. Ms. Gregorian : I have reason to believe you girls skipped the Eco Club Conference during adventure week and went off on your own adventure. I told her we didn't, we just got food poisoning... Greer, why don't you let Brenna answer for herself, hm? So you got food poisoning? Greer and I both had bacon for breakfast that morning. And I guess it was like bad or something. We both started to feel sick right before Mr. Ostrowsky's speech. And we went to lie down in a conference room. We both fell asleep. By the time we woke up, everyone left to go to the nature preserve. And we couldn't call anyone because our phone's were dead. Your phones were dead? Greer told me that you lost your phone and that she left hers in the room. Yeah, that's what I meant. Mm-hmm. So you didn't sneak off into a cab to go drinking by the beach? And you didn't get a friend to sign you in  and record the lecture? Because that's what I was told. No. I need to call your parents, now. Wait, please don't call my mom. My family's going through a really hard time right now. Brenna, I'd advise you to stop lying to me as soon as possible. She's not lying. My sister's in the hospital. She has cancer and she just started chemo. Well, I am sorry to hear about your sister. But this is a serious offense and your mother needs to know. I know. But can I be the one to tell her? Please? You have until tomorrow. (Video game beeping) You wanna play cards? Um... not right now. How about later? Maybe. (Muttering) (Knocks) Sol, I said I'll let you know when I wanna play cards. Danny. Hey. You can sit. Not that one. That's for doctors only. I'm messing with you. Come on, I'm supposed to be the slow one here. Okay, are you... are you mad at me? Or something? Because you barely acknowledged me on my last day at work. Did I hurt your feelings by not telling you personally that I was sick? No, it's not that. Then why are you acting so weird? (Sighs) I really don't know how to say this without sounding like I totally suck. Oh my God, just tell me. Okay. I'm uncomfortable around you. I don't know what to say, or what not to say, or how to act around you. I mean, I can't keep being a jerk to you. Yes, you can. When I was going to work, it was like my only break from all this heavy stuff. You know, our stupid competitiveness and your whole arrogant Harvard thing? I needed that to stay sane. I still do. It's not arrogance. I'm just smarter than you are. (Laughs) ♪ You and me got ourselves a problem... ♪ Seriously, this is the most romantic present ever. You should write into like "Cosmo" or something. I'm sure they have a whole column for stories like this. They do. It's called, "sweetest things he did right after I cheated on him." You did not cheat on Dominic. You... you guys were on a break. And you still technically are. I mean, we don't even know if he's staying in town. Yeah, especially now that he knows I was lying to him for a month. He's hurt. Well, he'll be really hurt if you tell him you hooked up with Leo. I don't know if you'd be able to get back together after that... assuming that's what you want. It is. I mean, we only broke up because of distance. And because I didn't want him to feel obligated to take care of me once he found out. He was obviously not scared off. I mean, he flew back here for me. He's amazing. Exactly. So just don't rock the boat, okay? Leo was a one-night stand. What happens in the funeral home stays in the funeral home. I feel like I'm gonna puke. I know, I know. You're the most moral person I know. But in this case you just need to... No, Beth, I'm gonna puke. Um... Here, let me help you to the bathroom. (Alarm beeps) (Softly) Here, hold on to me. Hey, there you are. You ready for your sleepover with April? Yeah. Can I talk to you first? Oh, and we need to talk to you too. So you should sit down. They got the results from the cheek swab and you're not a match for April's bone marrow transplant. Oh. It doesn't mean anything bad is gonna happen to April. No, so don't worry. 'Cause there's a really good chance of finding a match off the anonymous registry. And that's not our only choice,  not even close. Sara, I just wanna... (Sighs) Tell you how sorry I am about the other night... Kissing you. I just... (Chuckles) I don't know what I was thinking. Well, that's just it, obviously I wasn't thinking. It's okay. That's the problem. I think we were just both feeling a little overwhelmed. I mean, it's a completely rational response to trauma, when you think about it. (Laughs) Can you imagine if it were anything more? How would we tell the girls? What would they call me? Uncle stepdad? (Laughing) Oh, yeah. All right, well, I'm gonna head home. Good night. Bye. Are you still feeling sick? No, these meds are awesome. What about you? You look stressed. I'm fine. It's okay if you don't want to sleep here. I know it's not the most relaxing... No. No, believe me, I don't want to be home right now. Bren, what's going on? I don't want to upset you. Uh, I have cancer. I'm already upset. Okay. I'm kind of in huge trouble at school right now. Greer and I got caught sneaking away from the Eco Club when we were in Florida. God, Bren. Why would you... I went to meet Natalie. What? It was a huge disaster. I never should have gone. And now the school knows that we lied because someone told them and I think it might have been Ford. Wait, hold on. Does that mean you told Mom about Natalie? Is she freaking out? No, I haven't told Mom what happened yet. But when I met Natalie, she said that she's met Mom. The school said that I have to tell her by tomorrow and she is gonna kill me. Let me help. I can talk to her first. No. No, I'm the one who broke the rules. I can do it. Are you sure? You have enough to worry about. You don't have to bail me out this time. Okay. Let's try and get some sleep.

Do you know how lucky you are you didn't get into serious trouble? I  am  in serious trouble. Forget about the school. I don't care about the school, I care about you. You could have been hurt, you could have been killed. You know the stories that you hear about kids disappearing on class trips? This is how that stuff happens. I mean, what were you thinking? I'm sorry. Was it really so important to go partying with your girlfriend... it wasn't like that, okay? You said you were drinking. Yeah, but we didn't do this to, like, get drunk. We were just with people who were... Oh please. I don't even want to know what kind of people you were with. I was with Natalie. Yeah. Natalie Ortiz, my sister, who you never told me about. (Stammers) How did you... April told me. April knows too? I just wanted to meet her. And I thought maybe she could be a bone marrow match for April if we needed one, which we do now, thanks to me. I don't even know where to start, I... I just wish you had told me when you found out instead of taking matters into your own hands. Well, I guess secrets run in our family. You didn't eat anything. Huh-uh, I've been sick all day. I can't keep anything down. I'll have Dr. Hamburg up your anti-nausea meds. Am I dead? So this is a dream. (Sighs) Dad, what's wrong? It's just... it's hard to see you... Like this, stuck in this box, bound to these tubes and machines. You should be out there living. I'm trying to get better so I can. I just don't want you to die in here. Like I did. Do you know something that I don't? Dad. Dad, answer me! (Breathing heavily) No. (Alarm beeps) Martine : April, everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, Martine. I'm just gonna take a quick walk. Got that energy back. I'm proud of you. Hey, I'm getting out of here and I need your help. (Breathing heavily) George, it's me. I'm at the hospital. April's missing. I don't know. Okay. All right, thanks. Why are you not looking for her? We have Dr. Hamburg and the entire hospital on alert that she's missing... That's not good enough. I gotta look for her myself. You're pretty rude, you know that? They let me check out of this hellhole two days ago and then you drag me right back. I should get a mailbox here. All right, talk to me. But remember, this conversation may be monitored or recorded by God. I can't do this. All day, every day, I'm poked and prodded like a piece of meat. I'm suffocating  in every way. The air in my room is stale and I just can't stop thinking about everything I'm not doing. I look out my window and get so angry  when I see all these people just living their lives while I'm stuck in here missing everything. (Sobbing) And I... I just hate that feeling. And I shut my blinds so I didn't have to look at it anymore. I just... I have to get out of here. So you called me? You're the only one that would understand. Everyone would just freak out and tell me I had to stay. So are you gonna help me break out? Break out? April, it's not jail. You can check out of here anytime. Then I wanna do that. Help me. No. I know being here doesn't... Feel like living. But you gotta do it. Why? You're gonna beat this thing. I knew that the day you told me you were sick... and then moments later asked me to help you get into my dad's event. What does that have to do with anything? You never stopped thinking about your future. You refused to accept that you wouldn't have one. Because you know you're supposed to live. I think you still know that. There's just this... Poison inside of you, that's trying to make you forget. But don't let it. (Sobbing) Come on. Leo? Yeah? I'm scared. Trust me, you got this. No, not about going back. I'm... I'm scared that when I get out, you won't be... Alive. That might happen. But you're only upset at the thought of me dying because it makes you aware of your own mortality. I'm like the Grim Reaper, only blonder. You know what they say though? Don't fear the reaper. No, you're not just a symbol of something to me. I thought you knew that by now. Especially after... After what? Did something happen between us recently that I already forgot about? You know, my memory sucks lately. I hate you. Hold on. Yeah. Look... I could never forget about what happened that night. But trust me, I am the wrong horse for you to bet on. I'm the one they take out back and shoot before the race even starts. But that other guy, that's the one who actually might win it for you. ♪ Shining down on your face... ♪ Go bet on him while you still can. ♪ Your face ♪

♪ no, I cannot get you out... ♪ So what was it that put you over the edge? I don't know. I just... I felt like this is never gonna end. I... I actually think I'm really okay now. George : You should rest. Yeah, we all should. It's been a long day. And, um, I think there's someone here who wants to see you. Sara : Dominic? I'm Sara, April's mom. This is April's Uncle George. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to finally meet you too. Well... So the nurses were telling me that you disappeared today. Yeah, uh... Sorry. I just kind of had a panic attack about being here. It's okay. I'd probably do the same thing if I were you. (Sighs) I'm so happy to see you again. Are you feeling better about what we talked about? Well, I was. I actually came back here to tell you that I was thinking of... staying in town to be here for you. Was? How's Leo Hendrie doing? I saw him dropping you off. You were with him when you disappeared. How did that happen? (Sighs) When I was diagnosed, I ran into Leo at a cancer support group and we sort of became friends. You know, the whole cancer connection. I just needed someone to talk to. You could have talked to me. Yeah, but... It's just different. You know, when you're sick and you find someone else who's sick, you can have these conversations about life and death and what it all means. That's all it was? Talking? (School bell rings), Hey, where are you going? Don't we have our meeting? The situation has been handled. Sara : You're Greer's parents. I'm Sara Carver. I'm so sorry about all of this. I hope we can maybe... Hi, yeah. This incident has been officially removed from both of their records. That's all that matters. How did you manage that? Well, apparently Charton Academy needed a new field house. Oh, I'm sorry. I... Is there anything I could do to compensate for Brenna's half of this? Not that I can afford half of a field house, but... That won't be necessary. All we ask is that the girls stop seeing each other. Why? Because I'm a girl? Not at all. We're proud of Greer for finding herself at such a young age. We just think it's in our daughter's best interest to date someone with similar ambitions. What are you saying? You can't just say that about my kid and then walk away. I don't care how many field houses you've bought. Brenna is a brilliant girl. She's had some rough circumstances to deal with in her life... Mom! But at this age,  I would have never  handled them with the kind of strength I see in her. You know what? Yeah, she's made some mistakes. But they're gonna make her one hell of an interesting woman. Well, we'd like Greer to stay away from Brenna while she makes those mistakes. (Silent) I'm so sorry. It's okay. Let's just move past this whole Florida thing. No, not just the Florida thing. I'm so sorry that you have one perfect daughter and one who's just like... Hey. I have two perfect daughters. When were you gonna tell me? I don't know. I didn't even know if you and I were getting back together. Why do you think I came back here? I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend. Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too. I did. I still do. Then why did you call Leo today and not me? I just... (Sighs) Never mind. You can say it. No, I can't. You're in a hospital bed. I don't care. It's not fair you can't have a reaction to this. I feel stupid. Like I was always more invested in this relationship than you were. Dominic, that's really not true. I would have been that guy for you, April. I would have been the guy that you could call before anyone else when you needed someone. Like today. But you never gave me the chance. I wish I could go back and do everything differently. (Sighs) You are gonna get better, April. You're one of the strongest people I know. You've got a lot of really great people taking care of you. But right now, I need to take care of myself. I'm so sorry. Me too. I think my favorite thing about the afterlife is how you have hair everywhere you're supposed to and none where you don't want it. Like I've got hair on my head again but I don't have a hairy chest anymore. I'm basically like a much hotter version of myself in the afterlife. So you... You died? Ugh, yeah. (Laughs) But it's okay. Seriously. I like it here. I'm always the youngest guy around. April : Gerald! I tried to find you that day. I needed to talk to you. No, you didn't. You didn't need me. You're doing great, kid. You're one of the lucky ones. How am I lucky? I tried to escape the hospital today. When you get out of there, you'll be a survivor. And take it from me, survivors are people who appreciate life the most. Your life is about to get so much richer. Hi, Dad. I'm holding you to what you said. When? Right after you found out you were sick. You told me that I'd have to wait a while to see you. You heard that? You said you weren't ready to go yet. Did you mean that, April? I did.

It's been okay. Challenging. It's hard to listen to some of the things my patients think are tragedies, when I'm dealing with matters of life and death. I don't know, does that make me a bad therapist? No, it just makes you human. Even if you're only half-trying, you're still so much better than most people's best. Thank you, I appreciate that. Well, it's true. I mean it. So do you remember when we were talking about what happened the other night and we said that it was nothing, it was just a response to trauma? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'd be lying if I kept saying that. 26 years ago when I left town, and I... I left you, I owned that that was my choice. And I was genuinely happy when my brother called me to ask for my blessing and ask you on a date. But just being back in your life... All these feelings are coming back and I can't help but wonder if you're feeling them too. Oh God. Get ready for the "why me" lady. No, actually "why me" lady's grandson is visiting today so she stopped saying "why me?" Lady : Why me-ee? (Laughs) Oh, I guess he just left. Wait, where's Sol? He's not in his room. Martine, what happened to Sol? Oh, he's gone, honey. Last night. He died? No, he checked out. He's in remission. (Sighs) That's amazing. I know, I'm as happy as you are that he's out of here. In more ways than one. What are Leo's parents doing here? (Soft moan) April, slow down. Slow down. No, something's wrong.  (Phone chimes) April, there's a voicemail on your phone. It's from Leo. Oh my God. April, it's Leo. I have to tell you something really important.
