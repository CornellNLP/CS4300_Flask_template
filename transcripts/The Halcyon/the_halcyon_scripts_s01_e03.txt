 Garland : Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. 
 I'm sure it's just another false alarm. 
 Quickly, please. 
 Here we go again. 
 Check the floors for strays. 
 This way, please. 
 (SONNY PLAYS 'COLONEL BOGEY MARCH') 
 (BACKGROUND CHATTER) 
 Another place to clean, then. 
 Yeah. 
 Billy, look at you! 
 Mum, leave off. 
 (AIR RAID SIREN CONTINUES) 
 Oh, wonderful. She's found the Jew. 
 Do you want to wait outside, Chef? 
 Not in front of the guests. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, a moment, please. 
 For those of you who have been rudely awakened, I apologise. 
 And for those still to go to bed, you also have my sympathies. 
 But I assure you, this is the safest place to be in the city.

 Are you serious, Tom? 
 They don't even use them any more. They've got the Cruiser now. 
 That's a big pounder, spitting out 100 rounds at the front, three mounted Vicker machine guns at the back. (IMITATES MACHINE GUN) 
 Yeah, I know that! 
 Can, c'est Francais, oui? Une francaise. Bien. 
 Je suis desolee. Je suis desolee, de vous avoir fait attendre la. 
 Oui, je suis desolee. 
 Chef needs these ingredients. 
 He does know there's a war on, right? 
 More families coming from France every day. 
 A lot don't even speak English. 
 At this rate we'll be running to capacity. 
 Remember to breathe occasionally. 
 I still feel like I'm wearing someone else's shoes. 
 He's... here, Mr. Garland. 
 Apparently the Count has already checked out of the Dorchester and the Savoy. 
 As long as nobody interferes with my job, I'm sure he'll have a long and happy stay with us. 
 Your Excellency. 
 Lady Hamilton... 
 You are even more radiant than your reputation led me to believe. 
 You're very kind. 
 And we're honoured that you chose our hotel. 
 Emma, the Regent Suite, please. 
 Mr. D'Aberville. 
 When did you and His Excellency travel from France? 
 Oh, we left the Cote D'Azur two weeks ago, just ahead of the pack. 
 The German wolves snapping at our heels. 
 Only a matter of time before they reach Paris. 
 If there's anything His Excellency needs, please contact either me or Miss. Garland. 
 Oh, he'll need something. 
 He always needs something. 
 You're not exactly a ray of sunshine. 
 I thought I could do this job. 
 I snapped at Chef in front of everyone. 
 I keep saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. 
 That's because you're thinking about him. 
 I'm not thinking about Freddie. 
 Then how did you know 'him' was him? 
 How's he getting on, anyway? 
 I don't know. 
 I haven't heard from him since he left the base. 
 I appreciate you boys letting me take a look around. 
 So, you're the gentleman that Freddie hit, aren't you? 
 Well, it was a sucker punch. 
 And I guess I was the sucker. 
 So, I wanted to start by asking you about the withdrawal at Dunkirk. 
 We did our best to provide cover, no matter what anyone says. 
 Oh, I'm not disagreeing. 
 I'm just trying to understand. 
 Well, maybe that's the best place to start. 
 Let people know how it feels to be one of you, in this situation, at this time. 
 That's the last of your... luggage, Your Excellency. 
 Do you know what this is? 
 Well, it's a erm... 
 A gun, sir. 
 This is my family heirloom. 
 My great-grandfather went to fight for Napoleon III. 
 Have you ever held a gun? 
 No. 
 Neither had he. 
 On his first day, they gave him this weapon. 
 It never left his side. 
 Not even when he came home. 
 Saved his life many times. 
 See, my great-grandfather knew that, beneath our veneer of respectability, all men are savages. 
 What is your name? 
 Billy, sir. 
 Thank you, Billy. 
 Billy's all wide-eyed and excited. 
 He's only turned 18 today and already he's put in a request for the Royal Engineers. 
 I suppose he feels it's his duty. 
 They were the sewer rats of the last war. 
 Came home in pieces. 
 If they came home at all. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Switchboard. 
 Of course, Your Excellency. I have the manager right here. 
 He has sent back the tete de veau twice already. 
 I have made it with gribiche and I have made it with ravigote, and each one was top notch. 
 Perhaps if you were to bring the next dish to him yourself. 
 Right. 
 So, you expect me to bend and scrape in front of that chump? 
 I am so glad we understand each other. 
 Did you make this? 
 No. It was our head chef. 
 Ah! I think there is some fire in the eyes of my little Austrian friend. 
 Please, speak your mind. 
 We are just two poor refugees, far from our homes. 
 This is the third time the dish has been cooked for you. 
 There are people on rations, starving, and you're tossing away good food like the world hasn't changed. 
 But the world has not changed. 
 Not for me, at least. 
 It has merely... shifted latitude. 
 The government wants you to work for them? Really? 
 Please keep your voice down. 
 Trading it all in to become a civil servant. 
 At least you dress the part. 
 Thank you, Mother. 
 You grew up so fast. 
 Both of you. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Lady Hamilton. 
 May I? 
 Oh, of course. 
 You don't remember me, do you? 
 It was a few years ago. 
 Yes. Of course I do. 
 No recollection at all. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Weren't you one of Dobby Tucker's set? 
 And now the good lady adds insult to injury. 
 I'll have a coffee, please. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Well, obviously, as a woman of taste and good manners, you find gossip abhorrent. 
 Absolutely. I can't stand it. 
 Then I should warn you in advance, because you were the one who brought up Dobby Tucker. 
 Now, let me tell you... 
 Dis pas ca, c'est pas possible! 
 On me l'a vole, j'en suis sur! On me l'a vole! 
 Quelqu'un a vole! 
 Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Excellence? 
 My gun! Stolen from my room by one of your staff! 
 You're disappointed. 
 You came here with your story already written. 
 Oh, yeah? What story's that? 
 'Those poor young pilots, fearful of the coming conflict.' 
 (LAUGHS) All right, all right. 
 But with the situation in France, and Britain being next in line, there's gotta be some trepidation. 
 There's no space for fear in the cockpit, Mr. O'Hara. 
 What's happening? 
 We're air cover for ships, evacuating our people from France. 
 I thought the evacuation was over. In Dunkirk, yes. But St Nazaire, Nantes, we've still got a lot of men out there. 
 That sounds dangerous. Don't worry about me, Mr. O'Hara. 
 (BELL CONTINUES TO RING) 
 (AIRPLANE ENGINES FIRE UP) 
 This is a very serious situation. 
 I know guests like the Count can be difficult. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 But if he says the gun is priceless, we must accept that at face value. 
 And the only people with access to his room are us, the staff. 
 Funny, innit? 
 Nothing ever went missing before. 
 Then er... Herr Klein shows up. 
 I did not take the gentleman's gun! You were in his room. 
 Should have seen him when he came back. 
 Acting strange. 
 Most of the kitchen staff act strange. 
 Hardly a basis for guilt. 
 Why not look in his locker, then? 
 We're not turning this into a witch-hunt. 
 You could look in mine as well. Look in them all. 
 (KEY TURNS IN LOCK) 
 This is wrong. 
 Mr. Klein was the last member of staff to be seen in the Count's room, and if there's nothing to hide... 
 Very clean locker, Mrs. Hobbs. Oh, just get to the German's! 
 Chef! 
 Well, there's no gun. 
 These belonged to the late Lord Hamilton. 
 Mr. Klein, why are they in your locker? 
 It's always the quiet ones. 
 Miss. Garland, inform the police. 
 Miss. Garland! 
 That's what you were doing during the siren. 
 Taking the cufflinks. 
 I'm sorry, Miss. Garland. 
 It is my family. 
 I had... I had no choice. 
 It was the only way I could get enough money. 
 One a week for the past two months. 
 Sent to his wife and daughter, to where they're hiding in France. 
 Each letter has been returned, undelivered, unopened. 
 Well, there's a simple answer to that, then. You can't do that. 
 Well, you shouldn't do that, but yeah, you can. 
 It's simple, you just, you know... 
 Mr. O'Hara, I just wanted your professional opinion. 
 Do you think he was trying to get money to... 
 To bring his family over here? Yeah. I'd bet on it. 
 They're rounding up the Jews in Europe, and France isn't exactly sympathetic. 
 I feel for the guy. 
 No, thank you. 
 Hey, be careful, though. 
 Because? 
 Oh, I know that look. 
 Mr. O'Hara, you do not know my looks. 
 You're thinking of getting involved. 
 Maybe. 
 You check the temperature out there. 
 People are increasingly suspicious about foreigners. 
 You're a foreigner! 
 (LAUGHS) Oh, you know what I mean. 
 Oh, of course. Foreigners! 
 Austrians. Jews. 
 Not good, clean-living Americans. 
 Oh, wonderful, another lecture! 
 First Freddie and now you. 
 Wait. You saw him today? 
 Yeah, I went to the airfield. 
 I wanted to interview some of the pilots, you know, get out from behind my beloved martini glass. 
 How is he? Is he in danger? 
 Well, they're flyboys, aren't they? 
 What does that mean? 
 You know, I grew up in this place... 
 Farmersville, Illinois. 
 Anyway, there was this kid. 
 Danny Pacelli. 
 He played ball, ran track. 
 I never seen anyone so confident in my life. 
 Like nothing bad could ever touch him. 
 Freddie reminded me of him. 
 A lot. 
 Chef. 
 Billy. 
 One moment, please. 
 Sit. 
 Did you really think you could get away with it? 
 What? This is the kitchen, son! 
 We see and hear everything.

 Come on! Make a wish, come on. 
 (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) 
 You tried champagne before? 
 (SPLUTTERS) 
 (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) 
 (LIFT BELL PINGS) 
 An example of the Barbizon School. 
 Realism over romanticism. 
 Lord Hamilton chose it. 
 Though I doubt he ever gave it a second glance. 
 I find it dreary. Like a wet Sunday. 
 Then why is it still here? 
 Lady Hamilton, surely you're not waiting for permission to make changes to your own hotel? 
 Allow me. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 (GIGGLES) There we are. 
 Done. 
 You are very wicked. 
 She's doing this to provoke me. 
 Or maybe she's just enjoying her freedom. 
 That woman doesn't enjoy anything. 
 Apparently she enjoys provoking you. 
 Mr. Garland. Er... Mrs... Mum. 
 Billy... (SIGHS) 
 When are his papers due? 
 Any day now. 
 There's nothing I can do, is there? 
 Nothing anyone can do. 
 Well, yeah, I do know a fella. 
 But? 
 Messing with call-ups... 
 Some might say that's a bit unpatriotic. 
 We look after our own. 
 I'll get in contact with him, then. 
 Good. 
 Oh. I'll erm... need you to keep watch tonight. 
 We shouldn't rely on the air raid sirens. 
 Will I get time-and-a-half for that? 
 I hoped you might do it out of a sense of duty. 
 Well, we look after our own, Mr. G. 
 Eh? 
 You worry too much. 
 You know what they say? 
 It'll all be over by Christmas. 
 So YOU took the gun? Shh! In here. 
 I thought you were acting strange. Where is it now? 
 I've hidden it. 
 Bloody hell, Billy! 
 I've... I've never held one before. 
 I was gonna return it later, when I had the chance. 
 Then all hell broke loose. 
 Does anybody else know? 
 No. 
 When they do... 
 I'm gonna lose my job. 
 I won't be allowed in the army. 
 Oh, God. My mum's gonna kill me. 
 Give it back, then. 
 Yeah, and say what, though? 
 Say nothing. 
 Just need to put the gun somewhere in the Count's room. 
 Wait till he's having lunch tomorrow, right? 
 I'm not saying what Max did was right. 
 He stole from Lady Hamilton. 
 This isn't something that can be just washed away. 
 But if he was trying to help his family, then... 
 We must be seen as united on this. 
 Is that why you wanted me to take this job? 
 To have someone to blindly back you up, no matter what? 
 Is that all I'm meant to be? 
 Of course not. 
 Well, then, at least let me speak to him! 
 The matter is closed. 
 You're forbidding me? 
 As what? My parent? Or my superior? 
 Both. Are we clear? 
 Crystal, Mr. Garland. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 (♪ JAZZ ♪) 
 So, Mr. Hamilton's a working man now? 
 Yes. Start next week. 
 Can't help feeling they've made a terrible mistake, accepting me into the War Office. 
 This... is confidence in a glass. 
 OK. 
 You know, some people drink to forget. 
 I say... drink to remember. 
 To remember what? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe that being Toby Hamilton is something pretty special. 
 You all right there, Toby? 
 Not so bad, Mr. O'Hara. 
 Bourbon on the rocks. Make that two. 
 Housekeeping. 
 Comte de St Claire : Come. 
 I'm sure it'll turn up. 
 I know you must be feeling like it won't, but it's like my mam always says. 
 Always in the last place you look for it. 
 (LOCKS DOOR) 
 Your kindness is much appreciated. 
 My mam also says that a smile doesn't cost anything. 
 What is your name? 
 Kate, sir. 
 You... have a light. 
 It shines from within you. 
 A kindness. 
 A warmth. 
 Please. 
 It would be of comfort. 
 You scratched me! 
 I opened one of Max's letters. 
 Ah. 
 One of the guests helped me translate some of it. 
 Something tells me it pulled on the old heart strings. 
 How would you feel if the people you cared about were in danger, and there was so little you could do to help them? 
 Well, I've got a rule. 
 Only one person I care about. 
 Yourself? 
 Well, actually, I was referring to Mr. Jim Beam, but that's a good answer, too. 
 Look, I'm making a point. 
 You're an assistant manager in a hotel. 
 There's only so much you can do. 
 (APPLAUSE) 
 Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. 
 I apologise for the interruption. 
 The French have laid down their arms... and asked Germany for an armistice. 
 It'll be signed in the next few days, but as of now, France has effectively fallen. 
 (GASPS OF HORROR) 
 I am so sorry to be the bearer of... such awful news. 
 Thank you. 
 It shouldn't be too long now. Thank you so much. 
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your patience. 
 Britain stands alone now. There's no-one else. 
 We still have our army, our ships, our air force. 
 That kid I told you about from my hometown, Danny Pacelli. 
 He joins the Marines straight after high school. 
 He ships off to Nicaragua. 
 Two weeks later... they send him back in a box with a flag draped over it. 
 He was just a kid. But that's what they do. 
 They send out the kids. Like Freddie and his squad. 
 They're more than that. They've been trained. 
 That won't make a difference. They're outnumbered. 
 Stop it. 
 To go up against the Germans in the sky with what they've got? 
 They don't stand a chance. 
 I said stop it! 
 You're not helping. 
 All right. You wanna see Max? 
 Well, let's go see Max. 
 I'm sorry to be the one to tell you. 
 What were France's terms of surrender? 
 We don't... we don't know yet. 
 You must tell them to release me. That I'm sorry. 
 More than ever, I must find a way to help my family. 
 Max, you stole from the hotel. 
 From Lady Hamilton herself. 
 The cufflinks would have lain in a drawer... dusty and unused. 
 They compare us to vermin. 
 To rats. 
 My daughter is seven years old. 
 And because she is Jewish... she is seen as worse than an animal. 
 She's not even a person. 
 And if they have taken her... 
 Please, Miss. Garland. 
 You're the only hope I have. 
 Get me out of here. 
 (GASPS) 
 I understand there was er... an incident with the Count. 
 Best forgotten. 
 Are you sure everything's OK? 
 Just not seemed yourself the last few days. 
 Yeah, 'course I am. Not done nothin'. 
 'Not done anything'. 
 Ah! Excellent. 
 Just the man I was looking for. 
 I believe these are your call-up papers, Billy. 
 Well, that's not right. They've... 
 They've assigned me to the Royal Artillery. 
 Just round the bloody corner at Hyde Park. I'm... 
 I'm meant to be with the engineers, out where the action is. 
 I suppose the army has to look at how best to distribute their resources. 
 Why did the letter come here? 
 Should've gone to the house. 
 Did you do this? 
 Billy! 
 I promise, I don't know anything... 
 I ain't a child no more. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 I am so sorry. 
 I had no idea how upset he'd be. 
 You've... nothing to be sorry about. 
 (GIGGLES) You are officially awful! 
 Sorry. I thought we were supposed to be having breakfast together this morning. 
 There's plenty of room at the table. 
 Mr. D'Aberville is a terrible person and I want you to ignore everything he says. 
 Toby does very important work for the government. 
 Or so he tells me. 
 We were commiserating over the situation in France. 
 Ah, well, yes. It's most distressing. 
 I know, I know. I mean, where are they gonna find decent Sauerkraut in Paris? 
 (GIGGLES) 
 Erm... the Count's due to go for his lunch in a bit. 
 Gonna put the gun back then. I just need you to keep watch. 
 Er... I can't. 
 I don't wanna go up there. 
 What? Come on! You said that you'd help me, Kate... 
 What happened? 
 Kate? What... 
 (SIGHS) He was upset. 
 I was just being nice, but then... 
 He wouldn't let me go, kept... pushing himself against me and then... he kissed me. 
 We'll erm... 
 We'll go and tell Mr. Garland right... 
 No! 
 Billy, don't. 
 No-one's gonna believe me. 
 He's the Count, and I'm... nobody. 
 No. Don't say that. You're not. 
 And I'm not gonna let him do that to you. 
 What's the point? There's nothing you can do. 
 Just... forget it. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Young William. 
 I believe they teach you to knock before entering, yes? 
 I've got your gun. 
 Oh, that's wonderful! Wherever did you find it? 
 William? 
 Hand over my property. 
 She felt sorry for you. 
 Who? 
 Kate! The chambermaid. 
 (SCOFFS) There are things you need to learn about women. 
 What they say and what they really want. 
 No. I don't have to learn anything. I'm not a child. 
 What you did, it... it was wrong and... 
 Ah. You like her. 
 No. It's not about that. 
 Maybe you are angry because she wanted a man. 
 Not a pathetic, mewling baby, one who shivers and shakes with fear. 
 Now, give me what is mine! 
 (GUN CLICKS) 
 This place is meant to be secure. 
 An oasis from the outside world. 
 And what do you do? You threaten a guest. 
 A count, for God's sake, with his own gun that you stole from him! 
 If word of this gets out... 
 (SIGHS) 
 It's Kate. 
 What? 
 What about Kate? 
 Now, I have no wish to shame her, but... to be threatened like that by the boy? 
 No. That shall not stand. 
 I want him arrested. 
 And I want financial restitution. 
 More and more royalty are fleeing Europe every day. 
 We want them to know that the Halcyon is their safe haven, a place they will be taken care of. 
 Do you feel he acted inappropriately? 
 He's a titled man! 
 Do you feel he acted inappropriately? 
 (LIFT BELL PINGS) 
 I feel that he disrespected me and he disrespected my hotel. 
 Then may I have a free hand to deal with him as I see fit? 
 As long as there are no repercussions. 
 I'm glad we can work together. 
 Mr. Garland, you will be getting your hands dirty, whilst mine remain sparkling and clean. 
 Before he came here, the Count stayed at both the Dorchester and the Savoy. 
 Seems odd that he'd change hotels twice in eight days. 
 Well, he is very particular. 
 Mm. 
 The incident with our chambermaid... 
 It isn't the first time this has happened, is it? 
 He won't back down from his demands. 
 Because he thinks we won't go public with this. 
 You wouldn't betray the confidentiality of your guests. 
 Nobody would ever stay here again. 
 You're right. We wouldn't. 
 But there is an American. 
 Mr. O'Hara. 
 Journalist. 
 Quite popular on the wireless. 
 Always on the lookout for a story. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I would hate to see your name dragged into this. 
 Well, I could explain it to him in a way that would make him go quietly. 
 And what would you want in return? 
 Hm. 
 Well, the Count left a sizeable deposit for his suite. 
 I'd like to use it for a more modest room for myself. 
 You're leaving his service? 
 Mm. 
 War tends to put things into perspective. 
 So, how are you finding your new position? 
 It's a challenge, but I feel I'm starting to get to grips with it. 
 Of course, you're totally unsuited to the job. 
 Oh. 
 I don't say it to be cruel. You're too soft around the edges. 
 Your father... even with all his faults, isn't afraid to make enemies. 
 So, now would be the wrong time to talk to you about Mr. Klein? 
 He's the kitchen porter... 
 The Austrian who stole from me. 
 Yes, I know who Herr Klein is. 
 He has a family in France. 
 A wife. A daughter. 
 What he did was wrong, but... he was desperate. 
 And you want me to forgive him? 
 To allow him to return? 
 Why on earth would I do that? 
 Because my father is against it. 
 Waiting for someone? 
 I made a decision about Mr. Klein. 
 You went behind my back. 
 Clever. 
 Using me as leverage with her Ladyship. 
 I wouldn't have thought of that. 
 Are you angry? 
 You undermined me. 
 I couldn't think of any other way. 
 As your manager, I am not happy at all. 
 As your father... 
 I'm a little impressed. 
 Proud, even. 
 But angry. 
 Exactly. 
 (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
 Mr. Klein. 
 Mr. Garland. 
 You're late for work. 
 Please stop by my office later. 
 We'll discuss how we can try to locate your family. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, yes. No need for that. 
 Miss. Garland has shown great support for you. 
 Please don't let her down. 
 Of course, sir. 
 You can do that again. 
 Oh, no. 
 No. 
 That thieving piece of sh1t is not working in my kitchen. 
 Mr. Klein is rejoining us. 
 I'm not discussing this with the bloody receptionist. 
 I fought in the Great War. 
 We thought that was it. 
 But it isn't, is it? 
 It's starting all over again. 
 I appreciate that. 
 But I believe we must be measured by our compassion and not our suspicion or fear. 
 I don't give a fig what you believe, Garland. 
 This is not a negotiation. 
 It's him or me. 
 Are you sure you want to do this? 
 Chef, er... maybe let it lie, eh? 
 Very well. 
 Miss. Garland. 
 I leave this situation in your capable hands. 
 I apologise, Mr. Parry. 
 You've left me with little choice. 
 Please clear out your locker. 
 (SPLUTTERS) Robbie. 
 The head chef station is yours. 
 Mr. Klein. 
 Sous chef. 
 If that meets with Robbie's approval? 
 Y-yeah. 
 (EXHALES) 
 I'll try and get some. 
 Here we go. 
 What? What is it? 
 Take her away. 
 Pick it up. 
 Pick it up! 
 You've got knees. Do it yourself. 
 Your Excellency. 
 I'm so sorry to hear about your premature departure. 
 England is finished, Mr. Garland. 
 Soon your hotel will be little more than rubble and dust. 
 We can't put a stage in here. 
 Hm. We'll need something. I've gotta have space to perform. 
 Especially if we keep ending up down here. 
 Couldn't you just lie on top of the piano or something? 
 That might work. 
 No! That was a joke. 
 I don't know. It could be good. 
 See? 
 The big boss agrees with me. 
 Break her heart, I'll break your face. 
 Lovely to have you back, Lord Hamilton. 
 How are you? 
 I've... I've only got an hour. 
 But I just... 
 I needed to see you. 
 What is it? What's happened? 
 I couldn't make a difference. 
 They came out of the sun. 
 And they just opened up their machine guns on the survivors in the water. 
 We... 
 We just couldn't stop them. 
 But you'll keep trying. 
 I don't know what's going to happen to us all, but... there's something I've been wanting to do for a long time. 
 Was that it? 
 I'm hoping it was, because otherwise... 
 'Everything is changing. 
 You can feel it in the air. 
 As I pass through London, I see it on the faces of the men and women around me. 
 Things are different. 
 Now that France has fallen, Britain is next in line. 
 But I don't think that means they're finished. 
 Not by a long shot. 
 They might be scared, but they won't let fear win the day. 
 That's the thing I'm learning about the Brits. 
 That they know how to make the best of a bad situation. 
 They'll pull together. 
 They'll look out for each other and they'll surprise themselves along the way.' 
 (AIR RAID SIRENS) 
 'I don't think it'll be easy, and I don't envy those on the front line. 
 But I know this. 
 Whatever the coming days and weeks may bring... they'll do their best...' 
 Ready. 
 '...to their very last breath.' 
 For the people of Britain... the war is finally coming home.
