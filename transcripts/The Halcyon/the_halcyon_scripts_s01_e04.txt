 Newsreel :  Hurricanes come home. 
 Our fighters land after a brisk but successful encounter with hit-and-run raiders. 
 These are some of the boys who've flouted Hitler's air offensive. 
 In due course they'll stop it altogether. 
 They take it easy between raids... You and Freddie. Sport to be had when there's no serious work to be done in the sky. (TYPEWRITER BELL RINGS) 88 Squadron, two planes down, 145 Squadron, one plane down, 392 Squadron, one plane down, 405 Squadron... Wait, sorry, 392 Squadron? One plane down. Do you... Do you know who? The RAF know. We just process the numbers. My brother's in 392. I thought it was romantic. Eurch! She was a drip. And if any man told me that frankly he didn't give a damn, I'd frankly clip him round the earhole. Set upon by squadrons of German planes and one of them went down. We don't know which. Have you told your mother? What's happened? This is meant to be confidential, but... one of Freddie's squadron was shot down over the channel last night. The RAF haven't released any details yet. If it was him? They'd send a telegram. Emma, why don't you...? My shift starts in five minutes. It's fine. No, no. I'm going to be late and you are a stickler for punctuality. That doesn't matter. Five minutes. Really. ♪ These things are moving fast ♪ 
♪ No time left in my hourglass ♪ 
♪ No hopes for you and me ♪ 
♪ Long gone, they left without apology ♪ 
♪ Nothing can stop these ♪ 
♪ Cold clock hands ♪ 
♪ From turning ♪ 
♪ Pray it won't stop these ♪ 
♪ Falling sands ♪ 
♪ Raining down ♪ So what's the occasion, Delane? You bought another network? Hell, no. One was enough. This is my way of showing appreciation. Your show's done well. Numbers have been strong, I mean... "Oh, they could always be stronger". Exactly. But do you know what's making people tune in? Well, London during wartime, it's pretty compelling. Joe half our audience couldn't even find London on a map. People are tuning in because of you. Which is why I want to build our fall schedule around your new show. Enjoy your drinks, gentlemen. My new show? Joe O'Hara's Eye On America. New York City, state-of-the-art studios. What about the work I'm doing here? It's the Little Leagues, Joe. I'm calling you up to the Majors. Come on, Freddie. Come on. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Room service, sir. I didn't order anything. It's from Adil, uh, Mr. Joshi. He knew you were working and thought some coffee might be of use. Oh, erm... Do you want me to take it back down, Mr. Hamilton? No, no, no. (TRUMPET PARPS) There's a reason your father hid that from you. He didn't hide it. It was just in with his things. He used to play it every Sunday at church. (PLAYS BADLY) When you've finished torturing the poor thing, we've got a show to do. May I help you, madam? Probably not, love. Here to see someone? We're on the edge of a brave new world here, Joe. RCA's sunk millions into television, CBS has opened studios in Grand Central. It's the future. You do all right by me, ten years from now there'll be a glowing box in every home with your face on it. Now you're giving me the hard sell here. No. This is what I'd be giving you. Man : Please. Woman : It's my daughter. ♪ She can love ♪ It's my daughter. You can't come in here. ♪ That I do ♪ I've come all this way and I'm seeing my daughter. I'm sorry, madam, you can't come in. Get your bloody hands off me! Bets! It's fine, Mr. Feldman. I'm sorry. I told you. My daughter's the main attraction. Mum, shall we... It's just I'm due a break anyway, so... You can wrap up your show here on Monday. Well, I haven't said yes, yet. It's a simple choice. Do you want to stay in a warzone, or do you want to be a star? I'm sorry to hear you're leaving us. Please have a safe flight back to Chicago. Thank you very much. The great American exodus continues? Hm. It's understandable. I think you're gonna have to add my name to that list. Would you like us to book you a flight? No. Mr. Delane has a plane scheduled for Monday evening. Very good. I hope you'll consider the Halcyon again, should you choose to return. Your room's been covered by your employer, so all that's left is to collate your bar bill. I'll have someone bring it up to your room. That's it? Was there something else? Just you don't seem surprised. Most of the Americans are leaving town. I suppose invasion rumours are rather alarming. Well, this isn't an evacuation. I'm not quitting because of the war. It's a fantastic career opportunity. I understand. Just a coincidence. Mm. I hope you've enjoyed London. You know, I er... I never went to a pub. I don't think you'd like them. They don't serve martinis. Why are you here? Me and Martin are done and dusted. I've moved in with your aunt. So you're not going back to Liverpool? He can beg and beg, I've made my mind up. Oh, I've heard that before. I know. And more fool me for not listening to you. I'm sick and tired of wasting my life, picking up after that loafer. Besides, I missed my little girl. (SNORTS) We'll see how long that lasts. Go on, eat your dinner. Ah, Tom, did you take Mr. Hamilton his coffee? Uh-huh. And did he seem pleased or...? I dunno. It's just coffee. Stop it. What? They'll start calling me the merry widow. You shouldn't worry what the munchkins think. What's a munchkin? (LAUGHS) Don't you know? It's this film they're all seeing. Well, that explains it. I've never been to the picture house. No! Why not? Cos it's full of people. I mean, not "people". You know, "people". (LAUGHS) Have you told her yet? About Freddie? No. She's been through enough. Can I help you? Telegram, miss. Wilfred, please inform Mr. Price in room 217 there's a telegram. I imagine his sister has had her twins now. Er, could you check these names for me, Miss. Garland? Emma. Pilot Officer Radimsky pancaked down into the Channel. But thankfully a trawler picked him up and he was transferred to the Queen Alexandra. So... Oh, God, you heard something. Toby did. We didn't know if it was you. Oh, Em, I'm sorry. Ahem. Your Lordship. (GIGGLING) You're working late. Sorting through some things. So I hear Mr. Delane wanted to see you. How much did he offer you? A gentleman never discusses money. Especially not obscene amounts. (LAUGHS) Taking a couple of souvenirs? I just don't want the next guy to get my best material. There isn't going to be a next guy. After your final broadcast, the show's getting scrapped. Who's going to report from London for the network? Nobody, I guess. Well, what if the President sends troops? They'll need a correspondent. I suppose Delane doesn't think that'll happen. Or he doesn't care. (CHURCH BELL RINGS) Freddie. What is it? We fell asleep. Yes, we did. I better go back to my room and you back to yours. Don't I own this place? (LAUGHS) Do you want my father to find out? Your mother? You're ashamed of me. My secret's out. Though you're right, though. They'd do all they could to keep us apart. I should start moving. I want to visit Stan in the hospital before we're called back to base. Are we safe here in London? Optimistically, we hold them off. The Americans join the war effort and our combined forces are enough to push back the enemy. And if the Americans decide against helping? O'Hara's boss is sending him home. That's a shame. We could use all the support we can get. We hope for the best, prepare for the worst. (KEY RATTLES IN DOOR LOCK) Oh! Mrs. Hobbs, Good morning. Sorry, Your Lordship, I didn't... I didn't realise someone was in here. No, it's fine. Erm, you can come back later. Mrs. Hobbs. Yes, your Lordship. Why would I know anything about it? Because you're the eyes and ears of this place. It's none of our business. We can't keep secrets from each other, Peggy. That's what the Germans want. What secrets might they be, Mrs. Hobbs? Nothing, sir. I do hope so. Because if I thought you were spreading malicious gossip about the staff, or, indeed, the Hamilton family, you would be out of that door, before you knew what was happening. Mm. I fear she may be right. About the Germans? No. The other thing. Emma and Freddie. Have you spoken to Emma about it? I'm going to lay down the law this evening. She won't listen to you. There are a thousand ways he could break her heart. And not just because he's aristocracy. The war as well. I've seen the way she watches that door. One day he might not walk back through it. Are you sure this is my bar bill? I am sure, Mr. O'Hara. But this one is on the house. It better be. There you are. Thanks. Oh, Miss. Garland? Is this number right? It does seem a little light. (CHUCKLES) So, it looks like Delane is shutting down foreign reporting. You must be very hard to replace, Mr. O'Hara. Well, this new show they're lining up, it's gonna be big. An assistant's position maybe? Be a chance for you to see the world. That's very kind Mr. O'Hara, but I'm in no hurry to abandon the people I care about. I've found that war makes you realise what really matters. Oh, I've done my bit, Emma. I-I apologise. That was... that was very rude of me. About that drink. I have a few hours to spare if it suits. It might be your last chance to visit that pub. Oh, what are we doing here? (LAUGHTER) Visitor for you. Emma. Mr. O'Hara. Boys. And what brings you here? I guess we were in the area. Mother, you're supposed to knock! Why? It's not as though you've got a girl in here. And I need your opinion, about my outfit. Why are you asking me? Well, you know how to dress like a... like an ordinary person. Well, you look like you always do. Yes. That's the problem. Toby, if rumour reached you that... I had dined... with a man, what would you think? I'd assume he was a friend of Father's, offering consolation on your loss. Great. Glass. Metal. Water's rushing in. For a second I thought I'd already died. So? You going to tell his story on your radio show, then, O'Hara? Unfortunately, Mr. O'Hara will be leaving us to go back home. Well, technically, it's er under discussion. Well, you've probably picked the right time. Where is home? Well, I'd be going to New York, but home would be Illinois. Ah. Go, Blackhawks. (CHUCKLES) Blackhawks? What's that? Only the greatest ice hockey team in the world. My uncle has a friend who repairs their skates. He says Americans talk too much. But that they are good people. Well, he's got the first part right, at least. (COUGHS) Can I get you something, Stan? I did ask the doctor for vodka, but... (COUGHS) I'm all right, thank you. I know what you're doing. I'm not doing anything, Mr. O'Hara. I just wanted to give you a chance to say goodbye. OK, first, it's Joe. Not Mr. O'Hara. And, second, I get it. You want me to see the human cost, the people at the heart of this, the ones really making a difference. You can make a difference. You know, I don't know who you think I am. I've read about your broadcasts, how Americans react to your words, people listen. Because that's what I do! Oh, I say the words, I sound convincing, I turn bullshit into gold because it's my job to keep them listening. It doesn't mean that I believe it. It's just the job. I'm sorry. Really. But you've got the wrong guy. (♪ LESLIE HUTCHINSON: I Forgot The Little Things ♪) ♪ I've learnt my lesson now ♪ 
♪ I know they count those foolish little things ♪ 
♪ Forgive me, dear, and then ♪ 
♪ When we're in love again ♪ 
♪ I won't forget the little things ♪ Who's this, then? No, no wait, let me guess. Hutch, right? One of mum's favourites. She asked you for money yet? It's coming. You know it is. Always does. Honestly, she's changed. You must see that. She's drinking less. Her hems are longer. I really think this time she'll stick around. Of course. (SHE STOPS THE MUSIC) If you're going to patronise me, Sonny, you could at least try harder. Your mother is waiting in the bar! What's she doing here? Oh, glad you've finally decided to show up. This pickaninny won't serve me. Mum, this is where I work. You can't just keep showing up unannounced. You think I'm not good enough for this place.. No, I didn't mean that. Well, I was good enough once! I know I don't deserve another chance. I'm sorry, love. Sometimes I... I just don't think. That's right, Gloria. You don't. Betsey just meant that tables need to be reserved in advance. But don't worry, we keep this one free, for VIPs. Oh... Well, if you're sure. Thank you. Thank you very much. No heckling during tonight's show. (INCREASING ROAR OF AIRCRAFT OVERHEAD) (MACHINE GUN FIRE) What do you think, Billy? Oh... I reckon it's the Messerschmitt 109. You've got a good eye, I'll give you that. (EXPLOSION) (CHEERING) Why the hell is everyone just standing around? There's a dogfight in the sky. We're in a goddamn warzone! These people are nuts. (SHOUTING AND CHEERING) I can't be the only one who thinks that this is terrifying, German planes over the city. It's not good. It shows they're getting closer every day. And... they've been dropping propaganda leaflets up and down the coast as well. So why is nobody scared? Don't mistake fortitude for fearlessness. You know, this new job, it's... what I've been waiting for it all my life. You don't have to explain yourself. I've never had a problem leaving. Jobs, cities, girls; you give me ten minutes and my bags are packed. And are your bags packed? I'm halfway there. The evacuation of British children is going smoothly and efficiently. The Ministry of Health says great progress is being made with the first part... Excuse me! Railways, the road transport organisations, the local authorities and teachers, the voluntary workers and the householders in reception areas... Shall we sit here? Yes. Are all playing their part splendidly. Well, it's bigger than I expected. Well, yes, it's for all the people. Have you really never been curious to come? I suppose. It simply never occurred to me that I might be the one missing out. That there, the er, Ostrava, that's a Polish vodka, right? It's Czechoslovakian. But it's on the border with Poland. Good enough. Oh, no, no, no, no. I want the whole bottle. Mr. O'Hara, erm it's not my place to say, but you may have a problem. Just give me the bottle, Adil. Very well. You don't need to send coffee up to my room. Oh. I'm sorry, Mr. Hamilton, I just thought, I know you work long hours and... While I appreciate the attempts at a friendship, there is a line and I think... Of course, Mr. Hamilton. I... I am sorry if I crossed it. Right. Yes. Er, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I... Please. You have nothing to apologise for, sir. Right. I didn't know you'd taken up smoking. I was just looking at it. It's only a lighter, Sonny. Of course. It's only a lighter. It's only a few drinks. A few meals. A sob story at the end and Betsey handing over her wages to help her poor old mum. I didn't come here for a handout. Just thought you'd help yourself. It's all right for you. Places like this. You wouldn't understand. Believe me... I understand. Betsey offers you anything, you say no. She's not gonna drop her knickers for you just because you throw some of your cash around. That's the other thing. She doesn't ever find out about this. Do you know the worst thing? She still thinks the world of you. Even after all you've done to her. Is he worse? Running a fever. Blood pressure's low. It's er... a gift. You can put it on the table. Hey, Joe. Hey, there, buddy. You have not gone yet? Tomorrow. After my last broadcast. How do I look? Terrible. My wife is on the train now from Newcastle. I don't want her to worry. She will be angry. Because you crashed your plane? Because I will fly again. My unit was wiped out in Poland. In England, though... we found a home. And... Moje miasto to zawsze pada. Stan? Stan, I don't understand you, buddy. Nurse! Nurse! Somebody! Out of the way. Out of the way, please. (CHOKES) He's gone into shock. What's happening? You're gonna help him, right? Outside. Wait outside. Is he OK? (ROMANTIC, CINEMATIC MUSIC) (MUSIC FINISHES) Oh. They have an interval. Look who it is. Like in a proper theatre. Ahem. I'm sorry, I have to go. What's the matter? Excuse me. Do you mind? I'm sorry. Lady Hamilton. Will you arrange a car? I've seen enough. You have the right to live your own life and do as you wish. I asked you for a bloody car. ♪ Oh, how I remember ♪ 
♪ That night in September ♪ 
♪ When you said we were through ♪ 
♪ I cried through November ♪ 
♪ Long nights in December ♪ 
♪ Spending my days feeling blue ♪ (LAUGHTER) What are you laughing at, eh? We'll all be the same when the bloody bombs come down! Excuse me? Sorry, Mr. Garland, my mother. I don't care. Get this under control. Now. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. O'Hara? Hey. I didn't realise you were going to be here. Have you been to see Stan? Yeah. I just er wanted to bring him... this bottle Listen, Freddie. Stan's dead. I'm sorry. The doctor said it was septic shock, that... it happens and er... I'm sorry. What did he say? His last words. Well, he said he was going to fly again. Can I buy you a drink? I'm due back at base in an hour. You're a tough kid, Freddie. No, I'm not. We just don't have a choice. I'm sorry about this. Betsey. At least we know where you get it from. She'll be gone tomorrow. You don't know that. I just wish she'd come out and say it. That she regrets having me, that I was a mistake. Then I wish she'd go for good so I don't have to waste my time, waiting and hoping for her to come back. (BAND PLAYS UP TEMPO MUSIC) Hey! Exactly how good were my numbers? Like I said, could always be better. But they were going up. Week after week. Delane, I think we've got something special right here, right now. Trust me, it'll pass. I disagree. This is the story; a nation standing alone on the edge of war and you want to end our entire foreign correspondence. The hillbillies didn't wanna hear about my brother in the Argonne Forest in 1918 and they sure don't want to hear about this right now. I'm not asking you to support intervention. Good. Because over one hundred thousand fine American men never made it home last time and it didn't change a goddamn thing. We can't just turn our backs on the people here. Sleep it off, Joe. When you're in a lifeboat, it's best to stop rocking. Listen to me. We can make a difference and we don't have to strap on a gun or set foot in a cockpit, just through words on the radio. Are you done? Yeah, I guess I am. Have a good flight. Mr. Delane. I hope you have a safe flight. Thank you, Mr. Garland. Do you wish us to send someone up to Mr. O'Hara's room to make sure he's ready? I believe Mr. O'Hara is staying. What happened? Well, that's the trouble with someone who talks for a living. Sometimes they just don't know when to shut up. Freddie says you were with Stan when he... I'm sorry. Me too. Can I help at all? Actually... yeah, you can. You can get me some ice. I've never been summoned before. We shouldn't have looked over at her Ladyship in the cinema. Eyes and ears at the back of her head. Could tell we were gossiping. She can't sack me anyway. I don't even work here. Stay calm. I will do the talking. (PIANO PLAYING) Good morning. Sonny, you ready to start? I think I might have embarrassed you last night. You didn't embarrass  me. You embarrassed yourself. You've got a whole new life for yourself here. Left us all behind. I don't feel like I belong anymore. You're going back to him. He needs me, Bets. You'll be needing money for the bus fare, then. I just wanted to see my little girl. Make sure she was fine. Don't you work her too hard, Sonny. I can't promise anything, Miss. Day. You were never a bloody mistake. So, what do you want to see us about, Your Ladyship? That's a lovely accent. Where are you from? Er, Edinburgh, Your Ladyship. Ah. The Athens of the North. Don't look so worried, my dear. As I've chosen to spend more time at the hotel, I thought it would be prudent to get to know some of my staff. Er, well, I actually don't er... We are all facing difficult times. And we need to pull together. You know what they say? Careless talk costs lives. Good. You may go. One more thing. How does it end? The motion picture. Oh. Erm, a bit of faffing, bit of a barney. He loves her, then he don't. Bit of a... slap. And then he says, "Frankly, my dear I don't give a..." Ahem! "a fig." Yeah. "I don't give a fig." Oh. I'm not saying I told you so. I think you are. Just, it's no wonder she doesn't visit much, if that's the reception she gets. Betsey... I was wrong about her. I apologise. Now, can we please focus on work? Go double time here into the middle eight and then... Good place for a trumpet solo. Nah. I got rid of it. You were right. I was rubbish. Are we ready? Yeah, we're ready. (STARTS PLAYING PIANO) You can't watch that door forever. If someone had told you and mum to stop? That was different. What you're doing... I know what you're going to say. That he's titled and it could never work. I was going to say, be careful. That won't be the last scare, not by a long chalk. I fear we won't all escape this war unscathed. Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst. Hello, America. This is A View From London with your correspondent Joe O'Hara. And I want to talk to you about two pilots. One was called Stanislav Radimsky. I only met him a few times. I know he was married. He liked to drink. Liked the Blackhawks. And I know he died defending this country... far from his home. He was 21 years old and his name's not going to go down in history. His time was short. But it meant something. Then there's the other pilot... Freddie Hamilton. Whose reaction to the death of his squad mate was to get back into that cockpit. Right now, as I'm speaking to you, he's taking to those skies again. There will be danger. And there will be young men who don't make it home. These are the stories unfolding every day, of heroism... heartbreak... honour and despair. But you don't give a damn about any of that. At least that's what I'm told. They say you'd rather be spoon fed mindless entertainment. But I know you're better than that. I know you deserve more. And I know you're listening. This is Joe O'Hara, signing off. Take care, America. Shouldn't you be on the plane? Stopped by to hear the final broadcast. Well, I hope you enjoyed it. Is this stuff all true? About the pilots? Does it matter? Yeah. It's true. It's a hell of a story, Joe. I think um... I think I'd like to hear how it ends. Mr. Garland. Where's decent that I can stay for less than two pounds a night? You'll struggle to find decent on that. Ah, you must know some places. Miss. Garland, Mr. O'Hara would like a recommendation for somewhere to stay. Where do we normally suggest? Oh, well, I hear 201 is very nice. 201? where is that? Second floor. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Delane may have kept me on the air, but the budget's been slashed. Don't concern yourself with it. We look after our own. I don't suppose your generosity... It will not extend to your bar bill, I'm afraid, no. Mr. Feldman, bring my bags back upstairs, please. I have work to do.
