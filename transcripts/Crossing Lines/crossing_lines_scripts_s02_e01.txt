 That was Eva. 
 Her and Sebastian found a wreck from two days ago, a burned up car. 
 Yeah? 
 She's sure it's Anne-Marie's. 
 Arabela! Arabela... 
 It was my boss. 
 He attacked me. He helped him. 
 Genovese's escaped. 
 I'm going back to Paris. 
 Excuse me? 
 On the next train back. 
 Louis is in trouble. 
 There is every possibility that he will be dead by tomorrow afternoon. 
 If you ever want to see the Daniels alive again, I want my brother-in-law brought here. 
 I cannot. 
 You have 24 hours. 
 Will she survive? 
 I don't know. 
 No change. 
 Will she wake up? 
 Well, they say they're not sure, but I don't think so. 
 Is it Anne-Marie? 
 No. 
 This woman walked away from the accident, we followed her tracks. 
 Maybe she's one of the women Anne-Marie saved. She left with two. 
 There were some locals at the scene now searching the area for anyone else. 
 She has to be out there. She couldn't have just disappeared. 
 There's a body. 
 A body? 
 Unidentified female from a crash. 
 I'm sorry, I thought you knew. 
 Why is she not identified? 
 She's badly burned. 
 She's in the morgue. 
 I need to see her. 
 No, Eva, wait. It's not a good idea. 
 Hickman? 
 Genovese called. 
 He escaped? 
 Seeger's boss was working for him. Hit her from behind. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Where are Eva and Sebastian right now? 
 They're here with us at the hospital. 
 I'll be at the heliport with the chopper in 15. 
 You're going after Genovese? 
 No, that's going to have to wait. 
 We've got to go to Paris. Louis is in trouble. 
 What? What... what's going on? 
 I'll tell you about it when I see you. Just be ready. 
 Hey! 
 Let me out of here! 
 Back away from the door! 
 Let me go. 
 Let me go, my husband... 
 Your husband is here with me. 
 If you don't back away, I will gut him right here. 
 Back off! 
 Okay! Okay. 
 Okay, I'm back. 
 Louis? Louis... 
 Oh, my love. 
 Look at me. Louis... 
 Eva? 
 I can't open it. 
 Is it her, Tommy? 
 I don't know. 
 They have to check her DNA. Anne-Marie's mother is on her way. 
 There has to be proof. 
 I agree, but we need to go. 
 The Major's in trouble. 
 You said Seeger's boss hit her? 
 Aye, she has a lump on her head, but she feels more responsible than hurt. 
 We left her with the injured woman we found at Anne-Marie's accident. 
 Good. 
 There's nothing good about the accident. 
 She has something to do. 
 Time to think is not always helpful. 
 We have until 1:00 p.m. tomorrow. 
 Or help a war criminal escape prison? 
 Which is not going to happen. 
 If we don't find the Major and his wife... 
 Dimitrov will execute the two of them. 
 What does Louis have to do with this war criminal? 
 This... this... this Bardov? 
 Bardov is Dimitrov's brother-in-law, and Dimitrov is responsible for the death of Louis' son Ãtienne. 
 Dimitrov killed Major Daniel's son? 
 Well, he's responsible for it, yes. 
 Right, we have less than 19 hours, but unless I'm missing something, we have absolutely no idea where to start. 
 No, we have a relationship with someone who may be able to point us in the right direction. 
 We do? 
 Well, you know him. 
 Lev Marianski. 
 The Russian businessman. 
 We... we rescued his son in the south of France. 
 Right, the kidnapping. 
 Why would he help us? 
 Well, he's on his way here right now with what he thinks he might give you an idea as to where Dimitrov would hold high-value hostages. 
 Helping us could be really dangerous for Mr. Marianski. 
 Well, he... he made it clear to me that he was aware of all the risks. 
 This field office is at your disposal. 
 If there's anything they can't provide, just call me, and it will be yours. 
 You're not staying? 
 No, I have to go to the ICC. 
 Dimitrov knew that I had taken Bardov out of custody 11 times since he's been incarcerated. 
 And only seven of those were official. 
 He has a source inside the ICC prison. 
 Yes, so it is essential at least it appear that I am making all the arrangements for his transfer. 
 Good luck. 
 Dorn? 
 Does Louis know Rebecca is the reason that their son was murdered? 
 Bardov is a war criminal. If this is about his imprisonment, and Louis had nothing to do with that, then it's Rebecca. 
 It's Rebecca who prosecuted him with you. 
 Right? 
 No. 
 No? 
 No, Louis doesn't know. 
 And I would appreciate it if you could keep it just between the two of us until I can find a suitable time to tell him. 
 Thank you, Hickman. 
 Stay away from us. 
 I will enjoy so much playing with you. 
 Detective Hickman. 
 Mr. Marianski. 
 It's very good of you to come. 
 You gave me back my son. 
 Yeah. 
 I am in your debt, and I am a man who repays his debts. 
 I've brought some files that might be helpful. 
 All of the records I kept. 
 I acted mainly as Dimitrov's business agent, procuring buildings and maintaining his records. 
 What, like his accountant? 
 Close. 
 Yes? 
 Mr. Dimitrov. 
 Marianski has arrived at the ICC Field Office. 
 He's with them now? 
 Yes, he is. 
 I knew he was among those betraying me. 
 The usual arrangements have been made. 
 Good. 
 Very good. 
 This looks like every building Dimitrov owns in Europe. 
 There are quite a few, but not all of them are empty or good places to hold hostages. 
 This is great. 
 We should be able to narrow it down quite a bit. 
 I was treated badly by him the entire time I was his employee. 
 All of us were. We were like... like dogs to him. 
 So you're turning on him because he was a shite boss? 
 Suppose I said there was a sum of money that I'd like to turn over to my boy? 
 Enough for him to start his life with all the opportunity he could need... but I can't do it until Dimitrov is out of the picture. 
 So you're trying to get rid of him? 
 Use the files to put him away. 
 Forever. 
 How do you feel? 
 I'm dizzy. 
 Careful. 
 I'm fine. It's okay. 
 But what about you? 
 There was blood. 
 I stabbed one of them... with scissors. 
 I could have told them about fighting with you. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I should have never gone back to the apartment that night. 
 That was stupid and childish. 
 No apologies. 
 Do you know where we are? 
 I don't understand. 
 Why take us hostage? 
 They probably only used me to get you. 
 Yes, but why not just kill us? 
 Maybe they're planning on it. 
 Not for a while. 
 What do you mean? 
 They brought us food, Rebecca. 
 They want us alive. 
 You have definitely repaid us anything that you think you might owe us. 
 Thank you. 
 My pleasure. 
 Well, maybe I'll see you soon. 
 Maybe. 
 You don't think so? 
 Very little escapes Dimitrov's attention. 
 Very little. 
 He's been watching me since we fell out. 
 The good news is, whatever happens to me, if you can put Dimitrov away for good, my son will be more than fine. 
 Just... don't doubt for a second that he will kill your boss or any of you. 
 Show him no mercy. 
 Be careful. 
 He all but knew he was going to get killed for helping us. 
 I'd feel a lot better if we all went back inside. 
 Actually, I don't even think they noticed I was here, Tommy. 
 Still, man, better safe, right? 
 Yeah. Wait. 
 Wait, wait... 
 He said Dimitrov... 
 He said Dimitrov was watching him. 
 It sure looks like it. 
 But wh... why let him come into a building and... and talk to us? I mean, clearly he knew he was here. 
 Maybe he didn't know it was us he was coming to talk to. 
 He left his château with a bunch of files and went to an ICC Field Office on the same day that Dimitrov kidnaps a French major? 
 It's like he wasn't worried about what he was going to tell us. 
 There's probably nothing in those files that we can use. 
 Then we're back to zero. 
 Anything we can use as a weapon. 
 A loose brick, a piece of glass. 
 I don't even want to know what's on these walls. 
 We need something to make them take me out of this room. 
 What? 
 You'd leave me here alone? 
 Just as long as necessary, don't worry. You should eat. 
 No thanks. 
 Come on, just the bread. 
 Ugh. You sure they're not trying to kill us this way? 
 Louis? 
 This could be... 
 Use this. 
 Wait. 
 Let me out of here! 
 Hey! Let me out of here! 
 Keep your wits about you. This is not a place to let your defenses down. 
 Stay alert. 
 They are bringing Bardov down now, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you put all these men in here, sir? 
 Not all. 
 They are war criminals? 
 No. 
 Some of them are just accused. 
 They haven't stood trial yet. 
 If they are convicted, the proper prison will be negotiated for them. 
 You know, I never really believed in evil before, but it's... 
 Are you familiar with the writings of Joseph Conrad? 
 No, sir. 
 "Belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary men alone are quite capable of every wickedness." 
 He wrote that. 
 Excuse me. 
 Was Marianski helpful? 
 He's dead. 
 Oh, God. 
 Gunned down right outside our building. 
 He knew they'd know. 
 Well, he said he was being followed. 
 You spoke to him? 
 Oh, yeah, the hitters got him when he was leaving, after he talked to us. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah, Dimitrov let him talk to us. 
 They could have killed him when he was in the building. 
 But Dimitrov wasn't worried about what Marianski would tell you because he's holding them somewhere Marianski wouldn't know. 
 Maybe it's a building that Dimitrov bought after they fell out. 
 Within the past two years. 
 That's exactly what I needed to know. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Okay, we're looking for a real estate transaction made in the last two years, something that Marianski wouldn't know anything about. 
 Most of what he's done in the last two years is divest himself of everything. It's like he's cashing out. 
 The only thing that he's bought at all in this time frame is a London minor league football club. 
 A football club? 
 You call it soccer. 
 I know what a football club is. 
 When he bought the club, did it come with a stadium? 
 Black Tiger Stadium in Edgeware. 
 Well, we're not going to be able to get around London without the help of someone, someone at the Met, someone important. 
 ♪ Let's get it on ♪ 
 ♪ Let's love, baby ♪ 
 ♪ Oh, sugar ♪ 
 ♪ Let's get it on... ♪ 
 Sir? 
 Whoa! 
 * We're all sensitive people * 
 Dorn, sir! 
 What? What did you say? 
 I'm sorry, Chief Inspector, but you told me if I ever got a call from a man named Dorn at the ICC, I was to contact you immediately. 
 Oh, piss off! 
 Was that you singing? 
 Dorn, you old sod! 
 You caught me at my weekly Karaoke indulgence. 
 Was the Chief Inspector going over well? 
 The crowd loves me! 
 Hey, you were just cheering three blokes singing the bloody Spice Girls! 
 Anyhow, listen, you're not one for a casual catch-up. What can I do? 
 I need you to help me with something. 
 Carl Hickman. Vittoria, Berger, McConnell. 
 Chief Inspector Miles Lennon. 
 Yeah. 
 Welcome to London. 
 Sit in the chair there. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Who is he? 
 Thank you. 
 That's all? 
 Yes. 
 I failed? 
 No, not at all. In fact, you're perfect. 
 Wait outside. 
 And remember my admonitions. 
 Yes, sir. 
 
 
 
 I wanted to see the two of you in the same room, to confirm that you were the same size and height. 
 Why would you need a decoy of me? 
 Your brother-in-law has taken prisoner people who are very dear to me. 
 How is that my concern? 
 Because he said he would let them go if I helped you to escape. 
 What? 
 More than that. 
 He knows every time we have left here together. 
 Precisely every time. 
 Son of a bitch wants to kill me. 
 Exactly. 
 How can I help you? 
 Welcome to New Scotland Yard. 
 Right, these lads and lady are from the ICC, and need our help in rescuing their leader and his wife from a Russian gangster. 
 Sounds like a bloody penny dreadful. 
 Someone remind me to write an opera about this. 
 You're not actually writing that down to remind me, are you? 
 Some of them are a tad gullible, but the men and women in this room are the best we have at their jobs. 
 Tactical, comms, counter-intelligence. 
 Bring them up to date. 
 We rewound CCTV images around the stadium, and there has been movement in the last 24 hours, but not in the last 12. 
 Did you see the Major or his wife? 
 A couple of vehicles parked close, men surrounded one figure and they rushed him through quickly, but we couldn't get a very good look. 
 How many? 
 At least 10 unique figures moving in and out, but there's no way to know how many are posted on the inside. 
 Are these the schematics of the stadium? 
 Yeah, but they're more than 10 years old, and the building's been closed for almost that long and has fallen into disrepair. 
 No one knows what it looks like below. 
 Disrepair? Looks like a pile of shite. 
 You're McConnell? 
 Yeah, Police Services... 
 Northern Ireland. 
 I know your family very well. 
 How? 
 I reckon you know the answer to that, Tinker. 
 Only one question remaining. 
 Which is? 
 Well, since none of them was seen on any cameras, are you sure your boss is even inside? 
 No, I can't really say for sure. 
 It's the only place that makes sense. 
 I'm sorry, I can't authorize a major raid based on "It's the only place that makes sense". 
 Is this because you've got a problem with me? 
 I never said that. 
 We don't have a lot of time. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 But I need concrete knowledge before I put any of my people at risk. 
 I may have a way to get some cameras inside. 
 You brought them? 
 A few. 
 You can do that? 
 We need to use the buildings around the stadium and the sniper rifle. 
 Let me out of here! 
 You can scream forever. 
 No one can hear you. 
 Piss off. 
 Oh, you have spirit. 
 Does your cop husband appreciate your spirit? 
 I don't think so. 
 I don't think he appreciates you at all. 
 Screw you! 
 Screw me? 
 Why do women like you always think that they are so much better than a man like me? 
 Oh, you'll love this. 
 You'll love this, but you better not bite. 
 Hey! 
 You're going to die for this. 
 You're next. 
 This Sebastian of yours, his cameras going to work? 
 Never seen a gadget of his fail. 
 Ought to be fun. 
 Not for nothing, but, uh... 
 McConnell... he's good. 
 How long have you known him? 
 Six months. 
 And you think I don't know the real him. 
 That's funny. 
 He's good inside. 
 Good where it counts. 
 Bothering you? 
 No, no more than usual. 
 Are you high right now? 
 That's subtle. 
 I'm going up against armed suspects with you. 
 I want to know the situation. 
 I take pain meds, but they aren't as strong as they used to be. 
 Codeine pills instead of morphine patches, I know. 
 I researched you all before you arrived. 
 What web site has my prescription history? 
 Also, Dorn did give me a bit of a heads-up. 
 Well, like you with Tommy, we don't always see eye to eye. 
 Actually, he did tell me that you were someone whose judgement I should trust. 
 That's good enough for you? 
 I know you know how it feels to devote your life to something, to an institution, and then just have it betray you completely. 
 But do you know how it feels to have someone believe in you? 
 I mean, not just believe, but to step up, give you back the things that you thought you were going to lose forever? 
 Hope in the face of despair? 
 When this is over, maybe I'll tell you what Dorn did for me in the Falklands. 
 But for now... yeah, his word is good enough for me. 
 I've known the McConnell family for almost all my professional life. 
 Trust me when I tell you that none of them are, as you say it, "Good inside where it counts." 
 Who does that gobshite tosser think he is, judging me? 
 Look, I'm not trying to defend him or anything, but he's got a point. 
 I mean, he's probably had some professional run-ins with your family, not pleasant ones, I imagine... 
 This is you not defending him? 
 You know how many times people question me about my father? 
 So what? It doesn't make it right. 
 No, but it makes it inevitable. 
 Right, let's mount up! And if nobody minds, I'd rather have not Belfast boy here stand behind me with a rifle. 
 Don't need to be behind you to end you, big man. 
 It was a joke! Joke. I was trying to ease the tension. 
 Come on then, let's go find your boss. 
 Hang him up. 
 Take that off! 
 Come on... come on! 
 The cameras are inside these low-velocity rifle rounds. 
 You are kidding. 
 We've tried them. They work. 
 Yeah, there's only one real problem with the low-velocity. 
 Wind. 
 Wind. 
 2 Para, Falklands. 
 Where did you learn to shoot? 
 My da taught me, to protect us from you paras. 
 Okay, Tommy, pick a window, the wind is calming. 
 Nice shot. 
 Let's hope we get an image. 
 Look. 
 Officer Seeger. 
 Officer Seeger? 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Of course. Regional Commander... 
 Jonkers. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I came to tell you we located your boss, Commander Bergen. 
 Have you arrested him? 
 Apparently shot himself. 
 He's dead? 
 The shame of today was too much for him to handle. 
 Being taken hostage in the escape. 
 At least that's how the report will read. 
 He helped a prisoner escape. 
 What difference does it make now, Seeger? He's dead. 
 But that isn't the truth. 
 We're the police, Seeger. The truth is what we say it is. 
 Our small department can't afford a scandal. 
 I'm sure you understand that. 
 Inspector? 
 Thank you. You made a wise choice. 
 Sir? 
 Where is he now? 
 He's at the morgue, but don't concern yourself with that. Go home and rest. 
 You've earned it. 
 Prisoner Bardov is being released in my custody. 
 Michel Lechnya Dorn, ICC Prosecutor. 
 Document's in order. 
 He's leaving. 
 Strap him in. 
 Yes. 
 I have Bardov. 
 I'll text you an address in Belgium. 
 It should take several hours to get here. 
 When you arrive, pull in, and you'll see my vehicle. 
 They will be there in three hours. 
 I want everyone who comes dead. 
 Everyone. 
 That's the last one, Tommy. 
 Thanks. I needed more pressure. 
 Yeah, well, we still have no trace of the Major, and only a couple of hours left. 
 Wind is calming. 
 What the hell is that? 
 I don't know. 
 No, that's definitely him. 
 He is alive. 
 Barely. 
 I need some time. 
 Well, we don't have time. 
 If we move now, Dimitrov will know that he's not getting Bardov. 
 Then he'll just go back into hiding, and this will just continue. 
 How much time do you need? 
 30 minutes. Just 30 minutes, and this will be done. 
 It'll be over, forever. 
 All right, we'll do our best, Dorn, but I've got to tell you something. 
 I don't know if he's going to last 30 minutes. 
 Is this the cop, Commander Bergen, the suicide? 
 Suicide? 
 I thought they said he was killed in the line of duty, taken hostage or something like that. 
 Have you ever seen a suicide not leave any gunshot residue? 
 I don't know about suicide. 
 All I know is they don't want any autopsy. 
 We are the police. 
 The truth is what we say it is. 
 The truth is what we say it is... 
 This is ending. 
 But before it ends, I'm going to spend some precious time with your wife. 
 I want you to know that. 
 If you touch my wife, I will kill you. 
 Now that's funny. 
 One of them just hit the Major again. 
 Be more specific. Which one? 
 I'd like to give him a little something special. 
 The one with blood on his face. 
 Hickman, we've got to go! 
 What's going on? 
 The Major got himself free. He's going after them himself. 
 Yes, Hickman? 
 Things have changed, Dorn, we've got to move. 
 Save them. Save them. 
 Lennon! 
 We're on! Right, lads, let's go to work. 
 Come on, lads, quick as you can! 
 Right, that's going to let them know we're coming. 
 Hickman, take McConnell to the right. The rest of you, on me, to the left. 
 This way. 
 We're here. 
 Pleasure doing business with you, Dorn. 
 Nothing about this has been a pleasure. 
 I'm truly sorry you feel that way. 
 You targeted a child. 
 I wanted to do something loud. 
 The Daniel family were your weakness. 
 The boy was collateral damage. 
 Goodbye, Dorn. 
 It's over. 
 How did you... 
 Drones aren't the only vehicles that can be operated remotely. 
 How did you find me? 
 We've had a satellite tracking you ever since we met at that... bar with the nearly naked ladies. 
 We've recovered Louis and Rebecca. 
 They're safe. 
 Bardov is back in a cell. 
 Listen to this. 
 I wanted to do something loud. 
 The Daniel family were your weakness. 
 The boy was collateral damage. 
 This is your chance to surrender and face charges for the murder of Étienne Daniel. 
 Surrender? 
 Dorn, you are in my country. 
 How the hell do you think you will ever get me across a border? 
 I own this region. 
 It would be more correct to say, "My brother-in-law owns all the criminals of Tula and the area around it." 
 What I am offering you is protection from them. 
 By arresting me? 
 My brother-in-law is a traitor to his people. 
 His days are numbered. 
 One last time. 
 Walk out with me, and you will live. 
 If you don't, I cannot guarantee your safety. 
 Go to hell. 
 And if you think you will ever get out of Russia, you are as foolish as you are old. 
 Tomorrow I will be older, and you will not. 
 One call, Dorn! 
 One call, and you will never leave these woods. Never! 
 I knew you would come for us, Carl. 
 Thank you. 
 I was asked today if I knew what it was like to have someone believe in me when no one else did. 
 What a day, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Good job, everybody. 
 Ah... 
 ICC Hickman. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, thanks. Thank you. 
 Anne Marie's mother went to the morgue with DNA samples already processed. 
 Already? How could they be so fast? 
 Her mother was a doctor. 
 She had Anne-Marie genetically tested for autism when she was a kid. 
 So then they... the DNA... 
 It's a match. 
 So the body... is Anne-Marie? 
 The body got picked up two hours ago. It's on the way back to France. 
 I forgot my phone. 
 See you there. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry, I just forgot my phone. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
 She was going to be a special one. 
 She was smart. 
 She asked a lot of questions. 
 The good ones. 
 The right ones. 
 Yes. 
 I know. 
 Back in the beginning of this, uh, team... 
 Louis asked me if I wanted to feel like a cop again. 
 I did want that. 
 Mostly. 
 Mostly? 
 This part I didn't need. 
 The part where you lose someone. 
 I guess... we were all kind of alone when the Major brought us together. 
 I was. 
 Sebastian, Tommy... 
 You had your own things. 
 That's an understatement. 
 Maybe what he meant by "feeling like a cop again" was being part of a family. 
 When you are a family, sometimes you lose people. 
 But you don't have to lose them alone. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe. 
 Why don't you come with us for a drink? 
 For Anne-Marie. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe now that we're family, I can start calling you Carlton. 
 Or not. 
 Okay. Or not.
