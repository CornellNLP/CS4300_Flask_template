 Double episode: also contains 03x01 - Redux 
 Marco, you all right? 
 Been waiting a long time for this, Andrea. 
 Go go go! 
 Quiet! 
 Marco! Upstairs! 
 sh1t. 
 There are three of them. 
 Looks like they've been here for months. 
 Recognize anyone of them? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh my God! 
 Pietro Fonti, taken from a car park in Rhode Island when he was 13. 
 13... 
 Jesus. 
 What's that? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe nothing. 
 Get an ambulance. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 Turn around. Hands in the air! 
 Come on. Turn around. 
 Put the gun down. Drop... 
 Hey, wait! OK? 
 Just wait. Look... 
 I'm unarmed. 
 You found me, Inspector. 
 Let's talk. OK? Just talk. 
 Just tell me where she is. 
 Please. 
 I'm not going to prison. 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 No! 
 Just tell me where she is. 
 That's all I wanna know. 
 OK? 
 You'll never find her! 
 No! 
 "You'll never find her!" 
 INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, The Hague Silence General Wombosi. 
 Is that your response? 
 Did you pose a question, Mr. Dorn? 
 Look at the screens in front of you. 
 Crimes against children, crimes that include mass murder, ethnic cleansing. 
 Those are the charges that have been assessed and levelled against you, sir. 
 What say you? 
 You had the charges, for which you have no evidence. 
 I have no personal connection to any of these crimes. 
 I'm not required to answer such lies. 
 Get to the point, Mr. Dorn. 
 Well, then I'll just deal with irrefutable facts. 
 We have provided concrete evidence that you have ruled your country with an iron fist for 13 years. 
 And I will rule it for another 13 years, once this charade is over. 
 Once this is over, General, you will never again leave your prison cell. 
 I thank the court, but we have refuted all evidence blaming General Wombosi. 
 If Mr. Dorn continues to insists my client is guilty of these terrible acts committed in the East Congo, I say, prove it. 
 Michel... 
 I just found... 
 Mr. Dorn? 
 You asked for proof connecting you personally to these crimes. 
 General, did you order the execution of hundreds of villagers in 2013? 
 These are encrypted emails showing that foreign mercenaries killed those villagers in Banui under orders personally given by you. 
 If it please the court, I ask for a recess to study this new allegation against my client. 
 Recess granted. 
 Where did you get that evidence from? 
 I'd tell you but I'd have to kill you. 
 Does he have any more, your source? 
 He says he has a lot more. 
 We've got a problem. 
 Well, where you got that from, your timing was perfect. 
 A little bit more of this stuff, and that b*st*rd's conviction will be assured. 
 Oh, you would have got that conviction no matter what. 
 No, they've been clever. 
 Really clever. 
 It's been a good day, Sophie. 
 Thank you for it. 
 No, thank you, Michel. 
 And thank you for convincing me to be your second. 
 Good night. 
 Here. 
 Good night, dear. 
 Sleep well. 
 Oh, thank you, Jan. 
 Take me home, I'm exhausted. 
 Hey... come, please. 
 Basta! (Enough!) 
 Costante? 
 Inspector Costante, my name is Michel Dorn, I'm the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court at The Hague. 
 How can I help you, Mr. Dorn? 
 Miss Sophie Baines, my second, has been kidnapped. 
 When? 
 11 hours ago. 
 Her chauffeur has been executed. 
 A small bore bullet to his head. 
 So you want me to advise the investigator in charge? 
 You are the best kidnapping investigator in Europe. 
 I want you on a plane. 
 INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, The Hague Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 Inspector Marco Costante. 
 Inspector Costante? 
 Don't worry, I'll let him in. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Sure. 
 It's an honour to meet you, sir. 
 I can't tell you how much we appreciate your help. 
 I didn't get your name. 
 Arabela Seeger, formerly with the Rotterdam PD. 
 You're with the Cross Border Unit? 
 I was, until it was shut down 6 months ago. 
 Yeah, I heard about Major Louis Daniel. 
 That was a tragedy. 
 Yes, it was. 
 What about the rest of your team? 
 Carl Hickman? 
 You know Hickman? 
 Only by reputation. 
 He went home. 
 As did the others. 
 So you were the only one who stayed with the court? 
 That's right. 
 Just me. 
 What about your... forensic IT guy? 
 I heard he was pretty good. 
 Sebastian Berger? 
 Yeah. 
 I haven't seen him in a while. 
 Inspector Costante, Carine Strand. 
 Carine is our senior investigator for the court. 
 He's ready to see us. 
 The driver is Jan Ottendorf, killed at close range, single shot to the head. 
 No traceable fingerprints, forensics are running hair and fibre, but they're not hopeful. 
 We did find this. 
 A mobile phone. 
 Where? 
 In a puddle on the passenger side. 
 Whose is it? 
 The IT guys couldn't get anything off of it. 
 There's too much water damage from the mud. 
 Still no ransom demand? 
 No. 
 And the clock is ticking. 
 We desperately need some answers. 
 I gathered you think this, ah, dictator Wombosi took her. 
 Everybody saw Sophie walk into the courtroom with that evidence. 
 And kidnapping is very much Wombosi's style. 
 He's made thousands of his enemies disappear. 
 What are your thoughts? 
 Well, I think this whole attack was obviously premeditated. 
 The driver stops in the muddy fields, 6 kilometres from the victim's house, with no sign he was pursued... 
 You think someone got to him? 
 I think they threatened him. 
 Or more likely his family. 
 They kill him anyway. 
 Leaving no witnesses. 
 Professionals. 
 It'll be really helpful to find out whose phone that is. 
 What about your, ah, IT guy, Sebastian? 
 Berger. 
 Do you wanna bring him in? 
 Can you find him? 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 I have a text from Wombosi's lawyer. 
 He'll accept questioning in camera. 
 Would you like to have a look at him? 
 Sophie's a... close friend of Mr. Dorn, yeah? 
 Very. 
 She worked so hard to put Wombosi away, it's, uh... it's personal to her. 
 Well, I can understand that. 
 I was sorry to hear about what happened. 
 Your suspect, who shot himself. 
 Thank you. 
 You tracked him for a long time. 
 Well, it's why I became a police officer. 
 To find him. 
 He was my, ah... last and best lead. 
 All the other evidence had closed? 
 My sister was abducted when I was 12 years old, Inspector. 
 The trail has gone very, very cold. 
 You never stopped looking for her. 
 I never will. 
 No matter what it takes. 
 I'll have someone get you some coffee. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, black please, no sugar. 
 Yes, uh, two coffees, black please. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Elleanor Delfont-Bogard. 
 But people usually just call me Ellie. 
 And you are? 
 I just graduated from the Met Police Service with a degree in forensics psychology. I... hope you don't mind if I observe. 
 And if I do? 
 You can observe. 
 We've come as you asked, Mr. Dorn. 
 Thank you for agreeing to speak with us, General Wombosi. 
 What is this about, Ms. Strand? 
 My second, Sophie Baines, went missing last night. 
 Is that so? 
 Her driver was shot and killed. 
 And you think my client had something to do with this? 
 Are you saying he didn't? 
 The smile. 
 It's very telling, don't you th... 
 Of course, he didn't. 
 But he knows who did. 
 I assure you, Ms. Strand, my client had nothing to do with this. 
 But you should not be surprised. 
 God punished those who persecute the mighty. 
 Let me be absolutely clear: should any harm befall Ms. Baines, I will find out from whose hands it came, and they will pay a price. 
 Oh, a price will be paid, Mr. Dorn. 
 A very heavy price. By you, and by anyone who helps you. 
 Go, go, go, go. 
 Go. Yeah. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Good to see you. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Hello. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Arabela, right? 
 Right. 
 Um, could we talk over here? 
 Sure. 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 We'll just be over there. 
 What's with you and... 
 Kathrin. 
 She got a new job. 
 She's living in The Hague now, so, um... 
 We've been alternating weekends these past few months. 
 That's amazing. Good for you, Sebastian. 
 And you're still at the court? 
 Investigating war crimes for the court, yes. 
 And yourself? 
 I've been having a hard time finding a job. 
 I guess I did a few too many warrantless searches. 
 Would you like a job? 
 Are you serious? 
 Yes. 
 But... 
 What am I gonna do with him? 
 A price will be paid, Mr. Dorn. 
 A very heavy price. By you, and by anyone who helps you. 
 That son of a bitch enjoyed that. 
 Exactly what we might expect. 
 Not just a complete lack of empathy, but schadenfreude. 
 Schadenfreude is German for pleasure derived in seeing others suffer. 
 He's a pathological narcissist, wouldn't you say? 
 I understand Miss Delfont-Bogard just, ah, graduated from the Met Police Service. 
 And was first in her class in Cambridge before that. 
 We like to mentor here, Inspector. 
 What are your thoughts? 
 The man's a monster, for sure, but he has nothing to do with this. 
 Why not? 
 If she was being held to ensure an acquittal you would have received some kind of a ransom demand. 
 But we know that kidnapping is straight out of his play book. 
 Schadenfreude or not, he was genuinely surprised when he heard she'd been taken. 
 And kidnapping people in his own country is one thing but in The Netherlands? No. If he wanted her dead, why not just kill her? 
 Hello?! 
 Sebastian Berger. 
 Carine Strand. 
 This is Inspector Costante. 
 Hey. 
 Good to meet you. 
 I was able to clean up and repair the central processors on the mobile phone found in the mud. 
 It was a burner. 
 Who dropped it? 
 From the call list and GPS, I'd say it belonged to your missing prosecutor. 
 It's looking like Sophie had a throwaway phone. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Well, the question remains, what was she doing with a throwaway? 
 We think she was afraid someone might hack her work phone. 
 Why would you think that? 
 Because, someone did. 
 I've already alerted your IT guys. 
 It wasn't just Sophie's phone, but Dorn's, Arabela's and yours Inspector Strand. 
 I can see that Mr. Berger. 
 Who's hacking us? 
 Well, I can't identify the IP address, but whoever he is, he's got to be pretty sophisticated to get past the ICC firewall. 
 There's a fifth number being hacked. 
 Yeah, someone in London. 
 Luke Wilkinson, he's an inspector working for the Metropolitan Police. 
 Do we know how he's connected? 
 I can find out. 
 Can you send me his details to my phone? 
 You're being hacked. 
 My personal phone. 
 Doing it now. 
 Would you care for a drive? 
 Where to? 
 Sophie Baines' house. 
 Let's go. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice to meet you Mr. Berger. 
 And you. 
 What is it we're looking for, Inspector? 
 I'm not sure. 
 But I know Sophie didn't drop the burner by accident. 
 I was thinking the same thing. 
 She left it, hoping we'd find it. 
 Yeah. 
 And hoping it would help us find her. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Single mother. 
 Widowed. 
 War veteran. 
 Impressive woman. 
 Very. 
 What? 
 Maybe nothing. 
 It's The Hague Guardian. 
 He took the paper! 
 I got him! 
 I'll go 'round! 
 Get out! 
 Thanks. 
 Inspector Wilkinson? 
 Yeah. 
 Sir, Arabela Seeger with the ICC. 
 The ICC? 
 In The Hague? 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Sure. Give us five. 
 Tracking me down here on a Saturday. 
 It must be pretty important. 
 A prosecutor was kidnapped last night. 
 Sophie Baines. 
 She's been assisting in the trial of Fabrice Wombosi. 
 The wannabe Idi Amin. 
 Yeah, I've heard of him. 
 Look, what's this about, Ms. Seeger? 
 Whoever kidnapped Ms. Baines, hacked several phones, including yours. 
 Mine? 
 Why? 
 You've a military background, Inspector, five years in the army. 
 Yeah. Marksman. 
 But I was never posted anywhere near Africa. If that's where you're headed. 
 What about any of your open cases now with the Met. 
 I've got plenty, take your pick. 
 How many's plenty? 
 Uh, I dunno, a dozen maybe. 
 But I think I'd know if any were to do with Wombosi. 
 I hate to ruin your weekend, Inspector, but I'm gonna need you to fly back with me. 
 What for? 
 You are connected to this case in some way, and we need to find out how. 
 You must be Sebastian Berger. 
 No. Everybody makes that mistake. 
 Are you sure? 
 'Cause I've bought a hot chocolate for Sebastian. 
 I'd hate to see it go to waste. 
 I'm Erik, his son. 
 Erik, of course. Well, I don't that your father would mind, do you? 
 Not at all. 
 OK. 
 Thank you. 
 You're most welcome. 
 Elleanor Delfont-Bogard. But please, call me Ellie. 
 Thanks for that, Ellie. 
 Not a problem. 
 It's an honour to meet you, Mr. Berger. 
 An honour? 
 Well, yes, your infiltration of the Cavalier Motorcycle Club alone should be taught to cadets. 
 How do you know about this? 
 I've studied all Cross Border Unit cases. 
 You're a very impressive person, Mr. Berger. 
 Police work's a pretty unusual career for your background. 
 The accent, right? 
 And the surname. 
 Your father's at the World Bank, isn't he? 
 He doesn't exactly approve of my career choice. 
 But you were attracted to the long hours, low pay and lack of prestige. 
 Well, I suppose I just wanted to make a difference. 
 Not just by writing cheques. 
 What is that? 
 Uh, satellite scanner. 
 The burner phone that Sophie dropped. 
 That'll pick it up. 
 And how are you getting on with the newspapers? 
 Running analytical metrics. Page by page. 
 What are you looking for? 
 Something worth stealing The Hague Guardian for. 
 Was that the man they chased? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 Inspector Strand managed to snap his photo as he drove off. 
 And you can ID him from that? 
 The resolution is a little soft at this distance but I'm working on it. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Hello?! 
 Hoping I was someone else? 
 I've sharpened the resolution here. 
 Yes, that's him. 
 What about the car outside Sophie's house, with German plates? 
 Stolen from a car hire in Hannover. 
 So we're looking for a German national? 
 Stolen from a car hire in Hannover, not necessarily by a German national. 
 Yes, but we should still get a description of Sophie to the Hannover police. 
 Doing it now. 
 Good. 
 This is Inspector Wilkinson, from the London Met. 
 Glad you could come over, Inspector. 
 Michel Dorn. Sit down. 
 Do you recognize this man? 
 Uh, should I? 
 We ran into him this afternoon, stealing newspapers from Sophie Baines apartment. 
 Sorry, I've never seen him before. 
 Figures. 
 I have. 
 Where? 
 In the court. 
 Wombosi's trial. 
 We should check CCTV. 
 I can show him. 
 Good. 
 Sorry, you said "figures"? 
 You don't think I know this guy. 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 I checked. 
 No one's called you from The Hague. 
 You checked my calls? 
 Was there a court order or my consent? 
 Are you telling me you mind? 
 Yeah. 
 That's exactly what I'm telling you. 
 A life is in danger, every second counts. 
 Please, accept our apology, of course, we should have asked for your permission. 
 Sebastian will erase all data that he collected immediately. 
 He already did. 
 Appreciate that. 
 Inspector Wilkinson, can we review some of Wombosi's holdings in the UK? 
 I'd like to see if any of them mean anything to you. 
 Yeah, good idea. 
 That was fun. 
 Don't take it personally. 
 Was that Marco Costante? 
 Yes, why? 
 I heard he retired. After that shooting. 
 We were told he took leave of absence. What shooting? 
 I don't know the details, just that some suspect killed himself a month ago. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I need your help with something. 
 Have any idea what this is? 
 No. 
 Is it connected to our case? 
 No. Personal. 
 16 spokes emanating from the centre. 
 Same images on the Indian flag. 
 Right. Saw that on Google. 
 I can try to dig deeper if you want. 
 I'll call you if I find something. 
 Thanks, man, appreciate it. 
 Yes. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 What is it, Michel? 
 Wombosi's lawyer has challenged the evidence Sophie gave us. 
 If we don't have her source to back it up, he will have it thrown out. 
 We have no idea who gave her that information. 
 We have to find out who. 
 And fast. 
 Carine, I had them put the boxes in the conference room, I hope that's OK. 
 It's perfect. 
 What are they? 
 Ah, Sophie's files from the Wombosi case. 
 We're gonna go through them, page by page. 
 Inspector Costante said he didn't think Wombosi had anything to do with her abduction. 
 He may be right. 
 In which case, someone else really wants her evidence. 
 Someone else had a motive. 
 For kidnapping Sophie. 
 Did you manage to get any sleep yet? 
 I'll sleep later. 
 I feel a little silly about the schadenfreude incident. 
 I was just trying to hard again, I guess. 
 Ellie, listen to me. 
 A professional killer shot Sophie's driver in cold blood, and if we don't find her, he will very likely kill her too. 
 And we will spend the rest of our lives knowing that we failed to save her. 
 You can't try too hard. 
 None of us can possibly try hard enough. 
 OK? 
 Dad? 
 Hey. 
 Time to sleep. 
 You OK? 
 Why can't I go to Mum's? 
 Because, I told you, she's out of town. 
 And, um, I wasn't really expecting this. 
 Can you come up? Now. 
 What is it? 
 The man in Sophie's house, we've got a name. 
 Sweet dreams. 
 Sleep. 
 Who is he? 
 Robert Penny. 
 How did you find his name? 
 I didn't. Inspector Costante did. 
 Nice. 
 He used a false passport to sign into the court. 
 But his own credit card paid for petrol for that stolen car in the station 2 kilometres away. 
 What have you got? 
 Robert Penny. War veteran. 
 He did 7 tours in Iraq, then left the Royal Navy in 2010. 
 He's been working as a gun for hire ever since for those private security contractors. 
 I know that one. 
 Which one? 
 Melvoy Security. 
 They've got offices all over the world but their chief of security Dominic Fitzroy is based out of Amsterdam. 
 What was your business with him? 
 Uh, I had a few routine questions about one of his clients, Argento. 
 Argento? They make smartphones. 
 Yep, smartphones, other mobile devices. 
 Had some suspicious high value bank accounts out of London. 
 What the hell does Wombosi have to do with smartphones? 
 I bet Sophie could tell us. 
 Or at least her source could. 
 Who are you working for? 
 You can talk to me, you know. 
 Eat. 
 Not bad. 
 You know, I wouldn't have chosen eggs for my last meal. 
 It is my last meal, isn't it? 
 You killed my driver. 
 You strand me here. 
 You're just waiting on orders to kill me. 
 You're just a man who follows orders. 
 Did you learn that in the Navy? 
 What were you? Special Forces? 
 And how do you know that? 
 Tattoo on your arm. 
 I was in the Navy too. 
 7 years. 
 Sorry Miss Baines. 
 We're on opposite sides on this one. 
 
 
 
 Costante? Where are you going? 
 Amsterdam. 
 Inspector Wilkinson and I are going to see this security contractor, Fitzroy. 
 We're running out of time. 
 If we don't hurry up and find Sophie Baines, they will kill her. 
 You realize this isn't about Sophie Baines, Mr. Dorn? 
 She's just the means to an end. 
 To her source, I know. 
 And I know that that's why Wombosi's lawyer challenged the evidence that she gave us. 
 If we don't find backup for it in 48 hours they will have it thrown out of court. 
 And you still don't think that Wombosi is behind her kidnapping? 
 I don't. 
 Oh, I'm sure there's a connection. 
 Look, I know she's a friend of yours, I understand how difficult this is. 
 I will not have her blood on my hands. 
 I cannot. 
 We'll find her. 
 AMSTERDAM, Netherlands Nice place. 
 Being a gun for hire pays well. 
 Inspectors Costante and Wilkinson. 
 We were expecting you. 
 May I offer you some tea? Coffee? 
 Uh, black... 
 We'd just like to see Mr. Fitzroy. 
 Of course. Right this way. 
 A bloke could get used to this. 
 We provide services for clients all over the world. 
 General Wombosi isn't one of them. 
 Someone hacked Miss Baines' phone. 
 And several others, including mine. 
 Now, we think that it may have been this man. 
 Robert Penny. 
 You know him? 
 Of course. 
 He's worked for me occasionally. 
 But not recently. 
 Do you have any idea how we could locate him? 
 Personnel files are protected information. 
 Sorry, but, I can't share those with you. 
 See, I'm particularly curious why he might have hacked my phone, Mr. Fitzroy. 
 Last time we spoke it was about one of your clients, Argento International. 
 And because this man worked for me in the past, you think there might be some connection between Argento and this kidnapping. 
 I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen, but I can assure you there's no connection whatsoever. 
 If I come across any information that might be useful I'll share it with you at once. 
 He's lying. 
 Oh, yeah, he is! 
 Well? 
 We've got trouble, Mr. Pemberton. 
 Can you contain it? 
 We won't have to. 
 For much longer. 
 Come on, start... start! 
 You'll need gasoline to start the engine. 
 You didn't think I'd be that careless, did you? 
 Well? 
 Well, that guy, Fitzroy's got one hell of a poker-face. 
 I'll give him that. 
 What have you got? 
 We've gone through everything there is to know about Argento, Melvoy Security and Wombosi. 
 If there is a connection, they've been careful to keep it offline. 
 Dad? 
 Didn't realize you were running a crèche, Sebastian. 
 What are you doing up? 
 Back to bed. Let's go. 
 It keeps beeping. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 It's a VHF signal. 
 Someone calling the number for Sophie's burner phone. 
 Comes from a quarry outside of Hannover. 
 Sophie? 
 She's calling her own phone. 
 I'll get the chopper. Let's go. 
 How far are we? 
 Less than 2 kilometres. 
 I have the live feed up, over there. 
 I'll contact emergency services. 
 You don't have to kill me. 
 I've got a daughter, just let me go, please! 
 You were a hero before, be a hero again. 
 Is that what you think I was back there in the desert? 
 A hero? 
 Move. 
 No. 
 Get up! Get up! 
 No! 
 Get on the f*cking boat, you bitch! 
 Move in closer. 
 Where is she? 
 Come on! Move! 
 Please! 
 Come on! 
 He gets into that boat, she's dead. 
 Please. 
 Just think what you're doing. 
 This is a tough shot, Inspector. 
 I've got it. 
 Get on the boat! 
 Let me go. 
 Keep moving. 
 Do it, now! 
 He's moving too much. 
 God! 
 Nice shot, Inspector. 
 Sophie, it's all right. 
 You're going to be all right. 
 Trust me. 
 Miss Baines? 
 I'm so sorry, but, we don't have much time. 
 We have less than 48 hours before your evidence against Wombosi is thrown out of court. 
 They kidnapped me to keep me away from my source. 
 The one who gave me the evidence against Wombosi. 
 We figured as much. 
 How can we find them? 
 I don't even know his name. 
 Thank you so much for coming back in. 
 If they killed my driver, they'll kill my source. 
 You must have been terrified. 
 Terrified, try angry. 
 You get some sleep? 
 You look great! 
 Must have been all that fresh air. 
 Let's see what progress we've been making with your source. 
 He's in grave danger, that fellow. 
 Thank you. 
 This look familiar, Miss Baines? 
 This is Sebastian Berger, his satellite scanner picked up the call that lead to your rescue last night. 
 Thank you, Mr. Berger, and yes, it does look familiar. 
 We searched your house and the person who abducted you was there already. 
 The only thing he took was a copy of The Hague Guardian. 
 I, ah, ran some analytics and, uh, selected a few ads that looked like they might have been posted to communicate information, but... it's difficult, without knowing the context. 
 Well, you were along the right lines. 
 "Sweet Muse, I saw you last Monday at 10am waiting on the bench... for the west-bound #95 bus toward Noordwijk. You looked up and smiled as I walked by. I knew at that moment, my life would never be the same. Let's get in touch. You choose the place." 
 Signed... 
 Mad about you. 
 What the... 
 What? 
 He gave you the time and location. 
 All I had to do was substitute last Monday for next Monday. 
 And when I got to the bus stop, I'd find the Wombosi documents in a sealed envelope taped to the underside of the bench. 
 We have a problem. 
 The person who took this from your home knows you circled this ad in the newspaper. 
 They can communicate directly with our source. 
 All they have to do is set-up a meeting as, uh, Sweet Muse and wait for him and kill him. 
 I never imagined anyone would get hold of this paper. 
 No, how could you have? 
 The next issue comes out tomorrow. 
 My guess is they've already posted a response to your source in it. 
 OK, we need to get to that paper before her source does, otherwise they'll kill him. 
 I'll get Ellie on it. 
 A present from Ellie, hot off the press. 
 There... 
 "Sweet Muse, Mad about you: a life-changing moment, the Café Rosa at 14:00 yesterday." 
 That's 14:00 today. 
 It's a death sentence and we can't warn him because we don't know who he is. 
 Yeah, but he knows who Sophie is though. 
 Yeah. 
 Her abduction was kept out of the press... nobody knows about it. 
 So... Dorn has a press conference, he announces her abduction. 
 The source won't show up because he knows that Sophie can't be there. 
 He may even realise that someone else placed the ad, they're trying to flush him out. 
 He'll know he's in danger. 
 Carl Hickman pulled something like this once, it... it, er... it worked. 
 Maybe it's gonna work again? 
 I'll tell Michel. 
 ROTTERDAM, The Netherlands. 
 Morning. 
 Hi. 
 Want a cup? 
 You're off to a late start today? 
 Ah, I got hung up at the office. 
 Again? 
 Hm. 
 Pemberton doesn't seem to realise that Europe is 9 hours ahead of California. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah, fine. 
 You seem on edge lately. 
 Just got a lot on at work. 
 More details from the court in The Hague... 
 In his ongoing trial at the International Criminal Court today, lawyers for General Wombosi seemed caught off guard by the... 
 Is this yours? 
 Yeah. Been looking for that. 
 Since when do you read The Hague Guardian? 
 You know me, I like to stay well informed. 
 Then don't forget the doctors appointment tomorrow. 
 I won't. 
 Chief Prosecutor Michel Dorn, made the announcement... 
 I gotta get dressed. 
 ... earlier today in The Hague. 
 Thank you for coming. Two days ago my esteemed colleague, the ICC investigator Sophie Baines was kidnapped. 
 Taken from her car, after her chauffeur had been assassinated. 
 An investigation is ongoing, but as of this moment we have no leads. 
 Anyone who has any information whatsoever... 
 God damn it, you told me the ICC had Sophie Baines at that quarry. 
 They did. 
 Then I need to remind you that my connection to this cannot be made public. 
 You find that leak... and you plug it up. 
 We've gone through the computer files and phone records of 3000 Argento employees. 
 Already narrowed the field down to 12 suspects. 
 Call me back when you've narrowed it down to one. 
 Well, we know that whoever abducted Sophie, did it to get to her source, to silence him. 
 Yeah. 
 You said when you got here that you didn't think it was Wombosi. 
 And I still don't. 
 OK. 
 It... it's someone else, someone who would have a big problem with the information that Sophie's source gave her, getting out. 
 Somebody how hired this man. 
 Robert Penny. 
 He was a mercenary. He would have worked for anybody who would write him a cheque. 
 Right. Luke Wilkinson looked at the list of Penny's past employers and one name stuck out. 
 Dominic Fitzroy, from... 
 Melvoy Security. 
 He denied any involvement. 
 But Luke's phone was tapped when he was investigating a certain client of Melvoy Security... 
 Argento International. 
 Jay Pemberton. 
 But we're missing a fundamental element... 
 Pemberton's motive. 
 Exactly! 
 Arabela, has a lead. 
 AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands. 
 This place is really beautiful in the summer. 
 They've got kayaks and, uh, paddle boats. It's fun! 
 You holidayed here as a kid? 
 My mother, she's Dutch, I grew up in a little town nearby. 
 What about your father, where's he from? 
 Are you asking why I'm a little bit brown, Inspector? 
 Brown? 
 No! No I'm not. 
 I'm joking! 
 My father is Nigerian, he moved to Holland when he was a boy. 
 That must have been some culture shock. 
 Yeah, you could say that. 
 So, who is this guy that we're meeting? 
 My contact said he's been deep undercover for two years now. That's all I know. 
 I did undercover once, on a drug bust. 
 Just didn't have the stomach for it. 
 Always looking over your shoulder, waiting. 
 Mm. 
 Get in! 
 Guess that's our ride. 
 Now! 
 Nice manners! 
 Inspector Seeger... and you must be Inspector Wilkinson. 
 Welcome, please sit down. 
 I apologise for the cloak and dagger. 
 I hope you didn't suffer any discomfort. 
 Nah, I like being blindfolded and bundled into the back of a van. 
 It was for your personal safety. 
 I'm embedded in the Sinaloa drug cartel. 
 They wouldn't look kindly upon our meeting. 
 You have a question? 
 The connection between Argento International and Fabrice Wombosi... what is it? 
 You look quite pleased with yourself. 
 Sophie had her lower clerk's laptop sent over, I just located the email sent by her source. 
 That's brilliant. 
 It was sent from an IP address in Delft, on February 19th. 
 Internet café? 
 Public library. 
 And he used a read only, a fake email address.   e  gordongekko@malescratcher.com  e   How do you know that's not his real name? 
 Because it's a character from the movie "Wall Street". 
 Oh well, that presents us with quite a problem doesn't it. 
 Fictional email address. 
 I have to go there and access the computer. 
 Maybe he left something behind in the browser cache or the cookies. 
 You wanna come? 
 Me, out in the field? 
 You look surprised. 
 Well, it's just sometimes I get the impression the others don't quite take me seriously as a cop. 
 You're young. 
 You have to give them some time. 
 Oh, and, ah... you might wanna grab your shoes. 
 OK. 
 Hi. 
 How'd it go? 
 Rough night, but it was worth it. 
 Er, long story, better told in a pub over a few pints. 
 OK, walk me through it. 
 Right. 
 Pemberton, the owner of Argento has been bribing Wombosi to smuggle coltan out of the Eastern Congo. 
 What's coltan? 
 Coltan is the metallic ore you find in the power supplies of jet engines and computers, smartphones. 
 Now, Wombosi has been using the same smugglers and routes as the cocaine cartels. 
 Out of Eastern Congo winding their way up through Central Africa and into Europe. 
 Nearly 14,000 tonnes of the stuff is getting shipped, smuggled out every year. 
 That is billions of Euros worth of coltan and it's all on the black market. 
 OK. So the... the evidence that Sophie gave Michel had nothing to do with coltan, it was about the massacre in Banui. So, where's the connection? 
 Banui. 
 It just so happens that these villagers' homes are sitting on the world's largest deposit of coltan. 
 And a protected game reserve, so mining's prohibited by international treaty. 
 OK. So you said coltan is a billion dollar business. 
 Yes. 
 So, Pemberton... bribes Wombosi... to mine the coltan, but it's illegal. 
 So he has to get rid of any and all witnesses. 
 We have no documents, no photos, nothing to substantiate. 
 That will stand up in court. 
 Nothing. 
 Oh, I meant to tell you, your son is adorable. 
 Thanks. 
 He takes after his mother. 
 But I didn't even know I was a father until quite recently. 
 That's a long story. 
 Must have come as quite a shock. 
 You could say that. 
 Excuse me, do you have a public computer? 
 Yes. 
 But you'll have to sign for it. 
 For security. We have a lot of valuable artefacts here. 
 Sure. 
 I doubt he used his real name. 
 One mistake's all we need. 
 Gordon Gekko. 
 Bollocks. 
 Your ID is WN457. 
 You put the card in the slot there. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you so much, sir. 
 This must be the oldest computer left in existence. 
 That's an old Packard Bell. 
 My first computer. 
 Gotta love Window 98. 
 There's nothing for me to work with here. 
 We better head back. 
 There's one more thing we could try. 
 Sir, do you still have the ID card for WN453? 
 Er, yes I do. 
 Forensics found one usable fingerprint on the ID card. 
 They're sending us the results now. 
 Should I get the others? 
 Not yet, let's see what we're dealing with first. 
 Simon Gilbert. 
 Let me check. 
 Argento International. 
 He's senior vice president there. 
 Do you have a solution to our problem? 
 Still finessing the details. 
 If I go down for this Fitzroy, you go down with me. 
 I don't go down, ever! 
 I hired you to protect my company, not yours. 
 You've got over 40,000 employees, worldwide. 
 3.000 of them in Rotterdam alone. 
 These things take time. 
 I don't have time, Fitzroy, and neither do you. 
 You said you had 12 name? 
 That's right. 
 And only 4 of them left the office early today. 
 It has to be one of them. 
 News? 
 We identified our source. 
 Excellent! 
 Sebastian found him. 
 Good. 
 Not me, Ellie. 
 Well done, you. 
 What's his connection? 
 Simon Gilbert, 34 years old. 
 He's the senior financial analyst at Argento's Rotterdam branch. 
 Apparently he was hand-picked by Jay Pemberton, straight out of Wharton. 
 Pemberton's also an alumni. 
 So, Pemberton was his mentor. 
 Well, there's a quote on Gilbert's profile that refers to Pemberton as the most important influence in his life, both as a friend and as a mentor. 
 Well, he obviously had a change of heart. 
 Well, if we've found our mystery man, it's only a matter of time until Argento does. 
 And we know if they find him, he's dead. 
 Get his mobile number, and address. Shoot it over to Arabela and Luke. 
 They need to get to his flat right away. 
 Thank you. 
 Mr. Gilbert isn't very tidy. 
 Someone got here before us. 
 No blood wounds... 
 Or bullet casings. 
 You wouldn't leave the country without your passport. 
 Or your wife. 
 So where is she? 
 Mr. Fitzroy... 
 Come with me please. 
 Now! 
 Leave your phone and laptop there. 
 I'm sorry, Mr. Gilbert is still not answering his line. 
 Please, we really need to speak with him. It's urgent. 
 Hey Arabela, what's up? 
 Yes... 
 I have Simon Gilbert's brother-in-law here, he says there's been a family emergency. 
 Do you know where we can find him? 
 Oh, I see. 
 When? 
 I'll let him know. 
 Mr. Gilbert is no longer with Argento. 
 Since when? 
 Since yesterday. 
 That was Arabela, Gilbert's flat's been tossed. 
 There's no sign of him or his wife. 
 The Dutch police are out looking for her now. 
 Sebastian, did you get us a GPS location on Simon's cell phone? 
 Just a second... 
 It's pinging off a tower about 500 meters from the Argento building in Rotterdam. 
 What, he never left the damn building? 
 He's still in there. 
 What am I doing here? 
 An emergency warrant, Argento International, in Rotterdam. 
 Someone's been leaking incriminating information, about Argento's dealings in Africa. 
 And I've narrowed it down, to you. 
 When we searched your computer, we found classified information for which you have no security clearance. 
 Never seen any classified information. 
 In your capacity in the financial department surely you've come across lawsuits, allegations, settlements made by Argento? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Perhaps you chose to share a little of this secret information, with the prosecutor named Sophie Baines? 
 I've no idea what you're talking about. 
 I don't know any Sophie Baines. 
 I'm sure you're aware of the consequences of divulging confidential company information. 
 If you're lying... it could be at a great personal cost. 
 How did you get that? 
 Where is she? 
 You're a lucky man, Mr. Gilbert. Such a pretty wife. 
 OK. 
 Just... just don't... don't hurt her. 
 Mr. Pemberton treated you like a son. 
 He handed you a career. 
 And you chose to pay him back like this? 
 He was like a father to me, but he is not the man that I thought he was. 
 He's been illegally smuggling coltan out of the East Congo. 
 Two years ago he paid armed men to slaughter hundreds of villagers on a game reserve, just to get to the coltan deposits there. 
 He is a murderer. 
 You're living in a fantasy world. 
 Argento had nothing to do with any atrocities. 
 But, just in case there's anything that could be seen as incriminating, we've purged the company computers. 
 But I must have the copies! 
 There's... there's just one. 
 I'll take you to it. 
 Mr. Gilbert's going to take you on a field trip. 
 Yes. 
 Please tell him that a man's life hangs in the balance. That should get his attention. 
 They put me on hold. 
 It's bullshit. 
 They have him in the garage! They're leaving now! 
 Arabela called, the wife is at the doctor's office, she's safe. 
 OK. 
 Here we go. 
 I'll have Sebastian track our GPS. 
 Luke, they're heading north on the E19 towards Delft. 
 You're about 5 kilometres behind them. 
 Make that 2. 
 Sebastian, we're here. 
 Saint Albert's Church. 
 Alert the Dutch police. 
 On it. 
 Luke and Arabela are right behind you. 
 Tell them to hurry. 
 Freeze! 
 Come on, guys, it's over. You're surrounded. 
 Just drop it. 
 OK? 
 Just... drop the gun. 
 OK? 
 Hands up! 
 Now! 
 Drop the weapon! 
 Drop, drop it! 
 This is useless. 
 I made other copies to give to the media, but they're still in my office. 
 I'm sure everything's been destroyed by now. 
 I was just trying to do the right thing. 
 I wanted to hold that b*st*rd accountable. 
 There's still time to make it right. You could testify in court. 
 Are you for real? 
 They almost killed me. 
 Mr. Gilbert, without evidence linking Wombosi to that massacre, all we have is your testimony. 
 Wombosi will walk. 
 I'm sorry, but I tried and I failed. 
 I have my family to think about. 
 There's someone I want you to talk to. 
 General Wombosi, we have introduced into evidence the encrypted emails that show that you personally ordered your army to allow those mercenaries soldiers to cross your country's border in 2013. 
 Mercenaries who then went on to kill, no, to slaughter hundreds of men, women and children. 
 Yes, I reviewed those emails. 
 Do you deny writing them? 
 I do not. 
 But I find no proof those mercenaries slaughtered anyone. 
 Well, thankfully, a man named Mr. Simon Gilbert does. 
 And he is the vice president of Argento International. 
 Objection! 
 Argento is not on trial here. 
 And Mr. Gilbert was not on the witness list during discovery. 
 We didn't know that he would be willing to testify until late this morning. 
 I call Simon Gilbert as a witness. 
 Thank you, Miss Baines. 
 Thank you, Mr. Gilbert. 
 Would you introduce yourself, please? 
 My name is Simon Anthony Gilbert. 
 All rise. 
 Having considered all the evidence and the arguments of both parties, this trial chamber unanimously finds you, Fabrice Wombosi, guilty of all charges. 
 You're hereby sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
 We did a good thing, Michel. 
 We did. 
 This verdict exists because of you, Sophie. 
 Thank you. 
 I have news everyone. 
 Simon Gilbert has agreed to cooperate with the United States Department of Justice in the case against Argento International. 
 What about Melvoy Security? 
 Ugh, Melvoy, no. 
 They have too many friends in too many high places. 
 So, Fitzroy walks? 
 Well, my hands have been tied. 
 He'll get what's coming to him one day. 
 Only if you all were to do it, I have been to the board, and I argued that this case proved that the Cross Border Unit should be re-established. 
 And they agreed. 
 But who's going to be in the unit? 
 All of you. 
 And you will be led by Inspector Strand. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Say you'll take the job. 
 Congratulations to all of you for a job well done. 
 I cannot begin to tell you how happy, how relieved, it makes me that this unit is going to go back to work again. 
 Welcome aboard, Inspector. 
 I'm just gobsmacked. 
 Are you in? 
 Uh, I'll think about it. 
 As long as there aren't any more blindfolds. 
 Are you staying? 
 Oh, no. 
 You'd be vital to this unit. 
 You don't need me. 
 Did you give Sebastian a piece of evidence? 
 That was personal. 
 This court's resources aren't for your personal use. 
 If, on the other hand, you were an officer of the ICC... 
 Are you blackmailing me, Inspector Strand? 
 This unit needs you, Inspector Costante. 
 And you need it. 
 More than you realize. 
 I see why Dorn picked you to lead the team.
