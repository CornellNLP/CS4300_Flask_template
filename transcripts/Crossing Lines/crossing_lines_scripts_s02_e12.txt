 That is Lucien Fiori. 
 He's a Corsican national and he escaped three hours ago, taking with him as a hostage his court-appointed therapist. 
 He was not acting alone. 
 Dusek, the bomber, never been linked with the Radik's before, but he is a Hungarian anarchist. 
 Safecracker Victor Casta, first crime he served time for, robbery of a jewelry wholesaler in Prague. 
 This feels more like an amateur smash-and-grab gone wrong than a proper, professional heist. 
 They're moving with the best safecracker in the EU and they don't touch the safe? 
 You can rest assured that Sebastian's mythical Swiss hacker is as real as they come. 
 I probably need more time than I thought. 
 I'm kind of chasing a ghost. 
 Did anyone identify the last robber? The tiger? 
 The tiger was Colin, Tommy's brother. 
 Dr. Clark? 
 Yes? 
 We're the police. 
 The Major says that you do not want to go to the hospital. 
 I have access to a villa just outside of Lyons. 
 I'd just like to be in familiar surroundings. 
 I feel like that's the best way to begin healing from the trauma. 
 Eva? 
 Tommy, I need you to come here. 
 Someone sent me a note. 
 He wants to meet me today, but he told me to be alone. I need someone here. 
 Tommy! 
 Damn! Tommy! 
 Tommy! 
 Stay with me. Tommy! 
 Stay with me. sh1t! 
 Arabela, we're on the way to see Dr. Clark. 
 Major! We need help! Now! 
 Tommy's been shot in the head. We're behind the jewelry store. 
 We need help, now. Please. 
 Hurry up. I need an ambulance and back up, now. 
 Stay with me. 
 What's going on? What's wrong? 
 It's Tommy. He's been shot. 
 This is Major Daniel. 
 Track Arabela's cell phone and send ambulance and back up. 
 Eva, come on. Come on. 
 Eva! Eva is not answering. 
 Do you know what it is that she's doing? Where is she? 
 She would not tell me, but... 
 I need her here. I need everyone here. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Stay with me, Tommy. 
 It's okay. It's the police. Go back inside. 
 We're here! 
 Help is coming, they're coming. 
 They're here. 
 How is he? 
 He's, um, his head is bleeding, Major. 
 I, um... I don't know. 
 We got a lot to talk about. 
 Nothing yet? 
 No change. 
 I'll take over. 
 All right. 
 You sure you don't need that to be looked at? 
 All I did was scream "help," Hickman. I didn't really participate. 
 You'd be surprised how many times someone in that situation forgets to call for help. 
 Or they're so panicked that when they do call in, nobody can understand what they're talking about. 
 Trust me, you did real good. 
 Okay. 
 Then I'm a hero. 
 You don't think so? 
 You managed to call Louis while under fire, and get both of you out of that situation. 
 First, we were no longer under fire. 
 Second, I only called the Major because I couldn't remember how to call the police in Marseille, and third, we didn't exactly come out unscathed. 
 But you're both alive. 
 Only one of us is conscious. 
 So you're determined then? 
 Determined? 
 To blame yourself for something you have no fault in. 
 I just... 
 I wish I could have done something more. 
 Every cop would rather be the one who takes the shot than have their partner get wounded. 
 They're clean, Arabela. 
 Thanks. 
 How is he? 
 He's still unconscious, but the bullet did not penetrate. 
 It's a grazing wound. 
 What happened? 
 We were investigating a robbery where two officers had been murdered, and we were shot at from the rooftop of the adjacent building. 
 No warning? 
 The area had been declared clear, and the local police were at the restaurant where the officers were gunned down. 
 We thought it was safe. 
 And why would they ambush them like that? 
 To the extent that assholes ever do, these robbers haven't made any sense. 
 They enter these stores as loudly as possible. 
 They don't seem to mind turning off some alarms, and leaving other ones on, and then, when we arrive, we discover that nothing of any value was even stolen. 
 Peculiar modus operandi for... 
 You'd think these people, of all people, would want to stay under the radar. 
 Can we be certain it's them? 
 In the negative. 
 Just got off the phone with the detectives at the latest robbery. 
 The gang accomplished the exact same disruption of electricity and cameras, but left no trace of themselves, but did leave jewelry behind. 
 So the fact that they don't leave any evidence is now becoming evidence. 
 Sort of like the absence of matter proves a black hole. 
 Well, then, why don't we forget about the evidence. 
 If we can figure out what they're getting out of these robberies, we might be able to predict what their next move is. 
 When I started the team, Dorn asked me if I was doing it for the right reason. 
 At the time, I thought he meant I was trying to get revenge. 
 Étienne had been killed one year before. 
 Things were very bad. 
 But now, I think, I was looking for another family. 
 I never told you this before, but you were the last person I chose for my team, and a lot of people told me not to. 
 But I knew you were the right man. 
 Then... you have become more than that to me. 
 I don't want to lose you, Tommy. 
 I don't want to lose another son. 
 Major. 
 Yes? 
 I'm trying to sleep. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 This just can't be. 
 I'm sorry? 
 This latest robbery. 
 The detectives said they can see the robbers went into the office but left the safe alone again, and I'm thinking, what else is kept in an office? 
 Records. 
 And a computer, right, but I'm in the hard drive of that computer right now, and it looks like no one even used the computer for days. 
 What the hell were they doing in the office of both jewelry stores? 
 Why can't we figure out what's going on? 
 Have you resolved that matter that was troubling you when we last spoke? 
 Not yet. 
 Hmm. Well, I am here for you whenever. 
 There needs to be a conversation with someone that I can't have right now. 
 All right. 
 He is awake. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm getting out of here. 
 Tommy, you've been unconscious for hours. 
 Means I'm well rested. 
 Please, Tommy, think about this. 
 Arabela's right, Detective. 
 Being on your feet is not a good idea. 
 All due respect, sir, I don't give a damn if you think it's a good idea or not. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, I am, I appreciate the concern, but we've got a bunch of escaped convicts tearing around Europe committing robberies and killing cops. 
 If that's not what this team is for, then nothing is. 
 I'm not sitting on the sideline with a headache. 
 You sure? 
 Aye. We have to stop them, boss. 
 I gotta say, I'm tired of just reacting to these scumbags myself. 
 It's time to get a little proactive and get a step ahead of them for once. 
 Okay, we regroup in the waiting room. We are going to plan our next move. 
 When this is over, you and I got something to talk about. 
 Talk now. 
 Wrong place, wrong time. 
 But we'll get to the bottom of it. 
 "It?" 
 The tiger. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Yes. 
 Everything is on schedule. 
 After tonight, we all disappear and live the life of the very, very rich. 
 Come on, guys, let's get some rest. 
 Tonight's going to be a big night. 
 So... two prison breaks, two small jewelry store robberies, six murders, and one attempted murder. 
 No, I'm not so sure they were trying to kill me. 
 I saw the shadow before the shot. 
 What do you mean? 
 I hung up the call, and I was talking to Arabela when I saw the shadow of the rifle on the ground. 
 That's why I was able to turn my head at the last minute. 
 So they missed? 
 No, not exactly, but they waited too long. 
 I mean, we were stationary. I was making call after call, so I feel like the shooter waited for me to notice, and then he shot across my head rather than through it. 
 That would be an incredibly delicate shot. 
 Yeah? I could make it. 
 Are you sure? 
 It doesn't matter anyway. Let's just say that that shot is possible. 
 This all feels wrong, doesn't it? 
 It's like everything they've done is a... is a smoke screen. A misdirection. 
 Like magicians. 
 Yeah, just like that. 
 "Here, look here at this hand," while the other hand hides the coin. 
 Think about it. They wanted the cops at the scenes, they wanted the robberies discovered. 
 Heck, they probably even wanted us to come. 
 Everything about these guys is maximum attention. 
 They used giant car bombs to break out of prison. 
 Certainly crossed enough borders since. 
 It's almost as if they were demanding our involvement in this. 
 They wouldn't be the first to purposely make us part of their plan. 
 Yeah, but we're so well publicized. 
 It's common knowledge that that strategy has not worked for those who have employed it. 
 But why? 
 What could they possibly gain from our involvement? 
 Because when we are looking, no one else is. 
 Everywhere we've gone, the locals backed off. 
 That's absolutely true, Louis. 
 We've been granted extraordinary autonomy here. 
 So now we're involved, what do we do about it? 
 We take a step back. 
 Re-evaluate what we have from the standpoint of everything was done on purpose. Everything, deliberate. 
 Louis, the Marseille police took the psychologist to that villa, right? 
 Doctor Clarke? 
 Yes. 
 Good, they'll have her address. 
 You have something, Hickman, what is it? 
 These guys are good, yet they left all the victim's cell phones in the building where she was rescued. 
 At the time, I thought they'd made a mistake. 
 Assume it was not a mistake. 
 They wanted her found? 
 Maybe it's part of it. 
 Do you think she knows? 
 Maybe, maybe not. I definitely want to talk to her and find out. 
 I said to Sebastian when we were at the prison, there's something about that video, the CCTV footage, it just... it doesn't sit right, and if I talk to her, maybe I could figure out what that is. 
 Local police say they brought everything from the latest robbery into their station. 
 The gang was nearly caught and left quickly. 
 Maybe... they made a mistake and left something this time. 
 Okay. Carl, go to the villa, interview the doctor. 
 Tommy, Arabela, Sebastian, we will set up at the local station. 
 I doubt these w*nk*rs make mistakes. 
 Bound to make one some time. 
 Who were you calling? 
 What's that? 
 You said you were stationary making call after call. 
 Oh, shite! Has anyone talked to Eva? 
 I tried. She's not answering. 
 What are you talking about? 
 She called Tommy from Spain. 
 She sounded scared, definitely upset. She wanted me to come there. 
 Did she say what it was? What was wrong? 
 No, just that she wanted me there. 
 Does anyone know exactly where she is in Spain? 
 I know where she was last. 
 I can track her phone. 
 Okay. I will go there, I will find her. 
 No, Louis, I will go. 
 Will someone please advise the helicopter that I will be there? 
 When I was finishing her background check for the ICC, an Italian journalist of my acquaintance invited me to review a file. 
 When Sergeant Vittoria spoke to me yesterday, she said she was "chasing a ghost." 
 That file was about a ghost. 
 She is in desperately dangerous territory. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, I'm good. You don't have to wait around. 
 Right. I'll call you. Thanks. 
 Nice place. 
 How goes the self-treatment, Doc? 
 Detective Hickman, welcome. 
 I can certainly see why you preferred this to a hospital. 
 Well, the point was to be in familiar surroundings, but the special nature of this location is a bonus. 
 Yeah. 
 Can I offer you a drink? 
 Uh, something soft would be great, but please, have whatever you'd like. 
 I usually do. 
 Good for you. 
 Major Daniel. 
 Yeah. 
 Inspector Cambert of the National Police. 
 It is an honor to meet you. 
 Wow. That's what people say when you've retired. 
 Well, no, that's not what I meant... 
 I'm joking, Cambert. The honor is mine. 
 McConnell, Berger, Seeger, three of my investigators. 
 Enchanté. 
 You look much better. 
 I was in the alley as you were being taken away. 
 Well, luckily, they only shot me in the head. 
 I am glad you're okay. 
 Well, um, we have all the evidence from the last robbery. 
 My attempt at a joke. 
 There is no evidence. Not a trace. 
 We even swept the rooftop and couldn't find a shell casing, and we know a shot was fired from there. 
 How did they get into the store? 
 Broke through the rear door into the storage room. 
 Crudely. 
 And nothing from the main room beyond was taken. 
 Why would jewelry thieves break into a jewelry store and not take any jewels? 
 See? There's something about the offices in these jewelry stores. 
 If they had been a little stealthy we wouldn't have even known about the crime. 
 The store has been closed for days. 
 Out of business? 
 No, the owners are in Cannes for some sort of gathering. 
 The store will open again next week. 
 You didn't by any chance bring the office computer in, did you? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I remotely accessed it, but I'd really like to be able to hard-wire in. 
 I'll have it brought directly. 
 Eva, this is Dorn again. 
 I need you to respond to my calls. It's urgent. 
 If you are going to meet with whom I fear you have been chasing, you must not, under any circumstances, do that alone, do you understand? 
 I'm on my way to you. Wait for me. 
 Leon, we need to go faster. 
 The helicopter is ready and I am in a desperate hurry. 
 Ah, thank you. 
 Consuelo... 
 No, no, no. I'll... I'll get it. 
 Oh, nonsense, you're my guest. 
 Am I? 
 Excuse me? 
 Your guest? 
 Have I treated you as though you aren't? 
 I've just never had a crime victim call me that. 
 No? 
 Now that I think about it, I've never had one actually glad to see me, either. 
 They don't banter, don't offer me wine. 
 I almost feel as though I failed some sort of test. 
 Not at all. 
 They just usually want me to finish as quickly as possible and get the hell out of there. 
 Putting my psychiatrist hat on, that must be emotionally rather difficult for you. 
 Actually, it's not difficult at all, because it's normal. 
 Well, I guess that says more about me than you. 
 Well, from here on, for your sake, I will endeavor to be more, as you call it, "normal." 
 Here. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Are you all right? 
 Aye, I just hate waiting... Da. 
 Let's keep that between us. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 Look here. None of this has been accessed. 
 They didn't even attempt it. 
 They killed two cops and shot at Tommy. 
 They must be after something. 
 When did the store close exactly? 
 Cambert said four days ago. 
 What is this gathering they've gone to? 
 I don't know. 
 It's strange that the entire staff would go away like that. 
 I'll go check. 
 It has to be the computer. It has to. 
 May I ask you a personal question? 
 It depends on the question. 
 How does a prison psychiatrist afford a villa in the South of France? 
 That's funny? 
 No. 
 It's just that there are so many more personal questions you could have asked me. 
 I said I had access to a villa, I didn't say I owned one. 
 Right. Right, you did say that. 
 This home belongs to a banker from Paris. 
 Ah, I see. 
 I'm quite sure you don't. 
 He was a patient. 
 He's happily involved with a gorgeous, much younger man. 
 Is that commonplace? 
 An older man with a younger lover? 
 A psychiatrist staying at patient's home. 
 No. No, in fact, it would be fairly unethical, except it was a year after I stopped treating him that we became friends, and then a year after that that I came and stayed here for the first time. 
 Well, that explains it then. 
 There's something really enjoyable about conversing with you. 
 No kidding? 
 I didn't expect quite so many questions about me. 
 What did you expect questions about? 
 Lucien, the escapees, my detention. 
 Okay. How did you keep them from raping you? 
 Wow, you've got straight to it. 
 You were taken by two escaped convicts, two desperate criminals, for two days? 
 Yes. 
 Tied up, incapacitated. 
 Completely. 
 You weren't assaulted? I assume you would have said something if you had been. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that you weren't, I just find it kind of... surprising. 
 It's not surprising at all. I'm a psychiatrist. I'm quite adept at controlling people with words. Plus, my professional relationship with Lucien not only made him completely uninterested in me in that way, it made him want to protect me from the other three. 
 My question seems to have offended you. 
 No. I know you've got a job to do. 
 You say that Lucien was uninterested? 
 Excuse me. 
 I'll be right here. 
 
 
 
 Carl? 
 I know what was bothering me about the video. 
 Have Sebastian show you the CCTV footage from the prison. 
 When Lucien leaps from his chair at the Doctor's, don't look at him, watch her. 
 I'm pretty sure she doesn't flinch. At all. 
 Like she knew he was going to do it. 
 I will look. 
 Yeah. Text me and let me know. 
 I'm starting to think that our doctor is no victim at all. 
 She may be in on the whole damned thing. 
 Would you like some fresh tea? 
 I'm good, thank you. So, we were... 
 What's wrong with your hand? 
 Pardon me? 
 Why the single glove? 
 Work injury. 
 Severe? 
 Fairly. 
 Recent? 
 Some time ago. 
 Why are you so hesitant to discuss it? 
 Hesitant? 
 It's called avoidance. 
 You're giving me the least amount of information possible in response to each question. 
 Is that what I'm doing? 
 It wasn't simply an injury. 
 You were shot in New York by a child abduction suspect. 
 What was it you said? 
 "Google makes us all seem smarter?" 
 Now, why would you Google me? 
 An American police detective in Marseille, it's not something one expects. I was intrigued. 
 It said the man that wounded you escaped, that he's still out there. 
 That must weigh on you. 
 I imagine it makes life quite difficult. 
 Her phone is still not on. 
 How long? 
 The last five or six hours since she called Tommy. 
 Well, send me the GPS coordinates of the last one, all right? 
 On the way. 
 And does anyone know where she was staying in Spain? 
 I'll send you the hotel information, too. 
 Thank you. 
 Is he in Spain? 
 Yeah, but, Eva's phone hasn't been on for hours. 
 If anyone can find her, Dorn can. 
 Okay, what about this? Anything? 
 It's just impossible. 
 There is no way you can access a system and not leave any trace you were there. 
 Every time you move a mouse, the computer records it. 
 It just does. Deep in the bios, there's a record. 
 You can no more get that to stop happening than you could stop time from... 
 Sebastian? 
 The jewelry store wasn't just closed for any old gathering. 
 There's a major auction happening in Cannes. 
 Some of the world's most valuable jewelry will be there. 
 That sounds like something for the Radic Group to go after. 
 Yes! 
 You got in? 
 Phony son of a bitch. 
 More like around. 
 Like Hickman said... magic. 
 You know how a magician makes something disappear? 
 By dropping something in front of it to make the background appear to be the foreground. 
 Did anyone understand what he just said? 
 I do. 
 They're changing what you think you see. 
 Exactly. 
 Sebastian. Give me the headline. 
 I know what they got from this computer. 
 So is your hand completely unusable now? 
 You treated Lucien Fiori for two years? Twice a week? 
 Oh, we're back to that? 
 My history is not why I'm here. 
 I find your deflection really interesting. 
 Deflection, avoidance, I'm a basket case. 
 More than 200 sessions. 
 That's a lot, isn't it? 
 Sorry, I... 
 For one doctor to treat one patient, that seems like a tremendous amount of time to be in very stressful situations, intense situations. 
 One could think so. 
 Doctor, I want you to know that I don't consider you an enemy, and I don't consider you bad. 
 Most people consider convicts stupid. 
 If they were smart, they wouldn't find themselves in prison in the first place. 
 But for those of us that work in the system, we know that that isn't true. 
 They may not be educated in the formal sense, but a good, good many of them are extremely street smart. 
 And they can be very adept at manipulation. 
 I suppose that could be true. 
 You don't suppose it, you've lived it. 
 Sorry? 
 200 hours is certainly enough time for somebody already disposed to compassion toward an inmate, such as his doctor, to be influenced by him. 
 To be... how did you put it? 
 Controlled by his words. 
 I really don't know what you're talking about. 
 This is the footage taken from your office right before the lights went out. 
 You see how Fiori leaps from his chair at you? 
 You didn't even flinch, did you, Anna? 
 You knew he was going to do it, didn't you? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Let me help you. 
 I don't need your help. 
 Trust me on this, Anna, you are running out of time. 
 If you let them hurt more people now that you're away from them, now that you're out of physical danger, there won't be anything that I can do for you. 
 I thought he loved me, and then he... he just... dumped me when he didn't need me anymore. 
 He just threw me away. 
 I feel so stupid. 
 I've ruined everything, my career, my life. 
 Not if you help me. 
 What? 
 What are they planning? The real job? 
 If I did? 
 If you help me stop them, I'll do everything I can to keep this from hurting you. 
 Can I trust you? 
 You have to. 
 Okay, we're there. The glass alarms are disabled. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 21st Annual Jewel Auction! 
 The auction is beginning. 
 Tommy? 
 Good to go here, Major. 
 We are all in position, Cambert. 
 First up, ladies and gentlemen, we have this magnificent 100 karat dolphin diamond necklace. 
 A magnificent piece, I'm sure you'll agree. 
 Let's start the bidding at 80,000. Do I have 80,000? 
 Come on. 
 Almost there. 
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! 
 Please. Please, slow down. 
 It's only our first of the evening, you understand. 
 You're making me dizzy here. 
 Ready. 
 Hold a moment. 
 Security. 
 Who is this? 
 Security. 
 What the hell are you doing answering my wife's phone? 
 Who is this? This is the office of... 
 You tell that slut not to even bother coming home! 
 Video feeds are mine. 
 Who was that? 
 I don't know. Some weird guy who wanted to talk to his wife. 
 They can only see what I want them to from now on. 
 300,000! 300,000! Madam! 
 300,000, sold, to the lady in the white jacket! 
 Congratulations, Madam. 
 That's a wonderful start to the evening. 
 Now, up next, ladies and gentlemen... 
 We're ready. 
 Remember, from the moment I disrupt the motion sensors, you only have two minutes and 59 seconds to get off the main floor. 
 At three minutes, the system will read the failure of the generator to take over as a breach. 
 Ready? 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 2:59. Go. 
 We're at the elevators. 
 Okay. 
 Now. 
 Elevator one at the top and shut down. 
 Shaft is yours. 1:20 left. 
 Okay, we're ready. 
 Sending the rest to the basement. 
 See you at the bottom. 
 Okay. 
 Gentleman in the middle table there, 400,000 Euro, sold! Congratulations, sir! 
 We are in the basement. 
 20-seconds to spare. Nicely done. 
 Main floor motion detector is back online. 
 Dusek? How are you doing? 
 If the measurements you gave me are right, I'm almost there. 
 And no names over the comms. 
 Relax, no one even knows we're here. 
 Then say your name. 
 Measurements are dead on, aren't they? 
 Yeah. Trash chute open, I think. 
 It's the trash chute, believe me. 
 Okay, we're good. 
 The rest of the alarms are all controlled from inside that safe. 
 Once the fire alarm goes off, I'm just an observer. 
 I'll let you know the status of the responses, but apart than that, I... 
 Shut the hell up, Morand. 
 No names. 
 Go. 
 Always wanted to say this... 
 Fire in the hole! 
 sh1t. 
 What's that? 
 Fire in the garbage room. 
 Be fast, but correct, yeah? 
 No problem. 
 Fire department on the way, boys. 
 250 for this piece. 250! 
 You're a genius, man. Amazing job, Viktor. 
 Not much time. Come on. 
 Party time. We're in the vault. We're in. 
 All the locks are disabled. 
 Come on, ladies. 
 Yes! 
 Fire's out, boys. 
 Okay, time to go. 
 Phew. It won't stop smoking, man. 
 Don't move! 
 Don't move. 
 Remember me? 
 Sorry. 
 Step down from the van! 
 Hands above your head. 
 Step down! 
 Ghost Zero, huh? 
 Who the hell are you? 
 The guy who's going to make you so famous you'll never be able to access a computer again. 
 Buenos Tardes, Señor. 
 Sergeant Eva Vittoria. 
 Sí. She left about 20 minutes ago. 
 Give me the key. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Second floor, sir. 
 Carl, it's over. They are all in custody. 
 I'm on my way to pick you up. 
 Any news? 
 They're in custody. All of them. 
 They are? 
 Is that a surprise? 
 What, you don't believe me? You think I'm bluffing? 
 No, I... I told you what they were planning. 
 Yeah, you did tell me something. 
 Well, that's... that's good that they've been caught. 
 Is it? 
 Yeah. Those animals belong behind bars. 
 You can stop now. 
 Excuse me? 
 The one thing about helping you is that it was based on you telling me the truth. 
 You've just said that they're in custody? 
 Yeah, but they weren't caught at the auction that you sent us to. 
 What? 
 You see, our tech figured out what your hacker was getting from those jewelry store computers, the real location of the jewels. 
 An auction like that uses fakes publicly, but they keep the real stuff close by. 
 The real jewels were in a bank nearby, the real target of the robbery. 
 You the one who took the shot at me. 
 I wouldn't have missed. 
 No. 
 You shouldn't have missed. 
 When I get out, I'm going to come and find you. 
 If you get out, you won't have to find me. 
 I'll be waiting right outside that prison, with bells on. 
 Answer my question. 
 Hey, listen, I don't understand why I'm here. 
 I think you do. 
 No. 
 So you didn't participate in the robbery at the bank? 
 What? What robbery? 
 I was in the van when you all rushed in and dragged me down here. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 He said the security cameras were off. 
 You are very good at controlling with your words. 
 Except you did make that one little mistake. 
 I made a mistake? 
 Yeah, you told me that you Googled me. 
 How is that a mistake? 
 Well, if you'd have done it between meeting me and my coming here, then you would have known that the guy that shot me is in prison in The Hague right now. But since you didn't, you must have done it months ago, and that's a long time to plan at being manipulated. 
 You think you're a shit-hot computer guy, huh? 
 I caught Ghost Zero. 
 Though I did think you'd be a bit more... impressive. 
 If I were Ghost Zero, I would certainly have nothing to fear from a tool of the state. 
 If I were Ghost Zero, someone like you could never beat me. 
 The hacking itself, once I figured out what you were doing, is almost... amateurish. 
 What made you special was the fact that you left no trace. 
 Ah, the impossible act. 
 Ah, keep smiling. 
 You know you can never prove I had anything to do with that robbery. 
 I was two blocks away. 
 Yeah, in a van from which you attempted to override every security and CCTV system in the bank. 
 Plus, you used your own cell phone to call the guard inside. 
 What do you mean "attempted." 
 I took over every system an hour before you got there, dropped a veil over them to make them look untouched. 
 Guess where I learned that from? 
 A duplicate of the operating system made just before I did anything. 
 If you looked at it, you would never know anyone had been there. 
 After I finish documenting this, I will see that it becomes standard protocol for all cyber investigators to check a system they believe has been compromised to insure they're looking at the actual bios, not just a duplicate cover. 
 Your game, as they say, is up. 
 Nothing that you've said convicts me. 
 No, my testimony will convict you. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 Why would you want to put me away? 
 I haven't hurt anyone. It was just a lark. 
 A bit of fun in a boring life. 
 A lark? 
 Six people have died, a police officer, and a friend of mine wounded, all because what? 
 What, 'cause you were bored? 
 None of that was because I was bored. 
 Wanting to see if you could figure it out was because I was bored. 
 The NYPD has a nickname for people like you, it's called "whackjob". 
 But like I said, I found it interesting talking to you. 
 But all good things must come to an end. 
 Oh, so, you wanted me out here? 
 You won't be testifying against me, Detective. 
 You won't be testifying against anyone. 
 Anna, stop. Let's talk about this. 
 No. Talking to you has become really boring. 
 No! 
 Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance! 
 Carl... 
 What? What? I'm here. 
 Tell... 
 No, no. You... You tell her, okay? 
 I'm not scared. 
 Don't be scared, don't be scared... 
 Do you... 
 What? 
 Do you believe? 
 What? 
 Do you believe I will see him? 
 What? 
 Do you believe that I will see Étienne? My little boy? 
 You... you hang on. Just hang on. Just... 
 Do you? 
 I know it. I know you're going to see him. 
 Just hang on. Just... 
 Come on, come on, come on. Shh...
