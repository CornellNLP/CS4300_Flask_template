 Hickman stunned :  This was your beat? 
 Yeah. Italian border, from here all the way up to Switzerland. 
 It's a hell of a lot more picturesque than where I worked. 
 Well, the longer you police an area, the harder it is to appreciate picturesque. 
 Lot of human-trafficking through here? 
 More all the time. 
 I was working on a joint operation, with some of the other border regions. 
 I'd like to see that investigation if you still have access. 
 That's why you asked me to bring you to my old stomping grounds? 
 It's related to Phillip Genovese, the files you had me gather? 
 It may have something to do with Genovese. 
 I don't know. 
 But I really do want to familiarize myself with the area. 
 I guess I could introduce you to Captain Geroux, my former superior. 
 And I wouldn't mind checking up on the progress myself. 
 Great. 
 You mean now, don't you?

 [Moans echoing] 
 [Echoing laughter]

 Jacques, we're going to a club.

 The Mecca. In town. 
 Girl :  Don't forget the party after! 
 I gave them the address when I got here. 
 And then a private party. 
 You have the address. 
 I'll send the advance team now.

 Okay. 
 Get him straight to the V.I.P. area. 
 It's a much safer environment.

 Head to the private party venue.

 We can go to the club now. 
 Party time.

 There's no one here. 
 This is the address she gave me. 
 Okay, so where is the party? 
 Jacques? 
 I might have a bad address on the party. 
 [Radio crackling] Advance one? 
 Advance one? Can you hear me? 
 Come in, advance one. 
 Hello? 
 [Radio crackles, then silence]

 Something's wrong? 
 I lost their signal. 
 Maybe they're having a little bit of fun for once.

Special Ops, Part 1 
Original Air Date July 14, 2013 
 No ones here. 
 Saturday night, the joint must be jumpin'. 
 Nah. They're at the scene of a multiple homicide and kidnapping in Cannes. 
 The joint really is jumpin'. 
 Salut, Claude. Ca va? 
 Oui. Combien? 
 Oui, peut-etre. 
 [Speaks in french] On n'est pas loin. On arrive. 
 This might actually be a case for us. 
 Why do you say that? 
 It might match another kidnapping in Florence a few months ago. 
 It was in one of the files Major Daniel had me process. 
 You're sure? 
 I told you. I have a memory thing. 
 Okay. Let's check it out with Sebastian. 
 [♪] 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 Dammit! 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 [Telephone vibrates] 
 Anne-Marie? 
 Yeah, Sebastian? Sorry to disturb you  on a Saturday. 
 It's all right. I'm still at the office. 
 I had some work to catch up on. 
 Some programming. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Can you access Florentine crime databases over the last six months? 
 Yeah. Hold on. 
 What are you looking for? 
 There's been a kidnapping in Cannes. 
 It sounds like one in Florence. 
 Yes. There're... two, one parental abduction,  one kidnapping for ransom from a public space where the victim's security team  was overpowered and... 
 Anne-marie :  And murdered. Very similar. 
 Yes. Very. 
 Uh, no, I was talking to Hickman. 
 You're with Hickman? 
 Yeah. Uh, can you call Major Daniel  and tell him we're close to the scene? 
 We'll see what we can find out. 
 If he doesn't think the case is for us, then we can always pull back. 
 Right. 
 Thanks. 
 [Click] 
 She's with Hickman... in Cannes? 
 Dinner was lovely. Thank you. 
 I'm going to clean up. 
 No, I can do it. 
 Um... we can do it together. 
 [Gasps suddenly and bangs into the chair] 
 No. 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 No. 
 It's not all right. 
 It'll never be all right. 
 [♪] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Cell rings] 
 Sebastian. 
 No. No, no. I was... 
 What can I do for you? 
 [Blows landing] 
 [♪] 
 [Cell ringing] 
 Excuse me. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Panting] Sergeant Vittoria. 
 [Boisterous chatter over background music] 
 Cheers, mate. 
 There. 
 Get that into you. 
 [Cell begins ringing] 
 Why does the Lord hate me? 
 Detective Hickman? 
 Captain Claude Geroux. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Pleasure to meet you, sir. I've heard a lot about you. 
 Excuse me. 
 How was the reunion? 
 They're overwhelmed. 
 Anybody would be. Can I see your phone? 
 [♪] 
 [Shutter snaps] 
 Get this photo of that casing to Sebastian to analyze. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 They're all double-tapped. 
 One shot centre-mass, one in the head. 
 It's extremely brazen. 
 The club was packed. 
 They didn't worry about witnesses describing them. 
 Well, if something is fast and brutal, nobody remembers any details. 
 It's how the mob works in New York. 
 These kills were definitely professional. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [♪] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 One more pint and I was home free with the most beautiful bird I've seen since I left Dublin. 
 I didn't know you had a girlfriend. 
 There's a lot you don't know about me. 
 Really? 
 Where were you on a Saturday night? 
 There's a lot you don't know about me, either. 
 In the gym. 
 Dedication. That's hot. 
 Sebastian : 7.62, lead ore. 
 It's Russian, but manufactured in Bulgaria. 
 Fairly rare. 
 Russian? 
 What's the case? 
 Kidnapping in Cannes. 
 The victim's called Maxim Marianski. 
 His father's a Russian billionaire. 
 Double-tap kills are a military tactic. 
 A lot of Russian military went bad, and they don't like the new rich. 
 There could be a connection there. 
 Is that enough to make it cross-border? 
 To ask for the case? 
 The crime itself is only within France... 
 As far as we know. But... we have a similar Florence case. Oh, yeah. I remember that. Rich victim, blitz attack on security, double-tap kills with 7.62s... Sure looks like the same team did both. I'll call Dorn. Sebastian, get your equipment. We are all going to the South of France. Pick me up in a chopper at the heliport. Bye. Wow... a man asking me to the South of France on a Saturday night? You would think that would sound sexier. Anne-Marie and Hickman were already there... Together. [Shocked chatter] Woman : Where is my son? I need to speak to someone there! What's going on? The victim's mother is here. I need to see my son! They let her into the crime scene? You're gonna be in big trouble! In Cannes, no one refuses Caroline Marianski anything. Hey! Please! Does anyone know where my son is? Madame Marianski? Yes. I'm Captain Geroux. Hi. Shall we find some privacy? Victim's father, Lev Marianski, is one of the richest men in the world. He's just arrived. Where does his money come from? Well, initially, black market, after the fall, but he went much more mainstream in the last decade. He has tech companies, financial companies, a string of high-end stores, even owns a football team in Italy... A team that never covers the point spread, by the way. Hickman :  Soccer has a spread? It's called "football." Hickman :  Yeah, whatever it's called, how do you figure a point spread in a game  where nobody ever scores any points? Well, someone scores, or I wouldn't have so ma... Anyway. We are 15 minutes out. Madame Marianski... It's Pelletier. We divorced three years ago, and I took back my maiden name the moment I legally could. Who are you people again? We work out of the International Criminal Court. Mrs. Marianski : Handling kidnappings? Well, handling cross-border crimes. I don't understand. They took him across a border? No, madame. There was a similar kidnapping in Florence, several months ago. So this is a professional group? The kidnappers? It appears so. All kidnappings are professional, aren't they? Unless the parents do it. Look. If you want to investigate me, investigate me. Until then, what are you doing to find my son? Sir, look around you. Almost every officer in the region is here. Standing around, doing nothing. In a ransom kidnapping, you generally need to wait for further contact. How long will that take? You have somewhere more important to be? You've checked your watch twice since you got here. No. I have nowhere to be. How much time do you have before you need to report this to the insurance company? Insurance? Mr. Marianski, you must insure your valuables? Did you buy an insurance on Maxim? Caroline... Usually, a man in your ex-husband's position takes out an insurance policy, a kidnap policy, on his family. He probably has one on you as well. Is that true? As you say, it was prudent. But we're not married any longer. You can buy insurance on anyone. You cold b*st*rd. Actually, madame, kidnap insurance provides certainty that, if something like this should happen, the ransom money would be readily available. Hickman : It also tends to keep negotiations to a minimum. Makes it more of a business transaction. You probably have a million reasons to hate your ex-husband, but this shouldn't be one of 'em. May I have a moment with you, please? "Millions of reasons" to hate me? Three years after a divorce, a rich ex-wife should have a string of young guys helping her forget, but she's still really pissed at you. That kind of anger is earned. Right now, I'm more concerned about the chip. Chip? Your son has a tracer chip in him, right? I wouldn't... Things are gonna go so much easier if you don't lie to me. [♪] [Sighs reluctantly] You're wearing a $23,000 watch. So? It's a fake. The sub-dial is all wrong. The inner wall should be gold, not white. It's too thick by half. But it's a good fake, it's a professional fake, and they don't come cheap either, which suggests that you... You like to look good, but you're not above saving a buck. Kidnap insurance gives a discount when the insured has a locator chip, and I'm guessing that you went for that option. [♪] She can't know. Oh, she most definitely will know, but our problem right now is what the chip-makers don't tell you. Hey! Hurry up, I said! Jacket! Now! Hickman :  These are probably professional kidnappers. Knowing the level of Maxim's security, they'll expect a chip, too. They'll get rid of every shred of clothing, down to his skin. Then glasses, jewellery, piercings, prosthetics... Anything removable that could hide a device. Finally, when he's completely stripped, they'll scan him to check for any electronics. And they're going to find it. Question is... Is the tracking device something that he carries, or did you have it implanted inside him? You put a tracking device inside him? For his own protection. When did you do this? When he visited me in Minsk. A Russian doctor cut open our son? It was probably more like an injection. What kind of monster does that? I'm a monster for wanting him safe? They only thing you wanted is to save money! You mean like hiring those useless French security men? Better than the gorillas you use. I can see how much better your people are. All right, while watching you two has been thoroughly enjoyable, why don't we start focusing on your son? What will they do if they find it, the tracking device? I don't know. It's hard to tell at this point. Well, tell me the truth! The truth about what? We have four dead on the first floor. Do you mind checking it out? Yeah, sure. The victim has a tracer implant. Do we know the tag I.D.? I have it. [Mutters] Just give me a second to set up. 
 
 [♪] These w*nk*rs are efficient. Four dead, eight shots. Clean... Cold. Bodyguard. [Shot fires] Bouncer. [Firing] Bodyguard. [Shot echoes] Who's the girl? [Fires] She looks like a civilian. Maybe she was with the target. Maxim wails : Why did you kill her? Man : Shut up. [Maxim sobs quietly] [♪] Do we know who that girl was, the one they shot? She was called Laure. Maxim's girlfriend. How long had they been together? Six months. She was a gold-digger from the  Banlieue. How do you know that? She hates all his girlfriends, since he was 10 years old. Why else would a 28-year-old be dating a teenager? He'll be 20 next week and he's in love with her. Oh, stop. At that age, boys are in love with every girl. I have it... The tracking device. Is it moving? Doesn't seem to be. Can you get a location? Yep. It's at... Avenue Beauregard in Cannes. Are you sure? What does that mean to you? It's our... Her address. The family villa. He's at home? [♪] Hickman : Don't touch that. Please. [♪] "We will contact you soon." [♪] What is that? It's a microchip. [♪] Is there any indication of time on the note? Only "soon." Where was the device implanted in him? Back of the hand. Probably not a critical injury. Hickman : Hand ain't no picnic. Well... oh, I didn't mean... I'm just busting balls. Messing around. So, Sebastian, set up in the house to trap and trace any ransom call. I'll also capture the data lines, in case they reach out digitally. Good. Poke around the family financial records. We may need them. Wouldn't that be illegal? We're not trying to prosecute him for anything. Not yet. What do you need from me? There was an advance guard, who was not present when the kidnapping took place. Maybe it was an inside job. Right. Eva, I need you in Florence. Maybe there's something from the other kidnapping that can help us here. Okay. Anne-Marie... This is our base of operations. Liaise with the parents. Aghast : Excuse me, sir? Explain that, now, it's a waiting game. We wait for the kidnappers to contact us, then get the insurance company involved. Yeah. Uh... Sir, I'm really sorry, but... [Forced laugh] almost anyone else is better-suited than me... to take care of... You can do it. You can. Mrs. Marianski : No, I'm not listening to you anymore! This is all your fault. How is it my fault? If you spent more time thinking of him... That is one seriously dysfunctional divorce. Quietly : Please, Carl... Their child is in danger. [♪] [Maxim pants in fear] Step, step, step. Get down. [He whimpers] [♪] [Shackles clattering] [Lock shifts and clatters] [Panting] [Grunting] [♪] [Gunshot echoing] [♪] [Footsteps] [Sobbing] Madame Pelletier? Is there news? No, no, no. Um... I... I'm very sorry that this is happening to you, madame. Would you care for some tea? I... I can do that! I'll do that. [♪] [Exhales] Now... let's see what you've been up to, Mr. Marianski. [Punches a key] [♪] [Knocking] [♪] Tommy : I can have a mate who can enhance all this, so... Maybe he'll get something out of it. I'll copy it for you. You're... All from the International Criminal Court? Yeah. Sort of. We, uh, specialize in cross-border crime. These kidnappers may have done another one in Florence. Professional kidnappers don't usually kill anyone, do they? Not unless they have to. It's bad for business. So how long have you worked for the family? Six months. We don't work for the family, by the way. No? Madame Pelletier is the client. The father doesn't trust us. What about Maxim? Maxim... He's a security nightmare. Always taking off, trying to shake off his bodyguards. These kidnappers... They didn't wait till he was alone. Yeah. Probably because of Laure. The girlfriend. He was very protective of her. Is there something you want to say about her? She was the one who wanted to go. To the club? And to the party. The non-existent party. Yeah. That's why Jacques only had one guard with him. I'm sorry about your boss. He was a good man. Good bodyguard. Have you ever lost a partner? Uh, yeah. And... how do you handle the guilt? I figure that out, I'll let you know. [♪] We'll make the video, then I'll call Katya. Hey, hey. That can wait 'til after the video. He must be starving. So? We can do the video after he eats. What? Are you soft for him? Don't be stupid. Then what's troubling you? This. The whole thing. I don't... It feels wrong. Hey. This is our biggest one. Huh? Ever. After that, we'll stop, huh? Like we always wanted. Put your mask back on. I'm not an idiot, Yan. Here, some food. I don't want any. You have to eat. After we make the ransom video, your father will pay, then you can go home. He isn't going to pay anything for me. He will. Then you can go home. Home to what? [♪] [Door locks, bolt clatters] [Computer beeps] Come on. Come on, come on, come on. [Exhales in annoyance] [Mutters under her breath] [Cell ringing] Eva? I'm trying to link Maxim with the Florence victim. They are both teenagers with very rich parents, but different cities, different nationalities, and with different profiles. So, Allesandro, the boy in Florence, but Maxim... Is your typical trust-fund waster. "Waster?" You sound like Tommy. I guess I'm not any happier with people who have too much money. How much is too much? Eva... Do the guys know each other? Okay. Um... no. There's no evidence they've ever met. All right, how can I help? Well, part of the Florence file is available, but the other part is locked,  so I don't know how to get in. I think I can get into it by the time you get to Florence. Okay. Well, I think I'll be there in about... 42 minutes. I've got your progress on my screen. Okay, then. Thanks.  Grazie. Ciao, ciao. Okay. How much are you into them for? [♪] I had a partner who gambled. The only time he talked about it was when he was winning big or losing big. And... no offense, but... you don't seem like a guy on a winning streak. [Laughs] Why is "no offense" always followed by something entirely offensive? I am not into anybody for anything. All right... ♪ ♪ [♪] [Cell begins ringing] Hello, Dorn. What are you doing, Louis? I am on a case. Did you think I wouldn't know? Know? What do you mean, know? Know what? I have alerts everywhere. What are you talking about, Dorn? The Russian, Louis! You said I could handle it without interference. I have. You're running checks on my source. No. Yes, you are. I just told you... I have alerts in the files. Someone is going through the financial records  of the man who gave me Dimitrov. Someone with I.C.C. authorization is trailing him. Are you going to try to tell me that  it isn't you or... your German computer whiz? Your source, what's his name? [Dorn scoffs] What do you mean? [Mimics louis] "What is his name?" Marianski? It's Lev Marianski? Why do you ask me? Because I'm standing in his son's room. [♪] The kidnapping case... it is Marianski's son? Yeah. And we think the kidnappers are Russian, and they used military tactics. It is of utmost importance that you keep me informed, Louis. I must know if Dimitrov is involved. If I were to go to Russia, I would never make it back. ♪ ♪ [Flashback]: Max... [She laughs] [Shutter clicks] [♪] [Gunshot echoing] Time to make a movie! Why? I told you. For the ransom, so you can go home. Why did you kill her? You did that. You killed Laure. [Loud smacking sound, Maxim cries out] It's okay, he didn't hurt me. You stay out of this. You touch her again... And we won't be needing a video. Understand? You think I'm afraid of you? I told her... My father isn't going to pay to get me back. He hates me. Just say what I tell you to say. No. [♪] Then I'll kill your mother. [♪] After the divorce, we used to sit here, having tea together in the morning, Maxim and me. That must've been nice. Nice? Do you know what they talked about the entire time? While they were having their... Their "nice" tea? About me. Don't flatter yourself. Tell her all the things you told a teenage boy...  a teenage boy... About his father. I really don't need to know. She told him... I slept around, that I brought diseases home, that I fathered other children, that I never cared about them. What part of that is not true? A boy needs to look up to his father. You poisoned him about me. To make your... yourself feel better, to control him. Like you control him with money? While you let him squander all yours. Because you cut off his support. I only had to support him until he was 18 or in school. He's neither. Such a cheap b*st*rd! He does nothing! Won't work! Won't study! My cutting him off will finally make him act like a man. That's enough! What are you doing? This is a game? [♪] You know, a lot of people would love to have a child, and all you do is... Use him to hurt each other? No, we don't. We are under stress. Okay. Yeah. "Stress." Anne-Marie? We're meeting on the terrace. I suggest you find somewhere to sit... and think. Separately. Okay? [♪] [Computer beeps] [♪] [Ringing] Hello? You didn't tell the Italians about me going into their files, did you? Excuse me? Well, I remember you saying you were going to tell them to run a check-up on their systems. Yeah. I... I remember that. I was just kidding. Yeah, I tried to access a Trojan Horse I installed,  but it seems closed. Well, I wouldn't tell them, okay? Well... whatever it is in that file, Florence really wants it secret. I have the address of a witness, so I might just ask how it all got solved. All right. I'll be here if you need me. Eva :  Okay. Thank you. Ciao. Mutters to self : Dammit. [Thumps phone down] Something wrong, mate? No. Nothing. Yeah, well, Louis has called us together. Coming. Uploading the video... Now. [♪] I have the file. This is the message... "10 million Euros in cash, by 6:00 tonight. Delivery instructions will follow." I thought it was five million? The price has doubled. Why? Because I am in charge. What do you mean, you're in charge? Just tell them, Katya! 10 million. [♪] You think the girlfriend set Maxim up for the kidnapping? She sent the advance team to a non-existent party and she planned the trip to the nightclub. Seems kind of short-sighted of her. He's her boyfriend, and apparently, he's worth millions. Well, his father just cut his support. Really? So, what? Maxim was broke? Rich-kid "broke." He had a driver, a bodyguard and a limo. Which were all about to be taken away. Maybe he's in on it? I doubt he had a part in killing the girlfriend. Security said his whole lifestyle changed when he met her, became more... responsible. Maybe the kidnappers killed Laure just because she was a witness? Not the first time. Okay, so, we dig into the girlfriend's life and see if her contacts give us a name. There's something else about Marianski. What? He doesn't have insurance on Maxim. Not anymore. And, for him, he's short on cash. Most of his money is tied up in investments and property, but he's only got a little more than 10 million in liquid funds. He cancelled the policy? Yeah. About six months ago. What? [Footsteps] You went into my records? Did you cancel the insurance? You were angry I even bought it. [Skype alert pings] That's our Skype call. [Alert continues pinging] It's coming in on the family account. Mr. Marianski, get in the chair. Hickman : The important thing is to not let them think that there's a problem. Just listen to the demand, and we'll figure it out later, all right? Are you ready, Sebastian? [Computer beeps] Recording. [Skype keeps pinging] Answer it. [Hits key] Maman? Oh, God! Maxim :  Please pay. These people have killed. They will hurt me. Scrambled voice : The ransom is 10 million Euros,  by 6:00 P.M. tonight. [♪] But... The insurance lapsed. I need more time. Scrambled voice :  6:00 P.M. It's only 10 hours! I need more time. You don't have any more time. [Skype closes] [♪] [Explosion roars]
