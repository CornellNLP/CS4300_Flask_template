 And cut! 
 Got it! Print! 
 Let's move on. 
 Next up, scene 55! Company, move to the stages! 
 Audrey, your costume's in your room. 
 Oh, wait, um, and with this. 
 I'll try this then. Thanks. 
 I'll be on set. 
 Thank you, sweetie. 
 The truth will set you free... 
 The truth will set you free! 
 Don't move. 
 Okay. 
 I got him. You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. 
 Perp is down. Subject is safe. 
 Good job. Let's take him in for questioning. 
 That was easy. 
 A little too easy. 
 If you ever want to change jobs, you'd make a great stunt double. 
 Jumping out windows and falling down stairs? 
 That's too dangerous for me. 
 Well, you get shot at. 
 Yeah, but I can shoot back. 
 Ha. Touché. 
 Here she is. She's fine. 
 Good job. 
 You're not hurt? 
 Not at all. 
 And please thank Michel again for me. 
 I will. 
 He's a good man. 
 Well, you're all incredible. 
 Thank you. So, um, this... this guy, you've... you've never seen him before? 
 No. Never. Excuse me. 
 Uh, you're absolutely sure? 
 Stalkers usually get close a number of times before working up the stones to make contact with their prey. 
 "Prey?" 
 You make me sound so helpless. 
 It's not you, it's them, really. 
 Stalkers can sometimes be very dangerous people. 
 Especially if they are delusional. 
 We think that you may not be his first. 
 Tonino Piovani received the same hate mail as you. 
 "All false idols must die"? Piovani and me? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, we're ready for touch-ups, Audrey! 
 Right... 
 We will contact you about making a statement. 
 Anything you need. 
 You take care. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Theo, it's me. 
 They got him. Let's hope this is all over now. 
 Clément Blanc is a French citizen, 25 years of age. 
 He has a juvenile record of various drug-related offenses. 
 Mostly possession. 
 Right. Disappeared off the grid about three years ago. 
 Disappeared? 
 No records, cell phone, bank card usage, no IP address, nothing. As if he ceased to exist. 
 You searched him, he had nothing on him? 
 Only the tranquilizer gun and that necklace. 
 The dart gun, very different from the murder in Rome two months ago. 
 Piovani didn't get sedatives. Just a knife, four times. 
 Maybe Piovani wasn't supposed to die immediately? 
 To what end? Kidnapping? Ransom? 
 Torture? Maybe he wanted information? 
 About what? 
 $64,000 question. 
 Why warn the potential targets by mail? 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 All it did here was allow us to catch him. 
 We've been here almost half an hour, and all we've done is memorize each other's faces. 
 This isn't about making things worse. 
 You were caught in the act. 
 I'm not trying to incriminate you. 
 I just want to give you the chance to explain yourself. 
 To tell me your truth. 
 Is there something about the truth? 
 There is no truth here. 
 Maybe you can provide some. 
 Stop defending the lies. 
 What prevails, what survives, will be the truth. 
 That makes sense. 
 Audrey St. Marie? 
 Do you think she lied to you? 
 She lies to the world. She's the queen of lies. 
 She pretends to be other people. 
 You wanted to what, make her tell the truth? 
 Kill her so she would stop lying? 
 Carl, what do you think? 
 Don't know yet. 
 Seeger, incoming. 
 Oh, man. 
 When's the last time you were in Italy, Clément? 
 The name Piovani? 
 Ring a bell? 
 Hmm? 
 No? You know, I'm just trying to get a reading on whether you're a garden-variety asshole, or full-on Looney Tunes psychopath? 
 You know, at first I thought this was just for a quick buck. 
 You know, threaten an actress, take her hostage, get the insurance company for the film to pay up. 
 There's no profit in falsehood. 
 You have a problem with us thinking that you profited? 
 You're making false accusations. 
 Which accusation is false? 
 You were going to kill her, or just take her? 
 What was your goal? 
 They are all false idols. 
 That is just the phrase in these letters. 
 They were sent to... 
 Audrey St. Marie and Tonino Piovani. 
 He was stabbed to death. Did you do that, Clément, hmm? 
 Did you hack him up? 
 There are many false idols. 
 So why Audrey? Hmm? 
 She is only a symbol, a mask for the lies. There is no profit in falsehood. 
 Yeah, so you said. 
 Well, uh, no worries. 
 You're not going anywhere, and we have forever. 
 Forever may not be as long as you think. 
 What do you mean? 
 This world ends soon. 
 It will be reborn from night into day. 
 But not before the weekend, right? 
 Because I got tickets for a hockey game... 
 What's going on there, Clément? 
 We need a medic. 
 That was the hospital. 
 He has serious concussion, and there may be cerebral damage. 
 Not that we need any more bad news, but I can't find any indication that Clément was ever in Italy. 
 So we are certain the two murders are connected, but we don't have any evidence to that effect. 
 Aside from one delusional nutter? 
 An Italian film agent, a French actress filming in Holland, and a French perpetrator. 
 It's almost too random to be random. 
 Maybe he's a movie critic. The French can be tough. 
 "The world reborn from night into day." 
 Don't apocalyptic visions usually come from a group mentality? 
 Yeah, they do. Like a cult, with followers. 
 There could be more assailants and potential victims. 
 So the crimes can be connected even if Clément isn't. 
 There has to be a connection between the victims. 
 Carl, Sebastian, Tommy, go back to the crime scene in Italy. 
 Arabela, we are going to France to talk to Clément's mother. 
 Wow. I didn't know film agents lived as good as film actors. 
 10% of everything and no paparazzi following you around? 
 Nice gig, if you ask me. 
 Someone followed this guy. 
 Piovani didn't show up to work. 
 Assistant found the body. 
 Plastic bag over his head. 
 He was nailed to the door through his... feet and hands, then stabbed four times. 
 He bled out. 
 Piovani weighed what, about a hundred kilos? 
 And how the hell did Clément do that? 
 You couldn't nail a guy up to a door like that without help. 
 Here we go, it's cooking all the data. 
 That's Piovani. 
 Pool of blood collecting there under his feet. 
 What does that look like to you? 
 Imprint of a shoe. Let me zoom in. 
 A trainer. 
 Yeah, the right one. 
 Stab, stab, stab, stab... 
 Four times... from this angle, the perp was standing in this position right here. 
 He was right-handed. 
 And? 
 Clément's a lefty. 
 When may I see him? 
 Unfortunately, we have not finished interviewing him yet. 
 I do not know what more I could have done. 
 I know what you feel. 
 Do you have children? 
 I had a son. 
 Oh, so sorry. 
 What was Clément like as a boy? 
 At 16, he became involved in drugs. 
 If it's any consolation, he tested clean for us. 
 He stopped completely a couple of years ago. 
 How'd he do it? 
 He found someone. 
 That's Nicholas Wells. He's a New Yorker. 
 Yeah, he's a big-time director. 
 Yeah, he was killed, too. 
 Yeah, about six months ago. 
 Yeah, Upper West Side. Major news. Big case. 
 And he and Piovani knew each other. 
 Who are you calling? 
 Amanda. 
 In New York? Do you know what time it is there? 
 Yeah, she won't care. She's all about the job. 
 Amanda, it's me. 
 Do you know what time it is? 
 What? 
 It's 2:00 in the morning. 
 Oh, it is? Sorry about that. 
 I didn't mean to wake you. 
 But as long as you're up, I got something for you. 
 Is this going to mean another trip to Europe? 
 Yeah. 
 The young man's name was Mathis... and they started to spend all their time together, and just like that, Clément stopped the drugs. 
 But then he met the others. 
 The others? 
 Friends of Mathis. 
 Clément didn't share much, but I had the impression they were part of a spiritual society of some kind. 
 And he changed? 
 He became... distant. 
 Told me our relationship was a lie. 
 Can you believe it? His own mother. 
 Did he mention any other names? 
 Or maybe where the group might be located? 
 No, just that it was here in France, and that... uh, it would be a... a a rebirth, or something. 
 Did he say something about the end of the world? 
 My world ended three years ago when Clément vanished. 
 This photo was taken yesterday. 
 Clément... 
 Theo. 
 I need to meet you. Tonight. 
 Meet? Why? 
 It's important. We must meet tonight. 
 If you insist. How about 11:00 on Prinsestraat? 
 Blink your lights, I'll come to you. 
 You're not a journalist, you're a cancer, spreading your lies to the world. 
 Do you know who can never, ever tell a lie? 
 A dead man. 
 Just can't live without me, can you? 
 Fly all night, and then straight to work. 
 That's impressive. 
 I was reviewing the case on the plane. 
 I don't want to waste any time. 
 Let's get right to it. 
 This way. 
 Clément Blanc, this here is Detective Andrews, she came all the way from New York City. 
 She took a red-eye. 
 Nicolas Wells? 
 He was murdered six months ago. Did you know him? 
 Help me out here. 
 You brought me 3,500 miles to meet a mime? 
 This is good for him. 
 Last time, he tried to put his head through a table. 
 I read the transcripts from your interview, Clem. 
 Seems like you're pretty interested in the truth. 
 How about this truth? 
 Either you or your good buddy killed Wells, but I can't... I can't find any record of you entering the U.S. 
 I like Mathis for this one. 
 Mathis? 
 All right, we've got good news and we've got bad news. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Clément Blanc confessed to the murder of Nicholas Wells in New York City. 
 That is the good news? 
 Bad news is he also confessed to killing Tonino Piovani. 
 Yeah, he's a liar. He lies. 
 "All false idols will be destroyed by their own lies. 
 Those who worship them shall choke on their ashes. 
 We shall bring truth to the world." 
 I think the key word here is "we." 
 Nicolas Wells received nearly identical letters. 
 Nicholas Wells was shot four times. 
 Any one of those shots would have been fatal. 
 Four nails, then four stab wounds in the Italian case. 
 Each victim was killed on the fourth day of the month. 
 Nice and symmetrical, but a connection? 
 I could never get that past a D.A. in Brooklyn. 
 Well, I mean, it might have a significance. Four, four, four... 
 Could be mathematically symbolic. 
 Or spiritual. 
 The mother mentioned a group, a spiritual group, a cult. 
 This could be the symbol of that. 
 I'm running the design against known cults right now. 
 Well, if this is cult-related, and they're talking about the end of the world, this might be a little bit bigger than we thought. 
 We've had some real nightmare scenarios with cults worldwide. 
 Yeah, Sarin gas, Tokyo. 
 Jonestown. Waco. 
 Uh, nothing. 
 There's no record of a cult using a symbol like this. 
 It could be new, though. Too recent to have been reported. 
 Yeah. Madame Blanc? 
 Major Daniel. Yes. 
 I think it is time for you to be reunited with your son. 
 Audrey. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, bye. So sorry. Terry, my director. 
 As I said, "The hardest working woman in show business" 
 You are the hardest working man in your business. 
 I ordered the crispy herring for starters. 
 Oh! Parfait. 
 You... you remembered? 
 I did. 
 No, thank you. I gave up alcohol last year. 
 You did? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Oh, goodness me. You so loved champagne. 
 So, what shall we eat? 
 Doctor said they got the results of his CAT scan. 
 It's good news, they didn't find any. 
 Cats. 
 You've been using that joke for 15 years. 
 Yeah, and it's been working for 15 years. 
 No, it doesn't work. 
 Yes, it does. 
 So... Shari? 
 Have you tried? 
 Still giving her space. 
 Chicken sh1t. 
 Whatever. 
 This is for you. 
 All he wants is that you don't hurt his friend Mathis. 
 It's okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Louis. We've got Mathis' address. He's in The Hague. 
 That was delicious. 
 Aw, look at the time. 
 Yes, Sir. 
 I'll introduce you to your security team tonight. 
 I have my own security staff at the studio. 
 And surely with that young man in custody... 
 It's just for a few days, until we sort things out. 
 They'll be waiting when I take you back to the hotel. 
 Oh, don't fuss, Michel. I have a friend picking me up. 
 The phone belongs to Theo Baudouin, a French film journalist. 
 He had a 30-second conversation with Audrey St. Marie, this afternoon. 
 Yeah. We tried to call her immediately, but it went to voice mail. 
 I've tracked the signal, though. 
 She's with Dorn, Prinsestraat. 
 I'll get Eva. 
 Oh, that's for me. 
 
 
 
 Thank you for a wonderful evening. 
 You're ravishing, Audrey. Quite simply the best company. 
 Yes, Louis? 
 Dorn, stay with Audrey, she's in danger. 
 Audrey, stop! 
 Stay back! Drop it! 
 Drop it! 
 Drop it! Now! 
 We need an ambulance here! 
 Audrey... come... come away. Come away! 
 Another true believer. 
 Louis? They lost him. He died on the operating table. 
 Christ of almighty! 
 My thoughts exactly. 
 Who was this young man? 
 Mathis Carteaux, French, 20. Same M.O. as Clément. 
 They were both wearing identical talismans around their necks. 
 Between Clément's self-mutilation on the interrogation table, and this guy Mathis throwing himself in front of traffic, these guys are like suicide bombers without a bomb. 
 But they butchered the other victims, and tried to drug Audrey instead. 
 I'll let her know what's happening. 
 Is there nothing more we can get from this Mr. Clément Blanc? 
 He's completely brainwashed. 
 If we can crack the spell, we can get to him. 
 What about the apartment? 
 Transient place, sublet of a sublet. 
 Paid in cash. No computers, no cell. 
 But I haven't been able to find anything on the internet that matches that necklace. 
 The lab tested it. It's an alloy of bronze, silver, and copper. 
 It's highly unusual. 
 Something like that would have to be custom made. 
 Well, can we find out where it's made? 
 Sure something as unusual as that could just as easily be made in someone's garage. 
 Or... it was made in one of only six foundries in Europe that casts bespoke metal. 
 Any located in France? 
 Mm-hmm, one. 
 And if they made these medallions, they will have the address on the order. 
 Yes, Madame St. Marie. My name is Dorn. 
 That's nonsense. 
 I brought her there myself last night. 
 Uh... Okay. I will try her cell. Thank you. 
 I found something odd. 
 Two years ago, Audrey St. Marie attended the film festival outside Cassis, along with Nicolas Wells and Tonino Piovani. 
 Thousands of celebrities attend these events. 
 It doesn't mean they actually know each other. 
 Looks like they did. 
 Yeah. Nicholas Wells received an award the night this picture was taken. 
 April 4th, 2012. 
 Copyrighted by our dead journalist, Theo Baudouin. 
 So that makes four victims. 
 I don't think we're getting the whole story from Madame St. Marie. 
 I wonder if we should believe any of her story. 
 No word from her yet? 
 Dorn has everyone under watch... airports, roads, everything. 
 Starting to look like she wanted to disappear. 
 "Centre de Vérité." 
 "Center of Truth." 
 Well, the medallion makes sense. 
 How so? 
 One side it depicted a number four, on the other, a griffin. 
 That bird-beast thing? 
 It's European mythology. 
 The wings, feet, and head of an eagle on the body of a lion. 
 According to the myth, you can only speak the truth around the griffin. 
 You know why I can't lie to a mythical creature? 
 Because they don't bloody exist. 
 Welcome to the Centre de Vérité. 
 We need to speak to whoever's in charge. 
 Follow me. 
 The truth-teller. 
 Élu? I'm Carl Hickman. 
 Detectives Seeger and McConnell. 
 You'll pardon me if I don't shake your hand. 
 I wouldn't if you offered. 
 A handshake is a pact that only two may enter. 
 Thus, a secret of a kind. 
 Actually, a handshake just shows that you don't have a weapon. 
 There are no secrets here. 
 The griffin cannot be lied to. 
 Well, glad we got that cleared up. 
 You have a couple of members of your choir that are suspects in multiple homicides. 
 Clément Blanc and Mathis Carteaux. 
 Those... unhappy, broken men. 
 Isn't it your job to fix them up. 
 This is no longer simply a centre of rehabilitation. 
 I saw death, and was given the gift of enlightenment. 
 You don't say. 
 I have seen it. 
 I felt the griffin talons in my flesh. 
 It tore out my illusions and showed me reality. 
 I share that reality with all of the pure-hearted that will listen. 
 What a coincidence, I'm all about truth and reality. 
 So, about these two guys... 
 Those men left our sanctuary a year ago. 
 Did they say anything or leave any indication what... 
 What they planned? 
 Exactly. 
 We can only plan for the end of the world. 
 Do you know what happens then? 
 The world ends? 
 It is transfigured. A new beginning for the pure. 
 I, for example, shall become the Griffin. 
 You're going to become a lion with wings? 
 I'd like to see that. 
 I will become of the Griffin at the end of days. 
 Today we prepare a feast to celebrate the imminent new dawn. 
 It's like the Last Supper. 
 For some. 
 And this end of the world is... 
 At the break of day, tomorrow. 
 April fourth. Do the Mayans know about that? 
 The fourth day of the fourth month. 
 The four talons of the griffin. 
 The four imperishable truths. 
 Are we really listening to this? 
 I understand it is difficult to comprehend, but it is the truth. 
 Are you categorically deny knowing anything about Clément or Mathis or what they're doing? 
 My apologies, I cannot help you. 
 Well, we'll see you tomorrow. 
 You know, end of the world day. 
 The picture was taken two years ago on the fourth of April. 
 And tomorrow... is the fourth of April. 
 Ah, you must be the ICC? 
 Yes. Major Daniel from the ICC. This is Detective Berger. 
 Nice to meet you. Hugo Tati, Head of Security here. What can I do for you gentlemen? 
 Were you on duty two years ago? 
 Every year. 
 Do you remember seeing the actress Audrey St. Marie here that year? 
 Oh, yes. She was drunk and belligerent. 
 Not a very nice sight. 
 Was she alone? 
 No, no, there was a group of them. 
 I remember we had to throw them out. 
 I remember one of them tried to hit me. 
 Some American film director who had just won a prize. 
 Nicolas Wells. 
 Yeah, that was him. 
 So they got into a car and they drove off to the hotel. 
 What route were they taking? 
 There's only the one from here. 
 It's called La Griffe. 
 "The claws." 
 That's what the locals call it. A perilous stretch of road. 
 Twists and turns, cliffs on one side. 
 Do you recall who was driving that night? 
 Yes. 
 It was Audrey St. Marie. 
 Are you sure? 
 Oh, yes, I'm sure. 
 Hello. I'm Audrey St. Marie. 
 Yes, I know who you are. 
 But what are you doing here? 
 Does Bruno Antoine live here? 
 My father died about a year ago. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 May I speak with you for a moment? 
 Sure. Come in. 
 So not only did all the victims know each other, they also partied together. 
 Audrey is a liar. 
 Hang on. I've been doing some digging with the local police. 
 There was a hit-and-run reported the same night as the film festival. 
 Late night on the 4th of April, 2012. 
 A couple was hit by an unidentified car. 
 La Griffe. 
 According to this, the couple was thrown down the cliff into the sea. 
 She died on impact and her body was recovered a few kilometres away. 
 Her husband survived, but incurred serious brain trauma, And who reported the accident? 
 First responding officer who wrote the report... 
 Bruno Antoine. 
 Then we have to find his address. 
 I only found out about this charity fund you set up just before my father died. 
 I think it's very strange that a movie star would be in contact with a small town policeman. 
 We met, about two years ago. 
 And you thought my father should be the chairman of a charity for traffic accident victims? 
 With an annual income of 50,000 euros? 
 He was the best man for it. 
 Actually, I would love you to take over. 
 No. I'm not interested. 
 Did your father say anything to you? 
 What do you mean exactly? 
 About charity or... or me? 
 He became quite agitated near the end, wanted me to deliver a letter. 
 A letter? To me? 
 No, to a center nearby, some sort of a spiritual retreat. 
 But I believe it had something to do with you. 
 You meet the high priest? 
 Well, I hope you don't have any big plans, because apparently, the end of the world is tomorrow. 
 Dammit, I just sent in my credit card payment. 
 Hey, I bought hockey tickets. 
 They have hockey here? 
 Go Amsterdam G's! How's Clément? 
 Oh, you know, chatty as ever. 
 Yeah, he was like that even before he busted his head. 
 Hang on. How long did you say he was unconscious for? 
 Um... couple of days. Why? 
 We may be able to get what we need out of him, but we'll need Sebastian's help. 
 I'll see you in about three hours. All right. Taxi! 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah. Major Daniels from the ICC. Detective Berger. 
 We're looking for Bruno Antoine. 
 My father is very popular today, for a deceased man. 
 Pardon me? 
 Well, first a movie star is looking for him, and now you, police. 
 Perhaps you can tell me what's going on? 
 Are you saying Audrey St. Marie was here? 
 Okay, that's odd. 
 What is it? 
 She came with that car, and I saw her get out. 
 Major Daniel. 
 Yeah? 
 There's no one here. 
 Thank you. 
 Audrey St. Marie tried to call Dorn, but was cut off. 
 I found the phone next to her car. 
 Élu knows we're onto him. 
 Maybe he's trying to get a jump on Armageddon. 
 One of my contacts in Paris has new information for us. 
 Two years back, Audrey checked into rehab on the sixth of April. 
 She was in a drink-driving accident only two days before that. 
 This is the hit-and-run victim, Frédéric Roubert. 
 The psycho otherwise known as Élu. 
 Maybe they returned Audrey to the scene of her crime. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Look who's back. 
 Did you miss us? 
 We suspect your Master Élu has taken Audrey hostage and we need to know where. 
 It's all part of becoming true. 
 And the end of things. 
 Which... happens on the fourth of April. 
 Correct? Right? Fourth? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Humanity will be reborn. 
 It's funny, I just... I don't feel any different. 
 I'm totally good. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Today is the fifth of April, Clément. 
 It cannot be. 
 You were out for a full three days. 
 You were. Here, look. Look for yourself. 
 The world didn't end, Clément. 
 And lucky for me I didn't tear up my hockey tickets. 
 Élu used you and your friend Mathis. 
 He wanted revenge. His real name is Frédéric Roubert, and he is no prophet. 
 He is a sick, cunning murderer. 
 Now, we need to know where Audrey is before it's too late, and you are the only one who can save her now. 
 Don't make your mother live with you making the wrong decision. 
 They got a tranquilizer gun for her, so they didn't want to kill her. 
 Yeah, Carl. 
 A cliff. Clément says they're taking Audrey to a cliff. 
 I've got the coordinates. 
 We know exactly where she is. 
 Now we can fulfill the prophecy! 
 A blood sacrifice! Blood polluted with putrid lies! 
 Her blood! 
 Take the sins of the world with you. 
 Let the lies die with you on those jagged rocks! 
 Let the truth be reborn! 
 Liar! 
 No, listen! Listen! 
 I was driving the car that killed your wife. 
 I was drunk! I didn't mean for it to happen! 
 Please, I beg forgiveness. 
 Make me as you are, let me be pure. 
 See how now she even performs for us! 
 Do not be fooled by this puppet! 
 No, no, no, this is no act, I swear! 
 I made a dreadful mistake. 
 Please, believe me. Please... 
 Please. Believe me. 
 Throw her from the cliff! 
 Now! 
 Wait! Don't move. Get down? 
 All of you, get down! Get down on the ground! 
 Get down now! 
 Don't move. Don't move. 
 Don't move! 
 The truth will set you free. 
 No! 
 So you used us to protect yourself, to hide the truth. 
 Why did you do it? It was an accident. 
 Now we have five more people dead. 
 All right. 
 Looks like we got company. 
 I hope she's ready for her close-up. 
 ... A spiritual retreat near Cannes. 
 The cult leader is alleged to have manipulated his followers into a killing spree. 
 Allegedly, actress Audrey St. Marie was intoxicated when her vehicle struck and killed a woman, perpetuating a cover-up of the incident, which occurred exactly two years ago. 
 Well... 
 Time to go? 
 Some victories are gratifying, Hickman. 
 Others just... make one tired. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Well, the world has been spared at least until the fourth of next month. 
 Yeah, we're just like the Justice League. 
 You're still using that one, too, huh? 
 I need new material, don't I? 
 You do. You really do. 
 Come on. You know what? I jumped on a plane to save your ass, yet again, the least you could do is take me for dinner. 
 There is no place in this town at this time that I can take you that you would like. 
 Are you calling me a snob? 
 No, no, no, I'm just saying, you don't favor ptomaine poisoning. 
 Remember what we used to do late at night at the squad? 
 Hmm? 
 Okay, here we go, dessert, energy bar or candy bar? 
 I'll have whatever you don't want. 
 Energy bar it is. 
 Oh, dammit. 
 You're funny. 
 You know that? You make me laugh. 
 So have you really not spoken to Shari since I left? 
 I tried a couple of times. 
 Mmm. 
 She's not feeling it. 
 I, uh...
