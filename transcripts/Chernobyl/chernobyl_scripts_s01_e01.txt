 MAN (RECORDED VOICE): What is the cost of lies?   
 It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth.   
 The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all.    
 What can we do then?    
 What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories?    
 In these stories, it doesn't matter who the heroes are.    
 All we want to know is: who is to blame?    
 In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.    
 He was the best choice.    
 An arrogant, unpleasant man, he ran the room that night, he gave the orders... and no friends.    
 Or, at least, not important ones.    
 And now Dyatlov will spend the next ten years in a prison labor camp.    
 Of course, that sentence is doubly unfair.    
 There were far greater criminals than him at work.    
 And as for what Dyatlov did do, the man doesn't deserve prison.    
 He deserves death.    
 (RECORDER CLICKS)    
 (CLEARS THROAT)    
 But instead, ten years for "criminal mismanagement."    
 What does that mean?    
 No one knows. It doesn't matter.    
 What does matter is that, to them, justice was done.    
 Because, you see, to them a just world is a sane world.    
 There was nothing sane about Chernobyl.    
 What happened there, what happened after, even the good we did, all of it... all of it... madness.    
 Well, I've given you everything I know.    
 They'll deny it, of course.    
 They always do.    
 I know you'll try your best.

 First, the accident... (STAMMERS) is well under control.     
 And second, because the efforts of the Soviet nuclear industry are considered key state secrets, it is important that we ensure that this incident has no adverse consequences.     
 Now, to prevent a panic, the Central Committee have ordered a detachment of military police to Pripyat.

 Sometimes, we forget.     
 Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.     
 But our faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded.     
 Now, the State tells us the situation here is not dangerous.     
 Have faith, comrades.     
 The State tells us it wants to prevent a panic.     
 Listen well.     
 It's true, when the people see the police, they will be afraid.     
 But it is my experience that when the people ask questions that are not in their own best interest, they should simply be told to keep their minds on their labor and leave matters of 
the State to the State.     
 We seal off the city.     
 No one leaves.

 Contain the spread of misinformation.     
 That is how we keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labor.     
 Yes, comrades... we will all be rewarded for what we do here tonight.     
 This is our moment to shine.     
 (APPLAUSE CONTINUES WITHIN)     
 Thank you.     
 Comrade Sitnikov to see the Chief Engineer.     
 Well?     
 (CLEARS THROAT)     
 I sent my dosimetrists into the reactor building.     
 The large dosimeter from the safe, the one with the ,   -roentgen capacity...     
 What was the number?     
 There was none.     
 The meter burned out the second it was turned on.     
 - It's typical. 
- See? This is what Moscow does.     
 Sends us sh1t equipment, then wonders why things go wrong.     
 We found another dosimeter from the military fire department.     
 It only goes to     roentgen, but it's better than the small ones.     
 And?     
 It maxed out.     
 Two hundred roentgen.     
 What game are you playing?     
 No, I... I...     
 I asked him, he took multiple measurements, he's my best man.     
 It's another faulty meter. You're wasting our time.     
 I checked the meter against the control.     
 What's wrong with you? 
How'd you get that number from feedwater leaking from a blown tank?     
 - You don't. 
- Then what the f*ck are you talking about?     
 I, um... (CLEARS THROAT)     
 I walked around the exterior of Building  .     
 I think there's graphite on the ground in the rubble.     
 You didn't see graphite.     
 - I did. 
- You didn't.     
 You didn't! Because it's not there!     
 What?     
 Are you suggesting the core... what?     
 Exploded?     
 Yes.     
 Sitnikov.     
 You're a nuclear engineer, so am I.     
 Please tell me how an RBMK reactor core explodes.     
 Not a meltdown, an explosion.     
 I'd love to know.     
 I can't.     
 Are you stupid?     
 - No. 
- Then why can't you?     
 I... (STAMMERS)     
 I don't see how it could explode.     
 - But it did. 
- DYATLOV: Enough!     
 I'll go up to the vent block roof.     
 From there you can look right down into reactor Building  .     
 I'll see it with my own... my own eyes.     
 (VOMITING)     
 I apologize.     
 Guards! Guards!     
 Get him to the medic or the hospital! Whatever he needs!     
 (GROANING)     
 It's the feedwater. Been around it all night.     
 You go then.     
 What?     
 Go to the vent block roof and report back what you see.     
 No.     
 - No, I won't do that. 
- Of course you will.     
 You'll be fine. You'll see.     
 Come on.     
 (SLOSHING)     
 Okay.     
 Let's begin.     
 (CREAKING)     
 Leonid.     
 Leonid.     
 Oh...     
 (GRUNTS)     
 AKIMOV: It's all the way, okay?     
 All the way open.     
 (CREAKING)     
 I'm sorry.     
 (CRYING)     
 There's nothing to be sorry for.     
 I told you, we did nothing wrong.     
 But we did.

 Hello?

 You are the Legasov who is the First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy?     
 - I am. Who am I...?

 Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and head of the Bureau for Fuel and Energy.     
 There's been an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.     
 How bad is it?     
 No. No need to panic. There was a fire.     
 It's mostly put out. The system control tank exploded.     
 Control system tank. And the core?     
 We've ordered them to continuously pump water.     
 Yes, I see. Any contamination?     
 It's mild. The plant manager, Bryukhanov, is reporting

 That's actually significant. You should evacuate the sur...     
 You're an expert on RBMK reactors, correct?     
 Yes, I've studied...     
 General Secretary Gorbachev has appointed a committee to manage the accident. You're on it.     
 We'll convene at two this afternoon.     
 That late? Forgive me, but don't you think given the amount of radiation that it would be...     
 Legasov, you're on this committee to answer direct questions about the function of an RBMK reactor if they should happen to arise. Nothing else.     
 Certainly not policy. Do you understand?     
 - Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...

 BORIS SHCHERBINA: I'm pleased to report that the situation in Chernobyl is stable.     
 In terms of radiation, I'm told it's the equivalent of a chest X-ray.     
 No!     
 The fire is giving off nearly twice the radiation released by the bomb in Hiroshima.     
 It will burn and spread its poison until the entire continent is dead.
