 VALERY LEGASOV: Moscow. Hospital number six.   
 WOMAN: Are you here because of the fire?   
 Anything we should be worried about?   
 No.   
 It cannot go over the core.    
 BORIS SHCHERBINA: The nuclear plant in Sweden has detected radiation.    
 MAN: At least evacuate Pripyat.    
 When the lava enters these tanks, it will instantly superheat, causing a significant thermal explosion.    
 And how long before this happens?    
 Approximately    to    hours, but we may have a solution.

 We have successfully eliminated the risk of a thermal explosion.     
 (SIGHS)     
 And?     
 The situation inside the core is deteriorating faster than anticipated.     
 The concrete pad will last for six to eight weeks, but after that, Legasov estimates a   % chance that the fuel will breach the pad and melt down into the groundwater itself.     
 (STAMMERS) And where does this groundwater go?     
 The Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper.     
 The primary water supply for approximately    million people, not to mention crops and livestock, would be... unusable.     
 We're recommending we install a heat exchanger under the pad to lower to core temperature and halt the meltdown.     
 And in order to do that, I'm told that we will need... all of the liquid nitrogen in the Soviet Union.

 What will happen to our boys?     
 Which boys? The divers?     
 The divers, the firefighters, the men in the control room.     
 What does the radiation do to them precisely?     
 At the levels some of them were exposed?     
 Ionizing radiation tears the cellular structure apart.     
 The skin blisters, turns red, then black.     
 This is followed by a latency period.     
 The immediate effects subside.     
 The patient appears to be recovering.     
 Healthy, even. But they aren't.     
 This usually only lasts for a day or two.     
 Continue.     
 Then the cellular damage begins to manifest.     
 The bone marrow dies, the immune system fails, the organs and soft tissue begin to decompose.     
 The arteries and veins spill open like sieves, to the point where you can't even administer morphine for the pain, which is... unimaginable.     
 And then three days to three weeks, you are dead.     
 That is what will happen to those boys.     
 And what about us?     
 Well, we've...     
 We've gotten a steady dose, but not as much of it.     
 Not strong enough to kill the cells, but consistent enough to damage our DNA.     
 So, in time... cancer.     
 Or aplastic anemia. Either way, fatal.     
 Well... in a sense, it would seem we've gotten off easy then, Valery.     
 I've seen them before.

 Heat exchanger, I hope.     
 Yes.     
 There's something I've wanted to ask you, comrade, but I see you're already asking yourself the same question.     
 Why did it explode?     
 I've worked the numbers over and over, presuming the worst possible conditions in an RBMK reactor.     
 And I always get the same answer.     
 Which is?     
 It's not possible.     
 And yet...     
 You're not going to solve this here.     
 Not on paper.     
 Everyone who was in the control room, Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov, they're all in Moscow, Hospital Number  .

 I am with the official Chernobyl Commission, and I've been authorized by Valery Legasov.     
 - You can check this. My name is Ulana... 
- We know who you are.     
 What is everyone gonna hear?     
 You have your notes?     
 Yes.     
 Khomyuk was arrested last night.     
 What? Why?     
 I don't know.     
 - Was it...? 
- Of course it was.     
 I'm working on it.     
 - Boris... 
- I'm working on it.     
 What more do you want from me?     
 Fix your tie.     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 They'll see you now.     
 After thousands of sorties, our brave helicopter crews successfully extinguished the fire.     
 The miners are working heroically to ensure that the fuel does not reach the groundwater.     
 And furthermore, there is no longer a threat of additional explosion.     
 The Soviet people have faced the challenge and risen to the task, and they and everyone in this room are to be commended.     
 Lastly, Professor Legasov and I have been vigilant to protect the security interests of the State.     
 And since the unfortunate release of information directly following the accident, we believe that there has been no further lapse.     
 Comrade Charkov, we hope we have lived up to the highest standards of the KGB.     
 You have.     
 SHCHERBINA: Thank you.     
 Professor Legasov will now speak about the work that remains.     
 Thank you.     
 Deputy Chairman Shcherbina has given you the good news, and it is good.     
 The immediate danger is over.     
 Now, I'm afraid, a long war must begin.     
 There is an enormous amount of radioactive debris and contamination spread out across a zone of approximately      square kilometers.     
 This entire region must be completely evacuated.     
 We must go to every town, every village to ensure this.     
 And all animals still surviving within the zone, whether domesticated or wild, must be presumed contaminated and will have to be destroyed to prevent the spread of radiation and disease.   
 In the immediate area surrounding Chernobyl, uh, every rock, every tree, the very ground itself, has absorbed a dangerous amount of radionuclides, which will be carried by the wind and the rain if left exposed.     
 So we will have to raze entire forests.     
 We will have to rip up the top layer of earth and bury it under itself, approximately,     square kilometers.     
 Um, and finally, we will need to construct a containment structure around the power plant itself, which will, of course, still be extremely...     
 There will be deaths.     
 What amount of time, and how many men do you require?     
 We expect this liquidation effort to take three years and approximately    ,    men, including a number of doctors and structural engineers.     
 How many deaths?     
 Thousands.     
 Perhaps tens of thousands.     
 GORBACHEV: Begin at once.     
 (MEN MURMURING)     
 - LEGASOV: Comrade Charkov. 
- SHCHERBINA: Valery!     
 Yes, Professor?     
 My associate was arrested last night.     
 Oh?     
 I mean no disrespect, but I was wondering if you could tell me why.     
 I assure you, I don't know who you're talking about.     
 She was arrested by the KGB.     
 You are the first deputy chairman of the KGB.     
 I am.     
 That's why I don't have to bother with arresting people anymore.     
 But you are bothering with having us followed.     
 I think the deputy chairman is busy.     
 No, no. It's perfectly understandable.     
 Comrade, I know you've heard the stories about us.     
 When I hear them, even I am shocked.     
 But we are not what people say.     
 Yes, people are following you.     
 People are following those people.     
 You see them?     
 They follow me.     
 The KGB is a circle of accountability.     
 Nothing more.     
 You know the work we're doing here.     
 - You really don't trust us? 
- Of course I do.     
 But you know the old Russian proverb:     
 "Trust but verify."     
 And the Americans think that Ronald Reagan thought that up.     
 Can you imagine?     
 It was very nice speaking with you.     
 I need her.     
 So you will be accountable for her?     
 Then it's done.     
 - Her name is... 
- I know who she is.     
 Good day, Professor.     
 No, that went surprisingly well.     
 You came off like a naive idiot.     
 And naive idiots are not a threat.     
 MAN: I'll come back when the paperwork is complete.     
 - Are you all right? 
- They didn't hurt me.     
 They let a pregnant woman into a room with a...     
 (SIGHS) It doesn't matter.     
 They were stupid. I was stupid.     
 Dyatlov won't talk to me.     
 Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...     
 (SIGHS) Valery,     
 Akimov...     
 his face was gone.     
 You want to stop?     
 Is that a choice I even have?     
 Do you think the fuel will actually melt through the concrete pad?     
 I don't know. A   % chance maybe.     
 I said   . (CHUCKLES)     
 Either way, the numbers mean the same thing:     
 "Maybe."     
 (SIGHING)     
 Maybe the core will melt through to the groundwater.     
 Maybe the miners who I've told to dig under the reactor will save millions of lives.     
 Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.     
 I don't want to do this anymore.     
 I want to stop.     
 But I can't.     
 I don't think you have a choice any more than I do.     
 I think, despite the stupidity, the lies, even this...you are compelled.     
 The problem has been assigned, and you will stop at nothing until you find an answer.     
 Because that is who you are.     
 A lunatic, then.     
 A scientist.     
 (DOOR UNLOCKING)     
 Did you know that they were running a safety test?     
 - Yeah. 
- There's something else.     
 Akimov says they shut the reactor down, and Toptunov confirms it.     
 - They pressed AZ- . 
- Apparently not soon enough.     
 No.     
 They say Akimov pressed AZ- , and then the reactor exploded.     
 If it had been just one of them, I would have put it under faulty memory or delusion even, but they both agreed. They were adamant.     
 Comrade?     
 - Do you think it's possible? 
- I think it makes no sense.     
 I think it's what I would say if I was trying to cover my own mistakes.     
 But?     
 I believed them.     
 Then you should pursue it.     
 We have to pursue every possibility, no matter how unlikely, no matter what or who's to blame.     
 I'll go back to the hospital and reinterview Akimov and Toptunov.     
 If they're still awake.     
 They're not.
