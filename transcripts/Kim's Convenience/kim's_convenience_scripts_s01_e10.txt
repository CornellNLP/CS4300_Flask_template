 Both : One, two, three... 
 Hi. 
 ...four. 
 Hi. 
 Five, six... 
 I can see that you're busy... 
 Both : Seven. 
 ...and I don't want to stop you from... 
 (SIGHS) It's okay. How I can help to you? 
 I've got this petition for the playground in Kitteridge Park. 
 Oh, that's good. Very old. 
 Yeah. Two years ago, some boy is on slide and slash throat. 
 Sorry? 
 Boy is on slide, (WHOOSHES) and slash throat. 
 (MIMICS SLASHING SOUND) Ah! 
 And city say, "Oh, well. What can we do?" 
 Can you believe? 
 Well, I hadn't heard that but yes, we'd like to build a better playground. 
 Give to me. We sign. 
 Great! 
 Is there a problem? 
 No. No problem. 
 One problem. Red pen. 
 In Korea, when you die, they write you name in red. 
 Name in red mean you is dead. 
 I'm so sorry. I had no idea Koreans were so superstitious. 
 Oh, many Korean is superstitious. 
 But we is Christian. 
 Christian is not superstitious. 
 (LAUGHS) I sign. So silly. Stuperstacious. 
 Oh, so sorry. 
 No worries. 
 Use this one. 
 Give to me. Doesn't matter what kind. Pen is pen. 
 You can keep pen. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Okay. See you. 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 Stuperstacious people. (LAUGHS) So stupid. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Oh, Appa, good. 
 I need some money. 
 Mmm. 
 Oh. Actually I need $200. 
 For what? 
 There's this concert... 
 $200 for concert? Too much. 
 Take $20 and buy album. 
 Why do I always have to beg you for money? 
 I've earned it. 
 What? 
 You owe me. 
 What you talking? 
 I've been working here for over 10 years and you've never paid me a dime. 
 I pay you rent and food. That's million dimes. 
 I can't buy concert tickets with rent and food. 
 Not just rent and food. 
 Piano lesson. $20 every lesson once a week, every week. 
 Five year, I pay. 
 Golf lessons, $500... 
 Fine. 
 But... 
 Summer art camp. 
 Church winter camp. 
 So you paid for... 
 Tuition. Camera. 
 Phone. Perm. 
 Haircut to fix perm. 
 Ugh. You've got to be kidding me! 
 Everything I give to you. Everything! 
 What I owe to you? 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (INDISTINCT TALKING) 
 Sorry, what? 
 (PHONE BEEPS) 
 (ON PA)  Looking for a lunch buddy, mister? 
 I have to label those buttons. 
 I was just wondering... 
 I would love a lunch buddy. 
 Great. 
 I hate eating alone. I never know where to look. 
 Wow. That's like an eight course meal. 
 I like a little bit of a lot. 
 And I like lunch that comes with a toy. 
 I always forget to pack a toy. 
 It's yours. Mint condition. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Is this a bad time? 
 No, we're just having lunch. 
 No, no. 
 Pull up a chair. 
 Edamame? 
 Oh, thanks. 
 What's up? 
 Appa. 
 It's always Appa. Specifically? 
 I get it. Dads can be tough. 
 My dad wouldn't let me watch SNL until I was 19. 
 How crazy is that? 
 I'm just tired of working every day, and still having to beg for money. 
 So get a job. 
 Yeah, it's that easy. 
 Actually, we are looking for a part-timer. 
 Here? 
 Heck yeah. Oh. This could be so great. 
 We're already like one big family, and you guys actually are family. 
 We have to do this. 
 Are you serious? 'Cause that would be amazing. 
 That could be good. 
 Is this where the lunch buddies are meeting? 
 I heard the announcement. 
 We should celebrate. 
 Your treat, though, 'cause unlike you, I'm broke. 
 Hey, Umma. 
 What you celebrate? 
 Janet's new job. 
 Things got real awkward real fast. 
 Janet, you get job? 
 At the car rental store. She starts tomorrow. 
 At Handy Car Rental? 
 Yeah. 
 No, Janet. You work here. You tell them it's mistake. 
 Tell her, Appa. 
 You know what's a big mistake? 
 Pork rind. Never sell. Look. 
 What part of pig is "rind"? Nobody know that. 
 I need the job, Umma. 
 How else am I going to earn any actual money? 
 We work something out. Right, Appa? 
 And what's the deal with wine gum? 
 Not wine, not gum. 
 See, Umma? It's pointless. 
 Janet! 
 Congratulation new job. 
 Thank you. I'm looking forward to it. 
 Gerald, I have a very good deal for you. 
 Anything else, miss? 
 Really, Appa? 
 Customer call me "Mr Kim". 
 Fine. 
 Here, Mr Kim. 
 Ten cents short. 
 It's a dollar thirty. 
 That's employee discount. 
 No longer apply to you. 
 We don't have an employee discount. 
 We don't have employees. 
 New policy. 
 Look, Appa, I'm sorry but this isn't personal. 
 It's just business. 
 Morning. 
 Gerald! You early! 
 Early for what? What's he talking about? 
 I need someone to help store. 
 Gerald is new helper. 
 I know why you're doing this. 
 Don't take personal, Janet. It's just business. 
 I'm sorry. But you know how much I could use the cash. 
 Well, good luck with that. 
 He doesn't pay, you know. 
 You're paying him? 
 How much? 
 Confidential company information. 
 How much? 
 Ten bucks an hour. 
 You know that's not even minimum wage. 
 Okay, I pay to Gerald $12 an hour. 
 You see? You only work for me for two minutes, already you get raise. 
 Wow, cool! 
 Yet, so unfair. 
 I can't believe you'd rather pay Gerald than pay me. 
 Gerald is a nice, respectful boy. 
 In fact, you get another raise, $13 an hour! 
 You know what? 
 Pay him whatever you want. 
 It's none of my business. I've got to get to work. 
 Thank you so much for the raise, Mr Kim. 
 No raise. That was joke. 
 Oh. 
 So, it's back to just $12 an hour. 
 Ten. 
 But Janet said that's not even... 
 Ten dollars or five dollars, you choose. 
 Ten. 
 This will be your home away from home. 
 Hey, Kimch, she's all yours. 
 Hey, fresh meat. 
 Welcome to the grinder. 
 What's happening? 
 Make sure she gets a uniform. 
 I thought I was going to be out front. 
 You know, working with customers. 
 That's my area of expertise. 
 Everybody starts back here. 
 And if you play your cards right, you stay back here. 
 Okay. That's cool. 
 You know, I wasn't sure at first, but I think it's going to be fun having you here. 
 Of course it's going to be fun. I'm fun. Super fun. 
 Gotta say, I'm surprised you're here. 
 You had a pretty cushy gig at the store. 
 Yeah, cushy gig that couldn't pay for WayHome tickets. 
 WayHome? Isn't that this weekend? 
 Yeah. 
 You know you work weekends. 
 But probably not this weekend. 
 Part-timers work every weekend. 
 What's this for? 
 The guy ran over something. 
 It's a rabbit or a cat. 
 We'll find out soon enough. 
 I'll hose, you scrape. 
 Can't I hose? 
 You've got to earn the hose. 
 Okay, I am everyday customer. Ready? 
 I guess so. 
 
 
 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Beautiful store you have. You must be very successful. 
 I am a hungry man. Give to me two can pop, one bag chip, and gum. How much? 
 Oh, uh... 
 That would be... 
 (MIMICS BUZZER) Wrong. 
 Three question. 
 You have to know what kind pop, which size chip, which brand gum. 
 All different price, Gerald. 
 Right, I'm sorry, Mr Kim. 
 I didn't get a very good look at your imaginary chip bag. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Could I get a pack of Graydon Extra Milds, please? 
 Stop! You forgot to ask ID. 
 But she's clearly very old... 
 Enough for the product. I think. 
 Hard to tell how old she is. 
 Hey, I'm 40 and proud of it, you know. 
 40? What you talking? I think you is 25. 
 Thank you, Mr Kim. 
 Oh, yeah. I can see now. 
 Lots of little crack. Like broken eggshell. 
 See? 
 We can move this along, you know? 
 Gerald! Why you waiting? Fast! Gerald! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Sorry. 
 Training new employee. Soon to be old employee. 
 What? 
 Okay, see you. 
 Okay, see you. 
 Gerald! What you doing? 
 Appa! 
 Don't be angry. It's his first day. 
 Gerald is not problem. 
 He walk like problem, he talk like problem, he is problem. 
 You is problem. 
 What? 
 You make him nervous. 
 Go, leave Gerald with me. I train. 
 Okay, but if whole store is destroy, I blame you. 
 Go, go. Go! 
 Thanks, Mrs Kim, you really... 
 Okay, store is not mop itself. Get busy. Hmm? 
 Hey. 
 How's it going? 
 Great. 
 Great. 
 Just one little thing. 
 I need a weekend off. This weekend. 
 You need your first weekend off? 
 The reason I needed this job was so I could buy a ticket to WayHome. 
 You know it's going to be a couple of weeks before you get your first paycheque. 
 Oh. 
 I also need an advance. 
 Okay. 
 I can front you the money for the concert, but I can't change your schedule. 
 How's it going to look if the assistant manager is playing favourites? 
 Well, it looks awesome if you're me. 
 I can't do it. 
 You're gonna have to find someone to take your shift. 
 Okay. 
 Jung. 
 I'm already working the counter. 
 Don't ask Shannon. 
 She's too nice, she'll say yes. 
 I'm not going to ask Shannon. 
 A manager does not clean cars. 
 (MOCKING) A manager does not clean cars. 
 What was that? 
 Nothing. 
 Oh, I meant to get salsa, too. 
 Thought you might say that. 
 That'll be $10.25. 
 How you do that? 
 Do what? 
 Fix Gerald! 
 Okay, see you. 
 I just talk to him. He is a smart boy, and fast learner, you just have to be nice. 
 I am nice. 
 Then be more nice. 
 Gerald! 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was an accident, Mr Kim. 
 Appa. 
 I'm not angry. 
 Everybody make mistake. 
 You're mistake is make a big mess, my mistake is hire you. 
 I should go. Call you later. 
 Close the door. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Sit. 
 Okay. "Shannon the Boss" has left the building. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm just trying to switch shifts, and I'm not having much luck. 
 Is that all? 
 You came to the right person. 
 No, it's this weekend and everyone has plans. 
 Well, is it important? 
 It's the WayHome Festival. 
 All of my friends are going, and I've never been... 
 Stop. 
 In 2005, I had a chance to see Destiny's Child and I passed it up because of "school." 
 I don't know why I air quoted school, I actually had a test. 
 I thought I could catch them on the next tour, but I think you know what happened. 
 You can still see Beyonce. 
 All I would see are the two that aren't there. 
 Consider it done. 
 (OVER PA)  Terence, can you come in here, please? 
 Really? That's great! 
 Jung was right about you. 
 Sorry? 
 What did Jung... Right how? 
 He just said you're really nice. 
 Interesting. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yes. I was wondering if you could work this weekend. 
 Oh. Sure. 
 I could do that. 
 I mean, I could probably rearrange my plans. 
 Then it's handled. Thanks, Terence. 
 Janet : Okay. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah! 
 Thank you so much! 
 And thank you. That's amazing. 
 Not a problem. Now what were we talking about? 
 I don't remember. 
 It was Jung. 
 What's this? 
 It's for the milk and cereal I just used. 
 Looks like lots of milk. 
 That should cover it. 
 As a matter of fact. 
 That was a good cup of tea. 
 (COINS JINGLING) 
 Including tip. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Appa : So stubborn. 
 I wonder where she get that? 
 Don't blame yourself. 
 If you waiting for her to make first move, you waiting long time. 
 I can outwait her. 
 She can outlive you. 
 While you outwaiting her, go downstairs, get more milk. 
 Just talked to Terence. 
 You know he had plans for Saturday. 
 What? He told Shannon it was fine. 
 Because Shannon's the boss. 
 Of course he's not going to say no. 
 You're acting like it's my fault. 
 It is. You went over my head and got Shannon to do your dirty work for you. 
 She offered. 
 Because that's who she is. 
 She's like the nicest, sweetest person I know. 
 What? 
 You like her. 
 Like, like her. 
 What? No. Okay. I'm not even gonna... Not. 
 (BELL CHIMES) 
 Gerald. Five minute early. Good. 
 We need to talk. 
 Sure. 
 Gerald, you good boy. Hard worker. 
 It's not your fault you are terrible at this job. 
 To be fair, I'm only terrible when you're around. 
 To be fair, it's my store. I'm around. 
 Okay, that is fair. 
 Wait. Are you firing me? 
 I give to you one week pay. But yeah. 
 What's that? 
 It's my letter of resignation. I was about to quit. 
 Oh, okay, you quit. No severance. 
 But you fired me first. 
 When you write letter? 
 See, that's kind of why I didn't want to work here any more. 
 Okay, okay. 
 This is nice. 
 See? I can be nice. 
 Yeah, I'm just gonna go. 
 Can I talk to you for a sec? 
 Sure, what's up, Jan? 
 Hey, Jan and Shan, just a couple of work buds. 
 What's up? 
 Actually. 
 I'm going to work Saturday. 
 Terence had plans. He was just being nice. 
 He should have just said something. 
 He wasn't going to say it to you. 
 And I'm sorry for getting you involved. 
 No harm, no foul. 
 Well, just wanted to clear that up. 
 Sometimes it feels good to say what you think. 
 'Cause maybe you're nervous and you don't want to say it. 
 Janet, I would love to be friends. 
 Oh... Okay. 
 Me too. 
 But just think about what I said and apply it to all aspects of your life. 
 Okay. 
 That's very general advice, but that can be good too. 
 Janet. 
 Hey, Appa. 
 Okay. Ten. 
 Huh? 
 That's what I pay Gerald. 
 That's less than minimum wage. 
 But free snack. 
 I don't know, Appa. I've already got a pretty good job. 
 I need a better reason than free snacks. 
 Okay. What you want? 
 You're asking me what I want? 
 Seriously? 
 Serious face. 
 Well, as long as you're asking, I want coffee breaks. I like coffee breaks now. 
 We have a coffee maker. 
 I'm talking about where I get a coffee, I enjoy the coffee, then I come back to work. 
 Okay, one break. 
 Two. 
 One break, two coffees. 
 Appa... 
 I want to feel appreciated. 
 Okay. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. Do you have any 1%? 
 Yeah, just have delivery. It's in the back. 
 Janet, go get. 
 I'd love to, but I'm on my first coffee break. 
 Really? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay, see you. 
 You want a job? 
 Hey, Shannon. 
 Sorry about my sister. 
 I mean, I thought she'd at least make it through the month. 
 Yeah, it's a shame. 
 I'm just going to throw something out there. 
 Lunch buddies should order in today. 
 Yeah, sure. That sounds great. 
 What do you think about Thai? 
 I love Thai. 
 Did you want to say something else? 
 Uh, I don't think so. 
 Unless there was something else you wanted me to say? 
 No, no. 
 Great, I'll Thai it up.
