 Mouse come in to steal bait and bzzzt! 
 Get electrifried. 
 This kill mouse bzzzt, like that? 
 Bzzzt, like that. 
 Most not cruel mouse-killer of all Internet, eh? (CHUCKLES) 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 You planning to kill one of God creation? 
 (LAUGHS) Just joking. 
 Ahn young ha sae yo. 
 Pastor Choi. 
 Moksanim, what can we do for you today? 
 Oh, I just coming by to remind myself what you husband look like. 
 Appa : Business very good, Pastor Choi. 
 Somebody has to mind the store. 
 Somebody has to mind soul. 
 Moksanim, he was just say he is coming to church this Sunday. 
 "A good woman is hard to find, and worth far more than diamonds." 
 Proverb, chapter 31. 
 I'll see you both Sunday. 
 Bye,  Moksanim. 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 "Thou shall no steal." Bible, chapter something-something. 
 One gum. 
 It's  subeesu. 
 You give  subeesu  to so many you friend. 
 Subeesu is special gift for special friend. 
 Moksanim is special friend. 
 Friend not take advantage. Friend not take all you gum. 
 (BUZZING) 
 (MOUSE SQUEAKS) 
 See? "Thou shall no steal." 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Pastor Choi : ...to welcome his son home. 
 But by lifting up his clothes... 
 (EXHALES) 
 ...father is shame himself. You understand? 
 (CROWD MURMURING) 
 Now, some people think this is just a parable. 
 Some people think this is just boring. 
 Shh. 
 But no, because this is exactly what God doing in order to protect us and welcome us home. 
 No father would do like this. Punish not welcome. 
 I punish you, you don't be quiet. 
 Amen. 
 All : Amen. 
 Now, speaking of welcome, as you know, we have been looking to find another pastor. 
 Please join me in welcoming our new associate pastor, Pastor Nina Gomez. 
 Thank you, everyone. Hello, and  ahn young ha sae yo. 
 Did I say that right? 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Well, maybe some of you out there can help me with my pronunciation. 
 I help. 
 Hey, can I get your notes from Tuesday? 
 Don't you record every class? 
 Yeah. 
 Did they get erased? 
 No, but I may have hit pause. 
 With your face when you fell asleep on your phone? 
 So can I borrow the notes or not? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (BELL CHIMES) 
 (JANET SQUEALS) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Semira, this is Alex. The cop. 
 The police officer I told you about. 
 Alex, Semira, Semira, Alex. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Uh, so, how you doing? 
 Good. Really good. Better now. 
 Why's that? 
 Yeah, why is that? 
 Um, it's been a good day. 
 Semira and I were just talking about notes. 
 Notes? 
 Oh, sometimes I feel like all I ever do is take notes and look at notes. I got this old notepad here. 
 See, I got these notes and more notes. 
 This is just from today. 
 Actually, a lot of this is confidential. 
 Evidence. Shouldn't have shown you. 
 Are you going to have to arrest me now? 
 I'll let you off with a warning this time. 
 A warning for her not to look at the things you show her? 
 Right. (CHUCKLES) 
 Well, I'm still on the clock, so I gotta get back. 
 I just wanted to say hey. 
 Hey. 
 You let me know next time you're being robbed, okay? 
 I've got your number. 
 You do? 
 911. 
 Oh, right. 
 (WHISPERS) Coffee. 
 Coffee! 
 Pardon me? 
 You want to get coffee sometime? 
 Yeah, I'd love that. 
 There's a cute cafe down the street. 
 Yeah, Cuppa Cuppa. 
 Oh, you mean right now? 
 Sure. 
 I mean, I'm obviously working, so... 
 But you're done at 5:00, so... 
 Actually I work until 5:30. 
 Then maybe 6:00? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Great. 
 Looking forward to it. 
 I don't usually say it like that. 
 It's fine. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Okay. I'll see you then. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, hi, Pastor Nina. 
 I'm Mr Kim, and this is my... 
 Wife, Mrs Kim. 
 Hello. 
 Pastor Choi told me you were in this neighbourhood. 
 I'm just a block east of here. 
 Oh, that's good. We is neighbour. 
 Exactly. 
 Listen, I wanted to thank you for the very warm welcome this morning. 
 I was genuinely touched. 
 Church is very important for us. 
 We is very involve. 
 Well, Mrs Kim, Pastor Choi told me that you in particular would be a very important person to get to know. 
 We is very important to know. 
 Anything you need, don't even ask, we is here. 
 Thank you. 
 No problem. 
 You want something? 
 Chip? Pops? Cough drop? Lollipop? Ah, peanuts? 
 Uh, maybe just some mints for now. 
 Ah, you money is no good here. 
 Oh, no, no, I insist. 
 It is  subeesu. Special friend do not pay. 
 That doesn't feel right, Mr Kim. 
 If you want to pay, that's okay, too. 
 No, not okay. Pastor Choi never pay. 
 Never even think of pay. It's like the Jesus. 
 Just accept. 
 Well, since you put it that way, thank you. 
 I'll see you around? 
 Okay, see you. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 What you doing? 
 If it's good enough for Pastor Choi, it's good enough for Pastor Nina. 
 "One mint." 
 (SCOFFS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 I thought it was white men who couldn't jump. 
 How many Koreans in the NBA again? 
 Jeremy Lin. 
 No, he's Chinese. 
 Half-Korean. 
 Really? 
 Nope. 
 (GROANS) 
 Game. Beers on you. 
 You still black, but you got slow. 
 I just wanted you to look good in front of your little fan club over here. 
 Oh, I didn't even see them there. 
 Shameless, man. You have not changed a bit. 
 I'm just trying to give the people what they want. 
 Hey, Jung, you lose another shirt? 
 Yeah, apparently the people demanded it. 
 How you doing? 
 I told you about this, right? 
 No. 
 Oh. 
 It's kind of a funny story. We went for coffee, then we went to a movie. And that's it. 
 Wait, we also had drinks with a couple of my buddies from work. 
 And you came to my school thing. 
 Right. 
 Yeah. 
 So, you guys have been busy. 
 I wanted to call you, but then I thought I should tell you in person. 
 We both did. 
 So here we are. Telling you... 
 Both : In person. 
 Anyway, we're going to go grab some drinks. 
 Semira and Gerald are coming. Do you want to come join us? 
 Oh, yeah, I do. But I can't. Because, uh... 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Just go. Enjoy going out together. 
 All right. Have fun with your fan club. 
 Just got a few things here. 
 Uh-uh.  Subeesu. 
 Oh, no, no, I couldn't. This is too much. 
 Sometime too much, sometime too little. 
 It all even out. 
 (RUSTLING) 
 Oh, sorry! 
 Okay, okay. Stop! Stop! 
 (SIGHS) I have to go help Three Stooges. 
 Appa : (EXCLAIMING) Okay, okay, okay. 
 Man : Sorry. I got it, I got it. 
 I hope this won't offend you, but I am uncomfortable with this whole  subeesu  thing. 
 (SIGHS) He is stubborn. 
 Sometime more pride than sense. 
 I want to pay for this. 
 I want you to pay for this. 
 But I don't want to offend your culture. 
 Ah, culture is okay. Husband is other story. 
 Sorry. I'll buy this... 
 Okay, you pretend to accept subeesu from him, but I keep track. Then you pay me later. 
 What you think? 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 He come for one can soup, now have to buy five bag of cookie crumb. (CHUCKLES) 
 Okay, what we having? 
 Mrs Kim was just putting my things in a bag. 
 Oh! One more. Very special treat. 
 So beautiful. 
 So beautiful. 
 $60? 
 Subeesu. 
 So beautiful. 
 
 
 
 Janet : He's nice, right? 
 He's clearly crazy about you. 
 You think so? 
 Yes. 
 But? 
 Okay, it's just, I was watching you two last night and he was kissing you and rubbing your back... 
 Yeah? 
 And it seemed kind of one-way. 
 I was affectionate. I tickled his nose. 
 Yeah, Gerald and I couldn't figure out what you were going for. 
 (CHUCKLES) What? It was just a nose tickle. 
 You keep saying that like it's a thing. 
 What are you doing? 
 See, that's a normal response. 
 Alex didn't complain. 
 'Cause he likes you. 
 He's a seven on the touchy-feely scale. 
 You've got to at least hit a five. 
 What number am I now? 
 Three. Yeah. 
 When you've had some more drinks in you, you're, like, a four. 
 Unless you had tequila. Then you drop down to one. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 I don't want to be all over him. 
 I don't think there's a risk of that. 
 (GRUNTING) Thank you. 
 Anything else? 
 No, thank you. 
 Mr Kim? 
 Yeah. 
 It's too much. 
 It's a lot, yes. But  subeesu  is  subeesu. 
 Look. I know I've got a lot of stuff here, but don't worry, it's taken care of. 
 Jesus pay? 
 No, I pay. Later. 
 I've been paying your wife. 
 I just wasn't comfortable with  subeesu,  so we made an arrangement. 
 Mrs Kim sneak attack. 
 Uh, no, not sneak attack. Just... I wasn't comfortable. 
 Mrs Kim sneak attack. 
 It was my idea. 
 That what she make you think. 
 Mrs Kim is very smart sneak attack. Almost best. 
 Almost. 
 Look, I know I should have said something earlier. 
 I just... 
 I don't want to cause any friction between you and your wife. 
 No, no. I not angry at you or Mrs Kim. 
 And I agree with you both. 
 People should pay for what they take. 
 Everybody should pay. Everybody. 
 What? 
 What "what"? You look like you doing something. I know about you arrangement with Pastor Nina. She want to pay. I know. (COINS CLINKING) It's good idea. I want her to pay. I want everybody to pay. That's why I give Pastor Choi invoice for 72 Dentyne gum, 44 Mars bar, and two box Ritz cookie. When you do this? Just now. In that envelope. Excuse, excuse, excuse, excuse... Excuse, excuse, excuse... Excuse, excuse, excuse... Excuse, excuse, excuse... What you think of my arrangement? Don't overreact. Okay, okay.  Aeeshcham. Both : Excuse, excuse, excuse, excuse... Shannon : Mind if I join you? Don't you love the Sunday shift? It's so quiet. Yeah, makes you wonder why we even open. So, what are we talking about? I just found out that my sister's dating a friend of mine. Which is just wrong. Tell him, Shannon. Is your friend a good guy? Yeah. He's a great guy. Okay. When I was in high school, there was this guy that was dating a friend of mine's sister. But the guy's brother really didn't like my friend's sister and eventually, he made them break up. And the reason I'm telling you this is, that guy is me. Are you telling us you used to be a guy? No, at first I thought it was too personal, so I tried to pretend it was about somebody else. I don't know why I made me a guy. Anyway, halfway through, I thought, "Jung and Kimchee are friends. I can tell them this is about me." And I thought, "Finish first, tell them after," which brings us to now. My point is, you have to follow your heart, and if your sister's happy, you should be happy. I am. It's just... It's just a little weird. But I don't want it to be. Which is why I invited them over to the basketball tonight. What? Tonight is Nacho Sunday. Theme nights are so fun. At my old branch, we used to have Fondue Fridays. It wasn't very good during flu season. Nacho Sunday is sacred Jungchee time. "Jungchee?" Point is, it's our thing. We've done it, like, twice. You should have asked me first. He's probably right. Fine, is it all right if Janet and Alex join us for Nacho Sunday? Thank you for asking. No. Well, I already asked them and they're coming, so... I already told you, you should have asked me first, so... Too late, they're coming, so... Stop! Stop! Stop! Mr Kim, no one is allowed to come in here. I make a mistake. I put library card in envelope. By accident. (LAUGHS) Oh, I do that all the time. You can't be in here, Mr Kim. When you bus break down, who drive all the way up to Casino Rama and pick you up? You also picked up your wife. Also you. It's church policy that no one is supposed to be here but the counters. We is no one. Eun-Ji : Mr Kim, please. Pastor Choi : Ah. Mrs Kim. Mr Kim. Moksanim, Mr Kim put driver licence in envelope by mistake. You said it was a library card. Well, they both is very important. Many hands make light work. Let's find the card, hmm? Is this it? Yes, thank you. Oh! Like parable of woman finding lost coin. Now we must celebrate. Who wants gum? Commentator : In position, he's set for two, and he shoots it! Yes! Yes! (CROWD CHEERING) What happened? What did I miss? Your boy choked is what happened. Oh, yeah, he did. Okay? Yeah. All right. Are you seeing this? It's hard to miss. (SIGHS) Even if you were cool with them dating, there's still a way civilised people behave. And that ain't it. Totally. This isn't about dating, this is about boundaries. Exactly. They don't respect our boundaries, we don't respect theirs. This is nice. Yeah. It is. Really nice. Oh, man! It is hot in that kitchen. Yeah, you guys really need to spring for some AC. All right, time to drain the dragon. These nachos are so good. Mmm. Even better when they're hand-delivered. (URINATING) Hey, you ever heard from Carly lately? What the hell happened to your shirt? I think Carly's in Edmonton. (URINATING) Kimchee : Whoo! Can you please close the door? Yup! It's like Niagara Falls in there. (FLUSHING) Did you wash your hands? What the hell happened to your shirt? Ah! Just watching the game. Janet : You're being weird. Jung : Are we? A little. What? Oh. I'm sorry. I couldn't quite hear you with my sister in your lap. Is that why you guys took your shirts off? This is about boundaries. So you're not comfortable with Alex and me. Are you comfortable using your boyfriend as a chair? He's not my boyfriend. I'm not her boyfriend. Why'd you say it like that? You said it, too. I didn't say it like that. (CHUCKLES) Okay, maybe I'm a bit uncomfortable. With me? Not with you. On you. You said you thought it was nice. 'Cause it was nice. It just isn't me. I never asked you to be anything but yourself. Right. I know. Look, maybe everyone should just stick to what they're comfortable doing. Cool. Can I put my shirt on? Both : Please. I'm just comfortable like this. When the hell did your team go up by 12? When I took my shirt off. It's true. Less he wears, the better they play. Pants off! Please don't take your pants off. (DOOR OPENS) Pastor Nina : Hi. Ah! Pastor Nina. I just wanted to stop by and make sure everything's okay. Yes. Thank you so much for not say anything to Pastor Choi. It's okay. I get it. Sort of. Sometime I don't think before act. Sometime that's good. Sometime that's not good. Well, I'm just glad it worked out. But no more  subeesu,  okay? Subeesu is finish. For everybody. For everybody. I will see you next week? You preaching? Yes. We'll be there. Unless you working. God say rest on Sunday. Bible, chapter something-something. Okay, see you. I am glad you like Pastor Nina. I'm sure she needed to hear that. Oh, Appa tell her many time. Too many time, maybe. You too many time. See you soon. Moksanim, uh... We don't think we can... Business is not too good. So we stop doing subeesu any more. Sorry,  Moksanim. Oh. No, no, no, no. That's nothing to be sorry. (COINS JINGLING) Thank you. See you Sunday. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) It's been long time since he pay for gum, I think. Yeah. Since about 1982.
