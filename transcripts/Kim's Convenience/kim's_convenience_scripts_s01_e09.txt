 And after he invent the turtle ship then Korea win battle. 
 Sounds kind of like Korea's Louis Riel. 
 No, Admiral Yi was a great hero. 
 Customer : So was Louis Riel for a lot of people. 
 But nobody hang Admiral Yi. 
 Just because he was hanged... 
 Help! 
 Do you need to... 
 Nope. 
 Okay, see you. 
 Catch ya later, Mr. Kim. 
 (SLURPING) 
 So I just stand here for the rest of my life? 
 Please... 
 (SIGHS) 
 So... 
 I'm just trying to take one can. 
 But I think if I... 
 No, you don't think. 
 That's your problem. Hmm? 
 Even baby look and say, "Take can from top." 
 Are you saying I'm like a baby? 
 I not even talking genius baby, like one who play flute. 
 I'm talking regular baby, even they know don't take a can from middle. 
 But most of these cans have a dent. 
 Except this one. 
 Dent ravioli taste exactly same as smooth ravioli. 
 It's inside that count. 
 Please... 
 (SIGHS) 
 Okay, it's like  Jenga. 
 Have to finish move. Hmm? 
 Not easy. Is tight. 
 Okay, together. 
 One... 
 Two... 
 Here. 
 Can is safe and sound. 
 Oh. 
 Next time, take a can from top like a normal baby. 
 Oh, this one is meat. 
 Do you have cheese ravioli? 
 It's okay, I'll eat around the meat. (CHUCKLES) 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Mrs. Park. 
 Mrs. Kim. 
 How are you? 
 Very good, looking forward to bazaar. 
 How are you, Jeanie? 
 Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. 
 She have a hearing problem? 
 Ah, she's just texting. 
 Yeah, same thing. 
 Will we be seeing any of your family today? 
 Of course, me. Have to helping out. 
 "Have to helping out." (LAUGHS) Wonderful. 
 Jeanie would love to see Janet again. 
 Isn't that right, Jeanie? 
 Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. 
 Will Janet be here? 
 Oh, Janet has so much school work and uh... 
 (LAUGHING) 
 What about your son? 
 Oh, well he is... 
 Does Jung need permission from his parole officer? 
 Jung has never been in jail. 
 Really? I could have sworn... 
 Only youth detention centre, and now he is... 
 I understand. 
 Uh, if my son were a criminal, I'd be embarrassed too. 
 I didn't say I was embarrassed. 
 Jung is good boy now. Very different. 
 So invite him to the bazaar. 
 He's so busy with work. 
 Of course. 
 Well, so much work to do. 
 Mmm. 
 Come on, Jeanie. 
 Jeanie. Jeanie! 
 Jeanie? 
 Yes,  Ajumma? 
 You mommy wants you. 
 Oh, okay, thanks. 
 You see, Irishman don't realize, if he get it fixed, his head... 
 I get! I get! 
 Oh, hi, Janet. 
 Oh, hi, Mr. Chin. 
 Appa, I've got to leave in an hour. 
 Semira and I have a lab assignment. 
 Okay. No problem. 
 (LAUGHING) Look, we just sell out. 
 Why don't you just say, "One Can, One Dollar?" 
 Because I am a smart business man, huh? 
 People get excite about two. 
 It's like two for one but two for two. 
 Look at proof. We sell five whole case ravioli. 
 Yeah. We didn't sell out. I took them down. 
 What you talking? 
 They're expired. 
 I know. Why you think I get good deal? 
 Appa, you can't sell expired food. 
 Ah, you right, let's just give away for free, huh? 
 That a good business idea. 
 Don't you know... 
 Please, don't say it... 
 Expiration date is a marketing conspiracy! 
 Look. 
 It say "best before this date." 
 After this date, not best, but still pretty good. 
 It's meat, Appa. Meat goes bad. 
 You go bad. 
 If someone buys your ravioli and gets sick, you could get sued. 
 That would be bad. 
 Ah, you don't know what you talking. 
 Mr. Chin : Be careful, Mr. Kim. 
 In restaurant business, you serve one bad dumpling, you get lawsuit up the wazoo. 
 Hmm. You probably right. 
 Really? 'Cause I literally just said the same thing. 
 Janet, God give to you two ear, and one mouth, listen two more times than you talking. 
 But I'm the one who said... 
 Stop. 
 Listen. 
 Listen. 
 Can't you just admit that... 
 Shh, listen. 
 So you agree with me that the ravioli is bad. 
 No. I agree with Mr. Chin, that I can't sell. 
 But I can eat. See? 
 Fork! 
 Mmm. 
 Tastes good cold? 
 Shh. 
 Listen. 
 (SLURPING) 
 Mrs. Kim, I thought your family couldn't make it today. 
 Yeah, Janet is study and I talk to Jung, he wants to come and help, but he is manager now, so he is too busy. 
 He doesn't look too busy to me. 
 Jung. 
 Hi, Umma. 
 Pastor Nina. 
 Oh. Hi, Mrs. Kim. 
 You meet my son? 
 Yes, he's been very helpful. 
 Where have you been keeping him? 
 Oh, you didn't know? 
 Jung's been... 
 Jung has never been in jail! 
 I was going to say, managing a car rental agency. 
 Actually, I'm just an assistant manager. 
 Sounds impressive. 
 Is very impressive. 
 Especially since it wasn't that long ago that Jung was in a juvenile detention centre. 
 Oh, so you're a trouble maker, huh? 
 Not any more. I'm on the straight and narrow, Nina. 
 Pastor Nina. 
 Well, the Bible is full of trouble makers. 
 Yeah, even Jesus was trouble make. 
 I'm aiming for something between Jesus and juvie. 
 I think I just found the title of my next sermon. 
 It's good to meet you, Jung. 
 Likewise. 
 Excuse. 
 Why you don't tell to me you is coming? 
 I didn't even know I was coming. 
 Kimchee's Umma asked him to help. 
 He couldn't, so I came. 
 Okay. You come, you help, that's very good. 
 Thank you. Say hi to Kimchee. 
 What's the hurry? 
 It's kind of nice being back. 
 And besides, the food smells amazing. 
 Jung? 
 Jeanie? 
 Hi. 
 Nice bling. 
 Oh, I just got them. 
 They're pink. 
 When did braces get so cool? 
 Or maybe you're just way cooler than Janet was. 
 (LAUGHS) You're funny. 
 Hey, you want to come help us set up. 
 Sure. 
 Great. Come on. 
 Okay. 
 (SPEAKING IN KOREAN) 
 (SPEAKING IN KOREAN) 
 Yeah, I'm running a little late. Heading out now. 
 Appa! 
 Your dad said he'd be right back, but that was a while ago. 
 Oh, sorry. I can help you. 
 (EXHALES) 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Just a bathroom break. 
 You never take a bathroom break. 
 Sorry I have to pee one time, Mrs. Secretary General North-Korean dictator. 
 I gotta go. 
 (GROANS) 
 I told you not to eat the ravioli. 
 Ravioli is fine. Expiration date is, uh... 
 Conspiracy. 
 Great. Now you're sick. 
 (STRAINING) No. I'm fine. 
 Oh, hey, Semira. You think we can get a later lab time? 
 I know, I know. My dad's sick. 
 No, just try and push it. 
 Call me back, okay? 
 (EXCLAIMS) 
 Just back need stretching. 
 You don't look so good, Mr. Kim. 
 Maybe you need to take a break. 
 Oh, no, he can't do that, because then he'd have to admit the ravioli was bad. 
 The ravioli is bad? 
 Not that ravioli. 
 Other ravioli. 
 So you admit it was bad. 
 Not bad. Just not best. (CHUCKLES) 
 You want bag... 
 Would it kill you to admit that you made a mistake? 
 Maybe you right, Janet. 
 What? He doesn't usually say stuff like that. 
 Must go. Sorry. 
 Have a good day. 
 Hey, how are you? How's Tyler? 
 Good. He just won his baseball championship. 
 Sorry. 
 Can you hold on a second? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Mrs. Kim, I have to tell you, people have been talking... 
 He's just young man, 90% hormone. 
 And what about you? 
 Don't you know shoulder is gateway to rest of body? 
 I don't think we're talking about the same thing. 
 I hear you make a wonderful galbijjim. 
 Did I say that right? 
 Galbijjim. 
 Galbijjim. 
 Galbijjim. 
 Galbijjim. 
 Both : Galbijjim. 
 Well, everyone is raving about it. 
 Yes, thank you. 
 It's a very special recipe. 
 Take long time to make, but worth every minute. 
 Mrs. Kim, have you seen Jung? 
 Why, what happen? 
 He said he was going to get some more chairs and... 
 I can help. Excuse us, Pastor Nina. 
 Of course. 
 Galbijjim. 
 Galbijjim. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (GASPS) Jung. 
 Jeanie. 
 Get out of there right now. 
 Now! 
 (MRS. PARK MUTTERING IN KOREAN) 
 Okay. So, hear me out... 
 (GROANS) 
 Umma. 
 Umma! 
 
 
 
 (BANGING ON DOOR) 
 It's not what it looks like. 
 "Looked" like. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Mrs. Kim. 
 Excuse me. 
 (SPEAKING IN KOREAN) 
 Mrs. Kim, I wanted to talk to you about Jung, if that's okay. 
 Don't worry, I take care of everything. 
 I haven't asked you anything yet. 
 Don't have to, I was there. I see everything. 
 What did you see? 
 What you think I see? 
 I didn't know you saw anything. 
 Then why you ask what I see? 
 Because you said you saw something. 
 No, I think you say that to me. 
 I was just wanted to ask you if you think Jung would be interested in mentoring some of the youth group. 
 The kids seem to really like him. 
 Oh. 
 So, what do you think? 
 Jung is a good boy, but I don't think youth should look up to him. 
 Not look down at him, but maybe just look straight at him. 
 You understand? 
 Not really, but if you could ask him, that would be great. 
 Yeah, but answer is probably no. 
 Okay. Well, I'm... 
 I'm gonna... Uh, I'm gonna... 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SCOFFING) Trouble-make. 
 Sorry. 
 That's it. 
 Okay. 
 And I'll get a pack of spearmint gum. 
 Or maybe peppermint would be better? 
 Sure. Whatever. 
 Ooh! What's wintermint like? 
 It's gum. Take a chance. 
 You're... You're right. 
 Thank you. 
 Much better. I think I flush evil away now. 
 That's great. 
 (EXHALES) 
 Uh, Janet. 
 Maybe I don't always say, but you is right. 
 No, this is not necessary... 
 Ravioli was bad. 
 I should not have eat. 
 Thank you, Appa. That's really good of you to say. 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Yeah, hi. Oh, no. Sorry. 
 It's my dad. He's still really sick. 
 No, no. I'm 80 to 85% full-strength. 
 It's okay, Janet. Go. 
 And leave you here, by yourself? I couldn't do that. 
 Why don't you start and I'll try to get there as soon as I can. 
 Oh no, you don't need to swing by, that's okay... 
 Okay, whatever. 
 I'm gonna go make a call. 
 Another call. Bye. 
 Jung : Umma. 
 What were you thinking? 
 You're the one who locked me in that room. 
 I only got out because of Eddie Chan. 
 Oh, great. Now Eddie Chan know everything. 
 No, he doesn't. 
 And it's not that big of a deal. 
 To you, nothing is a big deal. 
 But is very big deal. Is most big deal ever in history of big deal. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 It's never your fault. 
 I tell Mrs. Park every time, "He's a good boy now, so different." 
 Maybe she is right. 
 Maybe you never change. 
 Umma, listen. 
 I went in there to get chairs, Jeanie was already in there, drinking. 
 I was there maybe five seconds before we heard you coming. 
 She practically threw the flask at me. 
 That's what you saw, that's what happened. 
 Why you don't tell to me? 
 Because you walked away and locked me in the chair room. 
 Mrs. Park would never believe. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Mrs. Park has been waiting for me to make a mistake ever since I was in the 7th grade. 
 Maybe she's not the only one. 
 Sorry, Jung. 
 Umma, I don't care what church people think. 
 They're gonna think what they're gonna think. 
 But I do care what you think. 
 I think you is a good boy. 
 But you should care little bit about what church people think. 
 And you shouldn't care so much about what church people think. 
 I don't care so much. 
 No, I don't! 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Okay, maybe little bit, I do. 
 Oh, Jung. 
 It's okay. 
 You smell like rum. 
 I was locked in there a long time. 
 You want some? 
 Ugh, no! 
 Come on! 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (GASPS) 
 That's Mrs. Park kimbap. 
 Yeah, she's not gonna like that. 
 Hey, I got us the final lab spot of the day, but I had to make some promises to Nick and Tamara that I definitely will not keep. 
 That's great. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, pretty good. A little dizzy maybe. 
 Appa : Ah. 
 What's wrong, Janet? 
 Nothing. 
 I was more worried about you. 
 Ah, I'm fine. Never better. 
 Okay, so who's sick? 
 I'm not sick. Who say sick? 
 Not me, I feel fine. 
 Good. 
 Then you can help me with this. 
 Because you both look kind of bad. 
 Huh. Put back on shelf. 
 Sure. No problem. 
 Bottom shelf. 
 All the way down. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 I'll get it. 
 Stop! 
 Janet get. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (GROANS) Okay. 
 I don't know what it is, but I don't feel very good. 
 A-ha! I told you! I right, you wrong. 
 Expiration date... 
 Oh, my God, Appa! 
 Just because you're right this one time, doesn't mean you're always right. 
 You still need to listen to me! 
 (SHOUTING) 
 (GASPS) 
 Oh, no. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 She is very stubborn and... (GRUNTS) 
 (SPEAKING IN KOREAN) 
 Customer : Can I get some help over here? 
 Sure. 
 Uh... 
 (BEEPING) 
 Is it supposed to make that sound? 
 Yep. 
 (BEEPING) 
 Is that my platter? 
 We're sorry. It was an accident. We'll replace it. 
 My mother-in-law gave me that. 
 It's not Jung's fault. I did. 
 Of course. Let him off the hook, like you always do. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Hey! 
 I understand that you're upset, and we'll do whatever it takes to make it right. 
 And I'm just supposed to accept the words of a convicted liar? 
 Yeah, that's not really a thing. 
 And what were you thinking giving my daughter alcohol? 
 My son doesn't have to explain anything to you. 
 He's been back in church less than an hour and look what he's done. 
 The flask was mine. 
 What? 
 When I heard you coming, I panicked, and I gave the flask to Jung. 
 Sorry, Jung. 
 Don't cover for him. 
 It's Dad's fishing flask! 
 It's okay. Everybody make mistake sometime. 
 What's going on? 
 I can explain. 
 Oh, if you don't mind, I'd prefer it if someone... 
 Anybody else walked me through this. 
 (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) 
 (EXHALES) 
 I don't think I can ever sit again. 
 What did we eat? And why does it hate us so much? 
 I just eat tea, ravioli, coffee, and some of Umma's galbijjim. 
 I had galbijjim too. 
 Appa, Umma took it to church. 
 Oh. 
 You want some galbijjim, too? 
 Uh, sure. What is it? 
 Korean beef stew. Sweet and savoury. 
 My mom made it. Best in the country. 
 Not best in country. 
 Maybe just best in city. 
 Sure, okay. 
 Thank you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I think it's a long time before Mrs. Park forgive me. 
 Yeah, but it'll be even longer before she talks smack about the Kims again. 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Hello? Hi, Janet. 
 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
 Okay, thank you, bye-bye. 
 Umma? 
 What are you doing? 
 Janet and Appa is sick. Galbijjim is bad. 
 We have to tell everyone. 
 Okay. Okay, we will. 
 In just one second. 
 Now we can tell them. 
 I should feel guilty, but I don't. 
 (MAN CHANTS IN KOREAN) 
 See? It's good to exercise Korean style. With confidence. 
 I guess. 
 When I was you age, Janet, I do this every day. 
 Oh, okay, maybe I'm not 100% yet. 
 Appa : Confidence build strength. 
 Strength build confidence. Have to keep going. 
 No, I think I'm gonna err on the side of caution. 
 Big baby. (LAUGHS) 
 (BOTH EXHALING) 
 (FARTS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 I go open window. 
 I go change panty.
