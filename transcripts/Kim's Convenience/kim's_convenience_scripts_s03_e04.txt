 - Just the gum. 
 - Are you sure? 
 We have a big special on scissor. 
 - I got scissors. 
 - Mmm. 
 Can you scissor do this? 
 Yeah, they're scissors. 
 How about, uh, this? 
 Not really a banana guy. 
 But, uh... 
 that's not all. 
 Say you is hungry for candy bar,  but not whole candy bar. 
 Been there. 
 Hmm? 
 And what goes good with a candy bar? 
 Can of pop. 
 But you ruined your scissors. 
 Remember banana from before? 
 Kind of. 
 - Still sharp. 
 - Mmm. 
 - I'll take 'em. 
 - Okay. 
 - What you doing? 
 - Selling scissor. 
 That's, uh, six pair today. 
 Why so many half banana, candy bar and the pop can? 
 This is a $20 extension cord. 
 What? 
 Have to spend money to make money. 
 Okay, guys. 
 I think we hit the wall. 
 Let's call it. 
 Good. 
 I had to pee an hour ago. 
 Why didn't you just go? 
 Good one, Jung. 
 Why don't I just hand you my job? 
 - Who wants to grab a drink? 
 - I'm down. 
 Let's do it. 
 That's a great idea. 
 See you guys tomorrow. 
 And I just ordered pizza. 
 If I'm not home, you know weird Jerry  from down the hall is gonna swipe it. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Peace! 
 Well, guess, I should head out, too. 
 Yeah. 
 - Unless... 
 - What? 
 There's no reason we can't go out for drinks as... 
 buds. 
 Co-workers grabbing a drink, right? 
 Yeah. 
 That's a thing people do. 
 - Tap Room? 
 - Sure. 
 It screams after-work drinks with buds, or a bud. 
 I going to sleep. 
 Good night. 
 Yobo, having problem with the Internet. 
 Ah, just wiggle cable. 
 Good night. 
 But I'm in middle of drama, Romance Byeonhosa,  and Boyoung just find out that her sister's sleeping with her boss,  who is also her half-brother's daddy. 
 - Su-ram? 
 - Yeah. 
 She gonna get pregnancy. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, maybe reset modem? 
 I try that. 
 - You stand on table? 
 - Yeah, three time already. 
 Oh, yobo,  we have to get new Internet. 
 We already spend almost $40. 
 You know how long it take Mrs. 
 Lee to watch a half-hour show? 
 Half hour. 
 Sometime less. 
 Because she not waiting for spinning beach ball. 
 Yobo, season finale is on Sunday. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Tomorrow we upgrade. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 - You coming to bed? 
 - Just have to check email. 
 And those were all my lunches this week. 
 - Good variety. 
 - And value. 
 So, how's life? 
 Good. 
 Work's been busy, but you were there. 
 Shanns? 
 Katie? 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's been forever! 
 I thought you were in Hali-fornia. 
 - Halifax. 
 - Okay. 
 I just moved back. 
 You look Shan-tastic. 
 Is your skin even real? 
 It's like Westworld perfect. 
 Aw, Katie-Kates. 
 You, too. 
 So, Andrea told me you were dating a handsome young man. 
 I can see that she was right. 
 Uh, no. 
 Well, yes to the handsome, no to the rest. 
 Oh. 
 Get out of my mouth, foot. 
 No, I am dating someone, but this is Jung. 
 He's my muchacho from work. 
 Or you might call him my work-chacho. 
 Oh, neat. 
 Jung, this is Katie. 
 We were roomies at uni. 
 - It's nice to meet you. 
 - Hi. 
 And I guess the last time I saw you,  it was when I was here on business. 
 - Oh. 
 - Do you remember? 
 Oh, my God. 
 "The Streetcar Screamer."  Okay. 
 We were coming home from a  dinner thing on the streetcar, and... 
 - Someone was screaming? 
 - Not someone. 
 Shannon. 
 - What was she screaming? 
 - "Streetcar Screamer!"  Okay, uh... 
 Maybe I should let you guys catch up. 
 Oh, don't be a baby. 
 We can share Shannon for one night, right, Mr. 
 Work-chacho? 
 Okay, tell me all about yourself. 
 Oh, hi, Janet. 
 Just in time for lunch. 
 Oh, but I was just... 
 Also, there is Bible with reading for Sunday. 
 What reading? 
 At church. 
 On Sunday. 
 You promise to come after last time you  don't come because you is hangover. 
 - I don't remember that. 
 - Because you is hangover. 
 Why do they even still do readings? 
 It just makes it longer and the sermon is already boring enough. 
 - Hi, Janet. 
 - Pastor Nina. 
 Hey. 
 Look, if you don't feel comfortable doing the reading,  we can always ask someone else. 
 No, of course I do. 
 Unless someone else wants to do it more. 
 - Nope. 
 - I will be there. 
 Oh, I'm glad. 
 The only young people I can get up there are babies being baptized,  and they put up a real fight sometimes. 
 Okay, everybody, sit. 
 - I was really just dropping by. 
 - Me, too. 
 Okay. 
 So, who want to say grace? 
 Hmm? 
 Why are you looking at me? 
 I'm kidding. 
 You are so right. 
 Yeah, no, you're cuter. 
 You are. 
 No, you are. 
 Okay, I should go. 
 I just ran into an old friend. 
 Okay, you hang up. 
 You hang up. 
 No, you... 
 Hello? 
 Okay. 
 She hung up. 
 Where is your old friend you run into? 
 Oh. 
 Sorry for the call. 
 My sister is so needy. 
 It's like we're FaceTiming every minute we're not together. 
 Sound sad. 
 And expensive. 
 Oh, I would never pay for that. 
 I'm on wi-fi. 
 You using my wi-fi? 
 No. 
 I'm a member at the Crash-Fit next door. 
 Yeah? 
 Oh, Mr. 
 Kim, you have no idea the speed. 
 My live stream viewers have tripled to three  ever since getting access to my tanning tutorials. 
 It say you need password. 
 Which is free for members. 
 Hint, hint. 
 Someone could use a workout, buddy. 
 Hint, hint. 
 And a live-stream cameraman. 
 Hint, hint. 
 I will never work out with you. 
 Not subtle, but I get the hint. 
 Take care, guys. 
 Hello, Daniel. 
 Mr. K! 
 Are you here for the 1:30 Hot Squats? 
 Oh, no. 
 Just, uh, visit neighbor-style, huh? 
 Here, for you. 
 Some cans of tomatoes. 
 Thanks. 
 The possibilities are endless. 
 Yeah. 
 From my store to you business, huh? 
 Free. 
 No catch. 
 Cool. 
 And just so you know,  my offer still stands if you ever want to work out. 
 With the neighborhood discount, of course. 
 Yeah! 
 Could be fun, huh? 
 Jump on a thing, shake a rope, fall off a ball. 
 Let me grab you a form, and you could think about it. 
 Very generous, Daniel, huh? 
 Almost as nice as me bringing you a tomato can. 
 So... 
 Our monthly fee is $80, but I could charge you $45,  which doesn't include a 13% HST. 
 So, the total would be around $50 a month,  or you could pay all at once, $500 for 12 months. 
 It's $100 savings. 
 You good? 
 Just, uh, think about. 
 Okay. 
 Well, if you have any questions, I'm here 24/7, 365. 
 Shh. 
 - Same deal goes for Mrs... 
 - Shh. 
 - Hey, you forgot the... 
 - Shh! 
 Hey. 
 So, last night was fun. 
 Yeah! 
 Sorry about Katie. 
 She's great, but she can be a blabber. 
 Remind you of anyone? 
 Guilty! 
 So, what's up? 
 Well, I was, A, just dropping by,  and B, seeing if maybe you would give me Katie's number? 
 Oh. 
 To... 
 call her? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Hmm. 
 I cannot think of a reason that's not a great idea. 
 - You okay? 
 - Yeah, yeah. 
 I'm just trying to remember Katie's rules for wingmanning. 
 It was definitely an acronym,  something about it being awkward if it's a mutual friend but, meh. 
 - I bet it's fine. 
 - Or maybe it's not cool? 
 The only thing not cool about this is that it hasn't happened yet. 
 Great. 
 So, what do you think you guys are going to get up to? 
 Maybe lunch or coffee. 
 Cute. 
 Maybe lunch and coffee. 
 That way she'll know you're serious. 
 Not that you need to be. 
 Are you? 
 Don't answer. 
 Okay. 
 Deets delivered. 
 - Thanks. 
 - No probbies. 
 Gonna get you some. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. 
 Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hi. 
 We missed you today in Ceramics. 
 Yeah. 
 Went to see the new film by Gretchen Oh. 
 Oh. 
 I thought you said you had a dentist appointment? 
 Yeah. 
 And I was, like, "Whatever, dentist. 
 Make it quick."  They barely even froze me. 
 Oh, I hope you don't mind. 
 We were looking at that. 
 Oh. 
 It's just a helmet, but, yeah, it's pretty cool. 
 No, your Bible. 
 Oh, that. 
 Ah, yeah, it's my mom's. 
 Forgot it was even there. 
 So are you, like, super-religious? 
 No, I'm not super... 
 anything. 
 Except hanging out and startin' trouble. 
 Janet's doing a reading this Sunday. 
 To keep my parents off my back. 
 They're into the church scene. 
 It's a Korean thing. 
 So do you wear a robe? 
 I wear what I want. 
 I, uh, saw your bookmark. 
 There's some pretty misogynist stuff in there, you know? 
 Like, "Submit to your husband" and "Women should be silent."  Classic. 
 I mean, no thanks, history. 
 Well, I know on the surface it's a touch  "Ra-ra, no girls allowed," but... 
 It's not Janet's fault. 
 She's a victim of the patriarchy. 
 Who even invited you over? 
 Sorry! 
 I'm just getting so riled up. 
 But you're still reading it. 
 Yeah. 
 But only to point out all the  faults with this chauvinistic BS. 
 Come Sunday, the whole congregation's gonna  get a real earful from the Book of Janet. 
 Amen, sister. 
 Or does that still lean in the wrong direction? 
 Hey, gorgeous. 
 Katie! 
 What's goin' on? 
 Just so great to see you last  night. 
 I just thought I'd pop by. 
 Cool. 
 I get it. 
 So where are you guys going? 
 What? 
 You and Jung. 
 He asked me for your number. 
 He called you, didn't he? 
 No. 
 Oh. 
 Coolio. 
 Well... 
 So, wait, when Jung asked for my number, did he seem interested? 
 Hard to tell. 
 He's kind of a closed book. 
 I'm always like, "What is going on in that noggin, mister?"  But he asked for my number? 
 He did. 
 So, I guess we got a little  nugget from that noggin after all. 
 Katie! 
 What brings you to Handy? 
 Oh, she just came by to see me. 
 Oh, cool. 
 So, you wanna grab lunch? 
 Oh, I would love to, but I can't. 
 Got a meeting. 
 Oh. 
 Anyone else? 
 I'd be up for it. 
 If that's okay? 
 Sh-yeah. 
 But you only get one hour, mister. 
 Not a minute more. 
 Or you're grounded. 
 Great. 
 We'll make plans soon. 
 We better. 
 Or you're grounded. 
 Have a margarita for me. 
 Not really. 
 I'd have to write myself up. 
 I'm on the job here. 
 Unless drinking margaritas was your job. 
 Like my aunt. 
 Who are we talking to? 
 Looking good. 
 Ah, just a normal church-style. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You look nice, too, but come, see! 
 Yobo, you get upgrade? 
 Just for you, hmm? 
 Happy Umma, happy home-a. 
 And look. 
 See? 
 You can watch two, three, four show,  all at same time and still very fast! 
 But why we want to do that? 
 Oh, we don't. 
 But we can, huh? 
 Just imagine. 
 Romance Byeonhosa finale tonight with no spinning beach ball. 
 Oh, thank you, God. 
 Thank you me. 
 I'm invite Mrs. 
 Lee and Mrs. 
 Bang. 
 And I watch a video of a monkey riding pig again. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Okay. 
 Have a fun time. 
 No. 
 No. 
 No! 
 All right, guys. 
 I'll see you in there. 
 Mr. 
 K! 
 Hey, are you finally ready to get Crashed? 
 Uh, no. 
 Just drop by, every day-style. 
 Ah, can you give me a second? 
 Oh. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Uh, can I get a five-class pass, please. 
 Oh, for sure. 
 
 
 
 And here is the wi-fi code. 
 - Oh, I got it already. 
 - Oh, we changed it. 
 Keeps people from stealing it. 
 Thanks. 
 - Some people, huh? 
 - I know. 
 I think someone try to steal my wi-fi, too. 
 Oh, you gotta change the password. 
 You know, something personal, easy to remember. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, Daniel, we is neighbor,  but, uh, don't really know each other, huh? 
 Never just talk. 
 Bonding time. 
 Loving it, doing it. 
 So, I've always had a issue with alcohol. 
 You know, didn't really hit rock bottom... 
 Whoa, too fast, huh? 
 Start from start, like, um... 
 What's you mommy real last name? 
 Oh, uh, Smith. 
 What about your mom? 
 - Also Smith. 
 - Really? 
 Uh... 
 Oh, I know. 
 What's the name of you first teacher? 
 Wow! 
 You are thorough. 
 It was Mr. 
 Koslowski. 
 I remember being pretty shy... 
 How you spell Cow-cow-ski? 
 K-O... 
 - Daniel. 
 Mr. 
 Kim! 
 - Hey. 
 Are you joining? 
 Hint-hint. 
 Okay, let's finish this later. 
 I got a  "Plank You Very Much" class in five. 
 Okay. 
 Sound good. 
 - Plank you very much. 
 - Oh. 
 - Hi, Mrs. 
 Lee. 
 - Janet. 
 I hear you're doing reading today. 
 So wonderful. 
 It's no big deal. 
 You make your Umma so proud. 
 Wow. 
 Tall in here. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Let's sit, huh? 
 Okay, just gotta say hi to Gerald first. 
 Just hurry. 
 Hey. 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 - Moral support. 
 - What you're doing is so brave. 
 Yeah, but it's kind of boring if you haven't read the book. 
 Why don't you guys grab brunch and I'll  swing by after I've bruised up "the man."  No, no. 
 Hate speech and misogyny need to be stamped out. 
 We're here for you. 
 Janet! 
 Mrs. 
 Yoo is here all way from Mississauga to see you. 
 Okay. 
 It's stamping time. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Here. 
 Thank you for letting me know because I  didn't even know I was missing my keys. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, here you go. 
 Aren't these the keys to your cash register? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 I doing Crash-Fit sometime  and I know Daniel change password,  and, of course, he give to me,  but, uh, I forget. 
 Crazy. 
 Can you, uh, remind? 
 Oh, dear. 
 This is a real Enrique's Choice situation. 
 Maybe you should ask Daniel? 
 Uh, but's he's so busy,  and I think, uh, maybe I can ask you because we's so good... 
 friend. 
 Oh, my gee. 
 You said it. 
 Mr. Kim, do you know how long I've been waiting for you... 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 What's the password? 
 Mr. Kim, would a true friend ask another true friend  to betray his fitness wi-fi community? 
 Yes. 
 Maybe... 
 for my best friend. 
 Just a regular friend. 
 Okay, it's BubblesthecatKoslowsky. 
 Enrique, are you coming, 'cause I got three standbys... 
 I gave Mr. Kim the Crash-Fit wi-fi. 
 Oh! 
 It's like a 20-pound kettle bell has been lifted off my back. 
 What? 
 No! 
 I just testing him, and he fail. 
 You were stealing my wi-fi? 
 Well, remember time you use my hose to wash your car? 
 Same, same. 
 Mr. K, I thought we were getting to know each other. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Tell you what, you can use my garden hose anytime you want,  even every day. 
 Don't have to ask. 
 I have a better idea. 
 You can have the wi-fi password. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah... 
 Take any energy bar you like. 
 If you buy a Crash-Fit membership. 
 Okay, well, I guess, uh, with neighbor discount,  it's still cheaper than rip-off cable company. 
 All right. 
 I will put you on the list for the 6:00 a.m. 
 Quad Crush. 
 Let's go, Enrique. 
 And our scripture today will be read by Janet Kim. 
 Whoo! 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 You! 
 Yeah! 
 Give 'em hell, Janet! 
 Whoo! 
 "A woman should be quiet, in full submission. 
 Do not permit a woman to teach or assume authority over a man..."  Um... 
 Hi, I'm Janet,  and, uh, personally,  I'm kind of disappointed that, um,  in this day and age, our church would  try to silence the voice of women. 
 - Janet... 
 - No. 
 I will not be silenced. 
 Women have fought too long and too hard, but no more. 
 Yeah, sister! 
 And while I agree, that's not today's reading. 
 Oh. 
 - "Season your grain with salt." - No. 
 Sorry. 
 This one. 
 "Love is patient, love is kind. 
 It is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,  it keeps no record of wrongs."  Really want to emphasize that last one. 
 So I put the corporate rentals in this part of the spreadsheet,  and the other rentals are under this tab. 
 Sorry, what? 
 And this is a blank column I can't delete. 
 Oh, and the number of damaged returns went up. 
 Uh, fantastic. 
 Good work. 
 Not really. 
 You know what? 
 I can't work like this. 
 I agree. 
 I'm way too clammy. 
 Jung, can I see you for a moment? 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 What's up? 
 We're trying to get a handle on year-end  and you're distracting everyone in here. 
 I really didn't even notice. 
 And thanks to your constant snapchatting and  general phone unprofessionalism, we're behind. 
 I was just texting. 
 That's right. 
 Which means we're going to have to work late,  and I'm sorry if that's going to spoil your date,  or an intimate evening with someone. 
 - It's not. 
 - Good. 
 Katie had tickets to this concert, but I'm sure she'll understand. 
 Well, I mean, if you need to go because of that... 
 No, you need me to stay, I'll stay. 
 Fine, if you want to stay. 
 Did you want me to stay? 
 Also, my mom really needs a fourth for bridge. 
 Not tonight, T-bag. 
 What's the matter with you, Janet? 
 You embarrass me in front of whole church. 
 You gave me the wrong passage, Umma. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 Just go along  with something I have issues with? 
 Yeah. 
 I have issue with lots of thing. 
 Sometime just have to go along. 
 Maybe it's time you stopped going along. 
 Umma, I didn't mean to embarrass you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to give you wrong passage. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 - But seriously, Umma... 
 - Don't ruin moment, Janet. 
 Thank you. 
 So much. 
 You did a lovely job. 
 You don't have to say that. 
 Yeah, she do. 
 She's a pastor. 
 If nothing else, it gave us an important teaching less... 
 Oh my God. 
 Young people. 
 Please don't leave! 
 Wow! 
 We did not rent as many cars as we thought. 
 No wonder we took over this dud branch. 
 No offence, Stacie. 
 It has gone up in the last month. 
 And who's been working here a month? 
 You're welcome. 
 So, what are we thinking? 
 Thai, burgers, Indian? 
 They all look good. 
 Actually, I think we're done. 
 - See ya. 
 - And bridge is out. 
 My mom partnered with my sister, Miss Coup en passant. 
 Who's up for a beer? 
 I'm already missing the concert. 
 Oh, you guys should go. 
 - You sure? 
 - Yeah. 
 We're buds, but might be good to keep it profesh. 
 - As long as someone's buying me a beer. 
 - I'm not. 
 - We'll see. 
 - I'm really not. 
 I guess it is less distracting without the subtitles. 
 Okay, now I see what's going on. 
 _  _  What's that? 
 So good, huh? 
 It's very exciting. 
 So who is the man with the handcuffs? 
 What you doing? 
 Just, uh, come from workout. 
 - You not even sweating. 
 - Shh! 
 _  _  Oh! 
 She has fangs now? 
 When did that happen?
