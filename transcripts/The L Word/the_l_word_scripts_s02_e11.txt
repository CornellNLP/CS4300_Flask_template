 You look beautiful.   
 You know what, let's start with mom and dad.   
 Do you write them? Do you see them?   
 Do you love them? I mean anything.   
 What's wrong?   
 Until that you can acknowledge that my relationship of   years was every bit as meaningful as your marriage to my mother, until you can see that my heart is broken.   
 Because I've failed the woman I love perhaps in the same way that you failed my mother, then I really had nothing else to say.    
 Daddy.    
 I'd like to see what would happen if we started to spend some more time together.    
 What about Helena?    
 We are not exclusive.    
 You've crossed every line of trust and don't you dare to tell me this was for the sake of art.    
 I just finished taking down the last of the cameras.    
 I pretty much had them all over the house.    
 Umm, Jenny saw a tape I made of the two of you.    
 Beg me.    
 Speak more clearly.    
 I can't understand you.    
 f*ck me.    
 Please f*ck me.    
 I'm gonna give you a minute to think about    
 how badly you want me to f*ck you.    
 I don't know what else to tell you.    
 Couldn't you try to convince him I've spoken to your father's physician in Philadelphia he tells me your father is adamant.    
 I think that he's very aware of that it would be an uphill battle with little hope of recovery.    
 I am sorry.    
 Hey.    
 How is he?    
 He has advanced prostate cancer and he's refusing any treatment.    
 Oh my God. I'm so sorry.    
 I'm so so sorry.    
 Look it's gonna be alright, okay?    
 Listen, we are gonna get through this.    
 Where's Kit?    
 She's in the... she's in the room, but she has to leave to go to the Planet to get ready for tomorrow.    
 Oh my God. Tomorrow's the parade and she thinks he's right to refuse treatment.    
 Well, maybe she's just trying to support his decision, that's it.    
 He can not make a decision right now.    
 I mean you should see him.    
 He's not himself.    
 He's so sick.    
 Come on.    
 There you go.    
 Hey.    
 Easy, easy, easy, easy.    
 Okay, okay.    
 Let me help with the feet.    
 Hello Melvin.    
 Take those home.    
 You can put flowers on my grave.    
 Aren't you gonna say hello to Tina, daddy.    
 Hello, Ms. Kennard.    
 How are you feeling?    
 How do you think I'm feeling?    
 Daddy, did you see how pregnant Tina is?    
 Would you like to feel the baby?    
 That would be highly inappropriate.    
 Hi, it's me right here.    
 I would make out with...     
 Yes, and scary, can sometimes be a little sexy.    
 They are not scary. They are stupid.    
 That's right, and stupid, Shane.    
 Let me ask you this question: what are you looking for in a woman?    
 What are you looking for?    
 Jen?    
 Hi.    
 What are you doing?    
 I just kept on having these nightmares, so just trying to work it all out.    
 Well umm, can we talk for a second?    
 Yeah.    
 This is my home, Jenny, and I don't know it's the first time I actually have a room of my own.    
 That's a huge thing for me and I am sorry. I am...     
 I am sorry about what you saw on that tape but I like living with you.     
 I love you.     
 I think we had a great time.     
 Right.     
 It's just, I don't...      
 I just don't wanna lose it.     
 Yeah.     
 What are you gonna do about Carmen?     
 Nothing.     
 I think the two of you should be together.     
 What about you?     
 I think...      
 I think that it was a very important step for me and now I am onto other things.     
 So, is that why you are pushing me and Carmen together?     
 No.     
 Because you are great together.     
 Come on, I wanna show you something.     
 I'm looking for a good time.     
 Come on. Really?     
 Yeah. Why are you asking as if I am not because I just want you to be truthful.     
 I am.     
 Great.     
 What are you looking for?     
 Mark here answering question "what are you looking for in woman"?     
 A little love, happiness, and a little Al Green.     
 Look, definitely a little Al Green.     
 No, really.     
 What...      
 What are you looking for?     
 You are not scary and Carmen is not gonna get herself involve with something that she can't handle, okay?     
 I love you.     
 Camile, I told you not to fall in love with me.     
 No no, this is me talking.     
 I love you, Dana.     
 Who is that?     
 I don't know.     
 It's Howie.     
 What?     
 What's he doing here?     
 Hey, hey, is it you guys?     
 I can hear you.     
 Hey.     
 Howie.     
 Big sis!     
 Ha.     
 Good to see you.     
 Oh Alice, nice outfit.     
 I am cleaning.     
 How'd you find me?     
 Are you kidding?     
 Mom and dad loved to talk about how you give up your bright future with Tonya for a dead end relationship with her.     
 Sorry.     
 You seem far away.     
 I am not. I am just thinking about Melvin.     
 I thought that might be the case.     
 Who knows what Bette's gonna do without him?     
 Tina, I don't mean to sound harsh, but that's not any of your concern anymore.     
 Is it?     
 Bette's still my family.     
 Yes, I am reminded of that often enough.     
 Can I take your plates?     
 Sure.     
 And can we see the dessert menu please.     
 I will bring it right over.     
 I want to see, other people.     
 You mean, you wanna see Bette.     
 Tina, it's fine.     
 That, it's not like we are exclusive.     
 You haven't drop that bombshell, I mean, I just, feel bad, that you are under the impression that things are otherwise.     
 There you go.     
 Thank you.     
 Did you run away?     
 No, no. Mom and dad are just way up in my grill so I needed some space.     
 So you came here.     
 Oh, yeah, thought it would be fun to suprise you guys.     
 Calling's fun too.     
 Oh, email's fun.     
 What? You guys not happy to see me?     
 No.     
 It's not. It's not that at all, just that...      
 How long are you staying, Howie?     
 Coz it's gay pride weekend and we are kinda "all up and out" proud thing.     
 Oh, okay, well, maybe I will go wit you then.     
 Howie.     
 How do I put this?     
 Gay pride... Howie... is for gay people.     
 Yes... yeah... okay... see.     
 Come here.     
 Gay.     
 Yup.     
 Not gay.     
 Right... right.     
 You wanna come to the pride with me tomorrow?     
 Yeah.     
 There's a party at the Planet afterwards.     
 May I come in?     
 Sorry.     
 I was just wondering if it would be alright if I just if I just stay here tonight and leave first thing tomorrow morning.     
 I almost got all the stuff in my car but I just don't wanna leave my car full of sh1t while I unpack at night.     
 Yeah.     
 Someone might steal your cameras.     
 I know that you hate me and, while I would love to ask for your forgiveness I probably wouldn't forgive myself     
 so...      
 I don't know if you can relate to this but, it's this, terrible thing that I was doing suddenly became the best truest thing that I've ever done.     
 What?     
 I got. I got.     
 I will go get the rest of my boxes. Sorry.     
 Hey...     
 you can stay tonight.     
 Thank you.     
 "Well I was getting to feel that way myself...thou I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do old Hank Bunker done it once..."     
 Hi.     
 Hello Melvin.     
 Hello.     
 Hey.     
 I brought you some food and change of clothes.     
 Oh, thank you so much.     
 As nice as it is     
 I don't know how much longer I could've wore this dress.     
 Well, you look beautiful in it.     
 You look beautiful, radiant.     
 I was so mad at you for leaving the ceremony I thought you did it to spite me.     
 No... no, no. I was so proud of you.     
 You looked so confident.     
 Would you please close that curtain.     
 Of course.     
 Well, I should go home.     
 Thank you for the food and the clothes.     
 Will I see you tomorrow?     
 I'm gonna go to the parade with Helena.     
 Look... I m not gonna stop seeing her.     
 If you don't want to see me under these circumstances, I understand.     
 One step at a time, okay.     
 Okay.     
 She's gone now.     
 You don't have to hide now.     
 What have I done?     
 What are you talking about?     
 I loved you.     
 I umm, supported every endeavor you've ever undertaken, I've given you every opportunity to follow your every dream.     
 I don't understand why you want to punish me.     
 I am not punishing you.     
 I do not understand, and you are such a beautiful woman.     
 Daddy.     
 Don't you ever think about the day you are gonna stand in the judgement before God.     
 What are you gonna say to him... when he opens the book of life and reads your sins?     
 I will say, I am your creation and I am proud.     
 Now I know how hard you've worked to distance yourself from everyone else on this planet     
 and I am sure that deep down you've got some great reasons why.     
 But it's not gonna work for you anymore.     
 It's working fine.     
 No... it's not.     
 It's not because of this. Okay?     
 Because of this right here.     
 Do you feel this?     
 Most people don't have this, Shane.     
 This is rare.     
 This kinda things just don't happen and I feel this because I see it.     
 And I know it.     
 Here's some sheets.     
 Wow, thank you.     
 And pillows and things.     
 You need pjs.     
 No, I am good, yeah.     
 Okay.     
 I am happy that you are here.     
 I am happy to see you too, Dane.     
 Alright.     
 Good night.     
 He's gonna ruin our pride.     
 Maybe he can hang out with you.     
 What?     
 Wha... where are you gonna be?     
 I sorta got asked to be on the gay and lesbians center float.     
 Were you gonna tell me that?     
 Yes.     
 Great.     
 Al!     
 Be with me.     
 No, seriosuly.     
 Be... be...  be...  with me on the float.     
 You are a celebrity.     
 You are, you are a "Pieszecki of the chart" Pieszecki.     
 Really.     
 Be on the float.     
 Well, do you think... would they want that?     
 Yeah.     
 Come here with me on the float.     
 Come on, let's be known and gay together.     
 That sounds kinda fun.     
 Yeah.     
 Alright... well... how about Howie?     
 We will leave before he gets up.     
 I love the way you think.     
 I love you.     
 I am gonna set the alarm, okay.     
 Yeah.     
 Okay.     
 Morning.     
 You want one.     
 Sure.     
 He's not there.     
 Did he leave?     
 I don't know.     
 Thank you.     
 We should get to the parade early.     
 Yeah.     
 Is it gonna be really big?     
 Probably.     
 Hey.     
 I brought coffee and umm...      
 those little organic scones that you guys like.     
 I am f*cking lost man.     
 Can you just take these, please?     
 Can I talk to Jenny?     
 You gotta ask her, not me.     
 Now.     
 Can I talk to you?     
 Yeah.     
 I wish so much that there's something I can do.     
 No. I don't think there's anything that you can do.     
 I think that you did it.     
 When I moved in here I was the type of guy who was capable of doing sh1t like this.     
 But I am not that guy anymore.     
 I know I've said it before but you and Shane had made me a better man.     
 Oh, f*ck off Mark.     
 It's not my job to make you a better man and I don't give a sh1t if I've made you a better man it's not a f*cking woman's job to consumed and invaded and spat on, so some f*cking man can evolve.     
 It's not what I meant.     
 What the f*ck are you talking about then, Mark?     
 You give me one reason why you think that I should forgive you.     
 Because that, Jenny, I've made a big, big mistake but from that I've learned how difficult it is to be a woman.     
 Oh please!     
 Wait Jenny.     
 Hey.     
 Look at this.     
 What are you doing?     
 Is this what you want?     
 No.     
 What I want is for you to write f*ck me on your chest.     
 Write it, do it and I want you to walk out that door and I want you to walk down the street and anybody that wants to f*ck you said, "Sure sure no problem."     
 And when they do, you have to say, "Thank you very very much."     
 And make sure that you have a smile on your face and you stupid f*cking coward's gonna know what it feels like to be a woman.     
 Ohh, Shane, I just...      
 I don't know.     
 He must've heard our alarm this morning.     
 There's no reason to be up so early.     
 Dana Fairbanks.     
 Hey guys.     
 It's Dana Fairbanks.     
 She's here.     
 Okay.     
 Oh, I am sorry.     
 Yeah.     
 Can I get your name?     
 Yeah.     
 Alice Pieszecki.     
 Would you spell that please?     
 P... I... I am not on that list.     
 I am.     
 She's...      
 this is my girlfriend.     
 We are together and Alice Oieszecki of the chart, KCRW.     
 It's okay anyway.     
 This is my brother, and I thought they could be on the float with me.     
 Oh, I'm really sorry Dana.     
 Only the people who's name is on this list gets to go on the floats.     
 They can watch you from the crowd.     
 It'd be fun for them.     
 Well...      
 it's not like it's the HRC or the GLAAD float thing anyways.     
 What?     
 You heard me.     
 Alice.     
 Dana, if you'd like to ride on our float, we'd love to have you, alone.     
 I'm sorry you guys.     
 Uh huh.     
 I will see you after.     
 Yeah.     
 Oh, how sweet of her.     
 People really loved her huh.     
 Yeah.     
 Alright, keep it moving.     
 He's straight.     
 Come on.     
 I am sorry.     
 It's a bit of a mate market.     
 Are you okay?     
 I am okay, yeah.     
 Al?     
 Come with me.     
 What?     
 Well, she won't come with me so you have to do it.     
 What?     
 Shane. She wants me to ride with her with the motorcycle lesbians the Dykes on Bikes and you are not going.     
 Yup, I wanna be an observer.     
 Yeah I so wanna go.     
 Yeah?     
 Yeah.     
 How about Howie?     
 Yeah I will be fine.     
 I will look after him.     
 You okay? You okay? You good     
 Yeah.     
 Oh cool. Thanks     
 Hey.     
 Hi, I am Howie.     
 I am Jenny.     
 Nice to meet you.     
 Nice to meet you.     
 You wanna walk around?     
 Yeah, sure.     
 I am gonna go with the Dykes on bikes. So...      
 Alright fine. I will see you later.     
 You can write that on your little clip board.     
 See you Al.     
 Shane.     
 What?     
 I told Dana that I love her, twice.     
 That's good.     
 Yeah. But she didn't say anything back, and umm, that's bad, right.     
 Okay. Why am I even talking to you about love?     
 Serious!     
 Look, at least I can see that she loves you.     
 You can?     
 Yeah. You can't?     
 Come on.     
 Jenny.     
 Oh my God, Shane!     
 Hi Dana!     
 You know I have a secret?     
 What?     
 I've never actually attended the parade before.     
 I mean, I had parties around it, I've rented rooftops with amazing views of it, but I've never actually be in it.     
 Well, welcome.     
 We are happy to have you.     
 And how about you?     
 Oh, this is, my seventh.     
 Such a political being you are, fighting for gay rights, eh?     
 No, not really.     
 Bette and I used to come every year it's just an excuse to have a margarita before   o'clock.     
 Did you miss that?     
 I like being here with you, seeing it through your eyes.     
 She needs to get spank.     
 
 
 
 Jenny.     
 Hey.     
 Hi.     
 Hi, have you seen Howie?     
 He said he would meet up with me later.     
 Was he freaking?     
 No.     
 Did he say where he's going?     
 Maybe he went to a sports bar or something.     
 Yeah, probably. Right.     
 Yeah.     
 What?     
 How weird...      
 Thank you.     
 Maybe there was a good game on.     
 Will I see you there?     
 Maybe.     
 Wow, I love to punish a tease.     
 I wish you were here, mom.     
 Hey.     
 I brought you something to eat.     
 How is he?     
 Asleep.     
 Why don't you go home?     
 If I go home     
 all I am gonna think about is being here.     
 But you can't just stay here and...      
 I can.     
 It's my decision.     
 Is that my Katie?     
 Yeah, daddy.     
 Come here Kat.     
 I brought your pajamas.     
 Okay.     
 I am so sorry.     
 All these years, such foolishness, oh, Katie.     
 It's okay, it's okay.     
 Is my baby here?     
 Yeah, she's here.     
 I...      
 I love you both.     
 I love you too, daddy.     
 I don't think I can do this.     
 Yeah sure you can.     
 Come on.     
 Okay.     
 Maybe it's not a great idea.     
 Alright, look.     
 Let's just look at the pros and cons.     
 Okay.     
 Okay, okay.     
 Gentle with novices.     
 This is good.     
 Okay, great.     
 So we can just tell them it's our first time.     
 I think they might know that, Dana. But...      
 Okay.     
 Alright.     
 There's   stations of the cross.     
 Okay.     
 Umm, see... whipping, temporary piercing, public humiliations, a**l penetration, torching...      
 Torching, oy...      
 Okay.     
 Umm, spanking and...      
 Oh, specialty arts.     
 That's nice.     
 Oooh, there's a free buffet till  , chicken wings and tofu.     
 Yeah, what do you think?     
 I don't know.     
 We'll, sneak peek and...      
 Right, alright.     
 Let's do it.     
 Come on.     
 Hey.     
 Hi.     
 So polite.     
 Ohh, what do you want your servant to be?     
 I don't know tunafish.     
 Thank you.     
 Okay.     
 Alright.     
 Great.     
 Planet.     
 Uh great, yeah.     
 Fantastic.     
 Okay.     
 Bye.     
 Thank you.     
 Thanks.     
 Hey!     
 Hey!     
 Happy pride!     
 Oh my God, you look so huge.     
 Oh my God, wow, hey.     
 Hi!     
 What are you doing here?     
 I am celebrating gay pride I guess.     
 I don't know.     
 You mean, gay shame.     
 That's what it really is?     
 Why?     
 Cause most of us have more shame than pride.     
 I think that you might be right.     
 You wanna dance?     
 No.     
 What's the matter?     
 Am I too old, or too suburban or something... ?     
 No, you are perfect.     
 You wanna kiss me?     
 Happy pride!     
 Leigh!     
 Hey!     
 How are you?     
 I am good?     
 Good to see you?     
 So you've made it?     
 Yeah, it's a great party?     
 Did you enjoy the parade?     
 Yeah, I had a great time?     
 Yeah?     
 Tina, this is Leigh.     
 Leigh, this is my friend, Tina.     
 Hi, very pregnant friend.     
 Yeah.     
 She and umm, her ex are having a baby.     
 Oh, I am sorry.     
 Not about the baby, about the ex.     
 I am just going through a breakup myself, so...

 We are not friends.     
 Daddy.     
 Remember when I was a little girl and on Sundays... we go to church and you'd wear your three piece suit pointy toed shoes.     
 I looked over to you and I said that's my dad.     
 You were the handsomest man in the world.     
 You are everything, everything I thought a man should be.
