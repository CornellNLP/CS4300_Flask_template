 I believe that something comes to get you. 
 When you pass away. 
 Nurse! 
 It was evil. 
 I know that I saw the Angel of Death. 
 It's gonna take me. 
 What is that? 
 Jeannie, it's the girl! 
 This was death... 
 Paying him back. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 I always heard that medical professionals make the worst patients. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 That's true, because I made the worst patient. 
 I'm an emergency medical technician. 
 I had recently had gastric bypass surgery... 
 And something had gone really wrong. 
 I went through the hospital doors. 
 Being an E.M.T., normally I would walk through... 
 But this time, I was on a cart, going in feet-first. 
 This time, I was the patient. 
 I was admitted to I.C.U... 
 And they started running a lot of tests. 
 I knew that it was serious. 
 So I was very scared. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 [Panting] 
 Going in to see him for the first time was very upsetting. 
 Here's my strong husband, who's normally the caregiver, laying there helpless. 
 [Panting] 
 Sir, that's my husband right there. 
 What's going on? 
 The doctor said, well, his kidneys have shut down. 
 Being married to an E.M.T., I know that somebody's kidneys failing is not a good thing. 
 [Cries] 
 The thought of losing Mike at the time was more than I could bear. 
 Our kids were young. 
 There were things he needed to do with these kids. 
 [Sniffling] 
 [Machine beeping] 
 On Memorial Day, my stepfather Darrell had a massive stroke. 
 When we arrived at the hospital, they immediately started working on him. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 They had already said he probably would not make it through the night. 
 Mom. 
 Tonya. 
 What happened? 
 Honey, pops had a massive stroke. 
 My daughter Tonya arrived at the I.C.U. 
 [Crying] I don't know if he's gonna make it or not, Sweetie. 
 He'll be okay. 
 All I could do was hug her. 
 We didn't know whether he was dead or alive at that point. 
 [Cries] He's barely breathing. 
 Nobody should be hooked up to that much machinery just to breathe, just to live. 
 It'll be okay. 
 Hey, how you doing? 
 My job at the hospital as an I.T. Technician. 
 Is crucial to the patient and the patient's care. 
 So I have to get into that room there... 
 A patient's life could be in jeopardy if you don't get it right the first time. 
 [Sighs] 
 If a patient is on their death bed and there's family around... 
 I try to just give them their space. 
 The computer can wait. 
 Yeah, it's not a good time. 
 I'll come back and do it tomorrow, okay? 
 I work by myself at night quite often. 
 I'm not scared of the night shifts. 
 I'm there to help the doctors. I'm there to help the nurses. 
 With my office being in the basement, close to the Morgue... 
 I do see the bodies in the gurneys. 
 Generally, the door's shut, but every once in a while, you catch a glimpse... 
 Of what's going on in the Morgue, and, uh, it's not... 
 It can be kind of frightful. 
 This is, like, the biggest stroke a person can have. 
 Thanks. 
 So how is he? No change? 
 [Machine beeping] 
 The doctors put a hole right here in his throat and installed a Trach. 
 He looked dead. 
 I don't even think the doctors expected for him to come back. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 [Machine beeping rapidly] 
 Mom. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 He was looking around the room like, you know, where am I? Type thing. 
 You're awake? 
 You just look into somebody's eyes, and you can see fear. 
 [Muttering] 
 His eyes were as big as saucers. 
 [Choking] 
 He was just angry. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 He was fighting something in his own world... 
 Because in my world, there was nothing in that room. 
 [Muttering] 
 [Groans] 
 My stepfather was not always a very kind person in life. 
 He did some bad things. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 I felt like... 
 This was death... 
 Paying him back. 
 I got called in to come change a computer in the operating rooms. 
 During the day, you can't really get in there. 
 There's people being operated on. 
 Met up with Security. 
 Everything had been shut down. 
 Bare minimal lighting. 
 And I'm looking at the computer and trying to figure out the problem. 
 [Computer keys clicking] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Something just caught my attention. 
 Hello? 
 I don't know what that was. 
 Anyone there? 
 I'm just trying to get my job done and get it done right. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 As I'm working... 
 [Beeping] 
 I hear, b-beep, b-beep, b-beep. 
 That sound... it's not coming from the computer. 
 Where is it coming from? 
 [Beeping] 
 You could see the heart monitor going, t-joot, you know, t-joot, t-joot... 
 With a heartbeat. 
 I can tell you that these heart monitors... 
 They don't go off without a body attached to it. 
 You've got to have a flesh-and-blood body attached to these electrodes. 
 Something's wrong. 
 He was in I.C.U... 
 [Muttering] 
 Just out of the clear blue, he says, you know, hey, Aunt Evie. 
 Aunt Evie... 
 And I looked around, and there was nobody in the room but me and him. 
 Pop, who are you talking to, pop? 
 [Groans] Uncle Bob. 
 How's the garden growing? 
 That's when I realized... 
 [Muttering] 
 Aunt Evie and Uncle Bob... 
 Was his Aunt and Uncle that had been dead for many years. 
 I never even knew the people. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 I knew something's wrong. 
 I'm pushing buttons. 
 There's got to be a logical explanation for this. 
 [Beeping stops] 
 And then it just stops. 
 [Metal clanking] 
 I hear clanking... 
 I look up... 
 I realize, you know, it was the surgical tools next to the operating table. 
 [Clanking continues] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 [Clanking stops] 
 I have never been so spooked in my life. 
 Every shadow, every light were creeping me out from that point on. 
 I didn't really want to be there. 
 I wanted to hurry up and get my work done and go home. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 I looked up... 
 [Gasps] 
 I see this black, misty mass. 
 What is that? 
 [Dramatic music] 
 What is that? 
 And within a second and a half, it shot up into the ceiling. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 I was laying in bed in a lot of pain. 
 And I kind of caught something out of the corner of my eye. 
 It was kind of a shadow, dark-type... 
 Thing. 
 Kind of like, you would think, a ghost, but not white... it was... it was a black. 
 It was going somewhere... 
 Like it was looking for something. 
 It's okay. 
 My mom was ran ragged. 
 Wore down. 
 I told my mom I'd go in. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 I heard... 
 This little pss-pss-pss-pss-pss-pss. 
 [Indistinct whispering] 
 Had no idea where it was coming from. 
 Had no idea who was doing it. 
 [Indistinct whispering] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 I can hear him kind of mumbling a little bit. 
 Darrell? 
 Are you okay, Darrell? 
 Darrell? 
 No! Leave me alone! 
 I am not ready to go. 
 No! You get away from me! 
 And all I could think was, who was he talking to? 
 [Yelling] 
 He's squirming around the bed like this, and, stop that! Get away from me! 
 I'm not ready to go! No, no! It's not my time! 
 He was speaking to something or someone that was in that room with us. 
 No, no! 
 The look on his face... 
 Something was there for him... 
 No! 
 And it was torturing him. 
 No! 
 Mom! 
 [Muttering] 
 No, no! 
 Hey, hey, pop... 
 Just all of a sudden, it was, get me a bat! 
 Give me a bat! Give me a bat! 
 Get away, you son of a bitch! I'm not ready to go! 
 I'm going back! 
 The arm kept doing this, as if he was... 
 Hitting at something, or swatting it away. 
 [Muttering] 
 He was fighting with it. He was struggling with it. 
 Trying to get it away from him. 
 Get it off me! 
 Hey, hey! 
 Get away, you son of a... 
 The machine couldn't keep up with him. 
 [Machine beeping rapidly] 
 Calm down. 
 Nurse! Nurse! 
 It was like something was physically sitting on top of his chest. 
 Give me a bat. I'll bash his head in. 
 Calm down. 
 Get away, get away, no! 
 No, no, no, no! 
 No, no, no! 
 What was there in that room, was in that room. 
 And it was for him, and I wasn't about to have a part of it. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 It was evil. That's what it seemed like. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 I got out of the operating room. 
 And I turned the corner, and I'm going down... 
 The very dark and desolate hallway... 
 This weird feeling... 
 Came over me. 
 I just stopped. 
 Just an eerie, weird feeling... 
 Right behind me. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 [Loud bang] 
 I was extremely terrified. 
 I turned around... 
 And that black mist... 
 That black shape is coming back up at me. 
 It was chasing me down the hallway. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 I'm turning the corner, my cell phone goes off. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 I take my phone out... 
 Hello? 
 [Garbled speech] 
 I look up... 
 And the Morgue door is open. 
 Why is the door open? 
 There was a body on the table. 
 Standing right behind... 
 Was a woman. 
 She was staring at her own dead body. 
 I knew I had just seen a ghost. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 I didn't feel like sticking around. 
 I ran very quickly. 
 I can't believe what I just saw. 
 I stopped at the end of the ramp. 
 I'm winded. 
 That was the scariest thing I've ever... 
 Ever seen. 
 You talk about stuff of this nature in a hospital... 
 The first thing they're going to do is take you up to the Mental Ward. 
 I had been working at the hospital in the psychiatric wing for... 
 Oh, my God, about nine years total. 
 I enjoyed my job. 
 The patients did like me. We got along very well together. 
 After a while, it's kind of like they they become family. 
 Time I get to work, it's, like, about 6:35 in the morning. 
 One of my favorite patients at the hospital was Mark. 
 How's it going? 
 Good. 
 Down here early this morning. 
 I came down early. 
 I was gonna go punch in. He asked me for a cigarette. 
 Have you got a cigarette, Ron? 
 Sure, why don't we go out to the porch? 
 Let's go. 
 I gave Mark a cigarette. 
 You know, when I was a kid, we used to fish in that stream all the time. 
 It's beautiful. 
 And I looked at my watch, and I seen it was about 8 to 7:00. 
 I gotta punch in, you know? 
 So I reach down, died out my cigarette on the ground... 
 And that's when this thing came upon me. 
 This thing had to be about 7 feet tall. 
 This black mist has hit me so fast... 
 I couldn't breathe. 
 Damn it, I'm dying. 
 It was if somebody had a vice around your heart. 
 I felt myself going. 
 I was dying. 
 [Grunts] 
 It started to pass. 
 I was able to breathe. 
 And as it finally passed, I turned to look at Mark... 
 What? 
 Mark was gone. 
 He was, like, there one minute, gone the next. 
 The only thing that I found that was left there was the cigarette that he had. 
 I thought maybe Mark might have taken off to get somebody. 
 Because that's the kind of person he was. 
 So I went in... 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 And next thing you know, one of the night shift came downstairs. 
 One of the patients, you know, apparently passed away. 
 Yeah, sure. I can help with that. 
 Oh, hey, Ron. Can you sign this for me? 
 Yeah, sure, Doc. 
 The doctor asked me if I would sign the verification of I.D. of the patient. 
 You can see, and plainly, estimated time of death was... 
 6:30 that morning. 
 I signed my name, and so the doctor said to me, well... 
 You have to look at the body. 
 You have to see the body, Ron. 
 Right. Sorry, Doc. 
 
 
 
 [Dramatic music] 
 It was Mark. 
 It can't be. 
 It can't be. 
 Mark died of a massive heart attack. 
 He just died at 6:30, and I was outside with him... 
 You know, at about ten of, having a cigarette. 
 Ten minutes ago just... 
 Less than ten minutes ago we were outside and having a... 
 Had a cigarette on the back porch. 
 Ron, I'm so sorry. 
 I know I wasn't talking to myself. 
 I know I was with him. 
 He was physically there. 
 It's impossible for somebody to be two places at one time. 
 I went up to the coffee shop to, you know, to unwind and gather my thoughts. 
 The priest was coming down. 
 Hello, Ron. 
 And I said, Father, do you have a minute? 
 Of course, come on. 
 What I'm gonna tell you, I said, you're going to find it very hard to believe. 
 Tell me what's going on. That's what I want to know. 
 I just had a cigarette with him downstairs. 
 I told him about having the cigarette on the porch with Mark. 
 He said when Mark died, I felt part of Mark's heart attack. 
 You felt his pain. 
 He said, it's a rare occurrence, but what you came in touch with, that's what we call, in the Catholic religion, the Angel of Death. 
 Ron, you... you've experienced death. 
 And it was coming for Mark. 
 I believe that the person who I was talking to on the porch was Mark's spirit. 
 When this mist came, it was coming for Mark, not for me. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 After a while, my stepfather Darrell... 
 He gave up. 
 The body started deteriorating. 
 [Beeping continues] 
 So the doctor ordered the hospice nurse to come in. 
 I'm a hospice nurse. 
 Have been for seven years. 
 Good morning. 
 My job can be difficult. 
 Because we have to care for the patient that's passing away as well as the families and their needs. 
 [Door opens] 
 Priscilla? 
 Yeah. 
 Hi, I'm Vickie. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I remember walking into the room the very first time, and there was Darrell, and he was laying on his bed, and he was sick. 
 Well, I will take over from here, and you can go and get some rest. 
 Great. 
 I did not tell Vickie anything that had been happening there, because I was afraid that she would either leave or have me locked up. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 The first thing she needed to do was go get some rest. 
 It was my time now. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 It was just Mr. Darrell and myself. 
 [Muttering] 
 It looks like he was wrestling with something. 
 [Muttering] 
 And I thought that maybe he just was one of those kind of guys that's not gonna go down easy. 
 [Muttering] 
 [Shouting] 
 [Moaning] 
 He's gonna fight it until he can't fight anymore. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 And I was sitting there reading a book... 
 I felt this chill sort of come into the room. 
 And it just kept getting colder. 
 I don't think the thermostat had been lowered or anything... 
 But the atmosphere had changed in the room. 
 The hairs on the back of my neck and on my arm sort of stand up. 
 [Shivers] 
 And you can feel like someone has walked into the room. 
 My eye was distracted to this shadow. 
 I'm feeling something in the room that I can't see... 
 But I can feel it. 
 I'm in a room... 
 With my dying patient, alone. 
 And something has entered to the room. 
 I pull my chair over to the side of his bed... 
 [Muttering] 
 I take his hand. 
 And I pray for him. 
 I pray for his family. 
 [Shouting] 
 [Machine beeping rapidly] 
 He was wrestling with something. 
 [Shouting] 
 Like, trying to get something off of him. 
 [Shouting] 
 I'm thinking that he's in pain... 
 So I gave him another dose of pain medicine. 
 Which was almost, like, twice of what you would normally give somebody. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Instead of him calming down, he got more... 
 Of this moving of the head and the hands. 
 [Muttering] 
 This was unlike anything that I had experienced before. 
 [Machine beeping rapidly] 
 The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want... 
 I got out my Bible. 
 I felt like that was something that could help me and Darrell at that time. 
 He makes me lie down in the green pastures... 
 [Groaning] 
 I can't say whether it was a Demon or a ghost. 
 [Shouting] 
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... 
 But I do know that it was something there... 
 Thou hast anointed me. 
 [Groaning] 
 That I could not see... 
 And I will dwell in the house... 
 And it was there for him. 
 [Groaning] 
 Vickie? 
 Are you okay? 
 I knew that we needed to have a chat. 
 We need to talk. 
 She is a hospice nurse. 
 She deals with death every day. 
 But she did make the remark to me that... 
 The torment that he was enduring by something in that room, was like nothing she had seen. 
 Priscilla was relieved to have someone else to say... 
 Yes, I saw it. Yes, I felt it. 
 Yes, I know it's there. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I was still in intensive care, and still in a considerable amount of discomfort. 
 It was nighttime. 
 I had my mask on, and had the I.V.'s. 
 And all of a sudden... 
 I saw a shadow. 
 And it had form. It was a physical... 
 [Machine beeping rapidly] 
 It was actually walking into my room. 
 I felt like I couldn't breathe. 
 I was pushing everything I had to call anybody. 
 [Groaning] 
 The only thing that came through the door was the dark, black figure. 
 [Groaning] 
 And the only thing that was running through my mind is... 
 [Choking] 
 It's gonna take me. 
 [Gasping] 
 It was getting closer and closer, and I was starting to kind of get fuzzy. 
 I kind of caught, out of the corner of my eye... 
 A figure, or... 
 It was a little girl. 
 I didn't know why she was there. 
 [Gasping] 
 I was gasping for breath. 
 I was scared... scared to death. 
 I was gasping for air, trying to catch my breath. 
 I looked at the little girl... 
 And I wasn't scared. 
 The figure left. 
 The thing was gone. 
 [Gasping] 
 I hit myself in the chest. 
 [Panting] 
 [Coughing] 
 And out of my mouth came a big blood clot. 
 [Wheezing] 
 Probably as close as I'll ever come to... 
 Passing away. 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 [Machine beeping] 
 I don't know if she was there to watch over me or to make sure that I was calm. 
 She just looked at me and smiled, and she said... 
 Now do you understand? 
 And I said, understand what? 
 She was gone. 
 As an E.M.T... 
 I know the difference between hallucinations and real. 
 And this was real. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 [Machine beeping rapidly] 
 I do believe something... 
 Was there, and it was there for him... 
 And it had to take him the way it did. 
 Mm, thank you. 
 And all of a sudden, I seen that little girl again. 
 Back in my room, standing next to my bed. 
 Are you lost? 
 What are you doing here? 
 When I walked into the room that morning, I thought he was talking to himself. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Who are you talking to, honey? 
 I'm talking to the little girl. 
 Um, what little girl? 
 No little girl in here. 
 I looked over at the chair, and she was no longer there. 
 There's no little girl in here. 
 Do you see a little girl? 
 As far as I could see, the only thing on that chair was my purse. 
 Baby, check out in the hallway. 
 What? 
 You know, she's gotta be out here somewhere. 
 Okay. 
 [Machine beeping] 
 No, no. There's no little girl. 
 She had disappeared. 
 I didn't see her walk out of the room, so she evidently just vanished. 
 He was not doped up. 
 He was not slurring his words. He was very lucid. 
 Let's worry about you... how are you? 
 A lot better. 
 Yeah? 
 A lot better. 
 We talked a little bit about the little girl. 
 I didn't know why she was there, but she was there for a reason. 
 The next morning when I walked in and I saw the look on his face... 
 The eyes were wide, and he was to the left. 
 He was to the left where the door was, and he had never looked at that door. 
 I started to wonder if something come through the door... 
 To tell him it was time. 
 I grazed his face. 
 And he was ice cold. 
 That's when I realized he was dead. 
 [Sighs] 
 Death showed up. 
 Something showed up. 
 All of a sudden was like, it's time. 
 [Melancholy piano music] 
 The torture and the pain and... 
 Every emotion that you could possibly feel. 
 Was over. 
 The weight was lifted. 
 You could exhale. 
 For the first time, you could exhale. 
 I've been doing hospice for seven years. 
 And I believe that someone comes to get you. 
 Something comes to get you when you pass away. 
 I'm not afraid of it like I was. 
 That day when I was with Darrell. 
 A lot of times I walk away from a death, and I go get in my car... 
 And I cry like a baby. 
 Because I can't take it with me. 
 Hey, there. Thanks for everything. 
 Eventually, my kidneys actually started again... 
 And I was able to... to go home. 
 Yeah. 
 [Laughs] 
 Whew. 
 I was more than glad to have my husband back. 
 I was glad to be anywhere other than the hospital. 
 And we talked about everything that had happened. 
 I was gonna make ribs tonight, actually. 
 Jeannie... 
 That's the girl. 
 Jeannie, it's the girl! 
 It was at that moment I understood. 
 That's when I realized... 
 Who she was. 
 Jeannie, it's the girl! 
 It was at that moment I realized that this was a girl that I'd taken care of, five years before on a 911 call that I had answered. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 She was unconscious, not breathing. 
 I did everything I could to... 
 Save her. 
 [Thunder booming] 
 She had passed away. 
 That was her. 
 Really? 
 That was her in the room. 
 The girl in the hospital room was the same girl that I had taken care of four years before. 
 That little girl that I seen... 
 Was somebody that was there to... 
 Make everything better for me. 
 Kind of like a guardian Angel. 
 Every nurse has a story, that is unexplainable. 
 Something that they've witnessed, something that they've seen, something that they've felt. 
 I know that I saw the Angel of Death. 
 In front of me. 
 I'll swear on a stack of Bibles, I'll take a lie detector, I know it, I know it exists. 
 It's out there. 
 We keep this stuff to ourselves. 
 Because we're risking a lot. 
 People aren't going to pick a hospital where, people are talking about seeing all kinds of weird things happening. 
 Eventually everybody will see that black figure. 
 I know it's going to happen. 
 But it doesn't scare me like it used to. 
 Hopefully somebody will be there again to help me through.
