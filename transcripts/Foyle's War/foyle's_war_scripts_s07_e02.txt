 Ugh! 
 (CROWD CHEERING) 
 Go on! Get him! Get him! 
 Come on! Upper body! 
 Just hit him! 
 What's, what's happening? Sh! 
 That's right! Come on, man! 
 He's gonna kill you! 
 Crowd : Boo! 
 (BOOING AND HISSING) 
 That's enough! 
 One! 
 Two! 
 Three! 
 Four! Get up! 
 Five! 
 Six! 
 Seven! 
 Eight! 
 Nine! 
 The winner! (CHEERING) 
 Morning. 
 Firstly, I'd like to introduce DCS Foyle and thank him for giving us his time at such short notice. 
 This committee has been convened to discuss a rather sensitive matter. 
 The council has received a request from the commanding officer at the American base to introduce a colour bar in Hastings. 
 I thought we should at least listen to a few thoughts on the matter from people like you, who would have to implement it. 
 Major Wesker here is the new liaison officer at the base and he's happy to answer any questions. 
 Gentlemen. Unfortunately, we've had a growing number of incidents between our coloured and white troops. 
 Fighting has broken out in public and it seems to be getting worse now that everyone is itching to get State-side. 
 My commanding officer feels a temporary colour bar could avoid trouble flaring up between the troops like it did at Bamber Bridge a while back. Bamber Bridge? 
 Yes, a brawl between white and coloured soldiers in a local bar... escalated into a full-blown mutiny. 
 Why now? The war in Europe's over, after all. 
 You boys will be going home soon. 
 Not quite. The truth is, we can't use our coloured troops as part of the occupying force in Europe. 
 Heinies don't take too kindly to being bossed around by them. 
 So our coloured boys are killing time till we can free up enough transport to ship them home. 
 They've been here a long time doing nothing, so tensions are rising. 
 How do you see this working, exactly? 
 We could make some of the bars whites only, some coloureds only. 
 We wouldn't restrict our coloured soldiers, just separate them like we do at the base. 
 Well, that's fine, except this isn't America, it's Great Britain, and we don't practise segregation. 
 Quite right, Detective Chief Superintendent. 
 The world would be a boring place if we were all the same. 
 But these are exceptional times, are they not? 
 Which is why, perhaps, it's important to remember what we've been fighting for. 
 Freedom from oppression, wasn't it? 
 Pointless destroying what we're trying to protect, wouldn't you say? 
 Foyle? 
 Cheeky business, this colour bar. 
 But it might be for the best. 
 Just for a few months. Right. 
 Let's uh, mull it over. 
 We can reconvene in a few days. 
 You can make your recommendation then. 
 Radio : This is the eight o'clock news from the BBC... 
 (BABY BAWLING) 
 Here are the sausages. 
 Only one each, remember. Yes. 
 Eggs ready yet? Nearly. 
 (BAWLING) Oh, you hear that? 
 Kept me up all night. 
 (SIGHS) Morning. Morning. 
 Hope she didn't give everyone a sleepless night. She's got colic. 
 Oh, I'm sure nobody heard a thing. 
 There we go. 
 Excuse me. 
 Who'd have thought rationing would get worse AFTER the war. 
 Well, we've gotta keep them poor Germans fed. 
 How's your little girl? 
 She have a bad night? 
 Did you hear her? Just a bit. 
 Weren't that bad. 
 Wasn't that bad? Sounded like she was being tortured or something. 
 If she keeps this up we'll get thrown out, won't we? 
 'Course you won't, don't be silly. 
 Don't listen to Mr Haines here. 
 I don't know why anyone would want to have children. 
 That's not something you'll have to worry about. 
 With your countenance, no woman would have you. 
 Sam? Can I have a word? 
 Of course. Erm... 
 Well, the baby kept Mr Haines awake last night and I think he might say something to Mr Wainwright. 
 I told her to stop worrying about him. 
 He'll be fine once he gets his artificial arm. 
 Lucy... Well, you'd think he was the only person who suffered in the war. 
 He lost an arm! 
 Yeah, I lost a husband. 
 (SIGHS) Don't worry. 
 I'll put in a good word for you. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 I'll be leaving. 
 I'll pay for last night, but you won't be seeing me again. 
 Is something wrong? 
 I didn't realise the kind of people you had here. 
 It's a downright disgrace. 
 What is, exactly? 
 Any establishment that allows loose women and their piccaninnies. 
 Mandy and the baby are gonna put people off. So? 
 Don't want people like that staying here anyway, do you? 
 Well, the way business is, I can't be that choosy. 
 I feel for her, Sam, I do, but... 
 I need every penny I can get or I could lose this place. 
 Adam, she's just been chucked out by her own family. 
 Now you want to chuck her out as well. 
 I thought we were all supposed to be in this together? 
 Isn't that what the war was all about? 
 Mum! 
 I need, I need to talk to you. 
 Mum. 
 Can you lend me some money? 
 For the rent? 
 I promise I'll pay you back. 
 I told you not to come back here. 
 I've got no time for it. 
 Well... Don't, don't you even want to see your granddaughter? 
 You ought never to have kept that baby. 
 Other girls gave them away. 
 You should've waited for Tommy. 
 He'd have seen you all right. 
 What's this got to do with Tommy? 
 Mum! 
 Mum, please! 
 I need milk for the baby! 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 Come on, guys! Let's go! 
 We're goin' home! 
 Don't drop the garbage, boy! 
 Man, I am sick and tired of watching these white boys go home while we stand here clearing the trash. 
 It could be worse. 
 We could still be fighting. 
 You don't wanna get back home to the States? Yeah, sure, I do. 
 Then Gabe. It's been so long, I can't remember the sound of my girl's voice. 
 How long they gonna keep us here? 
 Listen, Paul, it's nearly over. 
 We'll be out of this man's army soon. 
 Let's just keep our heads down, huh? 
 You two. 
 Get back to work. 
 Hey, boy! Get this place cleaned up! 
 We're on the last transport back to the States, Paul. Get used to it. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 How is she? 
 Can I have a peek? Yeah. 
 Hello. 
 Hello! What's that? 
 Thank you. (CHUCKLES) 
 What's that? 
 Do you still see him? The father? 
 No, not really. 
 Does he know he has a daughter? 
 Yeah. 
 But I thought it would be best I didn't see him. Best for him. 
 Well... What's best for you? 
 I can't think about myself. 
 Baby comes first. 
 My mum thinks I've ruined my life. 
 She still hopes that I'll get back with my old boyfriend Tommy. 
 Tommy, Tommy Duggan? 
 He's quite well known round here, he's a boxer. 
 Oh, that's right. 
 He was a conchie, wasn't he? 
 The boxer who wouldn't fight, I remember people talking about it. 
 They sent him away to work on the land. 
 Up in Scotland. 
 He's been writing me letters, and... now they're sending him home again. 
 Does that worry you? 
 Well, he won't like it that I've been with someone. 
 He always thought he owned me. 
 But I never encouraged him. 
 I never wrote back. 
 I ju - I just don't want him causing trouble. 
 Not thinking of getting back in the ring, are you, Jimmy? 
 Things that bad? 
 Tommy! 
 Well, well. 
 You're a sight for sore eyes. 
 Last I heard you was up north. 
 Forestry and land drainage. 
 When'd you get back? 
 I just arrived. 
 I wondered if I'd get my old room back. 
 Yeah. Yeah, if, if you need it. 
 I've missed this. 
 I've missed the smell of the ring. 
 I'd like to fight again. Ooh... 
 I dunno. 
 You'll be out of shape now. 
 It's been a few years. 
 I've never been fitter. 
 You try digging ditches ten hours a day. 
 Well, I've got my hands pretty full down the gym now, you know. 
 New blood. I was your best fighter. 
 The best I ever had. 
 I'll be honest, Tommy. 
 There's some bad feeling about you round here. 
 We lost some good lads overseas. 
 People don't forget that easily. 
 I need to earn a few quid, Jimmy. 
 I'm planning on getting married. 
 Oh? Who's the lucky girl? 
 Mandy, who else? 
 I take it you haven't spoken to her yet? 
 Before you start er, making plans... you should. I will. 
 Don't worry. I've got the ring and everything. 
 Yeah, well. Like I say, you can stay here till you get back on your feet again. 
 That's all I can do for you. 
 Tommy? Mrs Dean. Mandy in? 
 She's...not with us any more, Tommy. 
 She's at the guesthouse on Highcliffe Street. 
 She won't be coming back here. 
 Why's that, then? 
 You'll have to speak to her about that yourself. 
 Maybe YOU can knock some sense into her. 
 Mandy? There's someone here to see you. 
 Mandy. 
 When did you get back? Today. 
 Excuse me, I have to go and prepare supper. 
 Did you get my letters? 
 Yeah, I di - I did. 
 I'm sorry I didn't write more. 
 Wasn't always easy. It's all right. 
 It's not like we're walking out any more. 
 Well, I wanted to, just the same. 
 There wasn't a day you weren't in my thoughts. Things are different now. 
 I'm different. 
 I don't think about you that way. 
 Well, you did once. 
 I went by your house. 
 Got the feeling you and your mum had had a falling out. Yeah. 
 She didn't say why? 
 Said you'd explain. 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 I'm sorry, Tommy. 
 What're you sorry about? 
 I have to see to the baby. 
 There we go. 
 Sh-sh-sh. 
 It's yours? 
 Her name's Catherine. 
 She's... She's beautiful. 
 That's what she is. 
 I was gonna ask you to marry me. 
 What makes you think I'd say yes? 
 You won't get any other offers. 
 Not now. 
 Miss? What's wrong? 
 It's my husband, he's hurt! 
 Well, I'm already late. 
 What's happened, exactly? 
 (COCKS GUN) Don't move. 
 Had a good war, did we? 
 (ENGINE DIES) 
 'I only saw the girl.' 
 Dark hair. I don't think I'd recognise her again. 
 They disappeared into the woods before I could get a decent look. 
 That's what you get for playing the good Samaritan. 
 What is the bloody world coming to? 
 Anything else you remember? 
 She said something about me having a good war. 
 I don't know what she was implying. 
 Listen, as soon as we hear anything we'll let you know, of course. 
 Yes, well. Let's make it sooner rather than later, shall we? 
 Yeah? Sir? Mm-hm? 
 Detective Constable Hadley. 
 Ah, right - I'd just like to take this opportunity to say how much I'm looking forward to working for you. 
 Oh, jolly good. 
 How'd you do? Mm-hm. 
 I erm, I just heard about the stick-up. 
 Anything you need me to do? 
 Well, apart from the obvious, you mean? 
 Of course. Sorry, sir. 
 Ah, no. Beg your pardon. 
 Check with the locals, see if they er, saw or heard anything. Yeah? 
 Sir. 
 I can talk to my CO. 
 You can come back with me to the States. 
 Come and live in America? Mm-hm. 
 I love you, Gabe, you know I do. 
 This is my home. 
 It's where I belong. 
 It seems to me you don't belong anywhere. Not any more. 
 (OBJECTS FALLING OVER) 
 Please, Gabe, you've got to go. 
 Let me see the baby. 
 Just for a minute. If people find out you're the father something might happen to you. 
 I'm sorry, I couldn't bear that. 
 Mandy. 
 I'm not leaving without you and our baby. 
 You do want to be with me, don't you? 
 More than anything. 
 Nobody heard or saw anything. 
 They must've escaped on foot. 
 Uh-huh. Found something, sir? 
 Er, an empty packet of flints. 
 The Yanks use these lighters. Yeah. 
 Hard to get. They only sell them in their PX stores. 
 Mm-hm. Hm. 
 Move it. 
 Bye. Bye. 
 Some locals are saying they won't cooperate with the colour bar if it is passed. 
 And? 
 If we agree to it, people must comply. 
 Must they? If you would issue a warning of some kind. 
 Let people know that it's not a matter of choice. 
 I have to go. 
 And I hope we can count on your support. 
 Well, I'll see you at the meeting. 
 Pint of bitter, please. 
 Sorry. No bitter. 
 What's that, then? 
 I said no bitter. Not for you. 
 Pint of bitter when you're ready, please. Certainly, Mr Foyle. 
 It's for him. Thank you. 
 Do I know you? You don't. 
 I know you. I saw you beat... 
 Eric Hanson. 
 Knock-out in the third, wasn't it? 
 Second. 
 Pity you couldn't be bothered to knock out a few Germans. 
 Boxing's a craft. 
 Killing, that's different. 
 A lot of people think the Nazis has to be stopped. Don't you? 
 Well, put Mr Churchill and Herr Hitler in the ring and let them sort it out themselves. 
 Would've saved a lot of lives that way. Well.. 
 Not if Hitler had... won with a knock-out in the second, it wouldn't. 
 My old man fought in the last war, do you remember that one? 
 The war to end all wars? Yep. 
 When I was three he went into the garden shed and blew his brains out with his old Army rifle. 
 Not long after that they found my mother dead with her head in the oven. 
 All that suffering. 
 And nothing changed. And it will be the same again this time. 
 If men said "No". 
 "I'm not gonna fight, not for anybody". 
 Then people like Hitler wouldn't have an army to do his killing for him, would he? 
 Someone has to draw the line. 
 Thanks for the point. 
 It's a pleasure. 
 Now, it is with some regret that I say this, but... 
 I think we should recommend the colour bar be introduced. 
 I know there is some concern about legality but the feeling is we can get round that in a short time. 
 Does anyone else have any thoughts? 
 Well, I don't want no trouble in my pubs. 
 So it's fine with me. 
 DCS Foyle? 
 You'll have to enforce this. 
 How do you feel? 
 Well, we'd probably agree that the gratitude we owe our American friends is considerable. 
 Many of them died on the Normandy beaches fighting for freedom and protecting these islands in the process. 
 And it's probably a good moment to remind ourselves that not all of them were white. 
 Major Wesker assures us there will be no discrimination, just separation, but it's my opinion that whatever you call it it sets a very shabby precedent. 
 These people are guests in your country and should be treated, at the very least, with respect. 
 Shall we take a vote on it? 
 A show of hands, perhaps? 
 Those in favour of the temporary colour bar? 
 Those against. 
 We recommend to accept the American proposition. 
 Thank you all for your time. 
 Sorry things didn't go your way, Foyle. 
 Well. That's democracy for you. 
 (THUNDER) 
 Mandy! 
 I'm sorry about what I said yesterday. 
 It's just the shock, that's all. 
 I do love you. 
 And I do want to marry you. 
 But I can't take on someone else's child. 
 I just can't do that. 
 If you got the baby adopted I'd feel different. 
 She needs me. 
 She needs a mother. 
 You of all people should know that. 
 I'm sorry, I've got to go. 
 Mandy... 
 (SOBBING) 
 Everything all right. Uh-huh. 
 I know it's none of my business, but I couldn't help overhearing you and that young soldier. 
 Is he the father? 
 Very handsome. 
 And do you...love him? Yes. 
 But I can't see a future, can you? 
 Why not? That's what this ruddy war was all about, wasn't it? 
 A better future for all of us. 
 So... 
 If you love him, REALLY love him... 
 You ought to follow your heart. 
 Why... Why's everyone so against us being together? 
 I mean, who cares about the colour of his skin? 
 I keep thinking...what if... 
 What if something happens to Gabe just cos I'm his wife? 
 I couldn't live with myself. 
 See, things would be simpler with Tommy. I could... give the baby up. 
 Yeah. 
 We could start again. 
 But you don't love Tommy. 
 At least the baby and Gabe would be safe, wouldn't they? 
 You don't want to do anything you... regret. 
 I don't know what to think any more. 
 Tell you what. Lucy's going to the dance tonight. 
 You and I could join her and... cheer ourselves up. 
 I can't. The baby. 
 Mr Haines could keep an eye on her. 
 Mr Haines? 
 Why not? 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 Coat on, Adam. We're going to trip the light fantastic. What? 
 If she wakes, it'll be because she wants her bottle. 
 Come on. Good luck. 
 We'll be back by ten.

 Why doesn't anyone dance with those girls? 
 Oh, the wallflowers? 
 Also dared to be seen with a coloured GI, the white Yanks won't go near 'em now.

 Don't be alarmed, Ma'am. That's just one of our night fighters. 
 When he gets back to the States, we'll give him an injection and it'll turn him white again.

 (CLATTER UNDER WHEELS) 
 You'll live. 
 Thanks. What was very kind of you. 
 Not at all. 
 So they were ALL soldiers? 
 Yeah. 
 And why would they do this? 
 They didn't like me dancing with my girlfriend. 
 She's a local girl. 
 I see. 
 Is that a Black Dog? 
 It is. 
 Do you fish? 
 Yeah. 
 When I was a little boy, I'd fish all day if I could. 
 And you got Lady Caroline. 
 And that's a Ribs Flat. 
 That's right. 
 Hmm. 
 Ooh, and these ones are... ooh. 
 I made those. 
 Yeah. Look at that. 
 Long hackle, small neat head. 
 That's...that's beautiful. 
 Isn't it? 
 You can have those. 
 No! 
 No, no, no. I'll make some more. 
 We should get you back to base. 
 Thank you. 
 We did make it very clear it was in everybody's best interests that the coloured boys stayed away from the local girls. 
 I know, Sir. But I have feelings for the girl, Sir. 
 I'd like your permission to marry her, Sir. 
 (EXHALES) All right. 
 What's this girl's name? 
 Mandy Dean, Sir. And what are you gonna do when you get back home? 
 You gonna take her back down to South Carolina? 
 Inter-racial marriage is illegal in 20 States, Private. 
 We could live in New York, Sir. 
 Really? And do what? 
 I'm a musician, Sir. 
 I know how to earn a livin' 
 All right, listen to me, Kelly. 
 There is no point you making a mistake you are gonna regret for the rest of your life. 
 Request declined. 
 She has a child, Sir. My child. 
 Forget the child. I know it sounds harsh but I'm doing this for your own good, Private. 
 I have seen this too many times. 
 Girls like Miss Dean trap Americans into marrying 'em. 
 She's not like that - 
 Private Kelly, I will arrange a transfer for you as soon as possible. 
 In the meantime, you will NOT see this girl, do I make myself clear? 
 I don't want a transfer, Sir. 
 I wanna get married. 
 And nobody can make that decision for me. 
 Not you, not the army, not nobody. 
 (CHORTLES) 
 Oh, well...she must be something special, this girl. 
 She is, Sir. 
 Very pretty. 
 You know, I'll have to interview her before I sign any papers, as will the Chaplain. 
 There is a mountain of paperwork to get through, and even then, they might still refuse her visa. 
 I'll do whatever it takes, Sir. 
 And so will Mandy. 
 All right, Private. 
 Thank you, Sir. 
 I knew this would happen. 
 This is exactly what I meant. 
 Mandy, I'm gonna be fine. 
 Listen, I'm gonna be fine. 
 Mandy...Mandy... 
 ..I need to know if you'll be my wife. 
 Gabe, I love you more than anything. 
 Of course I'll be your wife. 
 Oh! 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Oh, diggedy damn! 
 OK, OK, first... 
 ..listen, we gotta meet Major Wesker. You could see him today. 
 And we're gonna need a British passport and two copies of your birth certificate. 
 I gotta write an Affidavit of Support, which - A what? 
 An Affidavit of Support, which he's gotta sign - Wait a minute, Gabe. 
 I dunno if I can get my birth certificate. Why's that? 
 Because my mum's got it and she's not talking to me, is she? 
 Relax, relax... 
 Before you know, we're gonna be in New York, and we're gonna get a place in Harlem. 
 Harlem? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Like the Cotton Club an' all that? 
 That's right. 
 Well...are there any white people there? 
 Of course there'll be white people there, Mandy. 
 We'll have all kinds of friends, Mandy. Trust me. 
 Gabe... 
 What? 
 I'm scared. 
 Oh, it's OK to be scared. 
 Sometimes you just gotta close your eyes and jump. 
 We'd better go. You go first. 
 Mandy, we don't need to sneak around no more - Please... 
 ..please, for me. 
 OK. 
 (URGENT BANGING ON DOOR) 
 Where is she? Where's Mandy? 
 She's not here. 
 You're lying. 
 Mandy! Mandy! 
 Mr Duggan, please, you'll disturb our guests. 
 Mandy, I wanna talk to yer! 
 What's all this noise about? 
 Is she up there? 
 No. Now go home and sober up. 
 What's wrong with you, anyway? 
 You should be happy enough you're still in one piece. 
 Mr Duggan, don't make me call the police. 
 She's causing more trouble than it's worth. 
 Tommy Duggan, right? 
 What's it to you? 
 I hear you're a fighter. 
 Wanna make some money? 
 How? 
 Bare knuckle. 
 Go on. 
 At the barracks. 
 We run a book. 
 But keep it under your hat. 
 If our Major finds out, we'll all end up in the can. 
 What do I get? 
 Five pounds. 
 Everything else is mine. 
 Just tell me when and where. 
 I'll let you know. 
 Sir! 
 Hello. 
 Thought you might like these. 
 Good golly. 
 Too much for me. Thought you and the others might like a decent meal. 
 That's very generous. 
 What a catch. 
 See you at seven. 
 Beg your pardon? 
 Well, I can't take your fish and not invite you to share it. 
 There'll be tons for everyone. 
 Very kind. See you at seven. 
 Thank you. 
 Any member of your family ever been in prison? 
 No. 
 Sir. 
 Any member of your family ever been affiliated with or a member of the Communist Party? 
 I don't think so. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 No, Sir. Sorry. Definitely not. 
 OK. 
 And you...genuinely love this man? 
 I do. 
 Are you prepared that you might not be accepted by white people in America? 
 Yes. 
 Or coloured people, for that matter? 
 Yes. 
 And you have the ten pounds for the visa? She has. 
 Good. 
 OK, look, to be sure no coercion is involved in your decision, Miss Dean, you may have to see me again. 
 She'll be glad to, Sir. 
 Wouldn't you, Mandy? 
 Yeah, course. Good. 
 Well, I can see why you wanted to marry her, Kelly. She's, um... 
 ..well, she's very beautiful. 
 Do you have your Affidavit? 
 Sir. 
 Thank you. 
 OK, good. 
 Let me think it over. 
 I'm sorry, Mandy, that's my final word. You have till the weekend. 
 Oh, please... 
 What's going on? 
 She can't pay this week's rent. 
 You don't understand. 
 I need an address so that I can apply for the visa. 
 I'm sorry, I have my own problems. 
 I need to pay my mortgage. 
 Well, then... 
 ..I'll pay Mandy's rent for this week. Sam... 
 Yeah, and I'll pay next week's. 
 I'm trying to run a business here, Sam, not a charity. 
 She has till the weekend. 
 (BALL BOUNCES) 
 You might like sleeping with white trash limey girls, boy, but you better not be doin' it when you get home, or you will get a lot worse than a beating. 
 You'd know all about white trash, wouldn't you, Sergeant? 
 (BALL BOUNCES) 
 Everyone's in the dining room. 
 Food should be ready soon. 
 Can I get you a drink? 
 Please. 
 It'll have to be cider, I'm afraid. 
 Oh, I see. All right. 
 Let me introduce everyone. 
 This is Miss Mandy Dean... 
 Hello. 
 Miss Lucy Jones... 
 How do you do? 
 Mr Foyle. 
 How are you? 
 You two know each other? 
 We do. 
 Mr Larry Haynes. 
 How do you do? 
 Excuse me. 
 What are you doing? 
 Mashing potatoes. 
 With a wooden spoon? 
 I couldn't find the masher. 
 That's because you don't HAVE a masher. 
 There's no need to be snippy with me. 
 To be honest, I'm pretty browned off with you. 
 Threatening to chuck Mandy out like that just doesn't seem like you. 
 That and the fact you haven't turned the oven up. 
 Look at it. It's raw. 
 Well, they're all so hungry, maybe they won't notice. 
 I'm sorry, Sam. I feel awful about the way I treated Mandy. 
 It wasn't my finest hour, I admit that. 
 I'm worried about losing this place. 
 I understand. 
 I've told her she can stay until she gets her visa. 
 How's that? 
 That's wonderful. Thank you. 
 Now, let's bat on before they all faint with hunger. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Don't stand on ceremony. 
 It looks delicious. 
 All Adam's work. 
 No end to his talents. 
 I haven't had a meal like this in an age. 
 Pity you can't feed the 5,000 with it. 
 You should just be thankful for what you have, Mr Haynes. 
 A toast. To Mandy and Gabe. 
 All : Mandy and Gabe. 
 Thank you. 
 It's good to be amongst friends. 
 (DISTANT CHATTER) 
 Thank you, Mr Foyle. It's the tastiest fish I've ever had. 
 And the coffee, Gabe. 
 Haven't had real coffee in an age. 
 It's the least I could do. 
 But I think Mr Foyle's contribution was more impressive. 
 He had to catch those fish. 
 Well, I'm glad he did, that's all I can say. 
 Don't. No, really, not necessary. 
 Where did you lose your arm, Larry, if you don't mind me asking? 
 Normandy. 
 It's a disgrace how long he's been waiting for a prosthetic. 
 Where did you land? 
 Sword. 
 6th Division? 
 That's right. 
 Well... 
 ..you landed first, didn't you? 
 Took quite a hammering. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, if it, erm... 
 ..wasn't for men like you, I don't know quite where we'd be. 
 In a bloody concentration camp, no doubt. 
 Thank you. 
 Baby all right? 
 Hmm. She's fine. 
 Sleeping. 
 You were in Normandy, Gabe. 
 How was it for you? 
 Lost half the company. 
 Well, I guess it's supposed to make the world a better place, huh? 
 Well, let's hope so. 
 Can't get much worse. 
 Still don't know why you want to fight for America. 
 The way they treat coloured people over there. 
 Yeah, I know what you're sayin'. 
 I know a lot of musicians who kept movin' to avoid the draft. 
 They didn't give a damn about the war. 
 Wasn't the Germans kickin' THEIR butt every day. No, Sir. 
 It was their fellow Americans. 
 And as for me, I wanted to go overseas to fight for democracy. 
 Now all we gotta do is fight for it again back home. 
 That's the last of them to bed. 
 Would you like a nightcap? 
 Oh... 
 ..I thought you'd never ask. 
 I...I've got some Empire port somewhere. 
 Miss? 
 Are you all right? 
 Miss? 
 (GUN COCKS) 
 This is the last thing we need now, what with local businesses trying to get back on their feet. 
 You'll have to catch these people, Foyle, as soon as possible. 
 Did they say anything? 
 As a matter of fact, they had the audacity to call me a war profiteer. 
 Ridiculous thing to say. 
 What? 
 You think they're picking on people who've done well out of the war? 
 Well...Hawkins, now you. 
 I wasn't a war profiteer. 
 My factory helped build tanks, for God's sake! 
 And I'd agree. 
 Sir, this conchie called Duggan arrived back in town the same time as these hold-ups started. 
 It might be worth checking out his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. 
 Call Eastbourne and Brighton first, see if they've had similar incidences, would you? 
 Yes, Sir. 
 (TYRES SCREECH) 
 If you think it's bad here, just wait till you get to the States. 
 He will never be able to see his family again. 
 If he does, they will lynch him, and believe me, you do not want that. 
 Back in '33, in my hometown, there was a coloured boy who was accused of seeing a white girl. Just seeing her, that's all. 
 And a mob of about 40 men dragged him out of his house and into a town square... 
 Well... 
 ..word come there was gonna be a lynching, there was practically a stampede to see it. 
 They strung him up to a poplar tree. 
 But before they did, they deprived him of his ears, his fingers, his toes. 
 And this guy's pleading for his life all the time they're torturing him. 
 And then they castrated him. 
 I can still hear his screams like it was yesterday. 
 I've never heard anything like it since. 
 No more thought given to his death than that of a dog. 
 Now, is that what you want for Gabe? 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 (CROWD ROARS) 
 Sergeant? 
 Hey, where you going? 
 One... 
 ..two... 
 ..three... 
 ..four... 
 ..five...six... 
 Come on, get up! 
 ..seven...eight... 
 All right, box. 
 Get outta here, boy. Move! 
 (SHOUTING) 
 Paul! 
 (SHOUTED INSULTS CONTINUE) 
 Kick him! Kick him! 
 Get outta my way! 
 Sarge! 
 Get off me! 
 Get Kelly! 
 Get him! 
 Kelly! 
 You better come back, boy. 
 Kelly, you better come back here, boy. 
 You hear, lover boy? 
 You two, head north. 
 You follow me. 
 Colley. 
 Sir? 
 Go get Major Wesker. 
 We got a real problem here. 
 For Major Wesker. 
 OK. Over there on the right, Sir. 
 So, this is where we found Miss Dean's body. 
 We moved it about an hour ago. 
 Without informing us? 
 Uh, yeah, thought that was best. 
 Technically, this is US soil. 
 Well, technically this soil is irrelevant. 
 The victim was a British civilian. 
 You had no right to move the body. 
 Right, well, with all due respect, Detective, this is not your investigation. 
 Visiting Forces Bill, 1942, Chapter 31, in fact, says it is. 
 Where IS the body? 
 Uh...back in the base. 
 In the sick bay. 
 Get the coroner out here, establish the time of death, will you? 
 Anybody check for...travel paths? 
 Tra...? I'm sorry, I'm not with you. 
 Travel paths. 
 Animals, foxes in particular, pick up evidence - hair, clothing - take it with them. 
 Anybody check for this? 
 Right. Uh, no, none of my men checked the travel paths. 
 Uh...I can see that we should have perhaps waited for you, but we've had quite a busy night here. Our payroll got high jacked last night. 
 Might be the same people that robbed your friend Delmont. 
 Was the body found before or after the robbery? 
 Uh...she was found after, but he could have killed her before. 
 We've arrested Private Gabe Kelly for murder. 
 Has he confessed? 
 No. Maintains he didn't do it. 
 Don't you think you might have been a bit hasty, then? 
 He was the only person in the woods at the time of her death, Detective. 
 Listen, I think she was getting nervous about becoming a GI bride, I could see that. 
 I think she changed her mind, Kelly took it badly and he killed her. 
 Look, I like this kid. 
 But between you and me, the top brass, really, not gonna look much further. 
 A lot of men in this division are from the south. 
 I'm ashamed to say their opinion of the negro is extremely low. 
 This will just reinforce their prejudices and they will want this wrapped up as soon as possible. 
 I went to see the fight. 
 Tommy Duggan was taking on one of our boys. 
 I was...I was a little drunk. 
 And I was happy. Celebratin'. 
 But then there was some trouble. 
 I thought Calhoun was gonna kill me, so... 
 ..I ran into the woods. 
 He'd been looking for an excuse, you know? 
 He didn't like the fact that I was with Mandy and she's white. 
 Was he one of the group that attacked you after the dance? 
 I can't say. 
 Go on. 
 Woke up at first light... 
 ..walked back to the base. 
 They arrested me at the gates. 
 I thought it was cos I'd hit Calhoun. 
 I didn't know what happened up until that point. 
 Were you and she on good terms? 
 She was a little worried about goin' to the States but... 
 ..she just needed time. 
 I didn't kill her, Mr Foyle. 
 I loved her. 
 Coroner's on his way, Sir. 
 Good. 
 You stay here, see what he has to say. I'll send somebody to pick you up. 
 Find out as much as you can about the wages robbery as well, will you? 
 You'll be fine. 
 I can't believe he'd do that. 
 Kill the mother of his own child. 
 Either of you see her last night? 
 No. I didn't see her at all. 
 I thought she was up in her room. 
 She'd asked me to check on the baby, erm...from time to time. 
 She said she needed to talk to someone. I presumed it was Gabe. 
 She seemed...terribly anxious. 
 I was in my room till about ten. 
 Went for a walk. 
 Got back at about 10.30. 
 I did get a glimpse of Mandy. 
 She was walking towards the base, alone, as far as I could see. 
 And are you happy to make a statement to that effect? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Any news about your arm? 
 Not yet. 
 Can't come too soon, I'd imagine. 
 It isn't Gabe. 
 Isn't it? 
 Well, it's obvious, isn't it? 
 It was Tommy Duggan. 
 Why would that be? 
 Tommy killed her in a fit of jealousy, then went to the barracks to fight. 
 Good way to cover any cuts or bruises he might have got during the struggle. 
 I wonder what was so important... 
 ..for her to go out so late and leave the baby like that. 
 Don't you? 
 He started drinking as soon as he heard about Mandy. 
 Oi! Tommy! 
 Tommy! 
 Somebody here to see ya. 
 Come on. Tommy. 
 Mr Foyle wants to ask you a few questions. 
 Oh, she's dead. 
 Yeah. And there are one or two out there think you might well have had something to do with it. 
 Did you see her last night? 
 No. 
 I was at the barracks with a fight. 
 I waited for Calhoun to give me my money and he never showed up. 
 I walked back here. 
 Is it true that she'd changed her mind about going to America? 
 I dunno. 
 She never said anything to me. 
 Do you think I killed her? 
 I didn't. 
 Thank you. OK. Bye. 
 Detective. I didn't expect to see you again so soon. 
 I hoped it might be possible to have a word with your sergeant. 
 Uh...yeah, sure. 
 You organised this fight, is that correct? 
 It's all right, Sergeant. We've got more important things to worry about than your little sideline. 
 I did. 
 Did you see Mr Duggan after the fight? 
 No. Had my hands full. 
 Some men get a little bit out of control, and there was the robbery. 
 I'll take the rap for that. 
 Normally Sergeant would be there to escort the payroll inside. 
 I thought this was about the murder of Mandy Dean? 
 Oh, it is. They could well be connected. Really? 
 In what way? 
 Hmm, I'm not sure. Yet. 
 Thanks for your time, Sergeant. 
 Where can I find the wages driver? 
 Follow me. 
 Too dark to see either of them, is that what you're saying? 
 Yeah, they came up behind me and held a gun to my head. 
 I thought I was a dead man. 
 Did they say anything? 
 Just said to put the box down and then he knocked me out. 
 Mm-hm. 
 The wages are always delivered at the same time? 
 No, it varies. 
 And...that's as much as you can tell me? 
 Yeah. I'm sorry. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Thank you, Private. 
 Detective. 
 Please, come in. 
 Thank you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I'm off duty. You? 
 I'm afraid not. 
 So, is it possible the same people who robbed our payroll killed Mandy Dean? 
 It is. 
 But...you don't think so? 
 Well...I don't know. 
 Whoever it was took a big risk, don't you think? 
 You mean, they knew about the fight? 
 Can't be discounted. 
 Well, seems everyone knew about this fight except me. 
 I would really like to get this cleared up before I ship out. 
 Not that I particularly wanna go home or anything. 
 Kind of enjoyed the war, you know. In many ways, I don't really want it to end. 
 Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to be flippant. 
 I lost friends, but... 
 ..it's just that... 
 ..you know, back home, I was a junior advertising executive, figurin' out ways to get people to buy stuff they don't really need... 
 A nobody. Really. 
 Here, in the army, I... 
 ..I've had men relying on me, I've had responsibilities... 
 Anyway... 
 Can't say I'm looking forward to goin' back home. 
 Becoming nobody again. 
 Being a bit hard on yourself, I'd say. 
 Well, maybe. 
 I did have plans to start my own business. 
 So who knows? Maybe banks will look more favourably on... 
 ..returning veterans. 
 In the meantime, if you could solve this for me, I would greatly appreciate it. 
 Seriously though, I got the top brass breathing down my neck. 
 They wanna put Kelly on trial as soon as possible and... 
 ..I don't think I can stall them much longer. 
 I'm not very good at this. 
 I couldn't stop her crying. 
 Well, you look like a natural to me. 
 Well, it was this abacus that did the trick. 
 I think she might be a mathematician. Do you? 
 I'd love to have kids. Wouldn't you? 
 Lots of them. 
 Enough for a cricket team. 
 Really? 
 I wasn't suggesting that we... that you and I... 
 Give me the baby. 
 You carry on with the supper. 
 Hello, darling. 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 Ooh. 
 Now it's time you told the truth, boy. 
 Otherwise, I swear to God, I'm gonna make sure that daughter of yours never grows up. 
 You don't believe me? 
 I am a soldier. I don't remember how many children I've killed in this war. 
 What's the difference between throwing fire onto a child and throwing a child onto the fire? 
 Do you understand me? 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 Hello? 
 Detective Foyle? 
 Major Wesker here. 
 I have some interesting news. 
 Private Gabe Kelly just confessed. 
 Can I help you? 
 Good morning. I'm Mrs Philips, the Welfare officer, from Hastings Children's department. 
 We're here for the baby. 
 I understand you've confessed. 
 Anything you want to tell me? 
 This is a hanging offence, you do know that? 
 There's still nothing you want to say? 
 Looks like we found our killer. 
 It doesn't concern you the confession might have been forced out of him? 
 If that was the case, he would have told you, wouldn't he? 
 Depends who forced it. 
 Sergeant. 
 I never laid a hand on him, sir. 
 Really? 
 I know you think you can treat men like Kelly the way you do back home but not here. Not on this base, not in my outfit. 
 Do I make myself clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You can go. 
 I will try to get to the bottom of this. 
 If Kelly doesn't retract his confession, then... my hands are tied. 
 Are you Mr Foyle? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, Gabe mentioned you. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Said you were a good man. 
 Who are you? 
 Private Paul Jennings, sir. 
 Mm-hm. 
 We heard Gabe confessed. Is it true? 
 It is. 
 No, you see, that just can't be. 
 He wouldn't touch a hair on Mandy's head. He was nuts about her. 
 We understand she changed her mind about going to America, isn't that right? 
 No, no, no. 
 He was trying to find somewhere for them to live in New York. 
 That's all. 
 Were you at the fight? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And how did all that start? 
 Some guys just started pushing us around. 
 They were mad at us being there, I guess. 
 Normally we wouldn't get past the Snowdrops, you know? 
 It was always whites only. 
 But not this time. No. 
 I swear to you, Mr Foyle, Gabe did not do this. 
 His only crime is to see the best in people. 
 Well, unfortunately, the facts appear to suggest otherwise. 
 Good afternoon. 
 I suppose it's for the best. 
 She couldn't stay here, could she? 
 No. 
 They said it's very nice, this children's home. 
 24 little ones. 
 Most of them under 11. 
 On Sundays they get to read Mee's Encyclopaedia. 
 No. I don't suppose it's ideal. 
 She's not an orphan, Adam. 
 She has her own family, they just don't want her. 
 She needs a... a young married couple to adopt her. 
 Kind-hearted and open-minded. 
 Somebody like us. 
 Except we're not a couple. 
 No. 
 No, we're not. 
 Well, well, well. 
 If it isn't gentleman Jim Corbett. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Where my money? 
 You didn't finish the fight. 
 You owe me. 
 No, I don't. 
 I said, you owe me. 
 Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're a real tough guy. 
 I just wish I had you with me on Omaha beach. Just give me my money! 
 You could have told your grandchildren about it - how on the sand men lay dead, crushed by their own landing craft, or drowned in water red with their friends' blood. 
 Yeah, you should have been there, Tommy. 
 You could have killed a few Krauts for us. 
 But that would have taken guts, something you haven't got. 
 Oh. Just thought I'd put some of Mandy's things away. 
 We could give them to the jumble sale, for the refugees. 
 Think she'd approve. 
 Her family may want them. 
 I doubt that, don't you? 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Mrs Dean, I'm a friend of Mandy's. 
 I was wondering if I could talk to you about her daughter, your granddaughter. 
 Catherine. That's her name. 
 Did you know that? 
 The council have put her in a children's home. 
 Best place for her. 
 She's just a baby. 
 She should be with her own family. 
 Give her to the father. 
 We don't want her. 
 Drinking won't solve anything, lad. 
 It's not gonna change what's happened. 
 Mr Duggan, might I have a word with you? 
 The lady's speaking to you, Tommy. 
 I was wondering, well, hoping really, that you might help Mandy's little girl. 
 In what way? 
 I understand Mrs Dean thinks quite highly of you. 
 You could get her to see sense and give her a loving home. 
 Every child deserves that. 
 Don't you agree? 
 That baby's got nothing to do with me. 
 You loved Mandy. 
 You wanted to marry her. 
 Well, that baby is part of her. 
 I said it's got nothing to do with me. 
 She'll grow up in an orphanage. 
 None of us want that, do we? 
 It's got nothing to do with me. 
 (CHURCH BELL) 
 I'm bowling. 
 I'm bowling, I'm bowling, I'm bowling. 
 Six! 
 Hello! 
 Mind if I have a look at your bat? 
 Hey! Wait a minute! 
 These figures aren't good. We're just covering costs and no more. 
 I just found this in Mandy's room. 
 I didn't know she wore a wig, did you? 
 Said they found it in a disused shed wrapped up in a blanket. 
 Who'd throw away something like that? 
 There aren't enough to go round as it is. 
 Check that, would you? 
 Mr Haines in? 
 Nothing to do with me. 
 I wish it was. 
 And if nobody claims it, I'll have it. 
 Right. 
 I see. 
 Because you've been waiting for yours er, how long? 
 I got measured up months ago. Every time I ask them what's going on, I get 'You have to wait your turn. 
 There's a lot of people in the same boat.' 
 Can I have a look at that, please? 
 Do you mind? 
 Thank you. 
 Invicta? Latin? 
 That means 'invincible'. 
 Right. 
 Er, RWK? 
 No idea. I got it from a Yank. 
 Well, since you lied about losing your arm on the Normandy beaches, it'd be a mistake to assume you're telling the truth about this. 
 What d'you mean? 
 If you'd been there, you'd have known it was 3rd Division who landed first, not the 6th, as you agreed the other night. 
 It was mayhem. 
 Nobody knew what was going on! 
 Invicta is the motto of the RWK, the Royal West Kents and this is the Africa Star. 
 You lost your arm at Alamein, didn't you...Mr Cole? 
 The name's Haines. 
 Well, this arm, serial number 3736 was issued to Private Edward Cole, Royal West Kents, April 2nd. 
 You've been using the name Haines and only wearing this prosthetic during the robberies you've committed in the belief that nobody would suspect an amputee. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 My name is Haines. 
 I've never heard of Edward Cole. 
 An astonishing coincidence then that... his ration book has just been found in your luggage. 
 Sir. There's something else you should see. 
 I'll keep an eye on him, sir. 
 I found it in Mandy's room. 
 Was she his accomplice, do you think? 
 If that were the case, she would be able to pay the rent, wouldn't she? 
 No, it wasn't her. 
 Afternoon, Sam, Mr Foyle? 
 Mrs Cole. 
 This yours? 
 Well, no, it's not looking good, because it looks as if you killed her after she found out that you and your wife had committed the robberies. 
 Right? 
 The men you robbed were all successful businessmen. 
 Is that a coincidence? 
 They made money while our lads were dying. 
 Well, Delmont's factory makes parts for tanks. 
 Where would you have been in the western desert without tanks? 
 What would you know about that? 
 Well, that much. 
 Oh, right. 
 We were on patrol west of the Alamein line. 
 Nobody told us there was minefields out there or what compass bearing we were working on. Nobody told us much. 
 And then the sky lit up. 
 And we thought it was Jerry. 
 And shrapnel was coming down like rain. 
 And in the dark we could hear our Sergeant, a big bear of a man, crying for his mother. 
 And then our 25 pounders opened up. 
 And I stood there... the sky turning red, thinking this is what the end of the world will look like. 
 And in the panic, an order was given to attack a machine gun that had opened up. 
 So we did. 
 And it was our bloody machine gun. 
 Half the platoon was killed. 
 And my mate Alf, he took four bullets in the gut. 
 And I held his hand and I laid him down and he said 'Do something, mate. 
 So something.' 
 And I pretended I don't know what he's talking about. 
 But he was screaming at me, 'Do something.' 
 So I took my gun. 
 And I put it next to his heart. 
 I pulled the trigger. 
 They told me later I fell on a mine. 
 Doctor, he said it was a miracle it was only my arm I lost. 
 But I don't know about that. 
 Because wherever God was that night... 
 ..he wasn't at Alamein. 
 How did you know we were married? 
 I didn't. 
 I could see you were a lot closer than you were pretending to be. 
 How? 
 Little things. 
 The way you knew he takes sugar in his coffee at dinner the other night. 
 Why did you kill her? 
 I liked Mandy. She was good girl. 
 People let her down, that's right, but, it wasn't me. 
 No? No, it was Tommy, her family, this town. 
 They let her down. 
 Your husband thinks the robberies were justified because he was punishing war profiteers. 
 Is that the way you see it? Yes. 
 What kind of a world are our boys coming back to? 
 Same old rules, same old people making all the money. 
 New government, some people seem to think that's all going to change now. 
 It'll be just the same for the toffs. 
 Won't see them down the dole. 
 I've got a husband to look after. 
 He's crippled now. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 Doesn't explain the wages robbery. 
 Robbing rich businessmen is one thing, stealing from soldiers is something else entirely. 
 Not your idea? 
 We didn't kill Mandy and we had no intention of robbing the payroll. 
 We'd never have got involved in anything like that. 
 He blackmailed us into it. 
 Who? 
 Sergeant Calhoun. 
 After Delmont, we thought we'd do one more robbery, then move on. 
 We'd been pushing our luck around here. 
 We didn't expect an army jeep, not on that road. 
 He held a gun to my wife's head. 
 There was nothing I could do about it. 
 And he had a proposition. 
 He'd make sure there was trouble, a brawl, and whilst everyone was distracted, we'd rob the payroll. 
 He said we'd get our fair share. 
 It was simple, really. 
 But we didn't see Mandy that night and that is the God's honest truth. 
 And why would I believe that? 
 She said there was a soldier at the base who could pull some strings, help her and Gabe get permission to marry quickly. 
 But I don't think the favour was gonna come free of charge. 
 And she didn't say who this was? 
 No. But I've got a pretty good idea. 
 Calhoun. Who else? 
 We've got two people at the station who will testify that you set up the wages robbery. Who? 
 That's insulting my intelligence. 
 And there's enough circumstantial evidence to link you to the murder. 
 I didn't kill anybody. 
 It certainly doesn't look like that. 
 Any jury's going to see that you despised this girl because she slept with a black GI. 
 You offered her help in exchange for sexual favours. 
 You strangled her when she refused. 
 You forced Kelly to confess to your crime by threatening him with the thing he cares most about - his daughter. 
 If they don't hang you for it, I will be very surprised. 
 That isn't what happened. 
 What do I care? 
 For the likes of you, it's a fairly satisfactory result. 
 So, if you are going to tell me what did happen, it had better be good. 
 You done with my office? 
 I have. 
 Have you done with Sergeant Calhoun? 
 I have. 
 And you won't be surprised to hear that he is not going to take responsibility for the murder you committed. 
 It was you she came to for help, wasn't it? 
 Wasn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 She was desperate to get in the States. 
 Be part of a family. 
 She was a pretty girl. 
 What's a guy supposed to do? 
 (KNOCKING) 
 What is it? We need to know when the payroll is arriving, the exact time. 
 I'll let you know as soon I can. 
 You just make sure that diversion happens when we need it. 
 What is she doing here? 
 Never mind. 
 Just make sure those guys know what they're doing, all right? 
 Does she know anything? 
 Sergeant, she won't be a problem, all right? 
 Trust me, she won't. 
 Yeah, I strung her along. 
 I took advantage. 
 I had no intention of signing Kelly's affidavit because I knew it couldn't work. 
 I was doing them a favour, really. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Come back to bed. 
 I've got to leave. 
 No, no, you don't. 
 You have to come back to bed. 
 You do what you promised. 
 Give us permission to marry now, right? 
 Well, I will if you... if you come back to bed. 
 I did what you asked. 
 Now you have to stick to your part of the bargain, all right?! 
 Really? And if I don't? 
 Look, I got what I want. 
 Why should I? 
 We just want to be a family. 
 Why can't we do that? 
 Why is everyone trying to stop us? 
 Oh, come on! 
 I heard what you said about the payroll. 
 I'm not stupid. 
 I know what you're gonna do. 
 I'll tell the police. 
 I will. 
 Are you threatening me now? 
 You just make sure that Gabe and I get our fresh start in New York. 
 And she didn't die in the woods, did she? 
 No. 
 No, she didn't. 
 I waited till everyone was on their way to the fight. 
 Smuggled her out. 
 And I dumped her body in the woods. 
 I figured by the time they found her, I'd be long gone. 
 Back home... new life. 
 Well, for someone who doesn't want to be a nobody, we're not gonna forget you in a hurry. 
 I never intended for anyone to die, detective. 
 Really, I didn't. I just wanted something at the end of this, just something for myself. 
 Is that really too much to ask? 
 After all we've been through, I... 
 Is it? 
 We're outta here. Let's go. 
 Gabe, we're shipping out. Let's go! 
 Gabe, come on. We gotta move. 
 Let's go. 
 Here she is. 
 Thanks, Sam. 
 I didn't think I'd see her again. 
 I just happen to know someone with friends in high places. 
 Oh. 
 I'm going now, but don't you worry, I'll be back to take you home as soon as I can. 
 You hear me, Catherine Kelly? 
 Gabe? 
 We gotta go. 
 You take good care of her now. 
 You don't need to do that. 
 I'll take her. 
 Jimmy and his wife will help me look after her until you get back. 
 If that's what you want, of course. 
 OK. 
 I'll come back when I get my discharge. 
 She'll be waiting for you. 
 It's going to be different now, isn't it? The country, I mean. 
 Well, let's hope so. 
 This unit, The British Free Corps? 
 They're disgusting. Nothing. 
 Hitler said there'd be a thousand of us one day. He didn't manage 30. 
 Why don't you move on, hm? 
 Take your equipment with you. 
 I'll have the law onto you. 
 That's council property! Is this?! 
 Why do you agree to see me? To find out why you keep coming back. 
 He's destroying me, my name, all that I've ever stood for. 
 He's going to bring it all crashing down. 
 I may as well tell you now, it's almost certain he'll hang.
