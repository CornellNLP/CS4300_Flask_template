 How was it, Sir? 
 We had 26 revisions to the Police War Instructions A briefing from the regional commissioner's office, "brief" not being the word. 
 Ready to go then? 
 I was ready shortly after we got here, you know. 
 This is Red Leader. 
 Angels 1-5 heading 0-95. 
 I'm right behind you. 
 See if you can keep up, Foyle. 
 Don't want to leave you behind. 
 That's France ahead, Red Leader. 
 Try not to get lost. 
 The trouble with war is committees. 
 And the trouble with committees is people who take an hour to say what you could in a couple of minutes. 
 I had an MTC instructor we called "Chloroform". 
 When he'd finished, there'd be no-one left awake. 
 What did he teach? 
 Road safety. 
 Now you tell me. 
 (CHATTING) 
 Lucky we're not in a hurry. 
 I don't think the Home Guard have anything to do. 
 Can I see your identity cards? 
 This is Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle. 
 Thank you, Sam. I'll look after it. 
 What's going on? 
 We've had reports of a boat landing near St Leonard's. 
 That's all in order, sir. 
 Nothing yet? 
 No, sir. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 What the... 
 Where the heck is he going? 
 Are you up for this? 
 You bet I am! 
 (HORN) 
 (HORN) 
 (SCREECHING TYRES) 
 Wait here. 
 Be careful. 
 The van was privately owned, sir. 
 Registered to a man called... 
 Fred Pierce? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, I recognised him. 
 Burglary and assault, six years ago. 
 Yep, I arrested him. 
 Where was he going, sir? 
 Why didn't he stop? 
 He recognised me and thought I was part of the roadblock. 
 And he panicked. 
 What about? 
 He was carrying a heck of a lot of fuel. Couldn't you smell it? 
 And end up like the Crystal Palace. 
 Really. 
 You'd have thought he'd have used a metal tank, sir. Not barrels. 
 He was also carrying enough petrol coupons to fuel half of Sussex. 
 NNV. 
 Private cars and goods vehicles. 
 Stolen or forged? 
 Where did he get the petrol from, sir? 
 That's the question. 
 In June, the entire south coast became what we call the pink area. 
 You see, we'd learnt from the mistakes of France. 
 The ease with which the invaders were able to collect supplies of fuel. 
 We at the Petroleum Board cut the number of pump sites by 40%. 
 If by any chance the Germans do land in England, they'll find only the very minimum supplies of petrol. 
 There's now only one fuel depot in the immediate area. 
 Here, at Bexhill. 
 The general manager's a man called Michael Bennett. 
 Has he reported any irregularities? 
 We went 3% down last month. 
 But that was down to a leaking underground tank. 
 We're having new tanks built. 
 3%. How much fuel is that? 
 Too much. Fuel supply is of utmost importance to the war effort. 
 I think we should launch an investigation into the procedures at Bexhill. 
 The possibility of that might just frighten them off, do you think? 
 What do you suggest? 
 Perhaps planting somebody in there. 
 Might tell us something. 
 Undercover? 
 As a driver, perhaps. 
 I could have had him, I know I could. 
 He was coming straight at you. 
 He was in my sights. 
 Been in a scrap? 
 I thought it was a just recce. 
 Stray 109. I saved his bacon. 
 Listen to the bloody line shooter! 
 I had a good fix on him then he snatched him out of my teeth. 
 Did you down him? 
 He was limping back in low cloud. 
 You didn't go after him? 
 We were out of fuel. 
 Should have left him to me. 
 I'd have seen to it. 
 I'd be pulling you out of the drink. 
 Like hell! 
 If we could find you. 
 (HORN) 
 Excuse me, chaps. 
 I don't think he's too pleased. 
 That would have been his tenth kill. 
 He'll get his chance. 
 I've missed you, darling. 
 I've been thinking of you every minute. 
 Every time I hear a plane, I jump out of my skin. 
 You don't think Jerry's going to catch me? 
 Will I see you tomorrow at the Flamingo? 
 Eight o'clock. 
 I love you. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Yeah? 
 Tea, sir? 
 Thanks. 
 Is there a problem, sir? 
 Um... 
 Yeah, there is, a bit. 
 Sir, I've just spoken to Freddie Pierce's widow. 
 She couldn't say where he was going. 
 But she did tell me who he was working for. 
 Frank Gannon. 
 No surprise there. 
 Gannon? 
 He owns a club here in Hastings, the Flamingo. Bars and a hotel. Even has a brewery. 
 Is he a racketeer? 
 Calls himself a businessman. 
 Who's it going to be, sir? 
 I've no idea, Milner. 
 It is a problem. 
 What is? 
 We're trying to think who we can put into the Bexhill fuel depot. We're short of men. 
 Yes, I know what you mean. 
 Does it have to be a man? I drove a tractor on my uncle's farm. 
 Even a three-tonner during training. 
 Only on fields, mind. 
 Well... Thank you but I don't... 
 Any racketeer worth his salt would spot a policeman a mile off. 
 No-one would suspect me. 
 She does have a point, sir. 
 I'd be completely invisible! 
 Like a sort of...secret agent. 
 Um... 
 I'll think about it. 
 Let her through. 
 Righto! Thanks. 
 ♪ Sweet Connie ♪ 
 ♪ Sweet Connie, my own ♪ 
 Not now, Sean. 
 Had a bad day? 
 I'm not feeling well. 
 I want to get home and have a bath. 
 Will I see you at the weekend? 
 Are you buying? 
 I don't know about that! 
 On what you earn, you should. 
 20 minutes! 
 Meet you at the gates! 
 Now there's a pretty girl. 
 Keep your eyes off her. 
 She's spoken for. 
 Mr Elliott, I know it should have been with you. 
 But you have to speak to the Petroleum Board. 
 It's all controlled out of London now. 
 Tomorrow. 
 Latest. Goodbye. 
 Ahem. 
 Yes? 
 It's Friday, Mr Bennett. 
 I came for my wages. 
 What are you doing this weekend? 
 Out with the girls, Mr Bennett, to the Flamingo. 
 Dancing, eh? 
 I might go down there myself. 
 I fancy a bit of a dance. 
 I'm meeting my young man. 
 All you young girls! 
 You're all at it, aren't you? 
 I don't know what you mean, Mr Bennett. 
 Come over here. 
 And sign for your wages. 
 Violet! 
 I came for my wages, Mrs Bennett. 
 That's right. 
 It's none of your business. 
 She was just signing for them. 
 Thank you. 
 Miss Davies, I have a letter for the Tanker Tonnage Committee. 
 It has to go out tonight. 
 Can you type it, please? 
 Yes, Mrs Bennett. 
 That's all, thank you! 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Nothing, dear. 
 Quiet tonight. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 Bad week? 
 No, not really. 
 How's the bike? 
 Goes like a dream. 
 It's a death-trap, isn't it? 
 And a Spitfire isn't? 
 I had a bit of a set-to with Rex this morning. 
 Who? 
 Rex Talbot. 
 We were at school together, do you remember? 
 Dark-haired lad, freckles, played conkers. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 We never dreamed we'd end up together in all this. 
 Now he's No.1 in the squadron. 
 In fact, he lives for flying. 
 And you don't? 
 I'd rather be where I am than square-bashing in the army or stuck inside a ship. 
 I hate the waiting, that's all. 
 That's when it can get to you. 
 What was the argument about? 
 A woman? 
 Nothing like that. It's nothing. 
 Rex and me... 
 We look out for each other. 
 Flying a lot? 
 Not at the moment. 
 We're being pulled out of the front line for a week. Give the new blood a chance to come up to scratch. 
 New recruits? 
 Yes, we're no longer alone. 
 Poles, Czechs, Belgians, Free French. 
 They're good chaps, most of them. 
 But not many flying hours. 
 Whereas... 
 You're an old hand. 
 You don't see it. 
 I'm an experienced pilot now. 
 At 22. 
 You talk as if nothing's happened. 
 It's not conkers any more. 
 It's a different world. 
 Rex, Douglas and myself. 
 We're the three oldest. 
 Of course you are. 
 You're the only ones left. 
 Lorry driver's licence. 
 Training board papers. 
 References from the Ipswich depot. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You're to report to a Mr Bennett, depot manager, at ten o'clock. 
 Make contact at least once every 24 hours with Milner. Understood? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I just wanted to say how grateful I am for this chance, sir. 
 And I just want to say, um... please don't let me regret it. 
 No. 
 If you feel yourself at any time to be in any danger, just get out. 
 Can I see your papers, miss? 
 Yes, of course. 
 That's all right. 
 Take it up, Geoff. 
 Very good. 
 This all seems to be in order, Miss... 
 Stewart. 
 I have to say, Ipswich speak very highly of you. 
 They don't say why they're transferring you. 
 I requested it. 
 I want to be near my mother. 
 She's getting on a bit. 
 I see. 
 Do you know the roads? 
 Absolutely. 
 My uncle has a removals firm here. 
 I learned to drive in his vans. 
 Really? What's his name? 
 Rogers. Gary Rogers. 
 Can't say I know him. 
 Well, I'll send you out as...Connie Dewar's mate to learn the route. 
 There are no maps. No signposts. 
 I'll dock your wages for lateness, so you don't want to get lost. 
 Right. 
 Let's get you started. 
 Miss Dewar, I've got a new mate for you. 
 Samantha Stewart, transferred from Ipswich. 
 Hello. 
 Welcome aboard. 
 I want you to take her out. 
 Make sure she memorises the delivery routes by the end of the week. 
 Thinking of replacing me? 
 I'll leave you two together. 
 I look forward to seeing more of you, Miss Stewart. 
 You can drive one of these, can you? 
 I think so. 
 You think so? 
 Well, we'll find out. 
 You can park it for me. 
 Reverse it over there. 
 Thank you, Sergeant. 
 He's not quite as fast as Sam. 
 No. 
 But he doesn't talk as much. 
 Been here before? 
 No, sir. We used to go up to the Cafe Anglais before the war. 
 Harry Roy and his band. 
 Don't think you'd find him playing here. 
 Frank Gannon? 
 Upstairs. 
 Thank you. 
 It's a pleasure to see you, Mr Foyle. 
 How's tricks? 
 Frederick Pierce. You know him? 
 I know Freddie. 
 Of course I do. 
 He runs errands for me. 
 I hope he's not in any trouble. 
 Well, he's not. He's dead. 
 You don't say. 
 He failed to stop at a roadblock. 
 Lost control of the van and died. 
 Well... I'm flabbergasted. 
 Poor old Freddie. 
 Um... I don't know what to say. 
 Where did this happen? 
 Channel View Road. 
 Channel View? 
 Outside of town. I can't imagine what he was doing there. 
 Nothing to do with me. 
 He was carrying petrol. 
 Petrol. I know what you're thinking, Mr Foyle. 
 We've had our run-ins, but I'm a businessman now. 
 Hotels, pubs, the club. 
 I've grown up, moved on. 
 Learnt the error of my ways. 
 You've never been offered petrol from illegal sources? 
 Of course I have. Who hasn't? 
 But I'm not paying six shillings a gallon. It's not just money, is it? 
 I wouldn't touch it. 
 I'm a patriot. 
 He was laughing at us, sir. 
 Nothing we can do. 
 We could search the premises. 
 Waste of time. I don't think he'd keep anything there. 
 No, it's best if we start the other end. With the suppliers. 
 They might just lead us back to him. 
 Yes, sir. Let's hope Sam comes up with something soon. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We may have to bring our plans forward a few days, Mr O'Halloran. 
 A few days? 
 We want to be sure you're ready. 
 I'm ready. I'm fine. 
 Just waiting for the word. 
 Do you have it? 
 Do you want to see it? 
 It's right here. 
 Don't worry, Mr Carter. 
 It's sleeping like a baby. 
 Won't wake up till it hears the alarm. 
 And then? 
 It'll wake up most of Bexhill too. 
 Settling in, Miss Stewart? 
 Pretty well, I think, sir. 
 I'd say I'm ready to go out on my own. 
 I think I'll be the judge of that, thank you. 
 We don't let just anyone drive out of here with 500 gallons of fuel. 
 Do carry on. 
 You have a lot of women drivers. 
 When I was a boy, you never saw women doing work like this. 
 The war's changed everything. 
 It must seem very strange. 
 Oh, no, I approve. 
 Sam! 
 Remember me? I'm Andrew Foyle. 
 You two know each other? 
 Yes. 
 We stepped out together. 
 What? 
 I was at my uncle's removals firm. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 You're not authorised. 
 Actually, I brought a requisition slip. 
 There it is. 
 That's still against procedure. 
 Good morning to you, Mr Bennett. 
 Don't tell anyone who I am. 
 Why? 
 You're not working undercover, are you? 
 What's so funny about that? 
 Oh, well, nothing. 
 Look, I can't tell you anything. 
 Except that someone's stealing petrol. Lots of it. 
 And I'm here to have a nose around. 
 My father put you in here? 
 I volunteered. 
 I won't say a word. 
 You can give my bike a wash while you're at it. 
 Andrew! What are you doing here? 
 Aren't you pleased to see me? 
 Of course I am. Of course I am. 
 Don't say that. 
 I brought over some paperwork. 
 Make me a cup of tea before I go, will you? 
 All right. Mr Bennett told me you two know each other. 
 Yes. She was my best girl. 
 When? 
 Oh, it was a long time ago. 
 It's all over now. Isn't it, Sam? 
 Totally. 
 Do you want to come dancing? 
 I've got a 12-hour pass. Love to. 
 This is a big order. Why was it brought in by a pilot officer? 
 Don't ask me. Anyway, it's got nothing to do with you. 
 It's just that it's hush-hush, isn't it? 
 What? 
 This information. 
 With all these extra supplies, there must be a big operation coming up. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Yep? 
 Sam, how are you getting on? 
 I'm fitting in, sir. 
 You really look the part. 
 Tell me about the others. 
 I have to say they seem a nice bunch. 
 I don't like having to spy on them. 
 I don't think any are involved. 
 What makes you think that? 
 You have to understand the system. 
 It does seem pretty above board. 
 Go on. 
 No fuel goes out without a requisition order from the customer. 
 Requisition orders are brought in by dispatch riders. 
 The depot is serving army and air bases, hospitals, the fire service, commercial garages. Just about everyone. 
 Mrs Bennett takes delivery. 
 She does the office work and checks the administration. 
 Her husband, Michael Bennett, oversees movement of fuel. 
 He's the one in charge. 
 Bennett is there when the tankers are filled to check the figures. 
 The main tanks have gauges which show exactly how much fuel has been taken. 
 And there are gauges on the tankers too. 
 Bennett gets the driver to sign, so no-one can argue about how much has gone. 
 There are about 20 deliveries a day and the process is always the same. 
 When the fuel reaches the delivery point, the same thing happens again. 
 The customer has a copy of his original requisition order and signs for the fuel he receives. 
 Very simple. 
 At the end of the day, all the signed paperwork is kept in a safe in the office. 
 It's checked once a month by the Petroleum Board. 
 I've been thinking, sir. 
 Bennett couldn't possibly be stealing fuel. 
 He'd have to have the driver on his side. 
 And then the customer at the other end too. 
 And his wife would have to know too. 
 But there's still 3% missing. 
 Puts it down to a leak in the pipes. 
 So, you're getting on with the other drivers? 
 Yes. They're taking me out tonight. 
 Really? Where are you going? 
 There's a club they all go to. 
 The Flamingo. 
 Oh, right. Well, have a nice time. 
 Be in touch with Milner tomorrow. 
 Don't do anything daft. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Oh, I forgot to mention I met your son. 
 At the depot? 
 Yes. 
 Did he recognise you? 
 Yes, but he didn't say anything. 
 What was he doing there? 
 He didn't say. 
 Oh. 
 I'll ask him. 
 This is very kind of you, sir. 
 Not at all. 
 Andrew's talked about you. 
 I thought it was about time we met. 
 We already have, sir. 
 Well, yes. 
 I have a confession to make. I kicked a ball through your window. 
 Oh, right. 
 Well, you got the blame for that. 
 Not the detective you think you are, Dad. 
 Rex volunteered straight from school. He's been here six months. 
 Five. 
 I had a month off. 
 I joined the Caterpillar Club, sir. 
 He got shot down and had to use a 'chute. 
 Messerschmitt got the better of me. 
 I should have been there. 
 I was 12,000 feet up. 
 Lucky I had my hood open. 
 Out of control. 
 Spinning round all over the place. 
 I was more or less sucked out of the cockpit. 
 Got the parachute open and the next thing... Splosh! 
 In the sea off the coast of France. 
 How did you get back? 
 Picked up by a fishing boat. 
 But I was bust up. 
 Month in hospital. Andrew here was usurping my No.1 place in the squadron. 
 Hardly! 
 That looks better than mess food. 
 I'll say! 
 Passes out a bit of a rarity? 
 Not too bad. I've got a 12-hour. 
 Taking my girl out tonight. 
 Are you coming? 
 You and Violet? 
 Violet? 
 Yep. She's just a friend, Dad. 
 Doesn't work at the fuel depot by any chance, does she? 
 Haven't spoken out of turn, have I? 
 No. 
 Not at all. 
 No secrets between Andrew and me. 
 Are there, son? 
 Tell me, Connie, how did you become a tanker driver? 
 You don't want to know. 
 I do. I'm interested. 
 There's not much to tell. 
 I left school when I was 16. 
 Got a job over at Bristol. 
 Waxing the inside of barrels. 
 It was bloody horrible. 
 13 hours a day, two quid a week. 
 And then I had to help load up the bogeys. Not much fun. 
 Bogeys? 
 Trucks. 
 I thought you worked in a removals firm. 
 Yes, that's right. 
 So then what happened? 
 A driver got sick, and I persuaded the boss to let me take his place. 
 As soon as I was trained, I scarpered over here. 
 Got any spare stockings? 
 You've got to be kidding. 
 Here. Help yourself. 
 What is it? 
 Stockings in a bottle. 
 What will they think of next? 
 Help yourself to lipstick, Sam. 
 Thanks. 
 Wait till those pilots see you! 
 Make sure you find one of your own. 
 How long have you and Andrew been going steady? 
 Long enough. 
 He and Vi are getting married as soon as the war's over. 
 Really? 
 A double wedding. 
 Him and Vi and Rex and me. 
 And we'll have a fly-past. 
 Wow. 
 It will be lovely. 
 All right. 
 I'm ready. 
 Ooh. 
 Connie, are you all right? 
 Yes. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm just tired. 
 See a quack. 
 You've been like this all week. 
 I'm fine. Come on, Vi. 
 We're going to be late. 
 Sorry about lunch. Didn't mean to blab about you and Vi. 
 Fools rush in. 
 I knew I shouldn't have invited you. 
 Vi's a corker. 
 You keep your hands off her! 
 Come on, tail-end Charlies! 
 Sir! 
 Heading into Hastings? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Don't do anything that involves alcohol, loose women or dancing. 
 How about all three, sir? 
 That's perfectly all right. 
 Maybe tonight's your night, Douglas. About time, huh? 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 (MUSIC AND CHATTER) 
 No? 
 Two left feet. 
 Really? 
 Things are looking up, girls. 
 Look who's arrived! 
 You look ravishing. 
 Is that all? 
 Delightful. 
 Delicious. Delovely. 
 Why don't you ever say nice things like that to me? 
 Mm? 
 I don't think we've met. 
 Sam Stewart. 
 Douglas Wright. 
 Can I buy you a drink? 
 I already have one. 
 Then why don't you buy me one and I can join you? 
 Brylcreem boys! 
 Rex, darling, come and dance with me. 
 Shall we go and dance? 
 I'll have a pint. 
 OK! 
 How about that drink? 
 Come on. 
 A good night. 
 Could get livelier. 
 Tell him to keep it this way. 
 They'll drink more. 
 Now here's a face I haven't seen before. 
 I'm Sean O'Halloran. How do you do? 
 Hello. I'm Samantha Stewart. 
 I've seen you. 
 You have? 
 Building the new tanks. 
 Me and my boys. 
 I heard you were losing fuel. 
 Something to do with leaky pipes. 
 Where did you hear that? 
 I don't know. 
 Mr Bennett, I suppose. 
 How long have you been at Bexhill? 
 I'm in and out. 
 Where do you come from? 
 Ireland originally, of course. 
 From Tullamore in County Offaly. 
 Beautiful. 
 It is. 
 Why do you want to know? 
 I'm just interested. 
 You seem to be interested in a lot of things. 
 When do you have to be back tonight? 
 Not till later. 
 Why don't we go back to my flat? 
 What about Violet? 
 We drew straws. 
 I have you all to myself for once. 
 Just you and me. 
 I'll... 
 I'll go and get some more drinks. 
 Were you going to tell me about her? 
 Who? 
 Sam Stewart. 
 When did you know her? 
 Ages ago. 
 You're not jealous, are you? 
 So what are you doing tonight? 
 What? 
 Later? 
 I wondered if you were going to invite me home. 
 That may not be so easy. 
 I promised Connie I'd give her the run of the flat. 
 You live in Hastings. 
 Not alone, I'm afraid. 
 What about a hotel? 
 You were at Ipswich? 
 Yes. 
 How long were you there? 
 Couple of months. 
 Let me tell you. 
 There's something about working with fuel. 
 It gets under your skin. 
 Under your nails. 
 You can scrub all you like. 
 But in the end, it's part of you. 
 Why don't you have driver's hands? 
 Gloves. 
 You have a lot of curiosity in you. 
 Let go. You're hurting my wrist. 
 What's happening here? 
 Mr Foyle, isn't it? 
 Was he hurting you? 
 I'm fine. 
 Why don't you get the hell out of here, O'Halloran? 
 I thought this place was open to everyone. 
 We don't want you here. 
 You or your mates. 
 Bog-dwellers. 
 You think you're too good for us, do you? 
 We're fighting. You're getting rich watching from the side! 
 It's all right. 
 Andrew, what's going on? 
 Why don't you get out of here? 
 Make me. 
 Maybe I will. 
 I'm waiting. 
 Rex, please! 
 Sorry. Look after this. 
 Not again! 
 (CRYING) 
 (SCREECHING TYRES) 
 Right, you lot! Come on, then! 
 (CRYING) 
 So, what do you have to say for yourself? 
 I didn't start it, sir. 
 Not what I heard. 
 I may be wrong, Foyle, but we're fighting Germans, not Irish. 
 Everyone knows whose side they're really on. 
 Last time I saw the papers, they were neutral. 
 U-boat crews can walk into Eire, buy cigarettes. 
 That is total nonsense. 
 How many ships have we lost in the Atlantic? 
 The fact that we can't use bases on the south and west coast of Ireland is a disaster. 
 Even Mr Churchill has said as much. 
 Go on. 
 We're protecting the Irish. 
 If it wasn't for our convoys, they'd have no food. 
 They've given us nothing in return, and they don't care who wins. 
 Really? How do you square that with the thousands of Irishmen now fighting for Britain? 
 O'Halloran isn't one of them. 
 Merchant marines, the Royal Navy. 
 Irish volunteers out there facing the U-boats while you snipe at them and their country. 
 I was just - 
 Listen to me. We need Irish labour. 
 With manpower shortages the way they are, we couldn't manage otherwise. 
 Whatever your views, your performance was deplorable, to say the least. 
 Sorry, sir. 
 Now get out. If you weren't such a damn good pilot, you, Talbot and Wright, I'd put you on a charge. 
 Sir. 
 I have something on the man who approached Sam at the Flamingo. 
 Sean O'Halloran, from Tullamore in County Offaly. 
 He's been at the depot for six months. 
 He and his men are meant to be protecting the fuel tanks from bomb blast. 
 Has he got a record? 
 No. But Special Branch interviewed him twice last year. 
 Once in London on 28th July, and then again in Coventry at the end of August. 
 Coventry. August. There was a bomb. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Killed five people, injured twelve more. 
 Went off in a busy marketplace. 
 A bomb also went off in London. 
 The left-luggage office at King's Cross station. 
 One man killed, 14 injured. 
 Are you telling me he's IRA? 
 Nothing was ever proven. 
 He was released both times. 
 What happened with this fight at the club, exactly? 
 It was started by your son, sir. 
 Oh. 
 Sam is adamant that he came to her defence. 
 Right. 
 Should we tell Sam about O'Halloran? 
 No, wouldn't help. 
 She's far too imaginative. 
 But any more trouble, get her out. 
 Yes, sir. 
 And I will not have my girls, any of my girls, involved in bar room brawls. 
 Do you understand that? 
 I wasn't actually involved. 
 You were there. 
 There were quite a few of us there, really. 
 Have you memorised the routes? 
 Yes. I think so. 
 Good. 
 This is your last day with Connie. 
 Tomorrow, you can take the tanker out on your own. 
 What are you looking at? 
 Nothing, Mrs Bennett. 
 You can go. 
 I don't like that girl. 
 You don't like any of the girls. 
 Is it any wonder? 
 My girls! 
 Why do you call them that? 
 What is the matter with you? 
 I had to bend the rules to let you work here, you know. 
 What else could I do? The WVS? 
 The knitting circle? 
 I do what you tell me to do. 
 It's all I've ever done. 
 And I can't stand it. 
 I don't understand you. 
 What was it about? 
 I've already been carpeted. 
 I don't like fighting. 
 Nor do I. 
 Well, you didn't show it. 
 Connie's not talking to Rex. 
 So you're not going to forgive me either? 
 Why should I? 
 Because you know I'm crazy about you. 
 Are you? You haven't even taken me home with you yet. 
 I can't take you home. 
 I live with my father. 
 Can't I meet him? 
 You don't want to meet him. 
 Why not? What's wrong with him? 
 Nothing. But... 
 Do you want to come out for a snifter tonight? 
 We could go back to the Flamingo and... 
 I thought you'd all been banned. 
 We're their best customers! 
 Most of the time. 
 You're not having me on, are you, Andrew? 
 We'll be together after the war? 
 Of course we will. 
 Mr Bennett said I can go out on my own tomorrow. 
 Bully for you. 
 You're not still upset about last night, are you? 
 How long have you and Rex been together? 
 I don't want to talk about him. 
 Connie, it wasn't his fault. 
 It was Andrew. 
 He got involved because of me. 
 Bloody Andrew Foyle. 
 He's Rex's best friend, did you know that? 
 No. 
 He had to come rushing in like the knight in shining armour, didn't he? 
 You said you walked out with him. 
 Yes, a long time ago. 
 Before he met Rex? 
 Why do you want to know? 
 Pilots. They're all liars. 
 They don't care about anybody except themselves. 
 Connie. 
 That's it. 300 gallons. 
 Hang on. There's something wrong. 
 What? 
 Look at the gauge. 
 200 gallons left in the tank. 
 We're empty. 
 Sometimes it gets stuck. 
 I can drop you off, if you like. 
 What? 
 Get off early. 
 There's no need to come all the way back to Bexhill. 
 Don't I have to sign myself out? 
 I'll do that for you. 
 Nobody ever checks. 
 I'm doing you a favour, Sam. 
 There's no need to thank me. 
 You can get a bus. 
 Connie! 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 How are you, Connie? 
 Just get on with it, Carter. 
 What's wrong with you all of a sudden? Are you all right? 
 I'm sick of you and the whole thing. 
 I've got a message. 
 We're doubling our order. 
 What? You've got to be kidding. 
 Someone will notice! 
 We may have to move on, so we're making the most of it. 
 You're not usually moody. 
 I wish I'd never started with this. 
 I should never have got involved. 
 But you are involved, Connie. 
 You'll be leaving the depot soon. 
 Start again. 
 What if I don't want to? 
 I'd be very careful what you say, if I was you. 
 You're in. 
 Getting out isn't so easy. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 Never said a word. 
 You tell him from me, I'm not going anywhere. 
 If he doesn't like it, there are stories I could tell. 
 That is a threat. 
 Now let's get this stuff unloaded. 
 She was lying. There were 200 gallons left. I saw the gauge. 
 What time was it? 
 Half past four. 
 See? I made a note of the times of the deliveries. 
 And where was this? 
 She dropped me at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere. 
 I think she went into the woods to transfer to another tanker. 
 Or a lorry. 
 Could have gone into Frank Gannon's barrels. 
 That would be frightfully dangerous. 
 Where was the delivery made? 
 The works at Silverfield. 
 They requisition it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Then they should have received a specific quantity. 
 The same quantity that left Bexhill. 
 If she held 200 gallons, why wasn't it noticed? 
 Perhaps they are involved in it too. 
 Could there be a link between Bennett and Gannon? 
 Quite possibly. 
 If only there was something more I could do. 
 What?! 
 There's no doubt. You're pregnant. 
 Did you really have no idea? 
 No. 
 I haven't been feeling well, but... 
 How was I to know? 
 Well... 
 I take it you're unmarried. 
 Of course I'm unmarried. 
 How many months? 
 You're about four months pregnant, Miss Dewar. 
 The father? 
 What about him? 
 Are you still seeing him? 
 I see him all the time. 
 You'll have to tell him. 
 Of course I'll tell him. 
 Is he in a position to... 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know what he's going to say. 
 Oh, Lord! 
 Your officer is still working inside the Bexhill depot? 
 Yes. 
 A Miss Stewart, as I recall. 
 Mm-hm. 
 That was the name on her papers. 
 Has she found anything amiss? 
 As a matter of fact, yes. 
 There are links between the depot and a well-known crook. 
 (CRYING) 
 Come on, Connie. 
 You tell me all about it. 
 Take your time. 
 He has the resources to move petrol on a large scale. 
 At least one driver is involved. 
 Oh. I'm afraid from what you say, Mr Foyle, this is not just a police matter. 
 I'll have to order an immediate audit. 
 Which would mean what? 
 Closing down Bexhill completely. 
 Going over every fuel movement of the past 12 months at least. 
 If you move in before we make arrests, we won't hear the last of it. There are other depots. It won't stop. 
 Another 48 hours. 
 Thank you. 
 What do you want? 
 A pint of best, if you don't mind. 
 Maybe I do. What makes you think you're welcome? 
 Jack, you're not going to let a scrap spoil a friendship, are you? 
 What friendship? 
 
 
 
 Here's Connie! 
 Connie! 
 Where have you been? 
 I've been looking for you! 
 Are you all right? 
 Am I all right? 
 (SOBS) No, Rex. I'm not all right! 
 You've been drinking. 
 Get away from me! 
 I don't want to see you! 
 What is it? 
 Someone should take her home. 
 I will. 
 No, I'm not going with you. 
 Darling! 
 Don't call me that! 
 I'm tired of it! 
 I'm tired of it all! 
 Being used, being pushed around. 
 I've had enough! 
 I know something. 
 Do you know what I know? 
 I've got a little secret! 
 Maybe it's time I started sharing it around! 
 I'll see her home. 
 Andrew. 
 Come on, Vi. She won't go with Rex. 
 I know what you want! 
 I don't want anything. 
 I think you should be in bed. 
 Go on. 
 Come on, Connie. 
 (SOBS) 
 It's all right. 
 I'm going to tell! 
 I'm going to tell everyone! 
 You upset her, that night. 
 A romantic evening turned into a punch-up. 
 Bloody Foyle's fault. 
 Language! 
 Sorry. 
 We shouldn't have come here. 
 You don't want to stay? 
 No. I don't. 
 Right! 
 Well, thanks a lot, boys. 
 Another lovely evening. 
 Thank you, Andrew. 
 Are you feeling any better? 
 I just want to go to bed. 
 Shall I come in? 
 No. I'll be all right. 
 I'll just see you in. 
 All right? 
 Miss Dewar not here yet? 
 No, Mr Bennett. 
 She's late. Where is she? 
 I don't know sir. 
 She had a skinful last night. 
 I doubt you'll see her today. 
 Do you know where she lives? 
 Yes. 
 Take my car. 
 Go round and collect her. 
 Don't let her tell you she's not well enough to work. 
 Don't come back without her. 
 Right, sir. 
 Connie! 
 (DOORBELL) 
 Connie! 
 Her neck is broken, sir. 
 Could have fallen. 
 What do you think? 
 She'd been drinking. 
 Yes, sir. But look. 
 Bruises. Some sort of fight. 
 Maybe. 
 If she was involved in this petrol racket, perhaps she fell out with her employers. 
 Maybe. 
 What a waste. 
 Her room's up here? 
 Yes, sir. Top of the stairs. 
 Connie shared with a girl called Violet Davies. 
 She also works at the Bexhill depot. 
 Violet Davies. 
 Well, well, well. 
 Sir? 
 Which bed is which? 
 This is Connie Dewar. 
 Boyfriend? 
 I'll find out who it is. 
 I know who it is. 
 Sir? 
 This is a friend of Andrew's. 
 Rex Talbot. 
 Really. 
 Who else is in the building? 
 The landlady is a Mrs Sutton. 
 She's away at the moment. 
 This is an odd thing to have on your dressing table. Bicarbonate of soda. 
 My wife's taking that. 
 Ask her about it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Wouldn't you know it? 
 I've got her diary here. 
 Is it murder, sir? 
 Looks like it. 
 You don't think she could have thrown herself down the stairs? 
 Why? 
 She was so miserable yesterday. 
 Was she? 
 It was to do with Rex. 
 This pilot she was seeing. 
 She got very angry with him for getting involved in a fight. 
 No, it wasn't suicide. 
 This is about petrol, isn't it, sir? 
 Maybe. 
 You're sure it was Rex Talbot she was seeing? 
 Yes. 
 What about the other girl? 
 Violet? 
 Was she seeing anyone? 
 I don't really know. 
 You don't really know? 
 Well, er... 
 For God's sake, tell the truth! 
 Do you think I'm an idiot? 
 Really! Don't keep anything from me just because it involves my son. 
 She was seeing Andrew, wasn't she? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Why didn't you tell me before? 
 I didn't want to say. 
 I know he's not involved in this. 
 Of course he is. It's murder. So nobody is protected. Not even him. 
 You understand? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'm sorry. This must be very difficult for you, Miss Davies. 
 Connie was a good friend to me. 
 We looked after each other. 
 How long had you shared a room? 
 Since the start of the year. 
 We joined the depot at about the same time. 
 We took a liking to each other. 
 Were you close? 
 Yes. 
 After Connie met Rex, she didn't confide in me as much as she used to. 
 She was so in love with him. 
 But... 
 I sometimes thought he upset her. 
 Like the other night. 
 The stupid fight. It had to be O'Halloran. He's trouble. 
 Connie had been looking forward to that evening. 
 It shouldn't have had to end like that. 
 This is Mr Foyle. 
 Hello. 
 How long had she and Rex been walking out? 
 A long time. 
 They hit it off right from the start. 
 Six... Seven months. 
 Was he her only boyfriend? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, she was in love with him. 
 She wasn't seeing anybody else? 
 No. 
 Well, maybe. I don't know. 
 Tell us what happened last night. 
 Connie had been drinking. 
 She was upset. 
 She said something that was very strange. 
 What was that? 
 She said she was tired of being used. 
 And that she knew something. 
 She said she had a secret. 
 She was talking to you? 
 No. 
 She was in such a state, she could have been talking to anyone. 
 Anyway, after that, she went home. 
 And that was the last time I saw her. 
 You weren't at home last night? 
 No. 
 I was at a hotel. 
 I was with my boyfriend. 
 Look, I'm not that sort of a girl. 
 We've never done that sort of thing before. 
 But he's more than a boyfriend. 
 He's my fiance. 
 We're going to get married. 
 You left together? 
 Yes. 
 He drove Connie home first and then came back for me. 
 We left at about ten. 
 His name is Andrew Foyle. 
 He's the most wonderful man I've ever met... 
 Foyle. 
 He's got the same name as you. 
 Mm. 
 That's because...I'm his father. 
 I understand this puts you in a difficult position, sir. 
 That's a bloody understatement. 
 I'm sure Andrew is above suspicion. 
 Is he? He's not above mine. 
 Mr Bennett, sir. 
 Those men that were just here. 
 The police. 
 What happened? 
 You haven't heard? 
 Connie Dewar was killed last night. 
 Someone pushed her down the stairs. 
 It's terrible, I know. 
 It beggars belief. 
 I don't know what the Board's going to make of this! 
 Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle, it's a pleasure to meet you. 
 You must be very proud of your son. 
 He's a credit to you. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm here, I'm afraid, in an official capacity. 
 And that is? 
 A young woman has been found dead. 
 She used to deliver fuel here. 
 Connie Dewar. 
 The name doesn't mean anything to me. 
 No? She may well have been involved in some way with two of your pilots. 
 One of them being my son. 
 I see. And the other? 
 Rex Talbot. 
 And you've come here... 
 What, to interrogate them? 
 To speak to them, with your permission. 
 Well, I'm not sure I like the idea. 
 I'm sorry. How did she die? 
 She was murdered. She was pushed down a flight of stairs and she broke her neck. 
 It couldn't have been an accident? 
 No. Indications suggest otherwise. 
 Indications. 
 The morale of my men is my first and only concern in this matter. 
 As I'm sure you're aware, we've sustained enormous losses. 
 They may not show it, but they're living on a knife-edge. 
 Your throwing a barrage of questions at my two best pilots could be the last thing we need. 
 I quite understand that. I'm not eager to discuss this with my son. 
 I'd rather not be here at all. 
 But the girl is dead. 
 We need to know how and why. 
 I'm here as a courtesy. 
 I could arrange for them to be taken to the station. 
 No. 
 Of course you can see them here. 
 I just wanted to be sure you appreciated the situation. 
 I do. 
 Mr Foyle! Sir, this is a surprise. 
 You're the last person I expected to see. 
 Rex, I'm afraid I've got some rather bad news. 
 I understand you know a young woman called Connie Dewar. 
 Nothing's happened, has it? 
 Is she all right? 
 I'm afraid she's dead. 
 I'm sorry. 
 How? 
 She fell and broke her neck. 
 It could have been an accident. 
 Could have been? 
 She may have been involved in a struggle. 
 Have you spoken to Violet? 
 They live together. 
 She must have seen what happened. 
 Violet... wasn't there. 
 When was the last time you saw Connie? 
 At the Flamingo. 
 She wasn't very pleased with me. 
 We had an argument a few nights ago. 
 Stupid, really. There's a lot of bad feeling about the Irish here, but it shouldn't have happened. 
 Then last night... 
 I didn't expect to see her there. 
 She came down from the office. 
 She'd been drinking. 
 She wouldn't come with me, so Andrew took her home. 
 Does he know? 
 I've not spoken to him yet. 
 Poor Connie. 
 Poor girl. 
 God, what a waste! 
 How close were you? 
 Had you talked of getting married? 
 Sometimes, yes. 
 But these aren't the right times. 
 We took it one day at a time, really. 
 I loved her. 
 Connie was loyal. 
 Funny. 
 She was wonderful. 
 Did she ever mention her work at the depot? 
 Not really. 
 Day-to-day stuff. 
 She seemed very happy there. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 Huh. My RAF friends are buying it every day. 
 You never know who's going to be next. 
 But Connie... 
 I can't believe it. I suppose that means you're here officially. 
 Have you told Rex? 
 I've just seen him. 
 Shattered. He adored her. 
 You don't think he had anything to do with it? 
 Well, er... 
 Oh, come on, Dad, that's absurd! 
 I mean, Rex and Connie were... 
 You've known him since he was 12, for heaven's sake! 
 A man like that isn't going to throw his girlfriend down some stairs! 
 Even if he has a reason. 
 Which Rex didn't. 
 Andrew... 
 The man's a hero, Dad. 
 Everyone here admires him. 
 I have to tell you it's not going to go down well, interrogating him. 
 I have to tell you I don't have any choice. 
 Anybody but you two would be at the station. 
 Me? Are you telling me I'm a suspect as well? 
 It's obviously escaped your attention - until proved otherwise, you are the last person to have seen her alive. 
 But no, you're not a suspect. 
 Yeah, I drove her home. What of it? 
 Then what? 
 Nothing! I dropped her off and went back to the club! 
 All right? 
 Remember this? 
 It was taken when I got my wings. 
 I gave you a copy. Is this it? 
 No, it's not. 
 I found this in her diary, under her pillow. 
 What? 
 Did you give it to her? 
 No. 
 How did she get it, then? 
 I've no idea. 
 Did you give one to anyone else? 
 What do you think, Dad? Do you think I paper them around town? 
 I gave one to you because it was special. How can you even think it?! 
 You did not give a copy of this photograph to Connie Dewar? 
 No, I did not! 
 Did Violet? 
 Who you were with last night. 
 Did she tell you that? 
 Yep. 
 Did she say anything else? 
 The name of the hotel, the number of the room. 
 For God's sake! 
 We've got a dead girl making threats. 
 You decide to drive her home. 
 You're the last to see her. 
 Your photograph is in her diary. 
 You're investigating me? 
 You send Sam to spy on me and my friends! 
 You've been digging up the dirt on Violet and me! 
 Why couldn't you tell me? 
 I find out you've been sneaking off with some girl and I'm the last to know. 
 Should I have taken her home? 
 Do you love this girl? 
 She's not this girl! Her name is Violet. It's none of your business! 
 You know, Dad... 
 ..I don't think you know me at all. 
 I don't think you have any idea what goes on in my head. 
 You come here, of all places, and you ask these questions as if anybody really gives a damn. 
 Connie's dead! 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 Rex had nothing to do with it! 
 So just chuck it! 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Yep. 
 I've just seen the medical report, sir. 
 Yeah. She was four months pregnant, wasn't she? Yes, sir. 
 In here, she says she's not been feeling well for a while. 
 And the last entry is about still feeling bad. 
 Appointment with DH. 
 DH? 
 There's a lot of shorthand. 
 Could be a doctor. 
 Does she name the father? 
 Unfortunately not. 
 Rex Talbot is the obvious choice. 
 There's a lot about him. 
 Does he love me? 
 Is he seeing anyone else? 
 There's something about a planned double wedding. 
 Double wedding? 
 Her and Talbot and Violet Davies and um... 
 My son. 
 Does she mention the fuel deliveries or any involvement in the petrol racket? 
 A couple of oblique references. 
 A sort of record of payments. 
 (READS) £10 from MB. 
 £5 from MB. 
 MB... Michael Bennett. 
 Mm. 
 She's being paid almost weekly. 
 It must be a heck of a lot of fuel we're talking about. 
 Enough to make an arrest? 
 It's still not clear if she was killed, why she was killed, and what she was doing with a photograph of...my son. 
 That's not mentioned in the diary? 
 No, it's not. 
 Since it seems either of them could be the father, wouldn't it be a good idea to find out if either of them knew she was pregnant? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And we'll get Sam out of the depot. 
 Leave that to me. 
 Yes, sir. 
 The bicarbonate of soda. 
 Connie Dewar might have taken it for morning sickness. Spoken to your wife? 
 N-No, sir. 
 I should. 
 Yes. 
 So you want me to leave. 
 You've done as much as you can. 
 After what's happened, it's too big a risk. 
 But nobody knows anything about me. 
 How do you know? 
 Can't take the chance. 
 All right. I'll hand in my notice. 
 Take the rest of the day off. 
 Pick me up usual time tomorrow. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Whatever you say. 
 Connie Dewar was a patient of mine. 
 She came to see me a couple of days ago. 
 And you told her that she was expecting a child? 
 You'd have thought it had been self-evident. 
 She was four months gone, but in fact she had no idea. 
 Was she pleased? 
 She was shocked. 
 That was the overriding emotion. 
 I don't suppose she told you the name of the father. 
 No, I'm afraid not. 
 She did say she was still seeing him. 
 She said she was going to tell him the news after she left me. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 Out of interest, how did you find me? 
 She kept a diary and made a reference to a DH. 
 We simply looked for local doctors with those initials. 
 I see. 
 Only my Christian name's Graham. 
 Yeah, it confused us a bit. 
 Eventually, we decided that the D stood for doctor. 
 Now she's dead. 
 I'm very sorry to hear it. 
 What a terrible waste of a young life. 
 Mm. 
 Two. 
 Indeed. 
 (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
 Ah! Miss Stewart, I'm glad to see you. 
 Mr Bennett, I've got some rather bad news. 
 We've got a rush on! 
 This business with Miss Dewar! 
 Actually, sir... 
 Mrs Bennett and I have to meet the girl's parents. 
 We won't be here. 
 Just leave the paperwork on my desk. 
 Yes, sir. 
 What was it you were going to say? 
 Bad news? 
 No, nothing. 
 I'll tell you tomorrow. 
 Right. 
 Come on! 
 How are you bearing up, Rex? 
 I'm all right. Thank you, sir. 
 I was so sorry to hear about your girl. 
 Are you ready to fly? 
 I can't wait to get back in the air. 
 Good man. 
 We've been lucky, in a way. 
 Most of the action has been to the east of us. 
 It's given us a chance to get the new chaps up to scratch. 
 However, all that's about to change. 
 We're back on ops? 
 Any day now, yes. 
 Things are about to get very tight. 
 You know how much I depend on you. 
 I wanted to be sure you were ready. 
 Very much so, sir. 
 Good. 
 The police have come back. 
 You don't have to talk to them if you don't want to. 
 I don't mind, sir. 
 I think I owe it to her. 
 All right. Dismissed. 
 Well? How can I help you? 
 Were you aware Miss Dewar was pregnant? 
 Pregnant? 
 She didn't tell you? 
 No. 
 Were you the father? 
 What? Of course I was the father. 
 Who else could it have been? 
 That's what I'm asking you. 
 How dare you talk about Connie like that! 
 She's been dead a day and you're treating her like some kind of... 
 I was the father, yes. 
 Then why didn't she tell you? 
 Because... 
 I suppose she didn't want to put any pressure on me. 
 To marry her? 
 I told you the last time we met. 
 We talked about marriage, but not yet. 
 Not until after the duration. 
 Could you have married her? 
 What? 
 What would your family have thought? 
 My father's dead. 
 My mother... 
 I don't know. 
 If she was expecting your child... 
 What are you saying? 
 I killed her because I didn't want to be dragged into a marriage that was beneath me? 
 That's not true. 
 I'm not a snob. I loved her. 
 Anyway, I've already said she didn't tell me. I didn't know! 
 When was it due? 
 She'd been pregnant four months. 
 She didn't tell me. 
 But it was mine, Sergeant Milner. 
 Maybe I didn't want a child. I... 
 I don't know what to think. 
 But it was definitely mine. 
 How's your investigation going, Mr Foyle? This petrol business. 
 Connie Dewar. You know her? 
 What gives you that idea? 
 She used to wax barrels in your brewery. 
 I'm not denying it. 
 Connie worked for me. 
 Did you know she's dead? 
 I heard. 
 Tragic. 
 Death seems to follow you around. 
 Quite the opposite. I follow it. 
 Did you know she was pregnant? 
 Did you know you were the father? 
 Did she tell you that? 
 The doctor told her she was pregnant. 
 She was going to tell the father when she left the surgery. 
 She came straight to your office. 
 Three hours later, she's dead. 
 I was very fond of Connie. 
 I looked after her. 
 And when her boyfriend got shot down, of course, she came to me. 
 He'd been in hospital for about three weeks or so, and I had to comfort her. 
 And I suppose one thing led to another. 
 I know it doesn't sound so good, Frank Gannon having his wicked way while the ace boyfriend is giving his all for king and country. 
 It didn't have to be me. 
 It could have been Rex. 
 It could have been anyone. 
 You're married, I believe. 
 Yes. 
 And a baby would have been an embarrassment. 
 But speaking off the record, she didn't have to have it. 
 I know the law. 
 But I also know people who respect the law less than me. 
 And I could have found someone to... help her. 
 So you met my father. 
 Did he tell you? 
 He interrogated me. 
 Why? 
 He doesn't think you've got anything to do with Connie? 
 Apparently, he does. 
 That's daft! 
 Well, I took her home. 
 And... 
 She had a photograph of me under her pillow. 
 What? 
 He found it. 
 Connie had your picture? 
 I don't know how she got it. 
 Are you saying she... 
 Were you and her... 
 No! 
 Then why did she have your picture? 
 That's what I'm asking. 
 Why did you take her home, anyway? 
 I don't understand you sometimes. 
 First, it was you and that new girl Sam Stewart. Now, you and Connie! 
 I thought we were going to get married! 
 Is that what you told my father? 
 Yes. 
 I wish you hadn't. 
 Why not? It's true, isn't it? 
 Andrew? 
 Look... 
 It's not the right time to be talking about it. 
 It was the right time when you were trying to get me into bed. 
 Violet? 
 You're all the same, you airmen. 
 Think you're God's gift! You're not. 
 What are you trying to say? 
 I've had enough. 
 Connie always said you can never trust a pilot. And she was right! 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (TICKING) 
 Hello! 
 Is anybody there? 
 Could you let me out? 
 Hello! 
 Help! 
 Hello! 
 Hello! Help! 
 Hello! 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Yes? 
 Sir, it's Sam. 
 Sam, what is it? 
 I'm at the depot. 
 In the Bennetts' office. 
 What are you doing there? 
 It's a long story. 
 There's a bomb. 
 A what? 
 In a suitcase. Someone left it here. 
 I couldn't see who it was, I'm afraid. 
 But I got stuck in the office. 
 What do you mean, stuck? 
 It looks as if it will go off pretty soon. 
 How soon? 
 Ten minutes, I'd say, sir. 
 Get out of a window. 
 Break a window! 
 I'll try. 
 Or get behind something solid. 
 Lie flat behind a desk or a table or something. On my way. 
 (BELLS) 
 Sam? 
 Sir! It's over there! 
 OK, steady now. 
 What on earth did you think you were doing? 
 I just wanted to get these. 
 These? What are they? 
 Requisition orders. 
 They were in the safe. 
 It was totally irresponsible. 
 You could have got yourself killed. 
 Whoever it was didn't know I was in there, sir. 
 You didn't see anything? 
 Afraid not. 
 It's all right, sir. It's safe. 
 You were very lucky. 
 Not very cleverly put together. 
 Should have gone off ten minutes ago. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 I don't know what the aim was, but there's enough to blow this place to kingdom come. 
 O'Halloran? 
 Do you think so, sir? 
 I can't be sure. 
 Could the IRA have anything to do with it? 
 Well... 
 How are you going to prove it? 
 Mm. 
 Anyway, are you all right? 
 I think so, sir. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 Not as sorry as I'd have been if you'd been killed. 
 The sergeant's a terrible driver. 
 What the... 
 Are you off back to Ireland, Mr O'Halloran? 
 Who are you? 
 I thought I'd return this. 
 Jesus! 
 So you know what it is. 
 You're under arrest for attempted murder. I caution you that you're not obliged to say anything, but anything you do say will be taken down and used in evidence against you. 
 Murder? 
 I didn't try to murder anyone! 
 What is this? 
 This is an arrest, Mr Gannon. 
 I don't think I've done anything wrong. 
 The bomb. 
 It didn't go off, and O'Halloran talked. 
 Is your name Carter? 
 Yeah. 
 You're under arrest too. 
 On what charge? 
 Purloining of petrol, conspiracy to commit sabotage. 
 For your outstanding contribution to the war effort, it gives me great pleasure to know that you're going to spend a long time doing hard labour. 
 The three of them have been arrested. 
 It's difficult to know how much fuel was involved. Thousands of gallons. 
 It's unbelievable. 
 I knew nothing about it, Mr Evans. 
 I swear to you on my soul! 
 I'm not a racketeer! 
 I never even met this man...Gannon. 
 I've said this already. 
 But I've never had any reason to doubt this man's honesty. 
 That may well be the case. 
 But Connie Dewar was certainly involved. 
 Yes, we have her diary. 
 And it records several payments to her by an MB. 
 Michael Bennett. 
 We now know how the thefts were achieved. 
 Sam gave us a very good idea of the working practice here. 
 Sam who? 
 Sam Stewart. 
 Samantha Stewart was working for you? 
 Sorry to have kept it from you. 
 From what she told us, the system seemed pretty cut and dried. 
 Requisition orders were made. 
 Copies kept at both ends. 
 Everything seemed above board. 
 I designed the system myself. 
 Yes, I understand. But... 
 All the requisitions were brought here by dispatch riders. 
 But it was interesting that it was Mrs Bennett who nearly always met them. 
 But suppose she exchanged the real requisition order for a fake one. 
 Nobody would know. 
 A customer demands 300 gallons. 
 Mrs Bennett changes the order to 500. And that's what Connie Dewar takes from the depot. 
 She then delivers the 300 gallons to the customer. 
 Leaving 200 to be handed over to Frank Gannon. 
 All the figures seem to add up. 
 And it will be months if not years before anyone realises anything is wrong. 
 Pamela? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I make no decisions. 
 My husband's in charge. 
 She's absolutely right. 
 I can't believe what you're saying! 
 My wife couldn't... 
 Do you know who recruited Connie Dewar? 
 Um... 
 Were you aware that she had worked for Gannon? 
 No! 
 He had met your wife. 
 And recruited her. 
 Your wife recruited Connie Dewar. 
 But in the diary, you said the initials of the man who was paying Miss Dewar were MB. 
 Yes. Connie used an irregular shorthand. 
 DH, for example, was Dr Henderson. 
 So it's quite possible that MB could have stood for Mrs Bennett. 
 No, no, no, you're wrong! 
 You're quite wrong. 
 Not Pamela. She couldn't. 
 Of course I could! 
 What?! 
 Have you no idea what you put me through? 
 Watching you strut around this depot like...Hitler. 
 So full of yourself! 
 You treat me like dirt. 
 I work for you. 
 You don't even give me any money of my own! 
 I have to watch you with the other girls. 
 The way you run your eyes over them. 
 Even when I'm there. 
 For heaven's sake! 
 You humiliate me every day. 
 And Gannon? 
 He offered me a way out. 
 Money. Independence. 
 A chance to live my own life after the war. 
 And nobody would know it was me. 
 That was the beauty of it. 
 I'd get all the money. 
 He'd get all the blame. 
 Connie understood. 
 We were laughing at you. 
 That was the best part! 
 It made us feel good. 
 There's one thing I don't understand. 
 The bomb. 
 It was intended to destroy any evidence in the office of how much fuel had been taken and any links it might have had with Gannon. 
 And O'Halloran? 
 He was a hired hand. 
 And a clever choice. 
 We might have believed there was a political motive for the bomb. 
 The IRA, for example. But in fact it was just to cover up a petty crime. 
 What about the girl, Mr Foyle? 
 Do you know who killed her? 
 Maybe. 
 Well, Rex. 
 I rather thought I'd be seeing you again. 
 Mm. 
 So you'd know why. 
 I knew you'd work it out. 
 Andrew has spoken so much about the way you work. 
 How did you know? 
 You gave yourself away rather early, you know. 
 Did I? 
 Remember the first time I came here to let you know that Connie had been found dead? 
 You said, "Have you spoken to Violet? 
 Violet must have been there. 
 They lived together. 
 She must have seen what happened." 
 So you knew it happened at the flat. 
 Just as you knew, in fact, that Violet hadn't been there because... you were. 
 It was because of the baby. 
 I knew she was pregnant. I knew she was going to have a child. 
 She would have forced me to marry her. It was out of the question. 
 My mother wouldn't hear of it. 
 The baby wasn't yours. 
 What? 
 You know perfectly well the baby wasn't yours. 
 It was conceived when you were in hospital after you'd been shot down. 
 What are you saying? 
 You tried to use the baby to hide the truth, just as you used Connie to hide the truth. 
 Please! 
 I couldn't find a reason why Connie would have had a photograph of Andrew. 
 But you see, I'd assumed it was her photograph. 
 When in fact, it was yours, wasn't it? 
 Yes. 
 Rex, please! 
 Sorry. Look after this. 
 I'd asked her to hold my jacket. 
 My wallet must have fallen out of my pocket. 
 It's all in the diary. 
 She was confused about your feelings for her. 
 The lack of anything physical. 
 And the photograph explained everything. 
 You're not interested in women, are you, Rex? 
 No, sir. 
 The truth is... 
 The truth is, I had feelings for... 
 Andrew. 
 Yes. 
 I disgust you. 
 Not at all. 
 I wish I could believe that. 
 It's true. 
 I couldn't let the other chaps know the truth about me. 
 You don't understand the spirit of this place. 
 Friendships. 
 But it was more than that. 
 They wouldn't have let me fly any more. They'd have kicked me out. 
 I couldn't let that happen. 
 I think you do them an injustice. 
 I couldn't risk it. 
 Connie guessed the truth. 
 She threatened to expose me. 
 I know something! 
 Do you know what I know? 
 I've got a little secret! 
 And maybe it's about time I started sharing it around! 
 Connie, you mustn't tell anyone! 
 Why not? 
 You used me! 
 You never loved me! 
 You only pretended! 
 You said you were going to marry me! 
 You wouldn't marry me! 
 You didn't even want to touch me! 
 Connie! 
 I am... I'm fond of you. 
 You used me so that nobody would know what you are! 
 I had to! If you tell them, they won't let me fly. 
 I don't care! I hate you! 
 You make me sick! 
 Please! 
 I didn't push her. She fell. 
 Why were there bruises on her wrists? 
 Does it really matter, sir? 
 Does any of it really matter? 
 It was an accident. 
 Does it have to go any further? 
 (BELLS) 
 That's the call to scramble. 
 You're right, of course, Mr Foyle. 
 I have to answer for Connie. 
 Manslaughter, murder, whatever you want to call it. 
 But surely it can wait until I get back. 
 I can't let you leave. 
 I have to, sir! 
 I'm flying No.1 in the first section. 
 It will jeopardise the op if I suddenly duck out. 
 I'm not going to run away. 
 I've nowhere to go. 
 For the others, sir, I beg you. 
 Let me fly this one last time. 
 Thank you. 
 There was one other thing. 
 I would so much prefer it if Andrew didn't know. 
 We could just say it was because of the baby. 
 I think I can bear any shame. 
 But not that. 
 There you are. I thought you were going to sit this out. 
 I'll be there to hold your hand. 
 Your tenth kill, Rex. 
 If Foyle doesn't snatch it away. 
 I'm not coming near you. 
 Get a move on! 
 Good luck, Andrew. 
 Proud to fly with you. 
 Always have been. 
 Home, sir? 
 Home, Sam. 
 Dad. 
 Andrew. 
 I'm sorry we argued. 
 So am I. 
 My fault. 
 Rex is dead. 
 Dog-fight over the Channel. 
 There were about 20 of them. 109s. 
 We intercepted them at 12,000 feet. 
 They came at us like a swarm. 
 I was in Rex's flight, as always. 
 And he... 
 I've never seen flying like that. 
 He must have bagged at least half a dozen of them. 
 More. 
 Then suddenly, there were two of them on his tail. 
 I thought he'd come home. 
 I kept on waiting to see him come out on his 'chute. 
 And there I was to protect him. 
 The plane was spinning. 
 It was on fire. 
 I suppose he must have been knocked out. 
 I watched him go all the way down. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't know how I'll be able to carry on, Dad. 
 He was my best friend. 
 He was a good man. 
 So... 
 Carry on for him. 
 A good man. 
 He was one of the best. 
 War doesn't matter. 
 You and I don't matter. 
 Business will go on! 
 Lesson No.1. 
 Don't believe everything you see. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 What I am capable of. 
 Lesson No.2. In this war, the winners decide who gets shot. 
 I'm fighting a war. 
 The Nazis might claim the same.
