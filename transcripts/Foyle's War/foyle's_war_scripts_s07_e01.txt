 (rooster crowing, dog barking) 
 Woman : Matthew! Breakfast! 
 (HORN BLARES) 
 (TYRES SCREECH) 
 (SHOUTING AND MUTTERING IN RUSSIAN) 
 Soldier : Get a move on! 
 What the hell are you doing? You'll get yourself killed. Mum. 
 I've told you about this a million times. Football is in the park not... 
 (FRANTIC SHOUTING) 
 Sit down. Down. Sit down. 
 (SHRIEKS) Oh, no! 
 Sergeant, stop firing that weapon now! 
 Prisoners escaped, sir. Two prisoners down the alley. Go, go! 
 No weapons to be used here. 
 You two, back in the truck. Guard those prisoners. 
 (DISTANT ENGINE) 
 (SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN) 
 Get after them, boys! Go on! 
 Prisoners separating. 
 Right, let's go. Go! 
 (ENGINE ROARS) 
 Stop the truck! 
 There he is! 
 At the double! 
 Get him! 
 Move it! 
 Come on, mate. You two, with me. 
 Give up. Stand still. 
 Come on. That's it. 
 Don't shoot. Stop. Don't shoot! 
 No, no, stop, wait. Wait. 
 We're sending you home. 
 We're sending you home. 
 (BIRD SQUAWKS) 
 This is a balls-up, isn't it, Bennet? Yes, sir. 
 British soldiers opening fire in an urban area. 
 Thank God hardly anyone was around. 
 Only one got away? Yes, sir, just the one. No sign of him since? 
 We may have had one sighting, down on the coast near Hastings. 
 Hastings. 
 Ah, Maurice Jones, Labour Party. Very nice to meet you. 
 And you. Thank you. 
 Good morning. Maurice Jones, Labour Party. Remember the name. 
 We'll need every vote on July 5. Can I count on your support? 
 Not me. I'm with Winnie. 
 Right. 
 Morning, sir. Good morning. 
 Maurice Jones, Labour Party. Are you really now? 
 I wonder if I could count on your support. I'm wondering the same thing. 
 Care for some literature? Sets out the need for a new start. 
 Well, with...rationing and the... 
 I think you'll find Labour has all the answers. ..huge paper shortage, best not perhaps, don't you think? 
 Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle, we owe you a vote of gratitude. 
 Well, that's uncommonly decent of you but I'm not here to be thanked. 
 How is the new station? 
 It's delightful apart from the fact that I don't want to be in it. I resigned. 
 I'm aware of that. It was very good of you to return after your predecessor... 
 Died. In very unfortunate circumstances. 
 Most deaths are unfortunate but that was some considerable while ago. 
 I'd like to know why I'm still there and where my replacement is. 
 Mr Foyle, please understand we have two problems. 
 The first is a chronic shortage of staff, particularly at a senior level. 
 We lost many men to the war and they're only just coming back. 
 Finding someone to take your place will take time. You've had the time. 
 But there's another problem. 
 Put simply, you're a hard act to follow. 
 Can we not persuade you to think again, Foyle? 
 You've been remarkably successful in Hastings and along the whole south coast. 
 You're too young to retire. It's nothing to do with retirement. 
 I resigned. I returned temporarily to help with a difficult situation. 
 But the war is over. I'd like to be remarkably successful somewhere else. 
 That might well be the case but right now there is no-one else. 
 Four weeks. After that, no matter what, I'll be going. 
 I posted your letters, Sir Leonard. This is the book you wanted. 
 There's still only lamb in the shop so it's chops...again. 
 Thank you, Miss Stewart. 
 What do you think of this? 
 Hm. It's beautiful. 
 It was given to me by the artist Karel Fleischer. 
 I met him in Antwerp. He died in Buchenwald. 
 We may have won the war but there's still so much to be done. 
 I'm sorry, was he a friend of yours? 
 An acquaintance. 
 I have some letters for you to type for me, Miss Stewart. 
 And this afternoon I thought we might get back to our other work. 
 Oh, yes? You still feel uncomfortable? 
 No...not really. 
 No need to be. Thank you for the book. 
 By the way, I wanted to remind you, I'm taking Sunday off. 
 Yes, that's fine. 
 Lunch at one? Right. 
 Niko! 
 I don't suppose you dug up any potatoes. There were none in the shops. 
 The shops were hempty? Empty with an E. 
 Empty. But, yes. Queues everywhere but nothing to queue for. 
 I don't know why people bother. 
 Potatoes. Perfect. 
 Do you ever think about going home, Niko? 
 This is my home now. 
 But don't you want to get back to your family? 
 I am happy here. And you, Sam? 
 You are happy too? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know what I'm doing stuck here. 
 But it's either here or Leominster so... 
 Lunch at one. One? 
 One o'clock. Thanks. 
 Sir. 
 That's him. 
 You can wait for me here. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Sir? Yes. 
 Foyle. 
 Brigadier. 
 It's very, very good to see you again after all these... 
 What is it? 27 years and far from pleasant circumstances last time we met. 
 Well, you've done well for yourself. 
 Congratulations, Foyle. I always knew you'd go far. 
 As far as Hastings. No, no, no. 
 That's why I promoted you when I had the privilege to have you under my command. 
 Now, may I? Well, of course. 
 I take it this is not a social visit. 
 That was always the way, straight to the point. 
 But have you seen any of them, Foyle? 
 Lowe was here. He was at my wedding. 
 Lowe? Ian Lowe. 
 He was blind. 
 Ah, yes. 
 And here we are... (SIGHS) ..just gone through the whole thing again. 
 Mm. But you...have a son. 
 In London. He's come through it all right. 
 I'm very glad. 
 I won't take up your time. And you're quite right, I'm here on War Office business. 
 I'm looking for this man. 
 Ivan Spiakov. Russian. 
 From Georgia. Fought with the Germans against us. Captured in Normandy. 
 What makes you think he's here? He was in Brenchurch two days ago when he slipped out of our hands. 
 What makes you think he's here? He was in Brenchurch two days ago when he slipped out of our hands. 
 We believe he was heading west and it's absolutely vital that we find him. 
 One escaped prisoner. 
 Oh, Spiakov is a troublemaker. 
 Huh. An agitator. 
 At the moment we have more than 1,200 Russian POWs in England. 
 They all fought on the German side. 
 And some of them... 
 Well, to describe them as animals wouldn't be putting it too strongly. 
 Did you hear what happened in the village of Saint-Donat? 
 June 15 last year. 
 German reprisal against the Resistance. 
 They sent the Russians in. 
 It was a blood bath. 
 53 women raped. And all the rest of it. 
 This man was there? Oh, no, no, no. 
 I just want you to understand what these people roused are capable of. 
 We're trying to get them out of the country quietly, peacefully and he's determined to whip them up against us. 
 I'm not sure how I... Oh, I came to you, Foyle, because you know the area. 
 You can find him. If he's still here. Which I believe he is. 
 He had no money, nowhere else to go. 
 But, more to the point, I can trust you to keep it under your hat. 
 Report to me directly. 
 We don't want to scare the local populace. 
 So might I ask you to use your men, your resources? 
 Of course. Good man. I knew I could count on you. 
 Well, you can contact me at the War Office. 
 Please let me know as soon as you have any news. 
 And... it'd be good to have a proper chat one day. 
 Psst. 
 Psst. 
 Ivan. (MOUTHS) 
 Let me make you some more tea. No, I'm all right, thank you. 
 I have to be on my way. You never talk about your work. 
 There's not much to tell. Go on, I'm interested. 
 Well, we had a school broken into last week. 
 The staff lost two months' tea money. 
 There have been a few late-night smash and grabs. 
 They shouldn't turn off the streetlights. 
 Saves fuel. 
 Sometimes I think I'm just killing time. 
 You're missing Hastings. 
 No. No, I'm not. 
 I like being here with you. I like Brighton. 
 And it was time to move. 
 You wait and see. What? 
 Things are going to change, Edie. 
 There are ex-servicemen pouring back into the country, guns everywhere. 
 And what with all these shortages. 
 You want to prove yourself. 
 I want to show that I can manage. 
 Without Mr Foyle. 
 Tom. 
 Joe. 
 Am I glad to see you. 
 Come in. 
 So, how was it? 
 Bloody shambles. 
 All of it, start to finish. Do you want to talk about it? No. 
 You were well out of it, Joe, believe me. I wanted to be where you were. 
 I'd have given anything. Well... you were the one who inherited Dad's flat feet. 
 You were the one that got all the gongs. Oh, yeah? 
 Africa Star, Italy Star. 
 Got them for showing up. 
 And what did I get? 
 Four years wet-nursing a bunch of Jerries. 
 What were they like? They weren't too bad. 
 A bit surly some of them. 
 But good workers. 
 We had a bunch of them draining the land at Ted Walker's place. 
 Old Ted. Don't tell me he's still in the land of the living. 
 What are you going to do, Tom, now that you're back? 
 I hoped you'd put me up for a bit. 
 Course. You're welcome. 
 Are you going to see Mum and Dad? 
 In time. 
 I've got to find work. Any thoughts? 
 Yeah, I thought I'd see Spencer-Jones. Sir Leonard, you know. 
 He'll give me my old job back. Are you sure about that, Tom? 
 What do you mean? Things have changed. 
 A lot of water's gone under the bridge. 
 He'll see me right. 
 He promised. I'll see him tomorrow. 
 And now? 
 A bit of shuteye. I'm knackered. 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 It's good to see you, Tom. 
 Good to be back. 
 I was wondering when they'd send in a senior officer, sir. 
 Sorry to disappoint. I haven't been sent in. 
 Someone ought to have an inquiry. A shoot-out in a civilian population? 
 It's like the wild west. 
 Niko. (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Have you been into the kitchen since lunch time? No, Miss Stewart. 
 Well...someone has. 
 Niko, I hate having to ask you this. 
 You know the tin where I keep the housekeeping - I didn't take it. 
 But you know it's been taken. 
 Do you know who took it? 
 You have to help me. They are going to take me away. 
 What do you mean? 
 Look, you can't just help yourself to the housekeeping. 
 Who took it? 
 A friend. 
 I met him in camp. 
 He has gone to the Russian House. 
 He tell me I have to go there too. 
 What Russian House? 
 In London. 
 He says it's where I will be safe. 
 He tell me I have to go there too. 
 He tell me they come for me, they take me. 
 Niko, listen to me, trust me. 
 Nobody's going to take you anywhere. I won't let them. 
 There was £5 in that tin. 
 You can't just give it away. 
 We're going to have to tell Sir Leonard. 
 Thank you very much. 
 There were two of them. Apparently, sir. 
 What happened? I heard they headed off towards the old viaduct. 
 Afternoon. Afternoon. 
 You from the papers then? 
 No. Why would you ask that? 
 I thought I might have read something but there's been nothing. 
 Cos I saw it, you know. Did you? 
 Yeah, I was just down there. 
 Two Russians escaped from a convoy as far as I understand it. 
 Two of them, you say? No, I only saw one, poor sod. 
 He was trapped, you see. There was a truck following him and a whole squad of soldiers. 
 One of them called out to him. 
 'Give up. It's over.' 
 He wasn't having any of it. He just... stood there for a minute...and then he did it. 
 He did what? 
 He jumped. 
 He killed himself, is that what you're saying? In broad daylight. 
 Threw himself off the edge. 
 Russky, you say. So I believe. 
 (TUTS) Well, he's a dead Russky now, poor sod. 
 Why do you think he'd do a thing like that? 
 Good question. 
 Look at you, dressed up to the nines. 
 Do you think I look all right? 
 You really want this job, don't you? 
 Well, I've got to get back to work. 
 There's not much else around. You should go back in the Army. 
 You've got to be kidding. 
 How much longer are you going to keep up this malarkey? Search me. 
 Still got Jerries, Russkies, even a few Eyeties. 
 They've all got to go home. Then maybe I can pack it in too. 
 I ought to be going. Do you want some toast? 
 Er...no. 
 Good luck, Tom. 
 I shouldn't need that, should I? 
 Who was this man? 
 Ivan. I meet him in the camp. 
 Met him. Yes. They were prisoners together. 
 Before they released me. Before I come here. 
 It was wrong of you to give him the money. I hope you understand that. 
 The money wasn't yours to give. 
 This talk of you being forced to do anything against your will is nonsense. 
 The war is over. 
 You're a citizen of an Allied country under Home Office jurisdiction and I see absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to stay as a residential alien. They can't force him to go home. 
 I want to stay here. 
 Well...I've been in touch with a man at the Home Office. 
 I'll write to him again and get this sorted out. 
 I'm not without influence. 
 And I've also written to Walter Hardiman, my solicitor, and I can assure you we're not going to let this go. 
 Thank you, Sir Leonard. You are very kind. 
 You and Miss Stewart. You have been very kind to me. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 I'm not expecting anyone. I'll see who it is, Sir Leonard. 
 Yes? 
 I'm sorry, Tom. 
 But you promised. That was six years ago. 
 I said I would do what I could. 
 You said you'd keep my job open for me. 
 Anytime. You said. 
 I went to war. And I'm very glad to see you back again. 
 I'll of course do what I can for you. 
 You lied to me. 
 You'll do nothing. 
 (LOUNGE MUSIC) 
 Mr Foyle! 
 Now there's someone I haven't seen for a long time. You want a drink? 
 Thank you. I've heard about the coffee. The best coffee in Hastings. 
 The only coffee that tastes of coffee. 
 It's good to see you open again. 
 We should never have closed. 
 No aliens allowed in Hastings during the war. 
 Mm. 
 So, who are you looking for? 
 I probably haven't seen him. 
 What's he done? 
 Nothing as far as we know. We'd just like to talk to him. 
 And what makes you think he'd come here? 
 Doesn't everybody, sooner or later? 
 They used to. Maybe. 
 But not him. I haven't seen him. 
 If he's done nothing...why do you want to talk to him? 
 Well...he may be in trouble. 
 There are a great many Russians in this country. POWs. 
 They could all be in trouble. 
 Meaning? 
 There are rumours. Joseph Stalin wants them back... and he will not welcome them with open arms. 
 So they're frightened - There is a saying, you may have heard it, the dog knows what happens to him when he steals the bacon. 
 Until now the British government has protected them but it is possible that that protection may be withdrawn. 
 Well, his name's...Spiakov if you felt able to ask around. 
 I can try. 
 But I must tell you, Mr Foyle, right now people are not talking, not to me. 
 And when they talk to each other...they whisper. 
 Do what you can. Of course. 
 Good coffee. 
 (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) Monsieur Duveen. 
 We speak English here only, my friend. 
 It is out of politeness to the country... that has been such a generous host. 
 Thank you. 
 (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) 
 Yes, I speak English. 
 Then, yes, I am Duveen. 
 Sit down. 
 Some tea for our guest. 
 So, have you come far? 
 I was in the south, near the sea. 
 I was in a camp. Me and a friend of mine...escaped. 
 Why did you come here? 
 I have heard many people speaking about the Russian House. 
 They said it is somewhere I would be safe. 
 The police are looking for you? 
 Maybe. The police, the Army. 
 But what is it you think we can do for you? 
 I need money. I...I need somewhere to hide. 
 You do not wish to return to Mother Russia? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 Because I know what happened in Odessa. 
 The ship called the Almanzora. 
 You cannot stay here. We have no room for you. 
 And if the British authorities come looking for you - I have nowhere to go. 
 We can arrange somewhere for you to stay. Don't worry. Food and money. 
 Who else have you told about these things? 
 There is no need to tell. 
 They all know. 
 Hm. 
 You should not stay here. We will arrange for you to be taken somewhere safe. 
 Do you mind waiting here? No, Sir Leonard. 
 I'm...used to it. 
 Very good to see you, Leonard. 
 Sherry? 
 No, thank you. You got my letter? 
 Er, yes. 
 This young Russian. 
 Nikolai... Vladchenko. 
 How did you actually come across him? He was in a camp near Brighton. 
 Then he was assigned a work detail and ended up working in my grounds. 
 I took a liking to him, offered him a room. He's been there ever since. 
 Well, it's more than commendable, your desire to help him, but I must say your letter did surprise me. 
 To adopt him? Why not? He wants to stay in this country. 
 Doesn't he have parents of his own? 
 They're quite probably dead. 
 Anyway, he'll never see them again. 
 But you have a son. 
 Maurice and I are not on speaking terms. Even so - 
 Maurice has nothing to do with this. 
 Leonard, forgive me, I've known you for many, many years and I know how...headstrong you can be but Maurice isn't a bad chap. 
 To fall out over a political difference? Does it really matter so much? 
 It matters to me. Everything we've fought for for the last six years. 
 I won't stand back and watch it being thrown away by a government that will bring the country to its knees. You really think that? You don't? 
 You can't just cut Maurice out of your life. 
 Let me stop you right there, Walter. 
 I came to talk about Nikolai, not Maurice. 
 If you won't do what I want let me make it quite clear - 
 I'll find a solicitor that will. 
 Cut Maurice out of your will? Make out everything to this - Yes. 
 All right. If you're absolutely insistent. How long will it take? 
 A few days. Thank you. But I really think you're making a - 
 That's enough. 
 He's really made up his mind. 
 I'm sorry, Maurice. I did try. 
 He doesn't know what he's doing. 
 He's senile. 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Good morning. How are you? Very well. 
 How are you getting on at... Sir Leonard's? 
 Yes. Takes a bit of getting used to. 
 Keeping you busy, eh? I'll say. 
 I'm the cook, the housekeeper, the secretary, the driver and more besides. 
 How about you? How's Brookie? 
 He just left to go back up to London. Did he? That's a shame. 
 How's the office? I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible. 
 What, they won't let you leave? 
 Well, working on it. 
 Sir. Good to see you. 
 Milner, good to see you too. 
 Edith. Lovely to see you. And you. 
 She's adorable. She's wonderful. 
 I'm so pleased she'll grow up in a world without war. 
 Have you done the work on the door? 
 You have? Good. 
 Do join us for a drink afterwards, Mr Foyle. 
 We managed to hold on to a few bottles of Empire sherry. 
 And we have a cake. I'll be glad to. 
 Cardboard icing. There's no icing but the cake's real. 
 As we gather here today for the christening of Clementine Elizabeth Milner... 
 ..it seems an appropriate moment to remember the sacrifices that have been made, the many, many lives that have been lost. 
 At times it may have seemed almost purposeless... yet now here is a little girl who will be able to grow up in peace and security, free of the great evil that has gripped the world over the past six years. 
 Will you pray for Clementine and, by your own good example, draw her into the family of Christ? 
 Both : We will. 
 Will you support her as she walks in the way of Christ? 
 Sir...we've found him. 
 Good. 
 Will you encourage her to take her rightful place within the light of Christ's church? 
 All : We will. 
 Clementine Elizabeth, I baptise thee in the name of the Father... 
 ..and of the Son... 
 ..and of the Holy Ghost. 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (WAILS) 
 Perkins. He's Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones, sir. Meaning anything? No. 
 He's an artist. I can't say I'd ever heard of him either. 
 He won't be doing any more painting. 
 Shot in the chest at close range. 
 Who found him? He's got a housekeeper, a sort of secretary. 
 Name of Stewart. Stewart? 
 I can't believe it's you, Milner. 
 I suppose I should call you Detective Inspector Milner now. 
 Do you have any idea what happened? 
 No, I don't know what happened. I had the day off, as you know, for the christening. 
 Um... 
 I spent the night in Hastings and when I came back this morning he was just lying there. 
 And then I realised he'd been - well, you know - and called you. 
 At least I called the police. 
 I never thought you would show up. A bit like old times. 
 Um, not really, Sam. 
 No, I suppose not. The windows were open? 
 The French windows, yes. 
 And the whole place was in a bit of a state, like it is now. 
 Could have been a break-in, sir. 
 Is he your new driver? Sam. 
 Could have been a break-in. I had a look and there's a few things missing. 
 His wallet's gone from his desk by the front door. He always kept it there. 
 And the paintings. His paintings. 
 What? Are they not valuable? 
 I suppose so. They're back through here. 
 I'll show you. 
 It doesn't look like anyone's touched anything. 
 He kept the place in a bit of a mess. 
 We'll take an inventory to see if there's anything missing. 
 Is that really necessary? Yes. 
 I might have a list somewhere. It's all right, we'll do it. 
 Sam, do you know if anyone had a grudge against Sir Leonard? 
 Do you mean did he have any enemies? 
 As a matter of fact there was one. 
 I'm afraid it was rather my fault. 
 Who was that? 
 His name is Tom Bradley. 
 What are we going to do? We? 
 We have to go to the police. We don't have to do anything. 
 What difference does it make? 
 He's dead. A lot of people are dead. 
 Millions of them. He's just one more. 
 I shouldn't have gone back to the bloody house. 
 Just keep quiet about it. 
 Nobody knows anything. Nobody's going to find out. 
 How can you be so sure? 
 It'll be all right, Tom. Trust me. 
 It'll be all right. 
 Did he actually make any threats? 
 Er...no, not that I heard. 
 But I know Sir Leonard was very upset. 
 And, actually, I didn't feel too good myself. 
 You'd done him out of a job? 
 Well, Niko and I, yes. 
 Niko? Oh, I was going to tell you about him. 
 Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 He's Russian. I think I could have worked that one out. 
 Who he is? He's been working here on the gardens in the grounds. 
 He's an ex-prisoner. The Americans caught him in Normandy and...handed him over to us. 
 And do you know where he is? He should be here. 
 I can't understand it. 
 It seems that I can help you, Mr Foyle. 
 Although I wondered if I should. Why would that be? 
 It is a strange thing, you know, the end of the war. 
 Everyone thinks that everything will be all right. The good people won. 
 Never as simple as that, is it? 
 I never thought so and now I know it. 
 I start asking questions for you. 
 It brings nothing but trouble. 
 I shouldn't even be seeing you. 
 Well, I noticed I didn't get invited for coffee. 
 Ivan Spiakov. I may have an idea where you can find him. 
 Mm-hm. There were three of them in the camp together. 
 Ivan Spiakov, Anton Valyshkin and the youngest, a boy called Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 The boy, Nikolai, was released early. 
 He was only 16 at the time. 
 He was sent to a place near Brighton. 
 A house called Redwood Lodge. 
 If you are looking for Spiakov it is possible you will find him there. 
 So you've heard. 
 I don't believe it. 
 Somebody shot him. 
 Somebody? 
 You don't think I had anything to do with it, do you? 
 Your father was my friend, Maurice. 
 I knew him for many, many years. 
 Of course, what happened between you... 
 I thought it was wrong. You think I did it. 
 Why, because we didn't share the same politics? Not politics, no. 
 I should never have told you what he was planning. 
 He came here in confidence. Cut me off without a penny and put a Russian gardener in my place. Yes, I had gathered that. 
 I broke his trust. And now he's dead. 
 Funny... 
 ..how it goes. 
 DCS Foyle. Sir. 
 Chief Superintendent. 
 Can I ask what you're doing here? I was about to ask you the same thing. 
 I'm afraid there's been a murder. 
 Is Sam here? Sam is inside. She was the one who found the body. 
 If you came to see her I'm afraid that won't be possible right now. 
 Well, no, I'm here to see Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones. 
 That won't be possible either. I beg your pardon? 
 He's the one who's dead. 
 Sorry, you're...? Detective Constable Perkins. 
 In my day a DC would never address a chief superintendent without permission and certainly not without calling him sir. 
 It's all right, Perkins. 
 Sir, can I ask why you wanted to see Sir Leonard? 
 I should remind you that this matter is in my jurisdiction. 
 If you have information... I don't need reminding. 
 I've no interest in any matter within your jurisdiction. 
 I'm here for information regarding a missing Russian. Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 We want to talk to him too. 
 Is he a suspect? I'm afraid I can't tell you that. 
 It's too early to say. I've only just finished talking to Sam. 
 I've just taken her statement. 
 Well, if she's just found her employer dead it sounds as if she needs a bit of support so I'll be going in. 
 Yes. Follow me. 
 Where's Miss Stewart? In the studio, sir. 
 This way, sir. Mm-hm. 
 Um, those are the more recent ones. 
 He was sending them to the Academy. 
 Sam. 
 I was just helping with the inventory. 
 I'm sure there's no need to list everything. 
 Mr Foyle! 
 What are you doing here? Well, I'm not here because of this. 
 Just a question of two incidents coinciding. 
 Another murder? 
 No, no, no. No, it's er... 
 Sir, I need to know why you want to see Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 Well, if you need to know, Milner, you only need to ask. 
 And I'm not here to see Vladchenko but a Russian friend of his who, as far as I know, has nothing to do with any of this. 
 If he came here he could be a suspect. 
 I'm not at all sure he came here. 
 Niko's friend. He did come here. 
 There was some money taken. He came and then he left. 
 Niko told me about him. 
 I never saw him but his name was Ivan Spiakov. 
 Answers my question. Mine too. 
 Sir. 
 Interesting work. 
 I'd been working for him for a couple of weeks. 
 And I liked him. 
 He was very civilised. 
 One day he was talking about his work and asked if I'd like to pose for him. 
 Mm-hm. He was putting the sketches towards a piece for the Royal Academy. 
 Oh, right. I mean, me, without a stitch on. 
 Can you imagine what my father would have said? 
 I did ask him not to but he said it was going to be one of his best works and I ought not to be ashamed about it and... 
 I was actually quite worried about it. 
 Well, don't be. 
 I felt so shabby, I suppose. It's not going to happen now, is it? 
 No. I hope not. 
 I shouldn't mention any of this to Milner. 
 Why not? I don't want to put ideas into his head but you've got a good motive for wanting to put a bullet into this chap. 
 Oh, right. Of course, you didn't but... 
 Did you? 
 No. Course not. 
 Just checking. 
 He's not the same, is he, sir - 
 Milner? 
 He was pretty unfriendly to me. 
 And he's already decided Niko did it which is completely unfair. 
 How well do you know him? Very well. 
 He's sweet. He's only 17. 
 I like him. Any idea where he is? 
 If I tell you, could I come with you? 
 It's just that Niko was so frightened and I promised I'd stand by him. 
 This other Russian. 
 He was here a couple of days before this happened. 
 He took the housekeeping money. 
 I never met him but Niko knew where he was going. 
 It was called the Russian House. In London. 
 Thank you. 
 I could drive you. I could drive YOU. 
 Gentlemen. 
 This situation is completely... 
 I have to say...I'm almost lost for words. 
 You are all aware, I imagine, of what is at stake here. 
 We're meant to be operating in total secrecy yet just days apart and a few miles from each other, we have two situations. 
 Two intolerable situations! 
 Bennet. 
 Ivan Spiakov is under close guard, sir, on the way to Liverpool where he'll be on the first ship out. 
 What flak do we have from this Brenchurch escape? 
 There were witnesses but nobody was hurt, apart from the one Russian. 
 We've managed to keep a lid on it. 
 And Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones. Are we going to keep a lid on that? 
 We're taking the necessary steps. 
 Which would be to have the idiots involved transferred to the Outer Hebrides. 
 And...what about this boy Vladchenko? 
 Ah, I have Sir Leonard's letter here. 
 Obviously we want to talk to him but at the moment he's on the run and we have no idea where he is. 
 He's left Brighton? The police are looking for him. 
 Let's hope we find him before they do. 
 We're sitting on a time bomb here, gentlemen. 
 Spencer-Jones isn't just anybody. 
 We have here a hugely respected establishment figure who's been shot dead in his own home. 
 I want a daily progress report and I want this boy Vladchenko found. 
 That is all! 
 Right, I must go. 
 You didn't say a word to me last night. 
 You hardly spoke at breakfast. What is it, Paul? 
 Nothing. Tell me. 
 It's this case. The murder? 
 I thought it was what you wanted, something to get your teeth into. 
 This man, Spencer-Jones, wasn't he quite important? He was very important. 
 Well, when you find out who did it, won't that stand you in good stead? 
 I think I know who did it. 
 He had a Russian living with him, an ex-prisoner. 
 And he was the one? Well, he's run away, money and other things were stolen from the house and a witness saw him taking a train from Brighton station so it looks cut and dried. So why are you worrying? 
 Mr Foyle is involved. He was at the house. 
 But that's good, isn't it? I worked with him for five years and I know what I owe him but this time I wanted to do this on my own. 
 Well, it's your case. Why don't you just ask him to go away? 
 I already have. That's what worries me. 
 I think I may have been... What? 
 Look, what does it matter, Paul? As long as you make the arrest. 
 As you sure it was this Russian? I wish I was. 
 Morning. Paul. 
 You're in charge now. You go out there and do it your way. 
 This is very kind of you, sir, letting me come with you. 
 The least I can do in the circumstances. 
 So you don't have a driver now? 
 That's right. After you left I thought it was about time. Hm. 
 I'm not going to be there much longer anyway. 
 Then what? 
 I might go to America. 
 America? Unfinished business. 
 They drive on the other side of the road there. They do. 
 You might need some help with that. 
 The truth about the upper classes in this country is they're only interested in one thing - themselves. 
 As they see it nothing has changed and that's the way they like it. 
 They're selfish. 
 Now, forget Winston Churchill because let me tell you now the war is over he is no longer of any use to you. 
 We have to kick the Tories out, all of them. 
 New thinking, new industry, a new beginning. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the war is over. 
 Now, let the Labour Party build the peace. 
 
 
 
 Man : Jolly good show. 
 Thank you. 
 Hear hear! Hear hear! 
 Hear hear! Thank you very much. 
 (APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH) 
 Thank you so much. Hello. Excellent. 
 Excuse me, Mr Jones. Might I have a word. How can I help? 
 I'm a police officer. Detective Inspector Milner. 
 I suppose this is about my father. 
 Yes. 
 Follow me. Sheila, I'll be a few minutes. 
 I take it that was deliberate - trying to embarrass me in a meeting. 
 Not at all, sir. I wonder. 
 Your father was murdered, shot dead. 
 I'd have thought you'd want to see his killer brought to justice. 
 Unless, of course, I was his killer. 
 I assume I'm a suspect. 
 When did you last see him, sir? 
 Well, how quaint. 
 How very Agatha Christie. 
 I went to his house on the day he was killed. 
 Yes. I thought that would surprise you. 
 I didn't go in - I couldn't be bothered. 
 You'd had a big falling-out. 
 How very well informed. 
 My father was a reactionary. He didn't understand that though the war is over another war has begun. 
 A war against unemployment, poverty, ill health. 
 He didn't agree with your politics. 
 We parted company. 
 I even changed my name. Well, dropped part of it. 
 I didn't want anything more to do with him. 
 Your father was a very wealthy man. 
 I'm not interested in his money. 
 Woman : Mr Jones. 
 What can you tell me about a Russian handyman, a gardener, living at Redwood Lodge? A Nikolai... 
 Vladchenko. I don't want to talk about him. 
 Why is that? The whole thing was ridiculous. 
 I like the Russians, God knows what they've been through, but the idea that my father could actually adopt him. 
 Your father was considering adoption? 
 Yes. 
 Mr Jones...you had no contact with your father so how did you know? 
 Did you find out anything about the Russian House? 
 Well, the Russian House is a sort of safe house, a sanctuary for White Russians in London. 
 White Russians? White Russians are loyal to the old tsar and believe Stalin took the country from them. 
 Red Russians are Communists and loyal to Stalin. 
 But Niko was caught fighting for the Germans. 
 I'd imagine that's because he's a White Russian in which case he'd be pleased to be fighting against Stalin. 
 But Stalin was our side so he was fighting against us too. 
 Which is why he was a prisoner of war. 
 It's all very confusing but I just know he didn't kill anyone. 
 I hope you're right. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Sir. 
 Thank you. Foyle, come in. I'm glad to see you. 
 I'm afraid I owe you an apology. 
 I've rather wasted your time. 
 But it's all turned out well. 
 Spiakov is in our hands once again. 
 Oh. Well, I'm very pleased to hear it. 
 Where did you find him? He was here. 
 In London. Travelled from Hastings. 
 Don't know where he got the money. 
 Staying at a place called the Albion Crescent Hotel. 
 We had a tip-off from one of the staff. 
 Moved in and arrested him while he was still in bed. 
 Maybe I shouldn't have got you involved but I can't tell you how important it was. 
 I take it that's why you're here. Do sit down. Yes, that's right. 
 Wasted journey, I'm afraid. All done and dusted. 
 Well, not quite as easy as that. 
 Oh? Well, your man may well have got his money from the home of an artist, Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones, who, I'm sorry to say, has been found dead. 
 Yes, I think I read something in the papers. 
 What was it? A heart attack. 
 Well, you might say that. He was shot in the chest. 
 And this happened in Hastings? 
 A bit further down the coast near Brighton. 
 Is that within your jurisdiction? 
 Well, I've made it my business. 
 I'm not sure there's much you can do. 
 Spiakov's in Liverpool. He may already be on his way home. 
 Well, there's a second Russian, it seems, and we're now looking for him. 
 And um...you think he's in London? 
 It's possible. 
 I may be able to help you find him. 
 As you can imagine I have plenty of resources. 
 Do you have a name? 
 Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 Well, I can ask. 
 Where are you staying tonight? Not altogether sure. I'll find somewhere. 
 You must use my room at the Auxiliary Club. 
 Not strictly club rules but um... 
 Mum's the word. 
 On Pall Mall. Do you know it? 
 Yes, I do. Ah, well, we should have dinner together. 
 Let's meet say at eight o'clock, hm? 
 Thank you. Ah. Be good to have a proper chinwag. Mm. 
 Have you seen his file, sir? I don't need his file. 
 I was his CO for 11 months during the last show. 
 The security services don't like him. 
 He's crossed swords with them on two occasions. In the line of duty. 
 Beyond the line of duty. He's not an easy man to control. 
 What are you suggesting? You will remember, sir, I opposed the idea of him being approached in the first place. 
 Covering your back, Bennet? 
 This is the one. 
 So, I'm to find out everything I can about Ivan Spiakov, who arrested him, when and how. 
 That's right. 
 (SIGHS) Let's hope it leads us to Niko. 
 Good luck. 
 Bye, Mr Evans. I hope you enjoyed your meal. Thank you, Mrs Howard. 
 Diabolical liberty. That's the second time he's been in this month. 
 He's done every hotel in the area. 
 Who is he? Ministry of Food. He's an inspector. 
 Excuse me. 
 Come to check we don't charge more than five bob and only one protein a course. 
 As if there's enough protein in London to keep a dog smiling. 
 Who pays for Mr Evans entertaining himself day in and day out? 
 You and me, that's who. I'd like a room. 
 I didn't think you were here for the plumbing. Although be nice to see it sorted. 
 Can I have your identity card? Yes, of course. 
 Have you finished with that, Mr Wainwright? Right. 
 Here. And your ration book if you're staying more than a few days. 
 I don't think I'll be here that long. I'll get your key. 
 Oh, you're from Hastings? I'm sorry? 
 I couldn't help noticing your address. 
 What a coincidence. I've just driven up from there. I took the train. 
 Room 5. First floor. Stairs down there. 
 No smoking in the bedroom and no women visitors after 6pm. Right. 
 I'll be seeing you. I expect so. 
 I've a room at the back. Five shillings a night. Cash in advance. 
 Yes, Detective Inspector, I do know Maurice Jones. 
 He lives here? 
 There's a coach house round the back. 
 I rent it to him. 
 When he fell out with his father there was nowhere else for him to go. 
 You also kept him informed of his father's private affairs. 
 No. I would have thought Maurice was perfectly able to surmise for himself what was going on. 
 You never discussed it then? 
 What? The changed will. The adoption. 
 It may be... with the proximity... 
 Everyone knew about this Russian character and some people thought it very strange. 
 And you? 
 I knew Leonard for 30 years. 
 And his late wife. I've known Maurice since he was a baby. 
 And what happened... this great chasm that came between them, and all because of politics, I thought it was wrong. 
 There's a chance that Maurice will become an MP. 
 And good luck to him, Mr Milner, that's what I say. 
 The whole world's about to change, all of it. 
 And you, me, all the old values... 
 ..we're going to be swept away. 
 Maurice Jones did not kill his father. 
 It's nonsense to suggest it. 
 I don't know why you're asking me all these questions. 
 You're wasting your time. 
 Do you mind if I join you? I'm whacked. 
 Sam Stewart. I'm Adam Wainwright. 
 I saw...when you were signing in. 
 Ah. 
 So how long are you staying here? 
 I want to get out as soon as possible. 
 I have a hotel myself. 
 Well, a guesthouse, anyway. 
 Hill House. Do you know it? It's on Highcliff Street. 
 I know the area but I never noticed a guesthouse. 
 Nor do many of the guests. That's half the trouble. 
 Why are you here? In London? 
 I've come up to see the War Damage Commission in Piccadilly. 
 Had a bomb go through the roof. 
 Luckily it didn't go off but I've been trying to get a grant for repairs. 
 What's the problem? Everything. They want to see the accounts, the building certificate. 
 I don't suppose you fancy dinner. 
 You're a bit fresh. 
 Not really I just... I'm on my own and I assume you are too and it'd be nice to have someone to talk to. 
 So, what do you say? 
 I'm here with someone. 
 Oh, married. No, no. 
 No, we're working together. 
 But, yes, yes, I'd love to. 
 Maybe. 
 Let's see. Perhaps. 
 Right. 
 Mr Foyle. Welcome. 
 Allow me to present myself. 
 My name is Duveen. How do you do? 
 This is my house. Mm-hm. 
 My colleague and associate Alexander Anokhov. 
 What can I offer you? 
 Some tea? I won't, thank you. 
 Some caviar? 
 It is a great Russian delicacy which perhaps you have not developed a taste for. You may well be right. 
 So...I'm at your service, Mr Foyle. 
 Please have a seat. Er, no, I won't keep you a moment. 
 We looking for a young Russian - 
 Nikolai Vladchenko. 
 Nikolai. It's a good name. 
 It is the name of the last tsar, murdered by the Bolshevik scum who have taken over our country. 
 And the family name you said... 
 Vladchenko? 
 Alex? 
 I do not know the name. 
 When did he come up to London? 
 Just a few days ago, I believe. 
 There's also a friend of his - Ivan Spiakov. 
 Does that mean anything? Spiakov? 
 Do you have any idea where he is? 
 We know exactly where he is. He's under arrest. 
 Arrest? 
 Mm. 
 Neither of these men were here. 
 You're quite sure of that? 
 Have we given you any reason to doubt us? 
 Since you mention it, Vladchenko had nowhere else to go in London. 
 Spiakov told him specifically to come here and it'd be interesting to know, since you've no idea where I've come from, why he'd have had to have come up to London. 
 I beg your pardon? You just asked me when he came up to London. 
 Doesn't everybody come up to London? 
 Er, well, some people come down to London. 
 An awful lot of other people are already here. 
 I do not think I have anything to add to what I have already said. 
 I'm sorry, Mr Foyle. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 There you are. Thank you. 
 Excuse me, sorry to be a nuisance but there's no light bulb in my bathroom. That'll be a shilling. 
 I'm sorry? For the light bulb. 
 Isn't it included in the room? If it was you wouldn't be asking. 
 It's a shilling deposit. When you leave you give me back the bulb, I'll give you back the shilling. 
 Have you had any Russians staying here? Why do you ask that? 
 I'm looking for a man called Ivan Spiakov. You know him? 
 Sort of. He's a friend of a friend. 
 He was here for one night. He was taken away under arrest. 
 Oh. I didn't know anything about it and I don't want to. 
 The soldiers took him and that was the end of it. I knew it was a mistake having him here. 
 I'm afraid I haven't got a shilling. 
 Here, let me stand you. I've got a bob. 
 Are you ready to go? I'm certainly hungry. 
 We'll collect the bulb when we come back. 
 What do you fancy? For dinner? 
 Oh, roast beef, sherry trifle, champagne. 
 But I'm not going to get it, am I? 
 There's a 4/6d dinner at Clacy's. 
 Soup, fish and chips, tinned fruit. 
 Perfect. 
 So what are you doing in London? You said you weren't on your own. 
 I'm here with a man called Mr Foyle. 
 He's a policeman. I used to work for him. 
 And why is he here? 
 It's complicated but somebody got murdered. 
 An artist. Quite a well known one. 
 It's all tied in with these Russians. 
 After six years of war people should have had enough of killing each other. 
 What did you do during the war? I'm afraid I never shot at anyone. 
 I feel a bit guilty that nobody ever took a shot at me. 
 I did try to join the Army but I'd just come out of university, Cambridge, and they said they had other uses for me. 
 Don't tell me. You were in intelligence. 
 I'm not allowed to tell you but, yes, I was in intelligence. 
 Well, sort of. I spent the war in a place called Bletchley. 
 It was cold and horrible and the beds were worse than Mrs Howard's. 
 But I think we did a good job. 
 So how did you come to own a guesthouse? It was my aunt's but she died. 
 Blitzed? No, no. It was a boating accident. 
 I was always her favourite so she left it to me in her will. 
 When I left Bletchley I had nothing to with myself so I thought I'd give it a try. 
 God, I must have been mad. 
 Why's that? 
 There's this business with the roof, my receptionist ran off with a Yank and the cleaners left when their husbands came home. 
 It's a bit of a mess if you want the truth. 
 Ah, there we are. 
 This is the place. Oh. 
 Oh. It says the fish is off. 
 In what sense, I wonder? 
 Soup and chips? 
 Sounds delicious. 
 Passchendaele. Hm. What a bloody mess. 
 Do you ever think of it? 
 Not if I can help it. 
 I always knew the Hun would be back. 
 Versailles was a mistake. It was a humiliation. 
 They never forgave us for it. 
 So um...how's the room? Comfortable? 
 Very. Thank you. 
 I more or less lived here from the time of the Blitz. 
 Never knew when you'd need a clean bed. 
 It's been good catching up with you, Foyle. 
 Married, a son. 
 The police. Well, that's about it. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Well, when it was all over I went back to the family estate - farming in Kent. 
 Then in March '39, when Hitler walked into Prague, I reported back for duty. 
 I ended up at the War Office, as you know. 
 Ordnance and equipment. Not the most thrilling field of activity but I was glad to do my bit. 
 But, of course, people think the war's over but...it isn't. 
 Quite apart from the Japs, the whole of Europe is a gigantic mess. 
 Thousands of displaced persons wandering all over the shop. 
 Then there's the British zone in Germany. 
 Millions more depending on us. No butter, no fat. 
 Winter will be on us soon enough. 
 Be a miracle if half of them don't starve to death. 
 This is your responsibility? Well, my department. 
 Yet you still take a personal interest in a single fugitive in Hastings? 
 Forget about him. I have. 
 I asked you to help find him, we found him. There's an end of it. 
 You always were a bit bolshie, Foyle. 
 That's why I knew you'd make a good officer. 
 But this time um... 
 ..let me give you some advice. 
 What's that? There are things happening. The bigger picture. 
 It's good to have met up, to have dined together. 
 But you should go back to Hastings, leave well alone. 
 Well, I'm not sure that's possible now. 
 Why ever not? This has nothing to do with you. 
 It didn't until you asked me to become involved. 
 Since then there's been a shooting in the street, a suicide, a murder. 
 There are a lot of frightened people. 
 You're weeks away from retirement. 
 Go back to Hastings. 
 Forget this ever happened. 
 Your driver is here, sir. Oh, thank you. 
 Well, um...shall we? 
 Thank you, John. Good night, sir. 
 See you again. 
 By the way, um... 
 ..do you know you have a file with MI5? 
 Do I really? 
 I'm told they have you down as a troublemaker. 
 Mm. I wouldn't stay in London if I were you. 
 I wouldn't go back to the Russian House. 
 If you do...I may not be able to protect you from the consequences. 
 Do I still have the room? Just for tonight. 
 Thanks for dinner. 
 We have a problem. 
 We may have the same problem, Mr Bennet. 
 Where is Nikolai Vladchenko? 
 He's safe. So he's staying with you? 
 After what happened to Spiakov it seems the best place. 
 I'm afraid you'll have to hand him over. 
 He has to be got out of the country at once. 
 You are making life difficult for me, Mr Bennet. 
 Right now, life is difficult for all of us. 
 Do you think a single provincial policeman can be a threat? 
 Don't underestimate him, Monsieur Duveen. 
 He has a history when it comes to these things. 
 Wilson was mad to go to him, knowing the sort of man he was. 
 But too much has happened and it's too late. 
 We can't control him. We can't ask him to keep quiet. 
 So, what can I do? 
 Very well. It will be done. 
 Good night, Mr Bennet. Good night, Monsieur Duveen. 
 Morning, sir. Any luck? 
 Are you ready? Ready and waiting. 
 Morning. Is there a back way out of the hotel? Depends why you're asking. 
 There's someone outside I'd rather not - Is someone following you? 
 Could be. I don't want any more trouble here. 
 No, no trouble. It'd just help if there was a back way. 
 Turn right, down the stairs. Thank you. 
 Would they really send someone after you, sir? 
 You can never be too sure. 
 Why? Why would they do that? 
 Well, very good question. 
 No. 
 No. 
 Here we go. 
 Back to plan A, I think. 
 Sam? Argh! 
 Oh, my God! Adam! 
 (GROANS) 
 (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) 
 No, not the car. 
 Sir, down here. 
 (DISTANT DOOR OPENS) 
 (HEAVY FOOTSTEPS) 
 This was a really good idea, wasn't it? I'm sorry, sir. 
 (POLICE BELL CLANGS) 
 (BELL CLANGS) 
 (CLATTERING) 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Don't worry, love, he'll pull through. He hasn't paid for the room. 
 That's his coat. Thank you. 
 All right? 
 I think he's going to be all right. 
 Are you going to be all right? 
 Yes. 
 Sorry you got involved in all of this. 
 Who was that man you shot? 
 Do you know why he was sent to kill you? 
 I've got a pretty good idea. Let me tell you something about the Russians in your country. 
 They are even now being rounded up and sent home against their will. 
 Your Mr Churchill and Mr Eden... reached an agreement with Comrade Stalin at Yalta. 
 I don't understand. What happens to them when they get there? 
 On 18 April this year... a ship transport called the Almanzora docked at Odessa. 
 It carried Russians who had been repatriated from camps in Yorkshire. 
 The people of Yorkshire had given them food and clothes for the journey. 
 The moment they disembarked they were taken to a shed on the quay... and machine-gunned. 
 But why? Because they fought with Germans against Stalin. 
 And now he wants his revenge. 
 (SHOUTING) 
 But the news of what happened at Odessa has begun to leak out. 
 In the Russian community there are those who know what will happen when they return. 
 And they'll do anything to remain in this country, anything to avoid being sent back. 
 You have to understand that...this is happening in secret. 
 There are people even within the British authorities who'll do anything to keep it that way. 
 It is, I think, a scandal that could tear your government apart if it became known. 
 And it is perhaps for this reason that you had to be silenced. 
 The Russian safe house doesn't appear to be safe after all. 
 That has been my concern for many months. 
 Might that have anything to do with Duveen? 
 Monsieur Duveen is a traitor. 
 He's working for the Communists. 
 Last night he talked with the man who tried to kill you. 
 Do you really have no idea who that man was? 
 It is possible that he is a member of SMERSH. 
 Smiert Spionam. 
 It means death to spies. 
 Russian counterintelligence. 
 I'm afraid it is now too late to ask. 
 I would advise you to leave London now, Mr Foyle. 
 It is quieter, I think, on the coast. 
 But what about Nikolai? How are we going to find him? 
 I'm sorry. I cannot help. 
 (SIGHS) 
 So, you went to see Sir Leonard. 
 Who told you that? 
 Is it true? 
 Yes...but I didn't kill him. 
 You argued. Lots of people argue. 
 I used to work for him. 
 I worked for him for two years. 
 Then I went away to fight. 
 You were in Africa. I was in a lot of places. 
 And you came back and you wanted a job. 
 I wanted MY job. 
 The job he promised would be waiting for me when I got home. 
 Was that too much to ask? 
 Did you threaten him? I may have. 
 I was angry. I don't remember. 
 Are you...leaving Brighton? 
 There's no crime in that, is there? 
 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to stay until this is sorted out. 
 How long's that going to be? 
 I don't know. 
 You know, when I was out there, fighting the Jerries, there was only one thing I could think about. 
 Home. Coming back. 
 And now I'm back... there's nothing here for me, is there? 
 What was it all about, that's what I want to know. 
 No food in the shops. 
 No dancing in the streets. 
 It's like...people have already forgotten. 
 What was the bloody point? 
 Doing very nicely, Mr Wainwright. 
 We'll soon have you out of here. 
 Hello. Hello. 
 I've brought you some bananas. 
 Bananas. 
 I didn't know what to bring. Haven't had one of those in a while. That's very kind. 
 You didn't have to bring me anything. Mr Foyle and I feel very guilty about what happened. It wasn't your fault. 
 Actually, it was. The man with the gun was trying to shoot us. 
 Why? 
 Top secret, I'm afraid. 
 Well, I'm very glad I got in the way. 
 It was only yesterday I said I felt bad about not being shot at during the war. 
 Mind you, I didn't expect you to take me seriously. 
 Are you going to be all right? I'll be fine. 
 But the guesthouse, you're all on your own. 
 Well... Look, I don't mind lending you a hand if you like. 
 It's funny you should say that. I was going to ask but... 
 I thought you already had a job. 
 No, actually, I was working for that artist. 
 The one I told you about. The one who got murdered? 
 Yes. That's a recommendation(!) 
 What about Mr Foyle? Doesn't he need you? 
 Not any more. I'm completely out of work. 
 So, if you like, just for the time being. 
 I can't pay you very much. Make a change if anyone paid me at all. 
 Well, it looks like Hill House has a new... 
 What should I call you? Assistant manager? 
 Receptionist...plumber... chief bottle-washer. 
 You can start by peeling me one of these. I can't do it with one hand. 
 Well, I'm obliged to say I'm astonished. 
 Are you really saying this happened on the streets of London? 
 Well, I was quite surprised myself. 
 Well, it's an outrage. I shall demand a full report. 
 No need for that, I wouldn't have thought. Why ever not? 
 Well, largely because you know rather more than you're telling me. 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 Three quarters of a million displaced people and you're after just one. 
 Why was it so important to find him? 
 I told you. Oh, well, you told me that Russians are animals. Maybe some of them are. 
 Maybe that's how you justify to yourself what you're doing. But that's not the point. 
 It's all about what this Russian knew. 
 He knew exactly what had happened to his compatriots deported on the Almanzora. 
 And he knew about your secret policy of forced repatriation and you, of course, can't afford to let that get out. 
 It's not my policy. A directive came down about a month ago. 
 They have to leave. All of them. 
 You heard what Montgomery said. The party's over. They have to go home. 
 Even though they're going to be killed. We don't know that. 
 We have to be pragmatic. 
 There are more than 20,000 British prisoners currently in Russian hands. 
 We want them back as soon as possible. 
 That means co-operating with Stalin... whether we like it or not. 
 So we've fought two wars to end up being pragmatic. 
 What do you want, Foyle? 
 We could start with your resignation. 
 I knew nothing about what happened to you. 
 It must have been Duveen or Bennet, I don't know. 
 But I promise you a full inquiry. 
 Not necessary. The person sent to deal with me this morning followed me from the Auxiliary Club. 
 Only one person knew I was staying at the Auxiliary Club. 
 Are you suggesting I would condone murder? 
 Can you suggest any other explanation? 
 I'm not resigning. I haven't finished yet. 
 I want Vladchenko returned to Hastings. 
 Not possible. You should first of all consider the killing of Spencer-Jones. 
 The fact that Vladchenko was there and could very easily be called as a police witness. 
 That won't happen. I couldn't disagree more. 
 Are you blackmailing me? 
 I'm offering you the opportunity to keep your deeply-offensive secret a while longer at the expense of one of ex-prisoner and...your career. 
 You know where I am. 
 It's good to see you again...sir. 
 Captain Bradley, you might as well know that I have spoken to Nikolai Vladchenko and I know what happened at Redwood Lodge. 
 It was an accident. Perhaps you'd like to tell me in your own words. 
 I was just following my orders. 
 There was a Russian I had to pick up...from this place near Brighton. 
 I'd never met Leonard Spencer-Jones. 
 I knew his name, of course. 
 My brother, Tom, used to work there. 
 I took two other men. The kid was only 17. 
 I thought it was going to be a pushover. 
 You're not coming in. Sir, I have my orders. 
 I don't give a damn about your orders. 
 The Home Office know that this young man is under my protection. You've no right to be here. 
 Sir. Get out of my house! 
 Sir, my orders are to take Nikolai Vladchenko into custody. 
 If necessary I will do so by force. 
 Niko, get out of here. 
 Stay where you are. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 Stay where you are. You're not going to use that, not in my house. 
 Go, Niko! I'm warning you. 
 Give me that. 
 Sir. 
 I couldn't believe what I'd done but I knew there'd be trouble. 
 And I was stupid. 
 I took some money and I ransacked the place. 
 I thought I could make it look like it was the kid. 
 It was the only way. 
 What'll happen to me? 
 Are you going to arrest me? 
 I'd like to... but this isn't a police matter. 
 Since you were in uniform, exercising your duty, you have to face a court martial. 
 Milner. 
 That's not the case. He may have been in uniform on duty but the person he killed was civilian so it's a police matter. 
 Captain Bradley, I'm going to have to ask you come with me into Brighton to make a full statement. 
 You are under arrest. 
 Sir. Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, your first one. Glad to be able to help. 
 Sir. Mm. 
 Perhaps I owe you an apology. 
 That day at Redwood Lodge. 
 I'd say there's no perhaps about it. 
 You were rude, uncooperative, you defended a disrespectful junior officer and you upset Sam. 
 It's a poor return for the five years we spent together. 
 But if that's how you want to handle yourself now it's entirely up to you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I hope so. 
 How is it? Well, it's not at all bad. He's getting there. 
 Can you keep him on? I can always use a little help. 
 And when he wants to move there are people that I know. 
 Thank you. And what about you, Mr Foyle? 
 Nothing changes. You are still fighting. 
 Yeah, always fighting. 
 Churchill out! Election results! 
 Get your election results here! 
 Labour sweep into power! 
 Churchill out! Get your election results here! 
 A great day for the country. Thank you. 
 Thank you. It's a great day for the country. 
 Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen. 
 A great day. A new start. 
 Thank you so much. 
 You ought never to have kept that baby. Other girls gave them away. 
 I wanna get married and nobody can make that decision for me not you, not the Army, not nobody. 
 I recommend the colour bar be introduced. 
 This isn't America, it's Great Britain, and we don't practise segregation.
