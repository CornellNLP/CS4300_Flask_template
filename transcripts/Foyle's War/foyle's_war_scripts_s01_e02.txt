 [Thunder] 
 Sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Good evening. 
 You coming in? 
 I wasn't planning to. 
 I'm on my way back to my hotel. 
 Is it far? 
 Gloucester road. 
 Far enough. 
 [Thunder] 
 Looks like it's going to bucket down. 
 Why don't you come in? 
 I'm guy Spencer. 
 I'm speaking here tonight. 
 "Whose war"? 
 Are you a casualty? 
 Yes. 
 Well, it clearly wasn't yours. 
 The Friday club. 
 What is that? 
 Are you pacifists? 
 Nobody wanted this war. Did you? 
 I wouldn't have said I had much choice. 
 My point exactly. Alan. 
 Good evening, guy. 
 How is everything? 
 Not a great turnout, I'm afraid. 
 There's about 20. 
 People are getting scared to come. 
 Well, that's to be expected, I suppose. 
 This is a young friend of mine. 
 Paul milner. We met outside. 
 Alan fleming. 
 Well, let's get on with it. 
 You will stay? 
 Useful. 
 Guy : Some people say that Hitler is mad. 
 Well, they should ask themselves this-- is it a madman who has been able in 7 years to restore Germany to its position as one of the foremost nations of the world? 
 Is it a madman who has led his forces across Europe and who is even now knocking at our door? 
 Let me ask you a question. a true hero who served his country and has been crippled and cast aside. 
 Has he benefited or has he been used as Cannon fodder in a war we should never have begun? 
 Why can't you people find somewhere else for your filthy rabble-rousing? 
 [Spits] 
 Guy : Who is the real enemy? 
 The bolshevik and the Jew. 
 They were the enemies of Germany, and they are our enemies now. 
 And because I hold this belief I am called a fascist, a sympathizer, an agitator. 
 Well, believe me... 
 I am not a violent man. 
 This organization-- the Friday club-- does not believe in violence. 
 I think of myself as a patriot, who will do anything to serve the country that he loves. 
 But this is an unnecessary war and not our war. 
 And that is the truth that the British government is determined to hide. 
 [Applause] 
 [All talking at once] 
 Christopher, have you got a moment? 
 It's like piccadilly circus in here. 
 Yes, these new defense regulations-- evacuation, lighting, use of firearms, it's causing disaffection among members of his majesty's forces. 
 You're a bit overstretched, aren't you? 
 Things are ridiculous. 
 Apparently, in eastbourne the other day, a young couple parked in one of these regulated areas, and just as they were leaving, a constable pulled them over and told the driver he'd been in a prohibited area. 
 The young girl next to him went bright red. 
 And said, "don't worry, officer. 
 I didn't let him go anywhere near it." 
 Ha ha! 
 Now everyone's panicking. 
 The whole country's gone mad. 
 They're seeing German parachutists everywhere-- clouds, flying geese, ack-ack fire. 
 Ever since brussels fell, everybody's been waiting for this invasion to happen, and now they've begun to imagine that it already has. 
 The Germans are on the coast South of boulogne, which puts them only, what, 30 Miles from here. 
 Our forces have got nowhere to go. 
 North of boulogne, calais, ostend? 
 They're cornered. 
 So what will happen? 
 I don't know. That's a little bit worrying, though, isn't it, when the king feels it necessary to tell everyone to get on their knees for a national day of prayer. 
 Well, let's hope it works. 
 Anyway, I wanted to ask you a favor. 
 Are you busy? 
 Hmm, silly question. 
 I've got a young girl here--name of Edith johnstone. 
 She works as a chambermaid up at the white feather. 
 It's a hotel. 
 I know. 
 She's been caught cutting telephone wires just outside crowhurst. 
 Not good. 
 No. And it gets worse. 
 There's a military camp half a mile up the road. 
 Want me to talk to her? 
 Would you mind? 
 Where is she? 
 Downstairs. 
 Right. 
 You're still on for Sunday afternoon? 
 Sunday afternoon. 
 Absolutely. 
 Good. Because we're praying Sunday morning, aren't we? 
 Hello. 
 How are you? 
 Got everything you want? 
 I'd like a cigarette. 
 Ah, well, I'm afraid I don't smoke. 
 My name's foyle. 
 I'm a police officer. 
 And, um, you're in an awful lot of trouble. 
 What on earth did you think you were doing? 
 I mean, did your, um, I mean, where do your parents live? 
 They don't care about me. 
 That's not quite what I asked, is it? 
 I don't know where my father is. 
 My mum lives in Norfolk--hunstanton. 
 Do you know where that is? 
 Yes. 
 It don't matter. 
 She don't give a damn. 
 It seems very strange that a young girl like you, cutting telephone wires. 
 That's bad enough, but there's a military camp half a mile away. 
 Did you know there was a camp there? 
 Yes. 
 What on earth made you do it, then? 
 Do you want to help the Germans? 
 Is that it? 
 You must be very committed to risk your life because that's what you've done, I'm afraid. 
 I don't think so. 
 They'll be here soon anyway. 
 Another few days. 
 Who? 
 The Germans. 
 They've smashed the Dutch, the Belgians, and the French. 
 We haven't got a hope. 
 Any day now, they'll invade, and you'll be out of a job. 
 You'll be the one who's in jail. 
 And I'll be the one who's laughing. 
 All right. 
 So that's what you think? 
 That's what I know. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Where do you want these? 
 I...Don't know. 
 Actually, I'm not sure there's anywhere to put them. 
 Are these all unsolved cases? 
 No. 
 Oh. Sorry. 
 Well, if it's not important, we could move them up here. 
 Out of sight, out of mind. 
 Settling in all right? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Need anything? 
 We could do with some more space. 
 I'm all right. 
 I want you to find out what you can about an Edith johnstone of hunstanton, Norfolk. 
 Parents, background, schooling, political affiliations. 
 And also whatever we've got on a hotel called the white feather. 
 Right. 
 Sam : The white feather? 
 I thought that's what they gave people for cowardice in the last war. 
 Foyle : It is. 
 Do you think they'll hang her? 
 Sabotage in a time of war. 
 That's treason, isn't it? 
 Well, it's not actually been confirmed. 
 I wonder why she did it. 
 You have any idea? 
 Sam. 
 Sorry. 
 Can I help you? 
 Good morning, ma'am. 
 My name's foyle. I'm a police officer. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Are you the owner? 
 Margaret Ellis. 
 Yes. My husband and I run this hotel. 
 I understand you employ an Edith johnstone. 
 Edith. She's not in any trouble, is she? 
 She's been with us now for 5 or 6 months. 
 She's always seemed quite reliable. 
 And where did you find her? 
 She was working in a smaller hotel near Hastings before she came here. 
 The Crescent. 
 She have references? 
 Excellent references. 
 It's almost impossible to find good staff at the moment. 
 May I ask what it is she's done? 
 Yes, you can, but I'm not at liberty to tell you at the moment. 
 Oh, I quite understand. 
 Did she ever express any sort of political opinion? 
 Political? 
 Well, um, the way things are going, events in Germany, for example. 
 I really couldn't say, Mr. foyle. 
 It's never been my habit to hobnob with the staff. 
 [Door opens] 
 This is my husband--Arthur. 
 This is Mr. foyle, a police officer. 
 Good morning. 
 Really? Why? 
 I mean-- he's been making inquiries about Edith johnstone. 
 Edith? Where is she? 
 What's she done? 
 She hasn't done anything as far as I know, and I'm afraid Mr. foyle is refusing to enlighten me. 
 Uh, did she ever tell you where she came from? 
 Yes. She came from Norfolk. 
 Yes, yes. That's right. 
 Well, thank you for your time. 
 Why was he asking about Edith? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It's nothing to do with us. 
 Having the police here now? 
 We've got nothing to be afraid of. 
 We have nothing to hide. 
 We're breaking the law. 
 Arthur, we've been through all this, and I have told you, a week from now, there will be no law. 
 Who was that just now? 
 Oh, it was nothing, Mr. fleming. 
 A police officer. 
 What did he want? 
 He was just making inquiries about one of our staff. 
 Nothing important. 
 Good. 
 This is very decent of you, sir. 
 It's perfectly all right, Sam. 
 I've never been particularly fond of sandwiches. 
 I seem to have been brought up on them. 
 Too many tea parties. 
 These are very good, though. 
 My father says, you should always eat 4 times a day. 
 He says it's healthier. 
 He's a vicar, isn't he, didn't you say? 
 Mm. But he cycles and swims. 
 He's very fit. 
 And how's milner settling in? 
 He seems all right, sir. 
 I think he's glad to have a new leg, although the doctor says he wasn't supposed to wear it for another 6 weeks. 
 He seemed very determined. 
 There we are. 
 Miss, excuse me. 
 I wonder if you could help me. 
 I'm Dorothy. 
 Everyone calls me dot. 
 Dorothy, do you, by any chance, remember an Edith johnstone who used to work here? 
 Edie, yeah. Why do you want to know? 
 You're not her dad, are you? 
 Uh, no. I'm a police officer. 
 Is she in trouble? 
 No. How well did you know her? 
 Not that well, really. 
 She'd been working in London. 
 Then she came down here, but she said they weren't paying her enough, so she moved. 
 Oh. Lots of friends? 
 I couldn't say. 
 There was a man she used to walk out with. 
 And what was his name? 
 I don't know. I don't know anything about him. 
 They're a bit like that, aren't they? 
 What? 
 Boyfriends. 
 Here today, gone tomorrow. 
 And it's over so quickly, you hardly get to know what they're called. 
 He wasn't like that. 
 Was he a soldier? 
 I don't know what he was. 
 He was a nice boy. 
 Edie was crazy about him. 
 David. 
 That was his name, if you really want to know. 
 David Lane. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 Well done, Sam. 
 It's all right. 
 Is that the last lemon curd? 
 Yes. 
 Do you mind? 
 Not at all. 
 Ahem. Here we are, sir Ernest. 
 It's always such a pleasure to have you and lady bannerman here. 
 It's a pleasure to come. 
 And, of course, you're staying for tomorrow. 
 Absolutely. 
 That's why we're here. 
 Can I introduce miss harwood? 
 She's come all the way down from London. 
 She works in whitehall. 
 All very hush-hush, but I'm sure you'll be able to wheedle a few secrets out of her. 
 How do you do? 
 It's very nice to meet you, sir Ernest. 
 I've heard a lot about you. 
 And I've heard you speak out in parliament. 
 I think you're very brave. 
 Well, somebody has to face up to the facts. 
 I agree. 
 Excuse me. 
 When's guy coming down? 
 Tomorrow. 
 Oh. 
 Hmm. 
 I'm afraid I'll have to ask you for your identity card, Mr. woolton. 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 And it's for 2 nights? 
 At least 2 nights, yes. 
 Can I help you? 
 It's all right, dear. 
 Are you staying here? 
 Yes. My secretary made a reservation. 
 This is Mr. woolton, dear. 
 I must point out it is the policy of this hotel not to take Jewish guests. 
 I have his identity card. 
 I am not of the Hebrew faith. 
 Margaret : Good. 
 Oh, this is my son. He'll take your bags for you. 
 Room 6. 
 Oh, and, Mr. woolton, I'm afraid the main lounge of the dining room will be closed tomorrow night. 
 We have a private function. 
 I see. 
 [Birds calling] 
 Woman : So how did you get on today, then? 
 It was all right. 
 You haven't told me anything about it. 
 There's not much to say. 
 Did you catch any criminals? 
 It's not like that. 
 You know that. 
 It's just paperwork. 
 And I suppose that's all you can manage. 
 What does that mean? 
 Nothing. 
 So what's for tea? 
 Shepherd's pie. 
 Mm. 
 Here. Let me help. 
 Not with the leg. 
 You stay where you are. 
 It's aluminium. 
 Invented by a man called desoutter. 
 He was a pilot. 
 He lost his own leg in a plane crash. 
 Why do you think I want to know that? 
 I thought you might be interested. 
 It's part of me now. 
 I don't want to know. 
 And I don't want to see it. 
 At night when you're not wearing it, I don't want it in the room. 
 Jane. 
 A few months from now, we may be able to pretend it's not there. 
 That's too hot. 
 Uh, let it cool down. 
 Where are you going? 
 Just next door. 
 Get a cigarette. 
 [Clicks click click] 
 "Boulogne falls... 
 "The threat to this island grows nearer and nearer. 
 "While the people of britain "wait anxiously for news of their soldiers over the channel, "they must prepare for the onslaught which may come upon their soil." 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 We don't have to leave yet, do we? 
 It'll take us a while to get there. 
 It's not as if you can drive. 
 [Exhales] 
 Good of you to come, Sam. 
 Oh, it's a pleasure, sir. 
 Anyway, national day of prayer, I'm only obeying orders, really. 
 Oh, I see. 
 I just hope the sermon's shorter than one of my father's. 
 It is not wrong to be afraid. 
 Our enemies are close and might appear almost unstoppable. 
 We fear for our soldiers in northern France and Belgium. 
 This war, this terrible war, seems to have fallen upon us like a great darkness. 
 And it is hard to find the light. 
 But on this, this national day of prayer, I do not think we congregate here simply to ask God to help us to win, but to help us to find the courage to face whatever the future may bring, because it is in that courage, in that determination that we will find the strength to overcome. 
 Got it. 
 Hey, that's my hat! 
 Girl : Charlie, give it back... 
 Good morning, milner. 
 Good morning, sir. 
 I don't think you've met my wife--Jane. 
 How do you do? 
 Pleased to meet you. 
 Paul has told me a lot about you. 
 It was very kind of you to take him on. 
 I wouldn't put it quite like that. 
 I thought he was finished with the police force. 
 We both did. 
 Strange how things work out. 
 I used to think I was going to become a nun. 
 Oh, really? 
 But here I am, too. 
 It just goes to show. 
 Yes. 
 By the way, sir, I wanted to give you these. 
 Background on Edith johnstone. 
 Oh, right. 
 And I think I've found your David Lane. 
 I traced him through the department of labor. 
 He's a fisherman registered in Hastings. 
 Only one David Lane? 
 Actually, there were 2. 
 But the other one's 85. 
 All right. Well, good. Thank you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Bye. 
 Are you busy now, Sam? 
 No. You're not going to invite me to lunch? 
 No, I'm not going to invite you to lunch. 
 But the boat's coming in now, and I thought that, um-- 
 David Lane. 
 Yes. 
 Working Sundays? 
 There's a war on, Sam. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [All speaking indistinctly] 
 I'm looking for David Lane. 
 Oh, yeah? Who are you? 
 I'm a police officer. 
 The name's foyle. 
 What's he done? 
 Well, nothing, as far as I know. 
 Coming down here on a Sunday. 
 I don't suppose you want to ask him the time of day. 
 No. I want to ask him about somebody he knows. 
 David! 
 I'm Ian Lane. 
 I'm his father. 
 How do you do? 
 Yes, dad? 
 This is a policeman. 
 He wants to talk to you. 
 What about? 
 Edith johnstone. 
 David : She used to work at the Crescent, you know? 
 That's where I met her, and we walked out together. 
 The only girl I ever met who didn't mind the smell of fish. 
 She and me, we were talking about, you know, one day... 
 After the war. 
 It was just talk, dad. 
 She felt she wasn't earning enough. 
 She had to rent a room and all that, so she got a job up at the hotel, the white feather. 
 A bit more money and somewhere to stay. 
 It seemed like a good idea. 
 What's she done, anyway? 
 Why are you asking questions about her? 
 I'm afraid she's under arrest... 
 What? 
 For sabotage. 
 She was found cutting telephone wires near a military camp. 
 You've made a mistake. 
 It doesn't appear so. 
 I said, you've made a mistake. 
 She wouldn't do a thing like that. 
 Sabotage? 
 That's rubbish! 
 David! 
 I want to see her. 
 That's enough. 
 Let him go. 
 Mr. Lane, I'm not the one who placed her under arrest. 
 In fact, I'm actually trying to help her. 
 [Sarcastically] Oh, yes. 
 And I can't help her unless you help me. 
 Foyle : I mean, was she not very happy? 
 She was afraid. 
 That's what I thought, anyway. 
 When I first met her, she was a laugh, but later... 
 Did she talk to you about how she felt about the war? 
 She talked, yes. 
 But it wasn't her words that came out of her mouth. 
 Look, she said lots of things. 
 There were meetings, rich people coming from London. 
 She wanted to tell me, but I never listened. 
 I'm not interested in all that. 
 She changed. 
 That's all that mattered to me. 
 She wasn't the same. 
 You felt that she was being threatened, maybe? 
 No. 
 I don't know, but I can't explain it to you. 
 It was more like... 
 That she was ill. 
 We stopped seeing her. She came here less and less. 
 It was that bitch up there--Mrs. Ellis. 
 She poisoned her mind against us. 
 That's what she did. 
 I'd have gone up there and sorted her out myself if-- if I hadn't stopped you. 
 Maybe I still should. 
 That's enough of that. 
 Foyle : I don't think there's anything to be gained by going back to the hotel. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 You're the one who's got her under arrest. 
 Hello, guy. 
 Alan. 
 How was the journey? 
 Bloody. 
 How's everything here? 
 The beds are lumpy. 
 The food's atrocious. 
 I wasn't asking about the accommodation. 
 The bannermans arrived yesterday. 
 The honorable John mowbray and his wife came this morning, and the Gilberts are here. 
 What about miss harwood? 
 Yesterday evening. 
 Why the interest in her? 
 And how about our host--Mrs. Ellis? 
 She hasn't said anything. 
 I see. 
 Guy! 
 Oh, my dear guy. 
 How very good to see you. 
 And you. 
 Stanley, the bags. 
 You're just in time for lunch. 
 Oh, good. 
 Margaret : Now, tell me, how are things in London? 
 Rather too Cosmopolitan at the moment, I'm afraid. 
 We're having a lot of refugees being forced on us right, left, and center-- 
 Dutch, Belgians, but also slavs, latins, and all the rest of it. 
 There are streets in Paddington and bloomsbury that you would hardly recognize. 
 Oh, you'll soon point that right. 
 Absolutely. With your help, Margaret. 
 [Soft laughter] 
 Oh. Oh, hang on. 
 I don't know how you do it, Christopher. 
 What's that, your fourth? 
 Yeah. 
 If I don't take something home for tea, I'll be shot. 
 Well, you can have one or 2 of these. 
 That's cheating. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I've caught enough now. 
 You come and fish here. 
 What do you think would happen if there was an invasion? 
 Well, the likes of us will be lined up against the wall and shot, I suppose. 
 That's comforting. 
 Incidentally, I met the, uh, owners of the hotel. 
 Of the white feather? 
 I don't know quite what we're uncovering there, but I come away feeling distinctly unclean. 
 I mean, Edith johnstone, there. 
 She obviously went in as a sweet, charming young thing, and--I don't know-- something happened to her in there. 
 You think you can help her? 
 Well, I'll try. 
 I mean, if they hang her, what a complete waste of a life. 
 David : I want to see her. 
 You could be her best friend, her father, and the king of england, but it wouldn't make no difference. 
 She's not seeing anyone. 
 She didn't know what she was doing. 
 Well, she didn't mean to hurt anyone. 
 All right, I'll show you who's... 
 I'll show you. 
 I'm afraid the hotel is closed this evening. 
 I'm staying here. 
 I have a room. 
 Oh, yes? 
 Room 6. 
 Well, I'm afraid the public rooms are closed. 
 I was told. 
 A private function. 
 An evening lecture. 
 And what's the subject? 
 The war effort. 
 Very commendable, I'm sure. 
 So, um... 
 There. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We'll need to have it witnessed. 
 Yes. 
 I'll find fleming. 
 You're a true patriot, Margaret. 
 What do you want? 
 I was looking for you. 
 Why? 
 Can I ask you something, father? 
 Yup. 
 Do you enjoy having these people here? 
 What do you mean? 
 They're guests. 
 You always have to dodge the question, don't you? 
 Oh, Stanley. 
 It's mother, isn't it? 
 She's the one that wants them here, not you. 
 They're sick. 
 You shouldn't talk like that. 
 Why not? 
 You don't understand. 
 They'll come, they'll go. 
 They won't do any harm. 
 I'm not so sure of that. 
 Why do you say that? 
 I was in room 6 just now-- 
 Mr. woolton's room. 
 What were you doing there? 
 Guess what I found. 
 What? 
 What did you find? 
 Tell me. 
 Good evening. 
 [Door slams shut] 
 [Laughter] 
 [Piano playing] 
 Guy : I'm afraid the days are long gone when you can believe anything put out by the BBC. 
 Oh, yes, the whole thing's a complete fiction. 
 Of course, London isn't the same anymore. 
 Full of refugees. 
 We stayed at the metropolitan. 
 It was full of Jews. 
 Simply ghastly. 
 You don't know what Ernest said. 
 There aren't enough foreskins here to cover a threepenny piece. 
 [Laughter] 
 Harwood : Dodging the call-up, queue-jumping, profiteering-- they're the worst offenders. 
 It's a fact. 
 Well, I've stopped buying the  express. 
 It's completely obvious, of course, that the press is very largely under Jewish control. 
 Yeah. 
 What's happening in Germany-- they brought it on themselves. 
 They've only got themselves to blame. 
 [Imitating Jewish accent] 
 The army wants blankets, so now I make blankets.

 Guy : It's quite possible that the war is already over. 
 Good news for those of us who said it should never have happened in the first place. 
 The British army is outnumbered, surrounded, and will soon be destroyed. 
 I take no pleasure in so many young lives being sacrificed on the altar of politicians. 
 But I say it again. 
 This was an unnecessary war. 
 The British government has misled its people for long enough. 
 What's going on? 
 Margaret : I'm so sorry. 
 It's a fuse. 
 Do sit down. Arthur? 
 It's all right, dear. 
 [Door opens] 
 Who was that? 
 Don't worry. This will only take a minute. 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 [Gunshot] 
 My God! 
 Ernest : My God. 
 What's happening? 
 Keep down! 
 Guy. 
 I'm all right. 
 Margaret! 
 Foyle : Guy Spencer? 
 Sam : Was he one of the guests? 
 Guest speaker, it would seem. 
 Do you know who guy Spencer is? 
 No. 
 Friday club? 
 He's one of those mosleyites, pro-Nazi, anti-war, anti-semitic. 
 It's a shame someone didn't shoot him. 
 Perhaps they tried. 
 Mr. foyle? 
 I'm guy Spencer. 
 This is my colleague and assistant-- 
 Alan fleming. 
 I gather you're handling the investigation. 
 That's right. 
 Good. 
 I'm very glad to see you. 
 Margaret Ellis was a fine, intelligent woman and a close personal friend. 
 You were here the other day. 
 I saw you leaving. 
 Yes. Um, forgive me. 
 You assist Mr. Spencer how exactly? 
 I organize his diary, I set up meetings. 
 Right. 
 And a meeting-- that's why you were here? 
 This was an informal meeting of friends. 
 We were here to discuss the war and the likely direction it might take. 
 I'd get a move on with this investigation if I were you. 
 You could be out of a job in a week. 
 Oh, if the-- the Germans invade-- guy's not really being serious. 
 It's certainly a possibility. 
 And would I be right in thinking it's something you'd approve of? 
 I don't care what you think, Mr. foyle, of me or of my politics. 
 I was here in a private capacity. 
 I was not breaking the law. 
 But last night, someone took a shot at me-- 
 3 shots, to be precise. 
 And like it or not, it is your job to find out who. 
 So you don't think it was Mrs. Ellis that was the intended target? 
 Guy's had death threats before. 
 I was standing here. 
 Mrs. Ellis was sitting there, and her husband, Arthur, was on the other side. 
 Her husband? 
 He was a member of the group? 
 Association. No. 
 I don't think he's entirely in sympathy with our views. 
 He was fiddling with his pipe all the time I was talking. 
 And who else was here, then? 
 A miss harwood. 
 She's a secretary from London. She was there. 
 The Gilberts. 
 Sir Ernest and lady Caroline bannerman were there. 
 The right honorable John mowbray and his wife, lady Helen. 
 John is the son of lord mowbray. 
 An elevated association. 
 The Duke of westminster is one of our loyal supporters. 
 You could say that our influence extends as far as the palace. 
 So it could well be the case that it was one of your loyal supporters who took a shot at you? 
 The shots came from the door. 
 It was pitch-black in here when the lights went out, but I heard the door open just before the shots were fired. 
 Someone coming in. 
 Or going out. Right. 
 On the subject of which, when can we leave? 
 I have work to do in London. 
 I would like to be gone by lunch. 
 Well, not possible, I'm afraid, Mr. Spencer. 
 I just need everybody to be here for the time being. 
 I see. 
 Can I ask you a question, Mr. foyle? 
 Are you, by any chance, Jewish? 
 [Door opens] 
 You! 
 Yes, you. 
 Young woman... 
 I want to speak to your commanding officer. 
 You mean detective chief superintendent foyle, sir. 
 I don't care what his name is. 
 I want to leave this hotel. 
 I'm afraid that's not possible. 
 He gave strict orders that everyone-- do you know who I am? 
 No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't got the faintest idea. 
 I am sir Ernest bannerman. 
 Sir Ernest is the mp for this constituency. 
 You have no right whatsoever to keep me here. 
 And this lady, miss harwood-- she has important work in whitehall. 
 I have to be in London. 
 I'm at the foreign office. 
 I'll be missed. 
 You're a driver. 
 You can take me and my wife home and then take miss harwood to the station. 
 Come along. 
 I'm afraid you'll have to ask Mr. foyle, sir. 
 What? 
 Are you defying me? 
 Yes. 
 It looks as if I am. 
 I can't believe it happened. 
 It's a terrible thing. 
 I was right beside her when the lights went out... 
 Inches away. 
 Maybe they were firing at you. 
 Were you due to speak at this meeting, Mr. Ellis? 
 No. Certainly not. 
 Did you not share your wife's political opinions? 
 I didn't say that. 
 Neither of us did. 
 We did what we were told. 
 So what happened after the lights went out, then? 
 I got up. 
 She told me to mend the fuse. 
 So you left the room? 
 It was too dark. 
 Well, evidently, somebody did because fleming said that he heard the door open before the shots were fired. 
 That was Rosemary harwood. 
 Foyle : How did you know that? 
 I was just outside. 
 But how did you know it was her if you couldn't see her because it was too dark to see anything? 
 I smelt her. 
 She, um-- she wears lavender water. 
 Oh. 
 I'd say she wears it by the bucket. 
 Right. 
 It was definitely her. 
 I don't think miss harwood could have shot mother, if that's what you're thinking. 
 They all adored her-- ate out of her hand. 
 You don't appear to be very moved by your mother's death. 
 Do you find that shocking? 
 Well... 
 Sorry. 
 I believe in honesty. 
 So, you were, um-- yes, I was-- sat just there. 
 At first, the lights started flickering, and they went out. 
 It was the fuse, by the way. 
 I replaced it. 
 Does it happen often? 
 Yes, all the time. 
 It's overload. 
 The electrics can't take it. 
 Anyway, it was pitch-black, what with the blackouts and everything, so... 
 I didn't see anything. 
 And did you hear anything of what was being said? 
 No. I heard the gun. 
 At the time, I assumed someone had taken a potshot at Spencer, and I wasn't surprised. 
 Why is that? 
 Stanley : The case was on the bed here, and the gun was in the case. 
 And you saw the gun how? 
 The case was open? 
 Yes. 
 It was open already or did you open it? 
 I opened it. 
 Oh. Why would you do that? 
 I'm curious about people. 
 So am I, but I don't feel the need to go through their belongings. 
 I study psychoanalysis, Freud. That's what I do. 
 Who turns down the beds? 
 I do... 
 Though father did last night. 
 Did you say his name was-- 
 Robert woolton. 
 I think he must have left during the night. 
 Father saw his identity card. 
 There's an address in London, I think. 
 Um... 
 You must be what, 22? 23? 
 I'm surprised you haven't been called up. 
 22. 
 It's because of my eyes. 
 So you saw the gun in the case, and what did you do then? 
 I told my father. 
 And, of course, he didn't want to know. 
 So I told mother. 
 And what did she do? 
 I suppose we'll never know. 
 Everything all right, sir? 
 Mr. foyle, I'm very sorry if guy rubbed you up the wrong way just now. He does that sometimes. 
 I'm sure. 
 There's something I forgot to mention. 
 Last night, there was somebody in the garden. 
 I saw them just before dinner. 
 He was about 20 years old, well-built, fair hair. 
 I'd have said he was a laborer of some kind. 
 I had the idea he was trying to break in. 
 He was definitely trying not to be seen. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 There's something else you ought to know. 
 Spencer : Fleming? 
 And what's that? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Never mind. 
 Good-bye  foyle : So we can't even be certain who was meant to be the victim here-- 
 Margaret Ellis or Spencer. 
 But the bullets were grouped very close together. 
 One hit Margaret Ellis, one hit the wall behind her, the other hit her chair. 
 Suggesting that she was a target. 
 Other people who were there? 
 Well, the bannermans you know about, and I've run a check on Rosemary harwood. 
 She  is  with the foreign office-- very senior. Reports directly to lord halifax. 
 Is that possible, sir, I mean, if she's with the Friday club? 
 Well, it's not a crime...Yet. 
 Actually, sir, I should have mentioned to you-- 
 I met guy Spencer when I was in London. 
 Oh, yes? 
 I wandered into one of his meetings. 
 Right. 
 There's not much to say. 
 There was a lot of talk about the war, about why we're fighting. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 He's got some very original ideas. 
 Um, the man that calls himself Robert woolton. 
 The address he gave the hotel-- 37 domville road-- it doesn't exist. 
 It was probably a false identity card. 
 He made 2 telephone calls from the hotel. 
 I'm already looking into it. 
 What about the man that was seen outside? 
 Fair hair, in his twenties. 
 What was he doing? 
 David Lane? 
 We're going to ask him, and in the meantime, I want the hotel searched and the grounds. 
 If it is woolton's gun, we got to be sure that he didn't take it with him. 
 
 
 
 Harwood : What are they doing? 
 Spencer : Searching for the gun, I suppose. 
 How much longer can he keep us here, this Mr. foyle? 
 Yes, it is irritating, isn't it? 
 Being pushed around by a provincial policeman with ideas above his station. 
 They're not looking for the letter? 
 No. 
 No. They know nothing about that. 
 You've done us a great service, miss harwood. 
 It won't be overlooked. 
 I think you should destroy it. 
 They're everywhere. 
 Yes, but they know nothing. 
 Don't worry. 
 They won't find it. 
 I'll keep it safe. 
 Man : Hey! 
 You were there. 
 No, I wasn't. 
 You're lying. 
 You were seen. 
 You ask my dad. 
 You told me you were going because you blamed her, Margaret Ellis, for what had happened. 
 I never hurt her. 
 So you admit you were there. 
 No. I didn't say that. 
 But you were. 
 You're gonna have to come with us. 
 I'm not going anywhere! 
 Sam, get in the car. 
 Right. 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Panting] 
 [Brakes squeaking] 
 Well, lost him. 
 [Birds calling] 
 Man, voice-over : Dear dad, well, here I am in you know where. 
 If I mention the name, someone will only cut it out. 
 So I'll say I had haggis for lunch today, and it was revolting. 
 We're well into training now. 
 Lectures all day and not nearly enough time in the air. 
 We're flying lysanders-- great, fat beasts that grumble all the way down the runway. 
 But at least they're reliable once they're up and almost impossible to stall. 
 I got a wonderful view of the coast last night just as the sun was coming down. 
 Sometimes it's hard to believe what this is all about, that there's a war, and the news from France-- not so good. 
 Anyway, I'm eating well, drinking far too well. 
 It's a good crowd here-- optimistic and all determined to get out there and do our bit. 
 How's Hastings? 
 Strange to think of you so far away and on your own. 
 But hopefully, I'll get a bit of leave before my wings exam, and we can go out and catch a trout or two. 
 Look after yourself, dad. 
 As always, Andrew. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 It's terrible about the Belgians. 
 The papers are full of it. 
 King Leopold giving up like that. 
 I think he's a coward. 
 They say the government will go on fighting anyway without him. 
 Our king would never behave like that. 
 Jane. You won't even look at me. 
 I'm reading the paper. 
 I'm going to work. 
 This murder investigation-- how's it going? 
 I don't know. 
 It's complicated. 
 We found the fisherman. 
 Who? 
 The man who ran away, David Lane. 
 He was picked up by 2 policemen trying to get on a train for London. 
 And now you can go and interrogate him or whatever it is you do. 
 Things are going to be how they were, Jane. 
 Really? 
 I promise. 
 Sam : That's it--there. 
 Foyle : Right. 
 Can I... 
 No. 
 I just thought I'd ask. 
 Won't be long. 
 [Bell rings] 
 That's him. 
 [Bell rings] 
 Can I help you? 
 Mr. woolton? 
 My name is wolf. 
 Quite possibly, but you used the name woolton on your false identity card when you checked into the white feather hotel. 
 How did you find me? 
 You made 2 telephone calls from the hotel to the number at this address. 
 You are? 
 I'm a police officer. 
 I see. 
 I didn't shoot anybody. 
 It wasn't me. 
 But you took a gun to the hotel--this one. 
 Is this your gun? 
 That's mine. 
 Look... 
 I admit I went to the white feather to kill guy Spencer. 
 I took a gun-- that gun. 
 But imagining something and doing it are two very different things. 
 Anyway, I never had a chance. 
 I was in my room. 
 The lights went out. 
 I heard 3 shots. 
 I didn't know what was happening. 
 But as soon as the lights came back on, I looked in my case and the gun wasn't there. 
 I swear to you that's the truth. 
 Why did you want to kill Spencer? 
 Come upstairs. 
 Wolf : It's all right. 
 Get some rest. 
 Thank you. 
 This is my nephew. 
 His name is Isaac wolf. 
 Isaac, this man's a police officer. 
 [Groans] 
 He's come a little late. 
 He isn't interested in you. 
 Nobody was interested in what happened to him. 
 What has happened to him? 
 He was beaten up by members of the Friday club. 
 He almost died. 
 He still can't walk. 
 They left him in the street. 
 But I can feel my legs. 
 It's an improvement. 
 Isaac's family is still in Germany. 
 They're in a concentration camp. 
 If I had shot Spencer, I wouldn't have done it in the dark. 
 I would have wanted to see his eyes. 
 It's quite a coincidence, you and I meeting again like this, wouldn't you say, milner? 
 Yes, I suppose it is. 
 Did you manage to read any of that material I gave you? 
 Some of it. 
 And? 
 I don't know what to think. 
 You have to think for yourself, sergeant. 
 That's the whole point. 
 That's why you need the facts. 
 This is another book I was going to lend you. 
 Here. 
 Protocols of the elders of zion. 
 It traces the Jewish conspiracy all the way back to the time of Solomon. 
 I think you'll find it interesting. 
 I don't know. 
 Hmm, have a read of it. 
 And if you can't manage to give it back to me personally, then you can pop it in the post. 
 Is that it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You're a good chap, milner. 
 This business here, it's an embarrassment, of course, but we'll get through it. 
 And when the war is over, which could be soon, believe me, it's going to be very important to have the right friends. 
 [Bell ringing] 
 Mr. foyle... 
 I wonder if you'd mind coming with me, sir. 
 Where's my driver? 
 Please, sir. 
 This way, sir. 
 Detective chief superintendent foyle, do come in. 
 Take a pew. Tea? 
 No, thank you. 
 My name is Lawson-- military intelligence. 
 You've already met my colleague-- tom baddeley. 
 I do hope you'll forgive the slightly rough ride, sir. 
 Yes, I'm sorry to drag you here like this, but you see, this investigation of yours-- this murder-- 
 I'm afraid it's got tangled up with one of our own operations. 
 Oh, dear. I am sorry. 
 Are you sure you won't have tea? 
 Perfectly. 
 Well, I will. 
 Would you mind, tom? 
 One of your operations being the Friday club? 
 Yes, the Friday club, British vigil, the British union of fascists-- they're all much of a muchness-- anti-semites and aristocrats. 
 Guy Spencer, though, is a bit more of a nuisance. 
 He's more active than the rest of them, and he's certainly more persuasive. 
 Why hasn't he been arrested? 
 He soon might be. 
 You know, of course, that we arrested mosley. 
 And ramsay. 
 But sometimes it's better to keep these people at-large, provided we can keep an eye on them. 
 Mm. Thank you. 
 We have an undercover agent in the Friday club. 
 He rang us yesterday. 
 That's how we knew about you. 
 Alan fleming? 
 Baddeley : How did you know? 
 Well, perhaps a little too helpful. 
 I'd prefer it if his cover wasn't blown. 
 That's why we had to get you up here so quickly. 
 Does he know anything about the death of Margaret Ellis? 
 Oh, I doubt it. 
 To be honest, the shooting of that woman was both annoying and irrelevant. 
 To you perhaps. 
 We need your help, Mr. foyle. 
 It goes without saying that all this is extremely confidential. 
 5 days ago, a letter went missing from the foreign office. 
 The letter was written by a senior member of lord halifax's staff and was addressed to giuseppe bastianini, the Italian ambassador here in London. 
 In very broad terms, the letter was examining the possibility of the Italian government mediating between us and Hitler; In other words, coming to a negotiated peace. 
 The position of the government, of course, is that we fight on. 
 So I'm sure I don't need to tell you what a catastrophic effect on morale it could have if it was believed that any minister at any level was seeking a way out of this war. 
 Rosemary harwood works in lord halifax's office. 
 We believe that she may have taken the letter. 
 She's been active with the Friday club for a while now. 
 We think she took it down to the white feather to pass it on to guy Spencer, who has all the right connections to make sure it reaches the German authorities. 
 And why haven't you arrested her? 
 Maybe we should have, but we can't now, not without the letter. 
 Oh. 
 We couldn't go in and search the hotel without compromising our man, which we'd rather not do. 
 But you and your officers-- you have every reason to go over the place. 
 Well, we've already done that and found the gun that we were looking for. 
 I'm sure you could find a reason to do it again. 
 I thought we'd already searched this place once. 
 Yes, we have. 
 What are you looking for now? 
 A letter. 
 To whom? 
 To giuseppe bastianini. 
 Who's he? 
 He's the Italian ambassador. 
 Is he a suspect? 
 I only asked. 
 This is an outrage. 
 I'm warning you. 
 I have powerful friends in London. 
 You'll hear more of this. 
 [Door shuts] 
 [Door opens] 
 You're going through a lady's room. 
 No gentleman would behave this way. 
 No, you're right. 
 But then again, murder isn't a very gentlemanly business, miss harwood. 
 I can't imagine what you hope to find. 
 It seems on the night of the murder, you left the room before the shots were fired. 
 Who told you that? 
 I have nothing to hide. 
 I hate the dark, I always have. 
 It's like claustrophobia. 
 As soon as the lights went out, I had to get back here. 
 In the dark? 
 I told you. 
 I wasn't thinking. 
 I just had to get out. 
 Just a minute. 
 Foyle, is this the way your men amuse themselves? 
 I've had enough of this. 
 I'm not gonna be pushed around by some bloody stuffed shirt. 
 I want to leave. 
 Still not possible, I'm afraid. 
 Fleming : I said, I want to go! 
 Officer, arrest this man. Thank you. 
 What?! 
 Fleming : Thank you for that. I take it you didn't find anything. 
 No sign of it, I'm afraid. 
 But she might, of course, have panicked and got rid of it. 
 Well, I doubt it. 
 It's too valuable, and taking the letter in the first place was too much of a risk. 
 I'm surprised Spencer hasn't, um-- let's go in here--hasn't mentioned it to you. 
 He still trusts you, doesn't he? 
 Well, he's told me he's got it. 
 He's just not saying what he's done with it. 
 He likes to play these things close to his chest. 
 Well, it's certainly not in the hotel. 
 We'll just have to keep looking. 
 So, what about the shooting? 
 You think Margaret Ellis was the target? 
 Do you? 
 Well, there was nobody in the room who had any reason to kill her... 
 Except Arthur Ellis, perhaps. 
 He didn't have it in him. 
 The son? 
 Perhaps. 
 He could have opened the door. 
 But how would he have been able to see to take aim? 
 I'll tell you one thing, though. 
 I happen to know for a fact that Mrs. Ellis changed her will hours before she died. 
 She added a codicil leaving half her money, and that includes half the hotel, to the Friday club. 
 All for the cause. 
 Spencer persuaded her, do you think? 
 He's good at that sort of thing. 
 It's not the first time either. 
 He was arrested 5 years ago-- intimidation, embezzlement. 
 He's got his hooks into your sergeant, too, for that matter. 
 I'd watch out, if I were you. 
 Well, they certainly met in London. 
 Rather more than that. 
 They had dinner together after the meeting. 
 Spencer's taken him very much under his wing. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 [Ring] 
 Excuse me. 
 [Ring] 
 Foyle : Mr. Lane. 
 Ian : You've got my boy locked up. 
 Well, he ran away. 
 He was off to London. 
 He was afraid of you! 
 He's no criminal. 
 Well, assault, drunk and disorderly, skipped bail, did borstal--August to November last year. 
 That was then. 
 It hasn't been easy for him living on his own with me. 
 He lost his mother when he was 9. 
 She ran off. 
 It's just been two of us. 
 And yes, he mixed with the wrong set and became a cropper with the law. 
 You people never forget. 
 Won't let him forget neither. 
 It's a bit more than that, isn't it? 
 He was seen at the hotel on the night of the murder, which means he could easily have been the one who took the gun and shot Mrs. Ellis. 
 He never shot anyone. 
 All right, he shouldn't have gone up there. 
 He hasn't got it in him. 
 You take it from me. 
 I want him back. 
 I'm afraid you're going to have to wait. 
 No, you don't understand. 
 I need him now. 
 They're asking for boats-- fishing boats, ferries, clippers, you name it. 
 We're going across where the army's stuck with the Germans bombing them and tanks moving in and God knows what. 
 They've put together a whole fleet of boats. 
 And we're going over there, and we're going to bring back our boys. 
 It's already begun. 
 They say there were nearly 30,000 of them saved yesterday, and there's going to be 30,000 more today. 
 I can pick up 20 men in my boat. 
 A drop in the ocean, you'd say? 
 But there's hundreds of boats all along the coast doing the same-- hundreds and hundreds of them. 
 Only I can't do it without David. 
 Lady rose  is too much for me to handle on my own. 
 So you have to let him go so we can leave together. 
 You let my boy out, and I promise you-- 
 I swear on everything I hold sacred-- 
 I'll bring him back to you. 
 I won't let him run away. 
 We'll do this journey. 
 We'll go there, we'll come back, and then you can keep him for as long as you need, as long as it takes you to realize that he's innocent-- as innocent as you or me. 
 [Men shouting commands] 
 Dunkirk. 
 Do you think you'll ever see him again? 
 Foyle : Yes. 
 He'll be back. 
 [Horn blows] 
 [Horn blows] 
 [Horn blows] 
 2 of diamonds. 
 2 no trumps. 
 3 spades. 
 Pass. 
 Pass. 
 Pass. 
 3 spades it is, then. 
 Ahh, I can't help you much, I'm afraid. 
 Ahh, for God's sake. 
 How much longer can they keep us here? 
 Till after tea, anyway. 
 Arthur, you think you should be working after everything that's happened? 
 No, no. I have to keep busy. 
 Yes, of course. 
 You and I have business to discuss about your late wife's affairs. 
 What? 
 Seems we're going to be in partnership. 
 That's not-- when the Germans arrive, the high command, we'll be able to put them up here at the hotel. 
 We're near enough to the coast. 
 They won't arrive. 
 I don't know why you're kidding yourselves. 
 The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true. 
 Stanley. 
 No, dad. I'm fed up with it. I'm fed up with the lot of them. 
 If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago. 
 You do know that the Belgians have capitulated? 
 Yes. But we'll fight on. 
 That's what Mr. Churchill says, and I believe him. 
 I think you must be insane, father, if you believe what these people say. 
 They're sick. 
 And they don't know a thing. 
 [Door slams] 
 These notes are very good, very thorough, milner. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I'm afraid they don't tell us the one thing that we need to know-- who fired the shots. 
 Or why they were fired in the dark. 
 And if Spencer was the actual target... 
 That's very likely. 
 Why wait for an after-dinner meeting when everyone's around? 
 Easier and less risky to wait until he's left or leaving the hotel or even gone up to his room and shoot him while he's asleep. 
 Yes, I know. 
 I wondered about that. 
 Why wait for the exact moment when the lights go out? 
 Because you can't be seen. 
 Well, you can't see either. 
 How do you know you're getting the right target? 
 You spoke to woolton? 
 Yes, it was his gun, but I don't believe for a second he fired it. 
 And it was thrown away, wasn't it? 
 He'd have taken it with him. 
 How about David Lane, sir? 
 He could have taken the gun, made his way through the hotel. 
 Maybe the lights went out just as he was about to fire. 
 They were all in the room, the room was blacked out, the door was closed. 
 Stanley was sitting right outside. 
 Then he'd have seen him. 
 Exactly. 
 What about Stanley Ellis? 
 He wasn't exactly fond of his mother. 
 What's the opposite of an oedipus complex, do you think? 
 Sir? 
 He was reading Freud, who said the aim of all life is death--matricide. 
 Could he really have killed his mother? 
 These, um... 
 Background notes on Spencer: Well-connected-- journalism, treasurer for the friends of national Spain. 
 No criminal convictions? 
 No. None that I could find. 
 What do you make of him? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I'd say a man has to be quite brave to hold the opinions he does, especially at a time like this. 
 You admire him? 
 I don't think he's a fool. 
 I mean, you read the medical report of...Isaac wolf, the man who got beaten up? 
 I don't think you can blame Spencer for that, sir. 
 He knew nothing about it. 
 How do you know? 
 He told me... 
 And I believe him. 
 Margaret Ellis' will-- he had the most to gain from it. 
 I still think that Spencer was the likely target, sir. 
 All right. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 Sam : Arthur Ellis-- who'd want to kill him? 
 Foyle : I don't know, but you probably do. 
 My guess is, he probably saw something. 
 That's what always happens. 
 He sees something, then the killer has to silence him before he can say what he knows. 
 How is he? 
 His heart had stopped. 
 It was touch and go for a while, but we managed to revive him. 
 They're just getting him to hospital. 
 And what was it? 
 Veronal, I'd say. 
 Some sort of sleeping draft, anyway, in his whisky. 
 Who found him? 
 His son. 
 All right. 
 My father was late coming down to breakfast, so I went to call him. 
 I found him lying on the bed fully dressed, and at first, I thought he must have had some sort of heart attack. 
 I don't know. 
 Did he often have whisky before bedtime? 
 I don't know. 
 This your dad's? 
 Yes. 
 He didn't smoke it much. 
 And, um... 
 And you say you... 
 Haven't... 
 Touched anything? 
 No. 
 I thought he was dead. 
 I called the police. 
 Well, for... 
 Someone whose mother's been murdered and father's been poisoned, you seem remarkably unaffected. 
 What would you like me to do, cry? 
 I never liked my parents. 
 My mother was cruel and stupid. 
 What she said about the Nazis and the rest made me sick. 
 My father... 
 Was scared of her, totally under her thumb. 
 It was her place, you see. 
 No, you have no idea what it was like living here. 
 It's always the same. 
 If you had read Freud, you'd know how much damage your parents do to you. 
 It starts... 
 Even before you're born. 
 Ah, yes, you read, uh... 
 Yes. 
 I wanted to study psychoanalysis. 
 I wanted to go to university. 
 They wouldn't let me. 
 Well, Stanley, lying is never very clever, but lying to a police officer is a very serious offense. 
 I'm not lying. 
 Everything I've told you is the truth. 
 Mr. Ellis? 
 Yes. 
 How are you feeling, Mr. Ellis? 
 Can you tell me what happened? 
 You don't know? 
 Well, you didn't leave a note. 
 No. 
 Whisky and a sleeping draft-- it's fairly evident you tried to take your own life. 
 Why was that? 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 Not to me. 
 People had the wrong impression about Peggy. 
 She was a strong woman, opinionated. 
 But they don't understand. 
 I'd been married to her for 22 years. 
 She was everything to me... 
 Everything. 
 Stanley is 22? 
 Yes. 
 We were courting when Peggy found she was expecting, so, yes, I did the decent thing. 
 But that doesn't change anything. 
 I'd have married her anyway. 
 I loved her, always did. 
 Were you aware of the changes your wife made to her will? 
 Spencer is a swine. 
 I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen to me, and so now... 
 Half the hotel. 
 How do you expect me to go on living when... 
 Everything I care about has been taken away from me? 
 Do you cure your own meat at the hotel? 
 What's that got to do with anything? 
 Would I be right in thinking that? 
 I don't know. 
 Yes. 
 Margaret was in charge of the kitchen. 
 Thank you. 
 Christopher, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. 
 Sir Ernest bannerman, the mp at the white feather, he's managed to pull rank. 
 He's made some phone calls, and the long and the short of it is I had to release the lot. 
 Ok. They've all gone? 
 Yes, they went this morning, except Spencer. 
 He's here, and he wants to talk to you. 
 All right. 
 How can I help you, Mr. Spencer? 
 You're holding my assistant, and unless you're going to charge him, I'd like to have him back. 
 You're very welcome to him. 
 Just a minute. 
 I haven't finished yet. 
 Are you any closer to finding out who killed Margaret Ellis, or, for that matter, who tried to kill her husband--Arthur? 
 I want you to know that I shall be making an official complaint-- arresting fleming, keeping me detained for 3 full days. 
 I think you've acted well beyond your authority, Mr. foyle. 
 Sorry, sir. 
 It was normal procedure. 
 Normal or not, it was unnecessary and inconvenient. 
 Have you finished now, Mr. Spencer? 
 I'm a politician, Mr. foyle. 
 And the way you've treated me, I think you have forgotten that I am the leader of a legitimate organization with legitimate views, even if you don't agree with them. 
 But I'd like you to know that I am just as much a patriot as you are. 
 I love our country. 
 But it is possible to believe that this war with Hitler is misguided. 
 Poles and Czechs, they're Jewish interests, not British. 
 I know what you believe. 
 I don't think you do. 
 I doubt that you know, for example, that the first 2 British pilots shot down over Germany were black shirts. 
 The kiel raid at the end of last year-- they were both mosley's men. 
 And sir Ernest bannerman, mp-- 
 I suppose you would call him a crank and a traitor. 
 Well, he served in the first war. 
 He was a member of the north Russian relief force in 1919. 
 Right now, he has a son serving in northern France. 
 You have a son serving with the raf. 
 Are you prepared to lose him, to see him slaughtered simply because Hitler invaded Poland? 
 I'll take you to Mr. fleming. 
 Thank you, milner. 
 You see, we're not so different, you and I. 
 We would both welcome an end to this war. 
 By the way, you will let me have that book back if you've finished with it, won't you? 
 Sir... 
 [Distant gunfire and men shouting commands] 
 [Airplane] 
 Your unit number? 
 I need your name, rank, and regiment... 
 [Men speaking indistinctly] 
 I'll see if I can help, sir, if that's all right. 
 Go ahead. 
 [Airplanes] 
 [Speaking indistinctly] 
 I didn't expect to see you here. 
 Well, they told me you were back. 
 And you thought you'd come for David before he scarpered. 
 No. I've come to tell you that I know he had nothing to do with the murder. 
 We picked up 15 of our boys... 
 15... 
 And there were thousands of them there. 
 You've never seen anything like it-- white sand stretching out for Miles... 
 Ships everywhere-- hundreds of them. 
 Motorboats, trawlers. 
 Picking up 15 here and 15 there. 
 You know, we're gonna get the army out of there. 
 We're gonna do it. 
 There were bodies. 
 You saw them on the beaches. 
 And as we went in there, the Germans were coming after us-- stukas, dorniers. 
 I was lucky, though. 
 There was some sort of refinery burning and the smoke-- it protected us for a while. 
 Where is David? 
 I told you I'd bring him back to you. 
 Here he is. 
 He waded in the water to help someone out. 
 He was helping them onto the boat-- they're here. 
 They made it home. 
 But he took a bullet. 
 It came out of I don't know where, and... 
 He was as near to me as you are, and I saw the light go out of his eyes. 
 But I said I'd bring him back, and I brought him back, even though it meant taking up space that could have been used by someone else. 
 Here he is. 
 Edith : Dead? 
 Foyle : Yes. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 But why? 
 He weren't a soldier. 
 The war was nothing to do with him. 
 Why did he have to go? 
 Well, he believed it was right. 
 Edith, whatever Margaret Ellis has told you, there isn't going to be a German invasion now, not today, not tomorrow, perhaps not ever. 
 How did she frighten you into cutting the wires? 
 She didn't. 
 What did she say was going to happen to you when the Germans came? 
 Nothing. 
 She knew, didn't she? 
 She knew that your grandmother is Jewish? 
 She said I wouldn't be allowed to work anymore. 
 She said I'd be put in a camp... 
 [Sobbing] 
 That she wanted to look after me, but first, I'd have to prove myself... 
 Do something to show I was on her side. 
 I didn't think it would matter that much. 
 I knew it was wrong. 
 I thought someone would find them and mend them. 
 [Edith sobbing] 
 I didn't think I was being a traitor. 
 I was just so scared. 
 What will happen to me? 
 Will they hang me? 
 Will I go to prison? 
 No. 
 Don't have a case to answer. 
 You're free to go. 
 Well, thank you. 
 It's ok. 
 You're not going to forget David, are you? 
 No. 
 'Cause he was right, wasn't he? 
 Yeah. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 You should understand, Stanley, that you could go to prison. 
 But I haven't done anything. 
 Yes, you have. 
 You've lied to me, a police officer, and obstructed the course of justice. 
 No, I didn't. 
 You told me you hadn't touched anything when you went into your father's room, which isn't true, is it? 
 You took your father's suicide note. 
 No. 
 There was pen and paper up there on the desk. 
 And when I visited him in hospital, he was as surprised as I was that the note hadn't been found. 
 What did you do with it? 
 I destroyed it. 
 Why? 
 To...Protect him. 
 Suicide is against the law. 
 Well that's another lie, isn't it? 
 I mean, what did it say? 
 I won't tell you. 
 I can't. 
 Arthur...You feeling any better? 
 Yes. 
 Thanks. 
 Arthur, I'm sorry to have to tell you that I'm here to arrest you for the murder of your wife. 
 That's absurd! 
 The husband who loves his wife so much that he'd rather kill himself than live without her is a little way off the truth, isn't it? 
 It's true! 
 Peggy was the backbone of my life. 
 Arthur, Arthur, you hated her. 
 Your son knew it, everyone knew it. 
 Probably often dreamed of killing her, didn't you? 
 But you never had the nerve, because everyone also knew that you were terrified of her. 
 And as the coward at the white feather, you rather resented being something of a local joke until, of course, you began to believe that the world was about to change. 
 What do you mean? 
 That a Nazi invasion of england would cause so very much disruption that there'd be no effective police force and no law, as such. 
 There would be no reason and nobody to investigate an insignificant... 
 Little murder at a countryside hotel. 
 Spencer believed in the invasion, your wife believed in the invasion, and, ironically, as it turned out, she convinced you. 
 And, uh... 
 It was the night of Spencer's talk, wasn't it, that Stanley... 
 Told you about the gun, didn't he? 
 Stanley, voice-over : I was in room 6 just now, Mr. woolton's room. 
 What were you doing there? 
 Guess what I found. 
 What? 
 What did you find? Tell me. 
 Foyle, voice-over : You thought you could make it look as if Spencer was the actual target, and your wife had been hit accidentally, which is why you arranged for it to happen in the dark, by leaving all the lights on in all the rooms as you turned down the beds, which overloaded the fuse box. 
 But then you had to be sure that you could actually hit your wife and not Spencer. 
 I take no pleasure in so many young lives... 
 Foyle, voice-over : Spencer said that during his speech, you were fiddling with your pipe, but, you see, Stanley told me that you hardly ever smoked. 
 It was... 
 Potassium nitrate you used in the pipe, saltpeter, which is used, of course, in gunpowder, but it's also used to cure meat, which is why you had a supply of it in the hotel. 
 And it acted as an oxidizing agent, and it... 
 Added to the tobacco and made it glow. 
 You lit the pipe while Spencer was making his speech. 
 I take no pleasure in so many young lives being sacrificed on the altar of politics. 
 The British government has misled us long enough. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm so sorry, everyone. 
 It's a fuse. 
 Do sit down. Arthur? 
 Foyle, voice-over : And when the lights went out, you put it directly in front of Margaret so you could use the glow as the target. 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Foyle, voice-over : You got rid of the gun as quickly as you could. 
 It wasn't yours anyway. 
 And after that, you were biding your time until... 
 The invasion. 
 But it never came. 
 Stanley, voice-over : I don't know why you're kidding yourselves. 
 The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true. 
 Stanley. 
 No, dad. 
 I'm fed up with it. 
 I'm fed up with the lot of them. 
 If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago. 
 Foyle : No invasion, and you panicked. 
 You were going to be found out after all, and you decided to... 
 Take the easy way out. 
 Yes. 
 I wanted to kill myself. 
 And Stanley destroyed your suicide note, understandably. 
 A fascist for a mother, a killer for a father-- not shining examples of parental guidance. 
 No wonder he was reading Freud. 
 What will happen to me? 
 You'll be tried for murder, Arthur. 
 I loathed her, you know... 
 And the scum she brought to the hotel. 
 Didn't give you the right to kill her. 
 Please tell Stanley I'm sorry. 
 Tell him... 
 I wish I'd been a better father. 
 I think he knows. 
 Yes. 
 Milner, sit down. 
 Congratulations on the arrest. 
 Ellis has signed a full confession, so I suppose that's that. 
 Why didn't you tell me about your association with Spencer? 
 I told you we'd met. 
 You told me you'd wandered into one of his meetings. 
 You didn't tell me you then went and had dinner with him. 
 I didn't think it was relevant. 
 Principal suspect in a murder inquiry-- of course it was relevant. 
 He didn't commit the murder. 
 Well, we didn't know that then. 
 In your notes about him, there's no mention of his arrest for embezzlement. 
 Was that irrelevant, too? 
 He was acquitted. 
 That's by the way. 
 But more than this, more even than your apology to him in front of me, and something that I take to be a personal betrayal, is that you talked to him about me. 
 He knew I had a son in the raf, and he could have only got that from you, isn't that right? 
 I did speak to him, yes. 
 And I'm sorry if I betrayed any confidences. 
 But I never said anything lacking in respect. 
 Speaking to him at all was a lack of respect and a lack of judgment. 
 I'm astonished you can't see beyond the front of these people. 
 Do you really believe what these people--Spencer and the Friday club--have to say? 
 No! You don't have any idea what's it's been like since Norway, how I feel. 
 I'm not asking for any special favors, and I--I don't want your sympathy. 
 But I don't understand why it happened, and I don't understand what it was for. 
 At least Spencer made me feel like he was on my side and that I'm not to blame for it all. 
 He had a reason. 
 There was a reason, milner. 
 What do you mean? 
 I don't agree with his views, but guy Spencer is a good man. 
 Milner, I'm sorry to have to disillusion you, but... 
 Is this the book he lent you? 
 "The protocols of the elders of zion--  how the Jews plan to overthrow christianity and conquer the world." 
 Have you read it? 
 No. 
 Are you anti-semitic? 
 No! 
 Is Hitler right doing what he's doing to the Jews? 
 No! You don't understand. 
 I just wanted the facts. 
 Spencer gave them to you? 
 While he was at the hotel, Spencer took possession of a letter smuggled out of whitehall and given to him by a traitor--Rosemary harwood, and given to him in the hope that he'd pass it on to the enemy. 
 After the murder, Spencer was trapped. 
 He had the letter, but he didn't know what to do with it. 
 He gave it to you because you were the one person at the hotel we wouldn't dream of searching. 
 After the investigation, you'd send it back to him, and he'd pass it on to the Germans. 
 Do you want my resignation? 
 No, I don't want your resignation. 
 That's the last thing I want. 
 I can't do this bloody godforsaken job on my own. 
 What I want is to forget all of this happened and, more importantly, for you, starting now, to be with me 100%. 
 In spite of whatever problems you're going through, it's important that you and me and Sam are able to trust each other and we're on the same side. 
 Is that understood? 
 Yes, sir. Understood. 
 Good. 
 That's all. 
 Radio : We've known them and laughed at them, these fussy little steamers, all our lives. 
 We've called them the "shilling sicks." 
 We've watched them load and unload their crowds of holiday passengers, the gents full of high spirits and bottled beer, the ladies eating pork pies, the children sticky with peppermint rock. 
 But now, look. 
 This little steamer, like all her brave and battered sisters, is immortal. 
 She'll go sailing proudly down the years in the epic of dunkirk. 
 And our great grandchildren, when they learn how we began this war-- by snatching glory out of defeat and then swept on to victory, may also learn how the little holiday steamers made an excursion to hell and came back glorious. 
 Man : I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh, shall I see God. 
 And I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold... 
 I've got a son the same age.
