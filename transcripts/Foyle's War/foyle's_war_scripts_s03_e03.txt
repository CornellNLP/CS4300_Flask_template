 [ AIRCRAFT ENGINES ] 
 [ AMBULANCE BELL RINGS ] 
 Feindliche Flugkraefte, 260 Grad. 
 Welche Hoehe? 
 Schwer zu sagen. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Scheisse! Es ist getroffen! 
 Gottlieb. 
 Sie gehen unter. 
 Ich kann es nicht lenken mehr. 
 Gottlieb ist tot. 
 Wir muessen springen. 
 Ich kann die Maschine nicht beherrschen. 
 Wir sind verloren. 
 Wir gehen unter. 
 Unsere Position ist 46 Grad Nord, vier Grad Sued. 
 Aus! 
 Walk on. 
 Whoa! Whoa, boys. That's it. 
 Good boys. 
 [ MOOING ] 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Good girls. That's it. 
 Hard to believe it's spring, sir, what with the air raids. 
 Plane crashes. 
 Road blocks. How many have we been through? Six, sir. 
 Bombs last night, and lambs are being born this morning! Spring. 
 And the smell of cordite in the air. 
 Doesn't make any sense, does it, sir? I agree. 
 Much appreciated, Chief Superintendent. 
 We're stretched pretty thin. 
 Three of their planes down and one of ours. 
 I shouldn't look, miss. The chute didn't open. He's a bit of a mess. 
 Has that been cut? 
 Looks like it. 
 Two more of them landed safely across the valley. 
 We found the chutes, but the Jerries had hopped it. 
 The dogs picked up their scent. 
 Now, it seems they were heading that way. 
 Back towards the plane? 
 Yes. Yes. It looks like it. 
 We should take a look. 
 All right? 
 (WOMEN GASP) 
 God bless America! 
 We paid for it. 
 The Yanks are making money hand over fist from this war like anyone else. 
 Why do you have to be so rude? 
 Why do you have to stay here and not in the hostel? 
 Because the Land Army billeted me. 
 Rose and Joan stay here. 
 We have cows to milk at 5am. 
 Do you want to help us? 
 (BOTH GIGGLE) 
 How the hell did you pull that one off? 
 I put in for one of them 14 months ago. 
 You won't need one if they took your farm. 
 If you and you pals on the committee threaten me and my farm, if you set foot on it, I'll blow your heads off! 
 You step out of my yard, Curling! 
 [ SHOUTING ] 
 Get off him! 
 Get out of it! 
 Get off my land, boy! 
 A Dornier, I'd say, sir, from the tail. 
 Three crew. 
 One of them's still in there. 
 I fished out some bits and pieces. 
 Three crew? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I don't understand why the two that landed safely would be heading back to this. 
 I'd make for the coast, wouldn't you? 
 That would make sense. 
 We should take a look for them. 
 Would you come? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Um Gottes Willen halten Sie mit. 
 Tom's home day after tomorrow. 
 That's of no interest to you. 
 You think you're going to snare my boy? 
 Yeah. Why shouldn't I? 
 You shan't get my boy, and you shan't get the farm. 
 I have worked hard - 
 You can always go back to London. 
 Sir, through there. 
 My back's killing me. 
 I'll leave you with lover boy. 
 I know. Don't make a scene. 
 For God's sake, Rose! 
 [ GUNSHOTS ] 
 Halt! 
 That's all. 
 He's not armed. 
 Stellen Sie sich nicht so an. 
 The parachute has nearly broke my arm. 
 You both speak English? 
 Yes. It is normal. 
 The other airman who jumped with you didn't make it, I'm afraid. 
 The cord to his parachute seemed to have been cut for some reason. 
 Der defekte Fallschirm war fur mich gemeint. 
 Wovon sprechen Sie? 
 Ich weiss zu viel uber das Funkmessegerat. 
 Seien Sie still! 
 Sie haben mir den defekten Fallschirm gegeben. 
 Verdammt! Seien Sie still. 
 What are your names? 
 Oberleutnant Schimmel. 
 And yours? 
 Sabartovski. 
 Right. 
 The plane you arrived in needs only a crew of three, it seems. 
 There were four of you. One on the plane. One in the valley, and you. 
 I was wondering if you'd... 
 Right. Hande hoch. Hande hoch! 
 Private Jackson, stop that. Treat them with the respect they deserve. 
 Major Cornwall, Prisoner of War Interrogation Service. 
 You're very welcome, gentlemen. 
 Private Jackson. 
 If you wouldn't mind? 
 Can I have a word? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Having spoken to these two not everything's quite as it should be. 
 Thank you for the tip-off. 
 Major - 
 We're very grateful for your help, but we'd prefer it if people didn't speak to prisoners. 
 We are the experts. 
 We run a very sophisticated show. 
 Amateur sleuthing is, of course, understandable, but...unhelpful. 
 Right. 
 Thank you. 
 [ AIRCRAFT ENGINES ] 
 [ THUD OF BOMBS ] 
 [ GUNSHOTS ] 
 (Oh...God.) 
 [ GUNSHOTS ] 
 Whoa! 
 Hello, lover boy. 
 Hey! 
 She's gone out, that Barbara. 
 And Tom's here. 
 I know. 
 Let's do it, then. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 Oh! 
 Morning, sir. 
 Morning. 
 Is this how you found him? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Why wouldn't it be suicide, then? 
 There's no note. 
 And when they use a shotgun don't they normally blow their heads off? 
 Recently fired? 
 Recently fired, sir. 
 Recently drunk as well, wouldn't you say? 
 Scotch? 
 Mm. 
 Is there a wife? 
 No, sir. But there's a son, Thomas. 
 He found the body. 
 Well, it was about 6am. 
 Cos I'd just arrived from the barracks. 
 24-hour pass. On my bike. 
 There's Dad just dead in his chair. 
 Why would he have killed himself, do you think? 
 I don't know. 
 [ MOOING ] 
 Oi! Can't you hear them cows? 
 Your little friend won't let us get on and milk 'em. 
 Their titties are going to explode if we don't! 
 Well, do. Go ahead. 
 Well, thank you very much. 
 We'll take him, too, if you can spare him. Certainly. 
 Are you not with them? 
 No. I don't work here. 
 Right. But you're in the Land Army, yeah? 
 No. I'm wearing this for a dare. 
 I'm a pole selector. 
 I select poles. 
 I survey woodland to find trees suitable for felling for pit props, for roadblocks, and poles. 
 Right. 
 Did you know Mr Jackson? 
 Not really. 
 I've only been here a few days. 
 First impressions? 
 Not too different from most men. 
 Rude. 
 Lazy. Lascivious. 
 And ignorant. 
 Right. I see. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Well, don't let me keep you. 
 But if you'd let us know where you'll be, I'd appreciate it. 
 So you don't live at the hostel? 
 Sometimes we do, but with the early start, sometimes we stay here. 
 In the house? 
 In the cottage. 
 Right. Sorry, it's Joan...? 
 Joan Dillon. 
 Joan Dillon. And Rose...? 
 Rose Henshall. 
 Thank you. And Mr Jackson lived alone in the house? 
 Yeah. 
 I suppose with the air raid it would have been impossible to hear anything like gunshots? 
 Ha! We heard plenty. 
 Did you? 
 Curling was rabbiting. 
 Curling farms the land just beside here. 
 Right. 
 Shooting all night he was. 
 Right close, an' all. Stupid man! 
 He was angry with Hugh - Mr Jackson. 
 Oh. Why was that? 
 You'd better ask him. 
 Right. 
 Where's erm... 
 ..Mrs Jackson? 
 What do you mean? 
 Thomas's mother. 
 She pushed off with a farm labourer 10 or 12 years ago. 
 Oh. Fine. Thank you. 
 Ah. Leutnant Sabartovski. 
 Wie ich sehe, haben Sie etwas Trockenes zum Anziehen bekommen. 
 Yes. Thank you, Major. 
 Now, the relevant authorities have been notified you're alive and well. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I have to ask you some routine questions. 
 You're a Luftwaffe navigator? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And you're part of the crew of the Dornier? 
 I would like to help, Herr Major, but my duty is only to tell you my name, my rank - 
 Oh, absolutely. Don't you worry. 
 We play it right by the book here. 
 Geneva Convention, 1929. 
 It's your duty to tell me nothing. 
 And it's my duty... to ask you to tell me everything. 
 Und? 
 Ging gut. 
 No sign of the whisky bottle, sir. 
 No? 
 No. What's that? 
 It's a bullet. 
 It's covered in blood. 
 It's from a pistol. 
 What do you think? Fired from here. 
 Passes through him. 
 Finished off with a shotgun to make it look like suicide? 
 Clever. But not... clever enough to fool us, eh, Milner? 
 Being the amateur sleuths we are. 
 Well, quite. 
 But as far as everyone is concerned we'll stick with suicide. 
 Until someone tells us otherwise. 
 Yeah, that sort of thing. 
 Sir... 
 ..you'd better come. 
 Barbara Hicks has found a German. 
 Put your hands up, you murdering Hun! 
 Put your hands up or I'll shoot your head off! 
 And you. 
 Is this your land? 
 It should be. Who are you? 
 We're the police. 
 Thank you for your help. 
 I think we can manage this now. 
 Are you Mr Curling. 
 Yes. 
 Get him out. 
 Pulse. 
 Steady, sir. 
 Hm. Where's that gone? 
 Luftwaffe lieutenant. 
 See if he's got any more ID. 
 Sir. 
 A bullet from a pistol killed Jackson, didn't it? 
 This man had a pistol at some point. 
 Yeah. But rather limited opportunity on the face of it. 
 He's a bit short on motive, too. 
 German High Command identify farmer as vital to British war effort. 
 Drop man with pinpoint accuracy in tree at Jackson Farm. 
 Man assassinates target, then returns to hang from tree. 
 So perhaps not our main suspect, then. 
 Maybe not. 
 Someone could have taken his pistol while he was hanging half-conscious from the tree, then used it to kill Jackson. 
 Yep. 
 Miss Hicks for instance? 
 Yep. 
 Get him into the car. 
 I'll have a word. Sir. 
 Have you found anything? 
 No, sir. 
 I didn't see him come down. I assume it happened during the raid. 
 And directly you found him you came to the farm? 
 Of course! I wasn't going to get him down on my own. 
 English men are bad enough without getting tangled up with Germans. 
 But even if he fell during the raid he wasn't here at 4am. 
 How do you know that? 
 I was here at 4am. 
 I came to get a glimpse of the badgers. 
 There's a sett at the edge of the meadow. 
 The raid was over by 4am, wasn't it? 
 Yes. And you were here and you didn't see him? 
 I didn't see him because he was not here to be seen. 
 And you'd be sure of that because...? 
 Because this is Quercus Robar. 
 Just as beautiful in the dark. 
 Difficult to distinguish a pistol shot in the middle of an air raid. 
 So difficult to be precise about when Mr Jackson died, unless you know different - nobody else seems to know. 
 I'm sure the others told you we were treated to a night of gunfire. 
 Some from the raid, but mostly from the...inbred moron living next door. 
 Mr Curling? 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 Where did you get your opinion of men? 
 Experience. 
 (COUGHS) 
 Danke. 
 He's rallying. 
 He seems very shaken, though. 
 May be a bit concussed. 
 Must have fallen out of the tree with an almighty wallop. 
 Get him to the farmhouse. See what he has to say when he comes round. 
 Should I let Cornwall know we've landed another airman? Yes. 
 But no rush. 
 This is going to go into tomorrow. 
 See if you can't get us somewhere local for the night. 
 That'd save petrol, sir. 
 I'm going over to Curling, see what he has to say. 
 That'd save even more. 
 Wouldn't it. 
 Shall we give Miss Hicks a lift to the farm? Yes, do. 
 Good luck. 
 Everything in the Garden of Eden was tickety-boo until the women showed up. 
 Them girls. 
 Hugh Jackson was sitting there drunk, watching the weeds grow. 
 Then in the Autumn of '39 he got the girls in. 
 I was offered an' all, but I didn't think they'd be much cop. 
 I never fancied a woman could do it. But them two? 
 Look at 'em. 
 Them's a miracle, and that's that. 
 You and Jackson didn't get on. 
 What was the problem there? 
 He got on the local committee. 
 The War Ag. 
 Two years back I was ready to buy some of his land. 
 Then he's on the committee. 
 He gets grants. He's gone up the queue for a tractor. 
 Now he's trying to get the committee to evict me for not putting more of my land under the plough. 
 They did that to a family at Newnham. They told me to grow flax, hoping I'd fail - to give them some excuse. 
 It's far too temperamental a crop. 
 You have to pull it up by hand. 
 We've no drainage, but his bottom meadow is perfect. 
 You never see the committee forcing him to plough that up. 
 Why would he kill himself, then? 
 His wife. 
 He never got over that. 
 She just pushed off with this farmhand, Andy Neame. 
 Just left Jackson with the boy. 
 But that's when he took to the drink to be fair to him. 
 This the chap, then? 
 Yes. We're waiting to interview him. 
 Major Cornwall. Prisoner of War Interrogation Service. Welcome. 
 Is he hurt? 
 He was concussed, but he's come round. Good. 
 Put him in the car. 
 Sir, I'm not sure you understand. 
 Excuse me! 
 I'm not sure you understand. 
 Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle. Detective? 
 Afternoon. I thought you said you were a farmer. 
 Did I? I don't remember that. 
 I'm not a farmer. I'm a policeman. 
 Perfectly understandable error. 
 There's been a murder, and this man could help. 
 I don't give a damn. 
 He's coming with us. 
 Could you give us 20 minutes - 
 We have all the authority we need. 
 Take care of him. He has concussion. 
 Just to let you know I'm back, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Ooh! Silk. 
 Mr Jackson's? 
 Or was he surprisingly popular with the land girls? 
 Well, Rose or Barbara's, I'd say. 
 Too large for Joan. 
 Think so? 
 Nice, though. 
 Do you want me to find out about it, sir? 
 Have you had enough for today? 
 Haven't you? 
 Certainly. 
 What is this? 
 Hotels and pubs are full, sir, billeting troops. 
 But what is this? 
 It's basic, but clean. 
 And there's hot water. 
 And the food's tip-top. 
 [ CHATTER ] 
 But what is it? 
 It's the Women's Land Army hostel. 
 ♪ DAISY BELL ON PIANO ♪ 
 Mr Foyle. You're very welcome. 
 Ellen McGee. 
 How do you do? 
 There's a separate little bit for you boys to sleep in. 
 Very kind of you. Thank you. 
 Needs must. There's a war on. 
 And it's perfect timing for dinner. 
 Please. 
 Can I take your coat? 
 Thank you. 
 Roast beef! Roast potatoes! 
 Yorkshire. 
 You'll never guess what's for pudding. 
 What? 
 Apple crumble. 
 With custard? 
 Mm. And there's bacon for breakfast. 
 [ CHATTER AND LAUGHTER ] 
 Es tut mir leid. 
 Take him to the sanatorium. 
 Make sure he's comfortable. 
 Alles gut. 
 (GROANS) 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 There. 
 Joan, don't you think we should speak to that Mr Foyle - 
 Don't make me laugh! 
 But, Joan - 
 Just dig. Tom. 
 Dig, or I'll put you in there an' all. 
 (GASPS) 
 What are you doing? 
 Just trying to use the bathroom. 
 Why are you here? 
 Men aren't allowed in the hostel. 
 Absolutely right. They decided to make an exception last night. 
 But you stay at the farm. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You expect me to stay at a place where someone was murdered? 
 I didn't feel safe. 
 Right. He was murdered, was he? 
 If it was simple suicide why would some as lofty as yourself be spending so much time on it? 
 And he may be in the Holy Land, but managing to get his wife pregnant from 1,000 miles away is a miracle even our Lord... 
 Just one moment. 
 Hello. 
 Katherine, I'd better dash. 
 Good morning, gentlemen. 
 Sorry to keep you. 
 Good morning. Sorry to trouble you. 
 I wonder if you can help us. 
 We're police, looking into the incident at the Jacksons'. 
 Oh, terrible thing that. 
 Yes. Wasn't it? 
 Yeah. I understand you took a call from there the morning he died. 
 Yes. Tom rang in, reporting that he'd found his father. 
 Right. That was what time? 
 At six. 
 Six. That was it? Just the one call? 
 No, there was another one about 30 minutes earlier. 
 From the farm? 
 I can't be sure it was from there. 
 They rang off before I got there. 
 Understandable. That's all we need to know. Thank you for your help. 
 We appreciate it. 
 Oh, Mr Curling! 
 They are beautiful! 
 Mr Curling, do forgive me. 
 I forgot to ask you the other day. 
 Would you have heard shots from the Jackson farm the morning he died? 
 Yes. One at five o'clock, and two more maybe half an hour later. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 Anything else you forgot to ask? 
 Well, as soon as I remember I'll let you know. 
 Here they come again. 
 You keep your nerve. You hear me? 
 The pair of you. 
 We should get this dragged. 
 Right, sir. 
 And see if any of the three girls has a record. 
 And get a lead on the missing wife and the chap she ran off with. 
 Yes, sir. Is that all? 
 No. Not quite. 
 Go to the camp. Find out what the Major has to say about Tom Jackson, if we can speak to the chap we pulled out of the tree. 
 You might also see if he has any idea that one of the other two we picked up, the young lad, is not an airman. 
 You speak to the girls? 
 Not yet, sir. 
 Do. Let me know how you get on. 
 Rose, can I have a word? 
 Yeah. 
 Er...is this yours? 
 No. No, it isn't. 
 It's not. 
 Anyway, who are you to be asking? 
 True. Right. 
 Thank you. 
 No joy I'm afraid, sir. 
 She said it wasn't hers. 
 But I suspect she wasn't telling the truth, although it is quite an expensive item for Rose. 
 Mr Foyle, I've remembered something. 
 I'm sorry I didn't say before but I've only just remembered. 
 When I left the farm at around four on the morning Jackson died I nearly bumped into a man on a bicycle at the end of the lane. 
 I couldn't describe him. 
 Well, never mind. 
 He had a rucksack on his back. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Where did you get that? 
 This? I er... 
 It's mine. 
 What are you doing with it? 
 Oh, er...we er... 
 We were trying to decide what it was doing in Hugh Jackson's bedroom. 
 When you've decided would you let me know? 
 May I take it? Or is it Exhibit A? 
 It is, but do feel free to take it. 
 We'll let you know when we need it. 
 I'm sorry, no. Leutnant Weiser is a prisoner of war and has his rights. 
 He's also in no fit state. 
 Perhaps when he's feeling better. 
 Perhaps. 
 You have a Private Tom Jackson here. 
 It was his father who was shot. 
 That's why he's on leave. 
 If you want to talk to him he's at home. 
 No. I wondered if you could tell us anything about him. 
 Funnily enough I can. 
 Within hours of his father's death he submitted that he now has... responsibility for his father's farm, and has asked for Reserved Occupation status. 
 When he was first called up he also tried to dodge the column by claiming Reserved Occupation. 
 He said he was vital to his father's farm. 
 His father told us otherwise. 
 His father reported him! 
 Mm-hm. 
 How often is this place cleaned? 
 The parlour and the shed are cleaned morning and night after milking. 
 You kill animals here? 
 Not since we've been here. 
 Well, this blood on the floor here. 
 Do you know anything about that? 
 No, I don't. 
 No, I don't. 
 No? 
 Was Hugh Jackson a violent man? 
 No, he wasn't a violent man. 
 Hm? 
 Evidently Curling heard shots coming from this farm the night Jackson died. 
 About five, five thirty. 
 Would you have heard them? 
 From five I was out on the tractor. 
 Oh. Doing what? 
 Harrowing. 
 Oh. What, in the dark? 
 Yeah. It's not that hard. 
 You put lamps either end of the field and steer by them like a ship. 
 There aren't enough hours of daylight to do everything here. 
 I was with her. 
 I was moving the lamps. Right. 
 So you wouldn't have heard the shots, then? No? 
 Right. Well, thank you. 
 Listen, did you ever spot anything going on between Hugh Jackson and Barbara Hicks? 
 The dirty old bugger! 
 No, no...I didn't say he was - I was just asking. 
 Well, why was you asking if there wasn't something? 
 Right. 
 Lady Muck keeping her eye on the sodbusters, is she? 
 Listen, I don't know what I've done - 
 Why don't the old man drive himself? 
 He's not an old man. 
 Don't you know there's a war on? 
 Us breaking our backs, and you all spick-and-span, your barnet done up like a Cornish pasty. 
 Look, I was drafted in from the MTC to drive Mr Foyle. 
 Is he giving you one? Is that it? 
 Joanie. 
 Are you his fancy woman? 
 Is that how it works? 
 Joanie, just leave it. Come on. 
 Sir. 
 There's no rust. 
 And the oil is fresh. 
 Can't have been in there more than two days...at most. 
 Do you know whose bicycle this is? 
 We've all got bikes, but that ain't one of ours. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 So, who would need a bicycle, and then need to throw it away? 
 Can I do anything to help, sir? 
 Not for the moment. Thank you. 
 There was a lot of noise with the air battle and Curling shooting. 
 Did Curling stop shooting before the air battle had ended, or did he go on a little while after the planes had left? 
 After. The air battle stopped about four. Then he stopped. 
 That's right. At five o'clock. 
 An hour before you say you got back to the farm. 
 You left the barracks at midnight. 
 You can't have taken six hours. 
 It's a four-hour ride tops. 
 Well, it was dark. 
 And roadblocks. And I got lost. 
 Why are you lying? 
 I didn't kill him. 
 I didn't say you did. 
 It can't have been easy for him, raising you alone after your mother had left. 
 Well, maybe if he'd have behaved better she'd have stayed. 
 Been busy? 
 Yeah. All work, no play. 
 Tom's story doesn't add up. There's no explanation for where he was. 
 What do you think? Tom Jackson hated his father and by killing him stood to inherit a valuable farm. 
 So improving his chances of getting Joan to marry him. 
 And Reserved Occupation status to get out of the Army. 
 Joan stood to inherit the farm by getting Hugh Jackson out of the way by marrying Tom. 
 Rose seems to have been afraid of Jackson for some reason, and is certainly hiding something. 
 And the German? 
 Yup. How did the gun get to the farm? 
 And who's the man with the rucksack seen by Barbara Hicks? 
 Speak of the devil. 
 Got a puncture? 
 Would you like a lift? 
 Oh, thank you. 
 I can put your bicycle in the back. 
 That's very kind of you. 
 Not at all. 
 It's all part of the service. 
 How was your day, Miss Hicks? 
 Pretty good, thank you. 
 I found my quota of long, straight suitable softwoods. 
 "Poles manufactured for the purpose of." 
 But I also found wood anemones, and celandines, and bluebells. 
 I just love the woods this time of year. 
 So do I. 
 Oh, excuse me, Herr Major. 
 Ah. Oberleutnant Schimmel. 
 Wie geht es Ihnen? 
 I'm doing well. Thank you. 
 Good. 
 There was a man yesterday came into the camp. 
 Leutnant Weiser. 
 Jawohl, Herr Major. 
 What about him? 
 He's an old comrade. 
 I wondered where he was. 
 In the sanatorium. Concussion, I'm afraid. But he'll be fine. 
 Getting the best of care. 
 Oh, good. 
 And he will be coming in here with us? 
 Day after tomorrow. Yes. 
 That's what the quack says. 
 Thank you. 
 You're very welcome. 
 Morning. 
 Morning, sir. 
 Are you all right? 
 Sir. 
 Sam. 
 Do I do enough for the war effort, sir? 
 Shouldn't I be doing more than just driving you around? 
 Is that all you do? 
 No. I-I...also spend a lot of time hanging around while you're working. 
 What's brought this on? 
 Well, I was thinking about the girls on the farm, sir, how hard they work. 
 And right at the minute with the potatoes I think they could do with an extra pair of hands. 
 Well, go ahead. 
 Really? 
 You want to help them out today? 
 What will you do, sir? 
 We're at the farm all day. 
 If I'm really in trouble I'll let you know. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 It's a pleasure. 
 Just some rough clothes, sir. 
 I borrowed them from the girls at the hostel. Just in case... 
 I see. 
 [ TWIG SNAPS ] 
 Sir. A Luger. 
 Hidden in some logs at the front of the house. 
 Oh, I see. Jackson's? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Three shots. 
 Three guns. 
 Recently fired? 
 Recently fired. 
 We know who that belongs to. 
 I think I should return it, don't you? 
 Listen, Sam wants to do her bit for the war effort. 
 Get one of the chaps to drive me to the camp, will you? Yes, sir. 
 (VOMITS) 
 Are you all right, Rose? 
 Mm. 
 (GROANS) 
 Hey. Hey! 
 Blast it. 
 Lover boy run off without you? 
 Shut up, will you? 
 You want to make me? 
 Put a sock in it, Joan. 
 Bleeding Yank rubbish! 
 Here. 
 You're flooding it. 
 [ MOTOR STARTS ] 
 I suppose Daddy has a fleet of these on his estate. 
 No. 
 My cousin does. 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 Not at all. 
 Please. 
 No, I won't, thank you. 
 I'm simply here to speak to Raimund Weiser. 
 I'm afraid that won't be possible. 
 Ah. 
 Two or three attempts have been made to speak to a man likely to help in a murder enquiry. 
 All of which have been rejected. 
 It's a general rule of the POW Interrogation Service - 
 So I may find myself having to look into the extent to which you're involved with black market cigars. 
 Right. I see. 
 Very well. 
 But I shall be present. I won't have you ruin all our hard work. 
 The debriefing of enemy flyers is a delicate science. 
 You get anything useful from the first two airmen? 
 I'm sure very few of our boys shot down over there blab their mouths the moment they're caught. 
 So I'm not surprised the Germans don't blab. 
 If one tries to intimidate them they clam up. 
 We try to baffle them with kindness. 
 To very good effect I might add. 
 You wouldn't believe the results we get. 
 Sabartovski, the unarmed one not in uniform - 
 He had a flying suit. 
 Many of them aren't armed. 
 If you want to speak to Herr Weiser, I'll arrange it. 
 But don't try to take over my job, Detective Chief Superintendent. 
 This way. 
 
 
 
 Guten Morgen. Wie geht es Ihnen? 
 Besser, danke. 
 Hier ist Hauptkommissar Foyle von der Polizei. 
 Good morning. 
 Guten Morgen. Ich kenne ihn. 
 Wir kennen uns. 
 I'll translate for you. 
 His English is non-existent. 
 Right. 
 I'm wondering if he remembers the night he was shot down. 
 Die Nacht, als Sie niedergeschossen wurden? 
 He came down into the trees? 
 Sie landenten im Wald? 
 Ich war bewusstlos. 
 Hab Schlag auf den Kopf. 
 He was unconscious. 
 He banged his head. 
 Right. 
 This erm...pistol... 
 Wo hat er denn meine Pistole her? 
 Do you know how you lost it? 
 Als ich im Baum steckte. 
 Ich war kaum bei Sinnen, dann kam diese Frau. 
 Und hat sie genommen. 
 He says a woman came and took it when he was hanging from a tree. 
 But he was barely conscious. 
 Und ich kann mich daran erinnern, sie trug eine rote Jacke. 
 She had a red jacket on. 
 Blondes Haar. 
 Und sie war attraktiv. 
 Blonde hair, and was very attractive. 
 Oh. 
 It's all right. 
 I think there's room for two. 
 Why are you always so nice? 
 I've just given you a right slagging back there. 
 Is that what they teach you in posh school, how to not show how you feel? 
 Yes, I suppose it is. 
 Yeah. Well, I will sit down as it happens. 
 This here's my spot, see. 
 It's called Poppy Bank. 
 Though I ain't never seen no poppies. 
 Did you grow up in the country? 
 Yes, I did. 
 I can tell. 
 The way you cracked on up there. 
 I never. 
 You never what? 
 Never grew up in the country. 
 Poplar. 
 East London. 
 Don't think I'd never seen the country till I come here. 
 I hated it at first. 
 Be sad to leave it now. 
 You think you will leave? 
 Hugh. 
 Messy bugger! 
 Do you know, he loved this spot. 
 Loved a spot of that an' all. 
 Do you know, he loved this meadow so much when we got our quota we had to turn all of that over. 
 Pull it all back from undergrowth and brambles. 
 Anything so we didn't have to plough up his precious field. 
 Generous he was... with our sweat. 
 If you two get off your arses, we'll have it done by dark. 
 Thanks to you. 
 Yeah. Thanks to you. 
 Hugh Jackson's wife ran off with the farmhand 11 years ago. 
 His name was Andrew Neame. 
 Any idea where they went? 
 King's North Farm, Faversham in Kent. 
 Nothing ever came for them, mind. 
 Nothing came in the other direction either. 
 Not a birthday card for the little lad. Not a dickie bird. 
 That's a shame. 
 But then she was French. 
 Right. 
 Do you mind if I made a call? 
 No. 
 I don't know who he was, but he was watching the farm. 
 He seems to be living in the woods. 
 I saw him yesterday while I was working. 
 And how would a pistol help you in your work? 
 The German parachutist has described you as the woman that took the pistol from his holster while he was hanging from the tree. 
 Are you suggesting I took the gun and shot Hugh Jackson, a man I barely knew? 
 Not at all. It was suggested to me that you simply took the gun. 
 Even if I did take it I couldn't have shot Jackson with it, because I didn't come across the German until after he was dead. 
 So you said. 
 There you go again. 
 You don't believe me. 
 Not at all. I'm simply doing my job. 
 Why are you so sure it was me he described? 
 Well, red jacket. Blonde hair. 
 Very attractive. 
 Sad eyes. 
 Sir! Over here. 
 What is it? 
 It looks like a grave. Freshly dug. 
 [ TWIG SNAPS ] 
 Sir. 
 Ah! Ah! 
 Thank you, Miss Hicks. 
 Mr Neame? 
 So what are you doing living in the woods, Mr Neame? 
 Heard Hugh Jackson topped hisself. 
 Is that right, boy? 
 No, it's not. 
 He was murdered. 
 Was he! 
 What about Genevieve? Where's she? 
 Mrs Jackson. 
 Mrs Jackson not with you? 
 Only in my dreams, boy. 
 When did you last see her? 
 11 years ago. 
 May 2nd, 1930. 
 If Mrs Jackson didn't run off with Neame and she hasn't been seen at the farm for 11 years, you have to wonder. 
 You do. 
 What did the people at the farm in Faversham have to say about him? 
 They confirmed that he moved there 11 years ago, and he lived alone. 
 He went off the rails a bit and hasn't been seen for a few years. 
 Sir. 
 Halt! 
 Load it up. 
 Kommen Sie schon. 
 Warum denn? 
 Sie sind in Gefahr. 
 Wir mussen hier raus. 
 Sie werden uns erschiessen. 
 Komm! 
 Stop the wagon! 
 Please! Don't shoot me, please! 
 You're all right, mate. 
 Bernard, check under there. 
 Come on out, you. 
 That's it. 
 That's the field done. 
 Dig for victory! 
 This was all brambles. 
 Hawthorns. Sycamore. 
 We cleared it by hand, Joan and me. 
 Through the Winter of '39. 
 The coldest in living memory. 
 Birds froze to death as they flew through the air. 
 And we was out here in our gumboots. 
 They asked us for 15 new acres under cultivation. 
 We gave 'em 20. 
 We had to break the ground with a pick. 
 This year we'll get 30 tons of spuds out of there. 
 Why did you join the Women's Land Army? 
 I wanted to do my bit. 
 My two brothers are away in the Army. 
 I wanted to...to help 'em. 
 To help bring 'em back alive. 
 The shot at 5am that Curling heard, was that the pig being killed? 
 Half taken away to be sold, the rest hung at the back of the milking parlour to be dealt with later. 
 But we all turned up that day, so you decided maybe you should bury it in the woods? 
 Says you. 
 You see, everywhere people are tightening their belts. 
 They're making sacrifices for their country, and the law takes a dim view of the black market. 
 Don't give me "tightening the belt"! 
 We ain't even been paid for two months. 
 Every penny has gone towards that tractor. 
 Hugh came up with the pig as a way to make the last payment. 
 It was nothing to do with me. 
 I warned him against it. 
 Easy to blame a man who can't defend himself. 
 I can't help that! 
 Look, all I know is I didn't want nothing to do with the pig thing. 
 Even Tom didn't. 
 But Hugh said that we had to. 
 What with that Barbara hanging around he needed help to get it out of the way as quick as possible. 
 And Rose, you know, she just saw him shoot the pig, was sick, and then went out and ploughed. 
 What crime that is is beyond me. 
 Whether we like it or not, profiteering is against the law. 
 Even though you may not have taken part in it you knew all about it, and it ought to have been reported. 
 You're only picking on me cos I've got a record. 
 That's why I run away from London, to start again. 
 But you won't let me. 
 I didn't want a life of crime. 
 I wanted something different. 
 And I found that here. 
 My family don't know where I am. 
 Even my mum don't. 
 And for two years I've been my own person. 
 They done a big list of all the farms. 
 How many workers, buildings. 
 How many livestock. 
 The government. 
 They called it The Second Domesday Book. 
 Hugh never told 'em all his pigs. 
 Or his sheep. 
 And there was more sheep because they evacuated over 100,000 off of Romney Marsh, and...he copped some of them as they went by. 
 All the farmers around here did. 
 Joan organise that? 
 No. She was against it. 
 Said you always get caught. 
 And she was right. 
 It was Hugh. 
 He said all the farmers around here do it. 
 And he was right. 
 You enjoyed your food at the hostel. 
 Oh, yeah! 
 All our beef. And the pork. 
 And the eggs. And the lamb. 
 I suppose you'll have to arrest yourself for receiving stolen goods. 
 Are you feeling any better? 
 What? 
 Sam and Joan told me you've not been very well a couple of times recently. 
 I'm fine. 
 Thank you. 
 Good. 
 Would that have had anything to do with Hugh? 
 Would er... 
 ..stealing other people's underwear to wear for him mean that you were very much in love with him, or that you were afraid that he wasn't with you? 
 I thought it would make him love me more. 
 He wasn't an easy man to love. 
 His heart was... 
 What with his wife pushing off he... 
 But there was a good man underneath. 
 A man who could feel love. 
 I think. 
 But not enough to want you to keep the child you're carrying. 
 No. 
 (SOBS) No! 
 We was in love, see? 
 She wanted to get away. 
 We'd arranged it. 
 Ten past twelve to London. 
 I waited for her. 
 At the station. 
 She never come. 
 I waited till the next one. 
 The one after that. 
 She wanted to come, boy. 
 I knew that. 
 But the boy. 
 I feared it'd break her heart to leave him. 
 Even though she said she could bear it. 
 She couldn't bring him with her, see? 
 We'd always know that one day Jackson would find us. 
 I understood in the end why she didn't come. 
 Thought better of her for it. 
 If you understand what I mean. 
 I do. 
 What are you doing back here, then? 
 Heard Jackson had done himself in. 
 Saw it in the paper. 
 I was over Tenterden way on piecework. 
 I saw this. 
 He's not going to have nipped over to Tenterden to pick up a paper then back to the farm and wait to get caught. 
 But he's not the full shilling. 
 I think that's more to do with a broken heart. 
 No. He's telling the truth. 
 I don't think Mrs Jackson ever left the farm. Sir. 
 Yeah? 
 I think I know where she might be. 
 They call it Poppy Bank. 
 Poppies grow where untouched ground has been disturbed after many years. 
 Evidently they grew where the land had been shelled in the last war. 
 Isn't that right, sir? 
 Mm. 
 Anyway Jackson wouldn't hear of the meadow being ploughed up. 
 This is where he used to sit. 
 This is where he sat and drank whisky the night he died. 
 [ SOBBING ] 
 The dog, the woman, and the walnut tree, the more you beat them the better they be. 
 Isn't that what they say? 
 What is it? 
 It's so wonderful working here in these woods. 
 You're so busy. 
 There's so much to do. 
 There's so much going on... that you can't think - that's what's so lovely about it. 
 But then sometimes it just sneaks up on you. 
 What happened to you? 
 There was a man. 
 There was a marriage. 
 Not a nice one. 
 But there was a son. 
 A beautiful son. 
 And my son... my beautiful son... 
 ..I lost at Dunkirk. 
 (SOBS) 
 (SOBS) 
 Men! War! 
 This filthy, blasted, bloody war! 
 (SOBS) 
 Sir! 
 Sir! 
 [ RADIO CRACKLES ] 
 That's better. 
 I'm getting something now. 
 Try this. 
 Radio : Well - 
 Wait. Stop! 
 Did you hear? 
 (WEST INDIAN ACCENT) ..this tactic of probing at the leg stump. 
 Did you hear? 
 That's where his weakness lies. 
 What is it? 
 Ssh. 
 Fooled by the variable bounce. 
 They're appealing. 
 Is it some sort of - 
 Ssh! 
 And he's given him! Leg before! 
 He's given him! 
 Bowled him leg stump there. 
 Must be the one that kept straight. 
 This is just mad! 
 We've had no cricket for two years. 
 Where's it coming from? 
 I don't know exactly. It might - 
 Foyle : Cricket? 
 Yeah. Mad, innit? 
 From the West Indies or something, it must be. 
 See, with them Jerries we've got radio operators and all that. 
 They are clever blokes all right! 
 I hope our chaps are as clever. 
 We found the pig. 
 Where was your father when you left? 
 He was off drinking. 
 I didn't shoot him. Why would I? 
 Well, he... reported you to the army authorities. 
 He didn't like your girlfriend much. 
 And er... 
 Tell me about what happened to your mother. 
 She left when I was young with a bloke who worked on the farm. 
 Did you ever hear from her after she left? 
 No. 
 Did you ever try to get in touch with them? 
 No. 
 Why would that be? 
 I suppose... she wouldn't want me... she wouldn't want me to. 
 Would she? 
 Wouldn't she? 
 Tom, I'm afraid she's dead. 
 She didn't run off with anybody. 
 In fact...she never left the farm. 
 She did! She did. 
 I remember her saying goodbye. 
 I was there playing with my farm animals when she came in. 
 She said she was going away for a while. 
 And I wanted her to get on with it because I wanted to get on playing with my farm. 
 I just thought she was going shopping or something. 
 And then she never came back. 
 I think maybe she... intended to leave. 
 But your father didn't want her to go. 
 And I'm afraid... it was him who killed her. 
 He must have really loved her, mustn't he? 
 Joanie always said I should forgive him cos he had a broken heart. 
 When you think about it she must be right. 
 Oh, big man, you going to charge us now? 
 No. Free to go. 
 You're having me on. 
 No. Joanie, just shut up and say thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Pleasure. 
 How are we going to get back? 
 A police escort. Come on. 
 Coming in, sir? 
 You go ahead. 
 I'll be there in a minute. 
 Woman : Here she comes! Here she comes! 
 [ CHEERING ] 
 Many happy returns! 
 All : ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ 
 ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ 
 ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ 
 ♪ And so say all of us ♪ 
 ♪ And so say all of us ♪ 
 ♪ And so say all of us... 
 Hello. 
 I brought you this. 
 Well, that's kind of you. 
 Ginger beer. 
 Well, thank you. 
 The best they can do. 
 It's a nice dress. 
 Do you think so? 
 Mm. 
 It's silk. 
 From the parachute. 
 The German's parachute? 
 I dyed it. 
 I got this one, one for Joan, and six others out of it. 
 Right. Not badly damaged, then? 
 Barely at all. 
 It looked like a new one. 
 Right. 
 Are you going in? 
 In a moment. Yeah. 
 Tom proposed, and Joan accepted. 
 Oh. That's good. 
 Is it? 
 Yes. 
 But for how long? 
 Well...with things the way they are, good for the time being is perhaps enough. 
 What happened to you, then? 
 What happened to me? 
 There was a woman. 
 A marriage. A good marriage. 
 And a beautiful son. 
 My beautiful son is alive. 
 Thank God. 
 But er...I lost my wife. 
 So I have a vastly higher opinion of women than you do of men. 
 Everything's so very difficult, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 To Tom and Joan. 
 This is all Weiser's kit. 
 Flax. Flax stretches under tension. 
 This flax isn't stretched. 
 Would you agree? 
 It's pristine. 
 Salt. 
 Leutnant Weiser. 
 Herr Cornwall. 
 Wie geht es Ihnen? 
 Gut, danke. 
 Well, I trust you'll be comfortable with the other prisoners. 
 Viel Gluck. 
 Danke schon. 
 Major, don't let him in there. 
 Who do you think you are barging in? 
 You must not let him in there. 
 He's here to kill Sabartovski. 
 Explain yourself. 
 The sort of plane Sabartovski came in needs a crew of three. 
 There were four. He's not an airman. 
 He's a technician. 
 He has information so valuable the Germans want him dead. 
 There's already been one attempt on his life. 
 We lose him, we lose the information. 
 We tried to help you with this. 
 You resisted. 
 You resist again, you've a lot of explaining to do. Open up. 
 Corporal, close those gates! 
 Wo ist Sabartovski? 
 Wo ist er? 
 Weiser! 
 Schimmel? 
 Over there. 
 Weiser! Weiser! 
 Aufmachen! 
 Halten Sie! Aufmachen! 
 Sabartovski died a few minutes ago. 
 He never regained consciousness. 
 Why was he killed? 
 He was killed because he survived the plane crash. 
 As long as the plane flew he was fine. 
 As soon as it didn't he had to die because he knew too much about what was on it. 
 One of the airmen died as a result of using a parachute that had been sabotaged. 
 When I explained this to Sabartovski he became very distressed when he saw it had been intended for him. 
 Why would he tell you this? 
 He didn't. He told Schimmel. 
 In English? 
 In German. 
 Der defekte Fallschirm war fur mich gemeint. 
 Ich weiss zu viel uber das Funkmessgerat. Seien sie still! 
 Sie wollten, dass ich das nicht uberlebe. 
 Sie haben mir den defekten Fallschirm gegeben. 
 Seien Sie still. 
 He said that they hadn't wanted him to survive any crash, so he'd been issued with a defective parachute which Kraus had picked up by mistake. 
 Why didn't you tell me you speak German? 
 Frankly, there became less and less point in telling you anything. 
 And it's only whatever I managed to pick up in Germany during the last war. 
 It's not that good. 
 It's as good as his English. 
 No. He doesn't speak English at all. 
 You're fairly fluent, aren't you? 
 You understood one of my questions without it being translated when I came over here last time. 
 And you understood every word we said when we first picked you up. 
 You heard us talking about the woman that was with us that day being a possible murder suspect. 
 And you described her later as the person you claim took your gun when you were hanging from the tree. 
 Blondes Haar, und attraktiv. 
 What information did Sabartovski have that was so important? 
 He... Do you want to answer that question? 
 No? 
 It seems from what he said to Schimmel that he was an expert in RDF, what you'd know as Funkmess... or radar. 
 It looked like perhaps there'd been a new system onboard, which is why they tried to get back to it. 
 To make sure it was destroyed, or get rid of it if it wasn't. 
 How am I doing? 
 He was sent for the same reason. 
 To make sure the equipment was destroyed and Sabartovski as well. 
 And he came prepared to face a situation in which he'd be caught, and most likely taken to the same holding camp as Sabartovski, and get rid of him here. 
 If I faked the parachute drop how did I get here? 
 Perfect English. 
 Boat. 
 There were saltwater stains on your trousers. 
 And no marks at all from a parachute and a harness that had never been used before. 
 Good. 
 Beach landing from a U-boat. 
 Oh. 
 We know why you killed Sabartovski. 
 What we don't know is why you killed the farmer. 
 How do you know I did? 
 You were seen arriving at the farm. 
 You came up from the coast by bike to the area where the plane came down. 
 But there was so much going on that night you were afraid you were going to be found out. 
 You gave up the idea of tracing the plane. 
 You dumped the bike. 
 And found somewhere to deploy the fake parachute drop. 
 Except Hugh Jackson saw you. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 You got to the farmhouse as he was putting through a call. 
 You shot him. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 And replaced the telephone receiver. 
 A man who drunk that much might have been thought to have killed himself, so you used his shotgun to fake the suicide. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 You left the farmhouse, and made your next mistake. 
 You tried to get rid of the gun. 
 Yes. 
 That was a mistake. 
 So we know you did it. 
 It's just a question of why. 
 Perhaps...being spotted faking the parachute drop didn't suit your purposes so you had to destroy the witness. 
 Why else would you do it? 
 He was English. 
 You'll hang for this. 
 I owe you an apology, Detective Chief Superintendent. 
 I feel I've let the side down. 
 Well... 
 I've always tried to see the best in people. 
 And we've had good results with the prisoners. 
 Quite a number have already opened up to us. 
 You see, I spent a year at university in Heidelberg before the war. 
 I always found the Germans to be a civilised and gracious race. Ah. 
 You ever played football against them? 
 Football? No. Cricket's my game. 
 There's a disappointing dearth of cricket pitches in Heidelberg. 
 I was in a police team that played in Germany in '36. 
 The German team that met us were very smart, hospitable. 
 Very gracious. Very civilised. 
 Wonderful night. 
 They wined and dined us. 
 We all left the bierkeller at dawn. 
 And we staggered onto the pitch later that day badly hung-over. 
 But the German team that ran on to play us were 11 totally different men who'd been in bed before ten and not touched a drop. 
 And we got a complete stuffing. 
 They use different rules. 
 But if we don't want to lose this war I think first of all we've even got to be sure what game they're playing. 
 And you're right. It's not cricket. 
 No "For Sale" signs? 
 After all the work we put into the place? 
 Now we need to support her increasing family. Come on! 
 Work to do. 
 See you, Sam. 
 Joanie. 
 Excuse me. 
 Any of you seen Barbara Hicks? 
 She's not been seen at the hostel. 
 Ah. I forgot. 
 Yeah. She passed by yesterday. 
 She's moved on to a new area. 
 Official secret. 
 She left this for you. 
 Right. 
 Right. 
 See you. 
 Barbara : I've been moved on. 
 I can't say where, but I'm sorry. 
 I didn't think my view of men could change. 
 But you changed it. 
 Barbara.
