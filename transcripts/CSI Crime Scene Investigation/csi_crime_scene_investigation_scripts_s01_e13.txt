 COLD OPEN: 
 [EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY]  
 
[INT. HANSEN BUSINESS BUILDING -- SUNSET] (DOMINIC KRETZKER walks down the stairs and greets the employees as they walk up to the second floor.) Dominic Kretzker : Hi, Renee. Renee : Hi. Dominic Kretzker : Good afternoon, Mr. Ribero. How's the golf? Mr. Ribero : Fine. How are you?  (DOMINIC reaches the first floor and stops to help a woman.) Dominic Kretzker : Hi. You look lost. (He looks at the piece of paper she's carrying and points her in the right direction.) Dominic Kretzker : Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the Real Estate Office is at the end of the hall. (The woman looks at him and nods.) Dominic Kretzker : Okay? Bye. (DOMINIC stands in the middle of the lobby and sees NICOLE walk in carrying a large vase of flowers.) Dominic Kretzker : Hello. Oh! Those for me? Nicole : Hi, Dominic. Sign here. Dominic Kretzker : Okay. (he signs.) I'll tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday. (He hands her back her pad. She hands him the flowers.) Nicole : I know, Elvis. Dominic : Okay. Nicole : See you. Dominic : Okay, bye-bye. (NICOLE leaves; JAKE RICHARDS walks up to DOMINIC.) Jake Richards : Domino, it's your turn to pick up dinner. Dominic : Okay, Jake-O. Listen, uh, this goes to Cooley Real Estate. (JAKE takes the flowers.) That's on two, all right? And the Fed Ex is running a little bit late on the pickup. (DOMINIC glances down at his watch.) I'll be back in ... hmm, about ten minutes, all right? Jake Richards : You got it. Dominic Kretzker : All right, buddy. (DOMINIC leaves. JAKE takes the flowers and puts it on the counter. He glances up at the wall clock which reads 6:02. He then glances down and notices a ticking sound.) (He looks over at the stack of boxes and things on the counter. He finally peers around the side of the counter and sees the briefcase sitting on the floor. The ticking sound comes from the briefcase.) (Camera goes into slow motion. JAKE RICHARDS reaches for the briefcase. Everything and everyone slows down to a complete and silent halt.) (It explodes.) (JAKE is flung up and backwards as fire and smoke takes out a good portion of the lobby.) CUT TO: (GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk through the police vehicles and activity outside as they make their way to the crime scene.) Catherine : Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene. Grissom : That's what they do. Put wet stuff on the red stuff. (GRISSOM and CATHERINE meet up with BRASS in the front of what used to be the doors to the building. BRASS fills them in.) Brass : We're all clear to go in, but here's what we got. Couple of head wounds. Elderly guy had his arm torn off. The only fatality so far is Jake Richards, a security guard. Body's still inside. [INT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] (GRISSOM and CATHERINE turn their flashlights on as they walk through the lobby. BRASS stands aside and looks around.) Brass : How big you think this bomb was? Catherine : It's not the size of the bomb. It's the overpressure in the air around it. (They make their way toward the body. BRASS reaches it first and kneels down beside it. GRISSOM and CATHERINE both put their kits down as they look at the body.) Grissom : The Van Gogh effect. In stereo. Both ears gone. Catherine : A perfectly symmetrical amputation. Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off. Grissom : So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign. (GRISSOM continues to look at the body. CATHERINE looks up and around.) Grissom : (sniffs) Smell the sulfur? Catherine : Uh-huh. [translation: yes] Grissom : Got your lighter, Jim? Brass : Sure. (GRISSOM takes a small sample scraping of the black stuff on the body.) Grissom : (to BRASS) Light this. (The black powder on the knife explodes.) Catherine : Gunpowder. Grissom : Well, we know the propellant. So would you care to make a preliminary call on this? Catherine : I'd love to. (CATHERINE stands up and moves to where the suitcase was on the floor indicated by the markings.) Catherine : Seat of the bomb is here. Victim was thrown ... three meters. His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant -- 6,000- 
7,000 feet per second. Who? Why? Will he do it again?  (She shrugs.)  Catherine : Time will tell. HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS (COMMERCIAL BREAK) FADE IN. (Sirens wail in the background as emergency personnel continue to assist and sort through the damage.)  (Inside, GRISSOM looks around the floor among the debris.) Grissom : The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use.  (Standing off to the side are WARRICK, SARA and CATHERINE.) Grissom : (continued) Our murder weapon's here someplace in a thousand pieces.  (GRISSOM looks at the flowers that were delivered just before the explosion on the ground.) Grissom : (continued) We have to find it and put it back together again. Warrick : Where do we start? Grissom : If it's not growing pick it up. We cart everything we find back to the lab. Sara : And then what? Grissom : Stay curious. (GRISSOM turns back to look through the debris. SARA stares at him for a moment still unsure of exactly what they're doing, then turns to look at CATHERINE.) Sara : Can you fill in the blanks? Catherine : Bombs explode. Weird thing is their components survive the explosion. If we can piece together this bomb, we're closer to finding who did this. So, Warrick, when you're photographing this debris can you, uh ... ? Warrick : Uh, I know -- looky-loos. CUT TO: 
[EXT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] (Various shots of the on-lookers. WARRICK crosses under the crime scene tape and starts taking pictures of the observers.) [INT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] (Using a magnetic device, CATHERINE starts gathering the minute pieces of metal in the debris.) (Cut to: SARA picks up a piece of metal and looks at it. She bags it.) (Cut to: WARRICK looks at the damage to the lobby wall. The clock on the wall reads: 6:02.) WHITE FLASH TO: [EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT] (NICK and his friend, ERIC, walk through the hotel toward the front door.)  Eric : Come on, Nick. It's my last night in Sin City. One more drink, man. Nick : Oh, no. I just pulled a double and I still have to file my shift report. (NICK hands the valet his ticket.) Eric : Hey, you're off the clock. You'd have never passed up a wild night back at A&M. Nick : Well, I guess I grew up. Eric : Too bad. Check that out. (ERIC indicates the two women walking down the sidewalk toward the building. He looks at them as they walk inside. They look at him as they walk by.) Nick : Enjoy. (They shake hands.) Eric : You must really love your job, man.  (ERIC turns and round and calls out to the two women who just walked by. They turn around as he approaches them.) Eric : Ladies ... (NICK chuckles, then turns to leave. The valet brings NICK'S car up to the drive. NICK reaches into his pocket for the tip and walks over to the driver's side.) Nick : Here you go. Thanks, man. Valet : Thank you. (NICK is just about to get into the car, when he hears a disturbance off in the distance.) Kristy Hopkins : (o.s.) Get your hands off me! Let go of me. You don't own me. Nobody does. Jack Willman : (o.s.) You're not going anywhere. You got that?  (NICK looks up and sees KRISTY HOPKINS arguing with a man who has his hand grasping her upper arm.) Jack Willman : Come on. Relax a little bit. Settle down. (NICK heads over to them.) Nick : Kristy?  Kristy Hopkins : You don't own me, Jack.  (NICK starts to cross the street.) Nick : Kristy! Kristy Hopkins : Nobody does. Jack Willman : I know, I know. (NICK finally reaches them and stops a distance away from them. He gets their attention.) Nick : Hey. Back off. Jack : Hey, just mind your own business. Kristy Hopkins : (pleading) Nick.  (JACK tries to shush her.) Kristy Hopkins : (to JACK) I know him. He's a cop. Nick : (corrects) Crime scene investigator. Kristy Hopkins : Nick, tell him to leave me alone. Jack Willman : Nobody tells me to do anything. Nick : Hey, we going to have a problem? Jack Willman : No, officer, we're not going to have a problem. See you around, baby. (He kisses her on the neck, then lets her go. He leaves. KRISTY appears to be slightly rattled. NICK looks at her and notices.) Nick : You okay? Kristy Hopkins : Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. That was good timing. Thanks. Nick : I suppose you need a ride. Kristy Hopkins : Do you mind? Nick : No. Come on. Kristy Hopkins : Thanks. CUT TO: (NICK and KRISTY sit in his car parked in her driveway.) Kristy Hopkins : Seems like every time we run into each other I'm getting into trouble. Nick : Not that it's any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers. Kristy Hopkins : Not every john is like that guy. Besides, I'm making a change. I'm going back to school. (He looks at her and nods.) Nick : Yeah? Kristy Hopkins : I've always wanted to study communications. I'm good with people. Nick : That's good. Kristy Hopkins : You think so? Nick : Yeah. Yeah. Kristy Hopkins : Well, I'm going to go inside now. (pauses, then offers) 
Unless, of course, you'd like to come in for a drink. Nick : I don't think that'd be a good idea. Kristy Hopkins : Come on. Just 'cause you're a crime scene analyst you don't have to analyze everything. (She laughs. He laughs.) CUT TO: (WARRICK, SARA and CATHERINE work at gathering evidence. WARRICK takes pictures. SARA extracts a tire out of the wall. CATHERINE picks up a portion of a gear. She dusts it off and looks at it under the glass. She finds a couple of letters etched into the gear piece.) Catherine : F - P -  (Meanwhile, GRISSOM walks outside.) Dominic Kretzker : Mr. Grissom. (DOMINIC looks at GRISSOM and for a moment is flustered.) Dominic Kretzker : Oh, uh ... hi, I've ... I've, um, I've seen you on tv before. I admire your work. Grissom : Well, thank you. And your name is ... ? Dominic Kretzker : Dominic. Uh, "I-C" rather than with the "I-C-K"... uh, Kretzker. I'm the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail. Grissom : Did somebody from homicide talk to you yet? Dominic Kretzker : Yeah. As a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you, because, well, we are ... you know, we're both in law enforcement, and ... Grissom : Right. Did you know the victim -- the other security guard? Dominic Kretzker : Oh, yeah. He was one of my best buddies. As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes' difference it would've been my face all over the news instead of his, right? (DOMINIC turns around to look at the news cameras and reporters just behind the crime scene tape.) Grissom : Would you, uh, like to be on the news? Dominic Kretzker : Yeah. Yeah. I mean ... only if I could help people, yes. No, no. I know what you're thinking. Uh, you know, my building blows up I'm over at Arby's sucking down some extra sauce. You know, how could I want to help people, right? Grissom : Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done? Dominic Kretzker : Well, I know a lot about bombs. You know, pipe, power, powder. The three "Ps" of mass destruction. Grissom : Huh. Dominic ... with an "I-C," not "I-C-K" ... Dominic Kretzker : Yes sir? Grissom : Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation? (DOMINIC stops and stares at GRISSOM.) Dominic Kretzker : Are you serious? (he chuckles.) Yeah. Yes, sir. I'd be honored, sir. Oh. But we can't tell anybody on the day shift, though because they're going to get real jealous. Grissom : That's good thinking. Would you excuse me a minute? Dominic Kretzker : Yes. (GRISSOM walks over to the OFFICER standing nearby.) Grissom : (about DOMINIC) Keep an eye on that guy. (GRISSOM heads back into the building. The OFFICER turns to look at DOMINIC who is just thrilled beyond anything.) Dominic Kretzker : Oh, yes! CUT TO: (GRISSOM walks into the building.) Grissom : Well, we got a live one out there. I got a cop baby-sitting him. How you doing? Catherine : Well, are his initials "F.P."? Grissom : No. Dominic Kretzker. Why? Catherine : I found this near the point of origin. (CATHERINE hands the gear piece to GRISSOM. He looks at it.) Catherine : Whoever did this is playing with us. Grissom : Or he wants to get caught. (GRISSOM looks up at CATHERINE.) FADE TO BLACK. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NICK is driving and talking on his cell phone.) Nick : Hey, it's me. You in the shower? What are you doing? Anyway, if you check your messages I don't have to work till later. So I thought, since you're between careers you might want to grab a late ...  (NICK pulls up in front of KRISTY HOPKINS' house and finds it surrounded by officer cars.) Nick : ... breakfast. (He pulls up. OFFICER ARVINGTON sees him.) Officer Arvington : Hey, Nick, what's up? Nick : Not a lot. What's ... what's going on? Officer Arvington : It's a 419. Dead prostitute. Nick : Who's the decedent?  Officer Arvington : Kristine Marie Hopkins. Day shift's got it covered. You all right? (NICK looks over and sees ECKLIE talking with the LEAD DETECTIVE and they're both walking down the driveway.) Nick : Yeah, I must've, uh ... I must've got my wires crossed. I'll see you. Officer Arvington : All right, man. (NICK drives off.) CUT TO: (DOMINIC KRETZKER explains how bombs work to BRASS and WARRICK.) Dominic Kretzker : All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right? Then you cap it here, and you cap it here. Now the grains inside, all right ... they're going to ignite and cause smoke. Lots and lots of smoke ... now, the problem is, all that smoke's here man it's got nowhere to go. Okay? It starts cooking ... and then ... bob's your uncle... boom! Warrick : Grissom was right: You do know a lot about bombs. Brass : How did you learn so much? Dominic Kretzker : Oh, they don't teach this stuff at universities. No, this is all trial and error. Brass : So what, you just, uh, blow up bombs and study them? Dominic Kretzker : Yeah. Yeah... (There's a light knocking on the door. MARGARET FINN walks in.) Margaret Finn : Margaret Finn, Public Defender. Cease and desist any conversation with my client. I've been assigned to you. Guess the PD was thinking of all the lawsuits Richard Jewell brought when he was wrongfully accused. Brass : Someone died in that office building. Dominic Kretzker : Ma'am, you seem like a very nice person but these people-- they've been very, very good to me. Margaret Finn : I'm sure they have. Warrick : Dominic, I think you should go with your attorney. Thanks for your help, though. (DOMINIC nods.) Dominic Kretzker : All right I'll see you guys later. (DOMINIC turns around and shakes their hands.) Dominic Kretzker : Listen, do me a favor. Will you tell Grissom that, if he needs me just call me at home, okay?  Brass : All right.  (DOMINIC turns around to look at his attorney.) Dominic Kretzker : Let's roll. (He leaves the room.) CUT TO: (SARA looks at all the bomb pieces they've gathered spread out on the table in front of them. CATHERINE explains it to her.) Sara : So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin? Catherine : Yep. Sara : How could the victim possibly have been in one piece? Catherine : Vacuum effect. The air is being pushed out so fast ... (Quick CGI to: The hands of the clock hit 12, the electrical pulse is sent through the wires and to the gunpowder where it ignites.) Catherine : (V.O.) ... when the bomb detonates ...  (End of CGI. White flash to the moment where JAKE RICHARDS leans down to pick up the suitcase. Everything stops in that moment as the bomb explodes.) Catherine : (V.O.) ... there's a calm at the center. (The bomb explodes and everything and everyone is pushed away.) (End of flashback. Resume to present.) (SARA looks down at the items on the table and picks up the gear piece with the etching on it.) Sara : Calm, huh? Catherine : Well, except for when he lost his ears. Sara : Did you figure out what this "FP" stands for? Catherine : I ran it through ATF's bomb database. No profile. Sara : So our bomber's a newbie. Does he fit Grissom's wack job from the bomb site? Catherine : Dominic the security guard? It's too soon to tell. (GRISSOM walks in carrying something. He holds it out for them to look ati.) Grissom : I found something interesting. Sara : What is it? (CATHERINE looks at it under the glass.) Catherine : Looks like a balance wheel from a clock. Grissom : Bomb was time-delayed. This is a piece of the timing device. Sara : What about the orange stuff? Grissom : Heat of the explosion must have melted whatever it is all around the wheel. So, Sara? Sara : Mmm? Grissom : What's orange and melts? Sara : I would have to investigate that. Grissom : Thank you. (NICK walks into the room.) Nick : Hey, guys. (to GRISSOM) Can I steal you for a minute? Grissom : I thought this was your day off. Catherine : We're kind of busy here, Nick. Nick : Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry, but I don't think this can wait. Grissom : Okay. (They step out of the lab.) CUT TO: (GRISSOM sits behind his desk. He sighs.) Grissom : You told me you weren't dating her. Nick : I wasn't till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh ... Jack. Grissom : And Ecklie's at her house now. Nick : Yeah, and I can tell you what he's going to find. My fingerprints; my DNA. Grissom : What were you thinking, Nicky? Nick : I wasn't. (Quick flashback to: That night, KRISTY leans toward NICK and kisses him.) Nick : (V.O.) We had a connection, you know? A chemistry thing, I guess. (White flash to: NICK and KRISTY are in bed kissing.) Nick : (V.O.) She was irresistible, man. (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Nick : I took off around four. Grissom : Ecklie's going to be all over this. (CATHERINE knocks lightly on the door and walks into the office.) Catherine : Hey, Nick ... I'm sorry to hear about your friend. (She puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.) Nick : Who told you? Catherine : Word travels. It was the day shift coroner. Nick : So people know I was with Kristy last night? Catherine : Not yet. Nick : Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there. Grissom : When you're a suspect and you're innocent, keep your mouth shut. I'll talk to Ecklie. Catherine : Bad idea. You and Ecklie ... oil and water. Just let me get into it. (NICK stands up.) Nick : I can't just sit here. Grissom : Okay, go for a walk. Maybe you'll accidentally bump into your guy, "Jack?" Nick : Yeah. (NICK gets it. He turns to leave the office.) Grissom : I.D. him, but don't approach him. (NICK turns around to look at GRISSOM.) Nick : Okay. (He shakes his head, then leaves the office.) Catherine : If Nick's arrested. it's not going to matter that he's cleared later. (CATHERINE sits down.) Grissom : No. It's an automatic dismissal. (She leans back and sighs.) CUT TO: (DR. ROBBINS starts the autopsy on KRISTY HOPKINS.) Dr. Albert Robbins : 25-year-old female caucasian. Liver temp's indicating time of death at 0600. Petichial hemorrhaging, cyanotic tongue. Can I help you, Catherine? (CATHERINE walks into the room.) CATHEIRNE; I just want to see the body, David. Dr. Albert Robbins : Unless I'm mistaken, this is Ecklie's case. Catherine : Eyes, no hands. (DR. ROBBINS doesn't say anything. CATHERINE turns to look at the body.) Catherine : Look at those ligature marks. Dr. Robbins : Petichials ... blue tongue, the works. Catherine : Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck. She didn't give up easy. Dr. Albert Robbins : Struggled and strangled. Catherine : Ecklie find the murder weapon? Dr. Albert Robbins : I only deal with bodies. Catherine : Did you check for fingerprints on the body? Dr. Albert Robbins : Not yet. Catherine : Half-life of fingerprints on flesh ... they're disappearing as we speak. Dr. Albert Robbins : Catherine, I like Nick, too. I know you're here for him. But what if I lift his prints from her? Catherine : Then that's what you report. Evidence, Doc ... (shakes her head) ... all we got. CUT TO: [SCOPE VIEW of the piece GRISSOM found earlier. He compares the damaged piece with a second in-tact piece.) (GRISSOM studies the pieces under the scope. There's ticking sounds coming from around him. Suddenly, an alarm rings. GRISSOM looks up.)  SARA; Hey. (The alarm continues to ring annoyingly.) Grissom : Could you find that and turn it off, please? (SARA checks the clocks on the table, then finds it and turns it off. The alarm stops ringing. She picks up another clock.) SARA; Find the clock our guy used? Grissom : (sighs) Not yet. Sara : This is a good choice. According to the bomb data center which has a record of every component used in any bomb -- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks -- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell SnoozeWell, $10.99 at any local drugstore. (SARA hands the alarm clock she's holding to GRISSOM.) Grissom : You spoiled all my fun. (GRISSOM starts unscrewing the back of the clock off. WARRICK walks into the office.) Warrick : Gris, can I get clear on something here? Grissom : Anything's possible. Warrick : Catherine gave me this "FP" which was part of the Hansen bomb and I'm supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it. Grissom : You isolate the tool, and then we trace it. Warrick : Yeah, but he could've used any number of things to initial it. I mean, screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter. Grissom : It's the same as guns -- we eliminate them one at a time. Warrick : What are you guys doing? Sara : (smugly) We're going to go blow up some bombs. Warrick : (envious) Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation. Grissom : (to WARRICK'S retreating back) Alas, poor Warrick. CUT TO: (Camera slowly pans across the table that has various etching devices on it. One by one, WARRICK uses them and compares it to the "FP" on the gear.) CUT TO:  (ECKLIE leans against the door frame knocking on the door. CATHERINE walks up to him.)  Catherine : Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom's in the field. Conrad Ecklie : I need to speak with him. Catherine : And I need to speak with you ... about Nick Stokes. Conrad Ecklie : Well, let me guess ... about his involvement with a dead hooker? Catherine : Come on. The hooker was a person. Her name was Kristy Hopkins. Conrad Ecklie : I realize that. Thank you. I just came from the lab. His prints were all over Kristy Hopkins' house. Let's see, wine glass ... oh, bedside table. (CATHERINE nods. NICK walks up to them.) Nick : How's it going, Cath? Catherine : Nick, I don't think that you guys should be talking. Nick : It's no big deal. What's up, Ecklie? Conrad Ecklie : I need a DNA sample from you, Nick. Nick : I assume you're trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night. Conrad Ecklie : We found a condom, used. Nick : And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary. And I have something else for you.  (NICK hands ECKLIE a piece of paper with writing on it.) Nick : I got this off a valet surveillance tape. Conrad Ecklie : A license plate number? Vehicle belongs to Jack Willman. Had a fight with Kristy Hopkins outside the Orpheus last night around midnight. Conrad Ecklie : Well, I'll look into it but come on -- your fingerprints, your DNA --that's what's going into evidence. Nick : You just love that, don't you? Conrad Ecklie : You think I want to believe that a CSI could commit murder? Hell, I don't even want to believe that a CSI could sleep with a hooker. Catherine : You know what? Nick's private life ... Conrad Ecklie : (interrupts) Is no longer private. (beat) Catherine, I'm sorry if you guys don't like where the evidence is pointing. But show me otherwise -- tell me I'm wrong. In the meantime, my hands are tied. I have protocol to follow. (ECKLIE turns and leaves. NICK sighs and heads out the hallway. CATHERINE turns and follows NICK.) Nick : I hate that guy. Catherine : Okay, look, I'm going to get O'Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning. But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick. Just don't make it harder with Ecklie, okay? Nick : (nods) Yeah. (NICK leaves.) CUT TO: (GRISSOM and SARA stand over the suitcase in the middle of a concrete slab.) Grissom : We find the bomber by understanding the bomb. Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container. Sara : Aluminum briefcase. (They turn and head off to the side.) Grissom : And we know the timing device. Sara : Snoozewell. Grissom : And the propellant. Sara : Black gunpowder. Grissom : So the final piece of the bomber's signature? Sara : Identify the pipe containing the powder. Grissom : Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes. Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied. Number one is a plumber's ex-flow pipe. Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner. Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all. (They reach the safe blast distance, then put on the earphones. SARA looks at GRISSOM and puts a hand on his shoulder to get his attention.) Sara : You ready? Grissom : (nods) Mm-hmm. Sara : Let's do it, Dan. (DAN gives SARA a thumbs up and ignites the first bomb. It explodes.) (The debris is green.) Grissom : Green. That's the ex-flow pipe. (The second bomb explodes.) Grissom : Inflow pipe, blue. (The third bomb explodes.) Grissom : Red-- the galvanized steel. (Cut to: GRISSOM measures the distance from the blast center.) Grissom : Last piece of green: Ten feet. (SARA puts down evidence marker #1.) Grissom : Blue: 16 feet. (SARA puts down evidence marker #2.) Grissom : Red: 20 feet. (SARA puts down the final evidence marker #3. GRISSOM picks up a piece and looks at it.) Sara : Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest. Grissom : 20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet. Sara : That's the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building. Grissom : So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel -- like a muffler or a tailpipe. I've seen it before. It's a common container for homemades. Brass : Don't you love the smell of sulfur in the afternoon? You might want to go and take a tour of Dominic Kretzker's house. I tracked down the sale of SnoozeWell clocks. Nine hundred twenty-six credit card purchases in the last three months in Clark County -- seven to Dominic Kretzker of Prairie Road. FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN. (The vehicles drive up the driveway.) Dispatcher : (over radio) 15, cal 24 is your backup. (DOMINIC is out on the porch waiting for them.) Dominic Kretzker : Hey, hey.  Brass : That your scanner? Dominic Kretzker : Yeah, that's how I knew you were coming. Makes me feel like I'm part of things.  (He shakes their hands.) Dominic Kretzker : Mr. Grissom. What can I do for you guys? Grissom : Dominic ... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb. We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock. Dominic Kretzker : Yeah. Yeah, I recognize that. That houses a nice little detonator. Brass : Want to show us that clock of yours? Dominic Kretzker : (welcoming) Why, sure. Come on in.  (DOMINIC turns and heads back inside. GRISSOM and BRASS look at each other, then follow.) [INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS] Dominic Kretzker : The place is kind of a mess. Sorry. (BRASS and GRISSOM walk into the room. DOMINIC walks over to the table where there's a file box filed with stuff on the floor.) Dominic Kretzker : Here. (He bends over to pick up the box.) Dominic Kretzker : Here it is. (He puts the box on the table and picks up the alarm clock.) Dominic Kretzker : Timetell Snoozewell. $10.99. Well, you can get it for half price if you got a coupon. (He gives it to DOMINIC.) Grissom : The timing device is still intact. Dominic Kretzker : Yeah, 'cause I haven't made the bomb yet. Grissom : But you have made bombs before using parts from this make? Dominic Kretzker : Well, yeah. Yeah. I blow them out in back all the time. I blasted a few of them a couple months ago. Brass : Look what I found. Sulfur. You blow up any bombs recently? (DOMINIC picks up something else from the box. BRASS hands the piece he found with globs of melted orange on it. Camera moves in for a close up of the piece.) Grissom : Is this from the Hansen bomb? Dominic Kretzker : Sure is. Brass : You keep your key piece of evidence that could nail you? Dominic Kretzker : Hey, that's sentimental. Brass : Well, that's cute. Dominic Kretzker : No. I mean, it is. That's like, you know, Waco and Trade Center. That's historical. I didn't have a war, all right? I'm too flatfooted for the P.D. And that's as close to history as I'm going to get. I collect souvenirs. I mean, th-that's my building, you know. I mean ... that was my place of employment, man. (MARGARET FINN walks into the living room.) Margaret Finn : You're going to be sorry, talking to my client. Brass : We called you. We left word. Margaret Finn : Dominic, don't speak. Dominic Kretzker : If I had anything to hide, I'd hide it. I'm pretty proud of that container piece, I'll tell you. Brass : Well, maybe so but you're under arrest. Put him in the car. Dominic Kretzker : (to GRISSOM) You-you kidding? Oh. (The OFFICER steps forward and puts the handcuffs on DOMINIC'S wrists. In the background, sirens approach.) Dominic Kretzker : (to GRISSOM) Cuffs? Brass : Well, vultures never sleep, huh? (The news crews and cameras drive up the roadway toward the house.) Dominic Kretzker : (to GRISSOM) Could you do me a favor? Will you put the jacket over them? I don't want to be seen like this. Especially on TV. This is not who I am.  (GRISSOM places a jacket over the handcuffs.) Dominic Kretzker : Thanks, Partner. (The OFFICERS take DOMINIC out of the house. GRISSOM watches them go.) Grissom : (to BRASS) I can't tell whether he's brilliant or... nuts. Brass : Sound familiar? Tell you one thing: If he's guilty, he's putting on one hell of a show.  CUT TO: (SARA puts a sample of the orange melted stuff in a tube and tests it.) (The printer prints out the results. She looks at it. It reads: ) Sample Name : BOMB FRAGMENTS 
Misc Info : MEOH 
Vial Number : 22 
Findings : polyethelene, terephtalete Sara : Polyethylene? Terephtalete? CUT TO: (DR. ROBBINS opens the door with "HOPKINS" on it. He pulls the table out. He lifts the sheet to uncover her face. NICK sighs.) Nick : You contact her family? Dr. Albert Robbins : No family to speak of. Nick : Has anyone claimed her for burial? Friend? Old roommate? Dr. Albert Robbins : There's no one. City will be footing the bill. (NICK looks down at her.) Nick : No. I'll pay. Dr. Albert Robbins : Sure that's prudent, given the circumstances? Nick : Doc, I'm giving this girl a proper burial. I don't much care about my career right now. Someone wants to throw me in jail for that so be it. (DR. ROBBINS pulls the sheet back over her face.) CUT TO: (The doors slide close. GRISSOM walks up to the bars.) Grissom : How you doing?  (DOMINIC nods his head.) Dominic Kretzker : Just kind of using the current experience to understand the other side of law enforcement. Grissom : That's resourceful. Dominic Kretzker : You think I'm guilty, don't you? Grissom : I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement. Dominic Kretzker : That is crazy. I mean, come on. I'm one of the good guys. I know the cops went through my things. Did they find anything? Grissom : Dominic, you have an attorney now. I can't really talk to you about your case. I was here on another matter and I thought I'd come by. Dominic Kretzker : You do what I do. Grissom : Excuse me? Dominic Kretzker : You don't just, like stop by to see someone. You ... make up an excuse like "I'm in the area. Just stopping by." Wow. You're just like me. Except better-looking. Grissom : I'll come by and see you later, okay? Dominic Kretzker : Okay. (GRISSOM heads back and sees BRASS leaning against the open door frame looking grim.) Grissom : What? Brass : Bad news. Another Fourth of July. Grissom : Where? Brass : Thrift Right Car Rental on Flamingo. Ten minutes ago. (GRISSOM turns to look back at DOMINIC who sits patiently in his cell.) CUT TO: (Emergency personnel are all over the parking lot area in the rain. BRASS fills in everyone on what they know.)  Brass : So, the manager was working the lot when he heard the blast. Fatality was on the check-in line and died on the way to the hospital.  Sara : Anybody report hearing any noise? Ticking? Brass : No. No one heard anything. Sara : Oh. It's not the firemen -- it's the rain. This crime scene is trashed. (GRISSOM look down on the ground and picks up something.) Sara : What do you have? Grissom : Form follows function. They've never been able to make a better one. Mousetrap. Sara : That orange stuff again. Grissom : Someone picks it up motion trips the trap, sets off the timer. (Quick CGI POV of the trap tripping, the timer sending the spark through the wire. The bomb detonates.) Sara : (V.O.) Which sets off the bomb. (It explodes.) (End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) (SARA looks around the parking lot, then notices the MANAGER speaking with an OFFICER. She sees something.) Sara : Be right back. (SARA leaves and heads toward them. GRISSOM turns to BRASS.) Grissom : We say nothing to the media or anybody. Our bomber's signature just got a little more sophisticated. (SARA walks up to the MANAGER.) Sara : Excuse me. Hi. I'm with the crime lab. I'm sorry, but I have to take your jacket. (The MANAGER looks down at his orange jacket, then takes it off.) Manager : Um ... okay. If it'll help. (He gives the jacket to SARA.) Sara : Thanks.  (The officer leads the MANAGER off to another direction.) Officer : Let's go. Manager : Okay. (GRISSOM and BRASS join SARA.) Grissom : What are you doing? Sara : Polyethylene-terephtalete. (SARA gathers up the jacket.) Grissom : Polyester. Sara : "Orange stuff". (She turns and walks away.) CUT TO: (The jail door slides open.) Grissom : You're free to go. I wanted to tell you in person. Dominic Kretzker : You mean you weren't just in the neighborhood?  (They both walk slowly toward the door.) Dominic Kretzker : That second bomb -- it wasn't remote, was it? Otherwise, I'd still be a suspect. Grissom : I can't discuss it. Dominic Kretzker : So I guess you're not going to be needing my expertise anymore. I mean, investigation-wise. (he sighs) I knew it was too good to be true.  (DOMINIC turns to GRISSOM and salutes him.) Dominic Kretzker : Well, proud to have worked with you, sir. Grissom : Dominic ... I'm not a police officer. I-I-I'm a Crime Scene Analyst. Dominic Kretzker : Yeah, but we know who really solves the crimes, don't we, sir? (They shake hands.) Grissom : Good luck. Take care of yourself. Dominic Kretzker : Thank you. (GRISSOM turns to leave. He stops and turns back around.) Grissom : Hey, Dom? Dominic Kretzker : Yeah? Grissom : Next time try not to be quite so trusting. You don't need to be a hero. (GRISSOM leaves the room.) CUT TO: (JACK WILLMAN sits at the table in the room. In the observation room, CATHERINE keeps and eye on him. ECKLIE walks into the observation room.) Catherine : I ran priors. The guy's got an '88 conviction for sexual assaults. Conrad Ecklie : (smugly) Boy, if I ever get in trouble, I know which CSI I'm going to. CATHERINE Let's watch the show. [INTERVIEW ROOM] (In the room, DET. O'RILEY takes a seat opposite JACK WILLMAN.) Det. O'Riley : How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins? Jack : Sir, we can just cut the crap. I saw him kill Kristy. I saw everything. Det. O'Riley : Go on. Jack : Well, Kristy and I, we had words. I was just swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry, but, uh ... (Quick flashback to: JACK looks inside the house and sees KRISTY and NICK arguing loudly.) Jack Willman : (V.O.) I didn't expect to see her with a guy.  (NICK pushes KRISTY down on the couch. She grabs something and throws it at him.) Jack Willman : (V.O.) They were fighting. I couldn't make out what they were saying but he was pushing her around pretty hard. (NICK grabs KRISTY and starts choking her.) (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Det. O'Riley : Could you I.D. this guy?  Jack Willman : It was, like, Nick something. Kristy and I bumped into him at the Orpheus earlier. Det. O'Riley : And you saw him kill her? Jack : Well, I saw him get violent, and I took off. Det. O'Riley : And you didn't try to help the girl? Jack : He's one of you guys. He carries a gun. I'm no hero. So, could I go? (DET. O'RILEY glances over at the mirror. CATHERINE shakes her head.) Det. O'Riley : Yeah. [OBSERVATION ROOM]  (ECKLIE turns smugly to CATHERINE.) Conrad Ecklie : The witness sounds believable. Catherine : It's a load of crap, and you know it. (The door opens and SHERIFF BRIAN MOBLEY walks in.) Sheriff Brian Mobley : I was listening. He seemed credible to me. Catherine : Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career. Sheriff Brian Mobley : So, what can you offer me? Catherine : Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience. He didn't do this. Conrad Ecklie : Ignore the evidence against Stokes it looks like special favors for CSI. Sheriff Brian Mobley : Well, I can't have that. Not and keep my post. Catherine : So give me twelve hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick. Sheriff Brian Mobley : Twelve hours. But then we arrest Mr. Stokes with all the attendant documentation. (The SHERIFF leaves the room. ECKLIE glances at CATHERINE and follows. CATHERINE turns back to look at the empty interview room.) FADE TO BLACK. 
 
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (GREG works in his lab with his ear phones on. CATHERINE walks up to him and takes the ear phones off. She leans down and looks at GREG as he raises his head.) Catherine : (quietly) How you doing, Greg? Greg Sanders : Same as you. Worried about Nick. Catherine : Yeah. I need to see his DNA from the crime scene. You have it, right? Greg Sanders : A sample from the condom, yeah. Popsicled in the freezer. But, uh, it's not your case. Much as I want to help, no can do. Catherine : That's my case for the next twelve hours. Ask the Sheriff. Greg Sanders : I would never doubt your word. Catherine : Smart man. (GREG opens the freezer and takes out the envelope. He removes the slide and puts it under the scope.) Greg Sanders : Nick's little soldiers. It's all you. Catherine : Thanks, Greg.  [SCOPE VIEW] Catherine : When did you say this sample was frozen? Greg Sanders : Um ... 10:15 A.M. Why? Catherine : These guys are all heads-- no tails. (Something occurs to CATHERINE. GREG moves over to look through the scope. CATHERINE rushes out of the  Greg Sanders : That's normal, given the post-ejaculate time frame. How is that going to help Nick? CUT TO: (CATHERINE fills GRISSOM in on her theory.) Catherine : The sperm found in the condom was frozen at 10:15 A.M. It's all heads, no tails. Grissom : I'm not quite up to speed on the particulars of ... Catherine : It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 A.M. But Kristy's time of death was 6:00 A.M. Grissom : Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy's murder but it doesn't disprove Nick's presence at the time of the homicide. Catherine : You could be a little more supportive. (CATHERINE walks away. SARA walks out of a nearby lab.) Sara : I have a new favorite color. Grissom : Orange? Sara : The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the thrift-right jacket. Guess where their regional headquarters is located.  Grissom : The Hansen Building. Sara : You bet. I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against thrift-right. Grissom : You get any hits?  Sara : Norman Stirling -- former manager. Grissom : How disgruntled? Sara : Let go last year. Caused a commotion at HQ. Filed lawsuits against the company. Guy's been out of work ever since. (SARA turns and heads back to the lab.) Grissom : Sitting around making bombs. CUT TO: (In the garage, NORMAL STIRLING tinkers with his car while his son, TYLER, sweeps the floors. BRASS, SARA and a couple of officers walk up the driveway.) Brass : Norman Stirling? Norman Stirling : Yes. What's going on? Sara : "FP." Norman Stirling : What? Sara : You don't recognize those initials? (Behind him, a couple of officers come in through the doorway from the house.) Norman Stirling : What's this about? Brass : The bombing of the thrift-right car rental and the bombing of the Hansen Building. Norman Stirling : A-a bomb? Are you kidding? I've never even been near a bomb my entire life. Sara : Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in. Norman Stirling : I used to wear those to go to work. Brass : You were let go by ThriftRright last year, and lost a court battle to get your job back. In fact, they filed a TRO against you for throwing furniture around their headquarters last July. Norman Stirling : I want to call my lawyer. Brass : Good. You can call him from the car. He can meet us at the PD. Take him in. Come on, let's go. (BRASS takes a hold of NORMAL STIRLING and the OFFICERS put cuffs on him.) Norman Stirling : (to TYLER) Call your mom. CUT TO: (CATHERINE walks up the pathway and up to the front door where she cuts the tape to the house.) (Cut to: In the bedroom, CATHERINE peels back the sheets and checks the bed.) (Cut to: In the living room, CATHERINE checks the sofa and under the cushions.) (She stops and looks around. From the curtains, to the fireplace and on to the other curtains where she definitely notices something.) (CATHERINE takes out the autopsy photographs and looks at the cord used to tie back the curtains. She compares it with the markings found around KRISTY'S neck. She's found the murder weapon.) CUT TO: (CATHERINE drops the cord out onto the table in front of GREG.) Catherine : (V.O.) Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash.  (She puts the evidence bag aside and continues to explain what she wants.) Catherine : It's fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer's hands, right? Greg Sanders : Abraded, yeah. Catherine : And can you extract DNA from epithelials? Greg Sanders : If they're fresh enough. (GREG gets to work. He takes a swab from the cord, then puts the sample under the scope.) [SCOPE VIEW] Greg Sanders : Okay, epithelials are an affirmative. And they're good to go for DNA profiling. I'm just going to need something to compare it to. Catherine : Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file. (GREG turns around to check on the database.) CUT TO: (NICK paces the floor. CATHERINE walks in.) Nick : Well? Catherine : I think that you and I should head over to the police station. Nick : (nods) DNA didn't pan out, huh? Catherine : (smiles sadly) Never have I seen such a clean match. Jack Willman killed her. (Quick flashback to: That night in KRISTY'S living room, JACK WILLMAN has the cord tied tight around her neck and chokes her. She struggles.) (Cut to: After KRISTY'S dead, he unwraps the cord from her neck. Cut to: He puts the cord back around the curtain.) (End of flashback. Resume to present.) (NICK sighs.) Nick : (smiles) Thank you.  (He hugs CATHERINE.)  Catherine : Hey ... hey, I'm just doing my job. Besides, if they'd sent you to jail I'd get stuck with all your cases. (NICK laughs.) CUT TO: (WARRICK continues to look at the "FP" etching on the gear piece. GRISSOM walks in.) Grissom : Dispatch said you were looking for me? Warrick : Yeah. I finally matched this "FP." To this electric etcher. Now, I made an exemplar. Boom! Identical type of striations. The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes. And it's only sold in bulk. It was not sold to Norman Stirling. Grissom : So who bought it? Warrick : Las Vegas School District. I called the district, and we traced it down to one high school -- summit high.  (GRISSOM looks at the paper.) Warrick : Stirling's son goes there. (GRISSOM looks at WARRICK.) CUT TO: (TYLER STIRLING and NORMAN STIRLING are being interviewed by BRASS and GRISSOM.) Brass : Tyler, were you aware of your father's lawsuits against thrift-right car rental? Tyler Stirling : It was kind of hard not to be. I mean, it's all him and my mom talked about for a year. Until she left. Grissom : Do you miss your mother? Tyler Stirling : I miss our old life. Norman Stirling : (quietly) Is there something that we should be talking about? You know, in private? Tyler Stirling : You said that's how corporations do it-- in private. See, they treated him great at work, in front of everyone. And then they let him go at the end of the day when no one's around. Thirty years of service, and then ... you know, they realized they could hire two young guys at half the price. Brass : What does "FP" stand for? It was etched into both bombs.  Grissom : We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class. (NORMAN looks at TYLER.) Tyler Stirling : "Fair play." (As soon as TYLER answers, NORMAN'S face falls with the realization that his son did it ... for him.) Norman Stirling : I used to yell that around the house -- that I was owed fair play. Tyler Stirling : I mean, they threw him out like trash. Norman Stirling : And you sent them bombs?! Tyler Stirling : You said you wanted to kill them. Norman Stirling : How did you even know how to do this? Tyler Stirling : Off the internet.  (GRISSOM closes his eyes.) Tyler Stirling : Dad, are you mad at me? I did it for you. Grissom : Tyler, did you make any more bombs? Where are they? Where are you keeping them? Norman Stirling : Tyler ... if you did this for me ... please tell them where they are. CUT TO: (DOMINIC listens to the scanner.) Dispatch : Victor 9, victor 9, report to summit high school, prairie road. Repeat -- Prairie Road. Reported bomb outside classroom 22b, in locker 897. (DOMINIC grabs his jacket, puts it on and leaves the house. The DISPATCH continues.) Dispatch : Bomb is trigger-activated and motion-delayed. Do not handle. CUT TO: (The alarm rings and the voice over the PA instructs students where to go.) Man Over P.A. : All students and faculty and all school personnel please exit the building. Security detail! Let's go! (Students calmly leave the school. DOMINIC rushes into the school passing by students.) Dominic Kretzker : I need classroom 22b.  Male Voice : Second floor! Dominic Kretzker : Where's 22b? [INT. STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS] (DOMINIC rushes up the stairs. He passes by students on their way out.) Dominic : Come on, people! Don't stop.  Male Voice : Come on. MALE VOICE: Outside. P.A. : All students and all faculty... Dominic : Come on, people, don't run. P.A. : All personnel are to exit the building immediately. Male Voice : Let's go. Everybody outside. P.A. : All students and faculty please exit the facility immediately and regroup in your designated areas. (DOMINIC reaches the red lockers and takes out a pocket knife that he uses to jimmy the locker open. He opens the locker and finds the bomb inside.) (He picks up the package. As soon as he moves it, the motion trigger sets off the clock timer.) (Quick CGI POV in through the box and to the alarm clock inside. The second hand starts moving. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) (DOMINIC cautiously carries the package and heads back for the front door.) Dominic Kretzker : Get out of my way, people. Come around me. (Sirens wail outside.) (Cut to: Outside, GRISSOM pulls up. He stops the car and runs out with the other OFFICERS. The students continue to run out of the school.) (As the last of them leave, DOMINIC exits the building carrying the package.) Grissom : Dominic, stop! Stop right there. Put it down! Dominic Kretzker : (smiles) No, it's all right. Everyone's safe. Grissom : No, no, no. Drop it. It's active! (Suddenly, DOMINIC stops smiling. He hears the clock timer ticking.) (Everything comes to a stop.) (Quick CGI POV to: Inside the package, the second hand hits 12. The charge goes off. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) (DOMINIC looks down at the package in his hands.) (OFF GRISSOM: As GRISSOM and the others watch, the bomb explodes.) (They're thrown back by the impact of the explosion. GRISSOM sits up and takes off his glasses.) CUT TO: (O'RILEY escorts JACK WILLMAN down the hallway. CATHERINE and NICK walk in.) Nick : Hi. Just the guy I wanted to see. (O'RILEY puts a hand on NICK to stop him from getting any closer.) Catherine : O'Riley. (CATHERINE shakes her head and they both step aside.) Nick : Tell me why you did it. Jack Willman : I got nothing to say to you, cowboy. (NICK grabs JACK and pushes his back up against the wall.) Nick : She was going back to college, turning her life around getting out of the business, and you killed her for it! Why? Jack Willman : Is that what she told you? She was getting out of the business? She was going to college to recruit more girls. Nick : Do you think I'm going to believe the John that killed her? Jack Willman : Oh, you think I was her client? I was her pimp. She was leaving me to start her own racket. So wake up. This isn't pretty woman. She's not Julia Roberts. You're not Richard Gere. (JACK takes a step aside, NICK grabs him and pushes him back up against the wall.) Nick : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. Because there's no happy ending for you. Twenty-five to life. Catherine : Get him out of here. (O'RILEY steps forward.) CUT TO: (GRISSOM eats his dinner and reads the front page of the paper. He looks at it, then smiles.) Grissom : (to himself) Above the fold. (He tears out the article.) (Cut to: Out in the hallway, GRISSOM pins the article onto the bulletin board, above the section, "ONE OF OUR OWN".) (The article headline reads: LOCAL HERO GIVES HIS LIFE. There's a photo of DOMINIC KRETZKER on the right with the caption: "Dominic Kretzker Saves Summit High Students". The caption under the headline reads: "Dominic Kretzker sacrificed his life today for the students of Summit High School. The article was written by Marilyn Mancia, Staff Writer.) [The entire article reads: "Dominic Kretzker sacrificed his life today for the students of Summit High School when the bomb he was removing exploded in his hands. Mr. Kretzker, a security guard at the Hansen Building, which was bombed just days ago, learned of the bomb threat at the High School and raced there to lend a hand. As a bomb enthusiast, Mr. Kretzker had extensive knowledge of how bombs worked. He'd located the bomb in a student's locker and was carrying it away from the student population to a container. But despite his expertise, he was unable to reach safety in time. (Repeats two more times.)] (GRISSOM walks away. The camera slowly pushes into the article and the photo of DOMINIC.) FADE TO BLACK.
