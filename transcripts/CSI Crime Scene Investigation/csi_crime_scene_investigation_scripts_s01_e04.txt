 COLD OPEN: 
 [EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] 
 [EXT. LAKE MEAD - NIGHT] 
 WHITE FLASH TO: 
 
[EXT. LAKE MEAD - NIGHT] (HANK and GEORGE are sitting in a boat fishing. HANK struggles to hook a worm.) Hank : Ah, these green worms ain't worth a damn. (Something thumps against the boat.) George : What the hell was that? Hank : I don't know, probably one of those eight-foot carp. (Something thumps against the boat again. GEORGE is spooked.) George : Let's get out of here. (GEORGE reaches for the engine pull cord and rips it. The engine sputters and dies.) Hank : Something probably caught on the blades. Check the prop. George : I'm not sticking my hand in that water. (HANK gets up to do it.) Hank : (irritated) Move. Move out of the way. Okay. (HANK reaches over the side of the boat and sticks his hand in the water. He feels around.) Hank : Yeah, I got something. (HANK pulls it up. He has his hand wrapped around the high heel of a woman's shoe.) George : Dude, throw it back. Hank : What the hell is it? (As he lifts it up, it's apparent that the woman's leg is still attached to the shoe.) SHORT TIME CUT TO: (GRISSOM sets up the light to shine it on the leg.) (All around the lake, OFFICIALS comb the water for the rest of the body.) (CATHERINE puts on her gloves as she approaches GRISSOM.) Catherine : Femur. Strongest bone in the human body -- it's sliced clean through. Grissom : Like a ginsu through a banana. (BRASS walks up to them.) Brass : So, what do you think, drowning? Grissom : Yeah, probably, but under what circumstances? You don't wear flippers at a five-star restaurant. Why would you wear three-inch heels at a lake? (to CATHERINE) So, Watson? The game is afoot. HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS (COMMERCIAL BREAK) FADE IN. [EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY] (WARRICK and NICK are in the locker room. NICK is changing his clothes and stands there shirtless; WARRICK fiddles with his tie as he prepares to go to court.) Nick : What do you think, bro? Breakfast on me? Warrick : I got a court date ... straight off of graveyard. It sucks. Nick : Ouch. Well, time-and-a-half. A cup of java, and you're set. (SARA walks into the locker room.) Sara : (o.s.) Fine suit.  (WARRICK and NICK turn around to find SARA in the locker room.) Sara : (to NICK) And well, just fine. Nick : That's harassment.  Sara : Hey, we have one locker room and it's my job to be observant. (NICK grabs a shirt and puts it on.) Warrick : Well, evidence vault opens in five. (WARRICK closes the locker door.) 
See you guys later. Nick : Later, bro. Sara : Easy. So, you and me, 419 Western LVU. Nick : I know, a dead body at a fraternity. 7:00 A.M.-Looks like we're pulling another double. Sara : I know, we don't have all day ... are, are you going to wear ... that? Nick : Yeah. Sara : It's that hideous ... Nick : Hideous. Thank you. (SARA leaves the locker room. NICK waits a moment, then undoes the buttons of his shirt to change it. He clears his throat and takes his shirt off.) CUT TO: (DR. JENNA WILLIAMS goes over the leg findings with CATHERINE.) Dr. Jenna Williams : Large propeller. Blade cut clean through. No epidermal bruising. The leg was severed post-mortem. Catherine : Well, that's good news. (DR. JENNA WILLIAMS covers the leg with the plastic.) Dr. Jenna Williams : How do you figure? Catherine : Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off? (The door bursts open and GRISSOM appears pushing a gurney with a body on it.) Grissom : I believe this goes with that. (beat) Divers recovered the body about a half a mile east of Calville Marina. Dr. Jenna Williams : Female caucasian, mid-30s. Left thighbone connected to nothing. I believe this is our victim. Catherine : Well, she's wearing a wedding ring. Grissom : Will you collect a rape kit? (DR. WILLIAMS looks up at GRISSOM.) Dr. Jenna Williams : Always do. (She checks out the hand.) Grissom : How's it look for prints? Dr. Jenna Williams : Her skin's shriveled like a shar-pei. No pressure, no prints. (GRISSOM looks expectantly at CATHERINE. CATHERINE knows that look.) Catherine : No. No way, use your own hand. Grissom : Come on, Catherine, my hand's too big. Catherine : (firmly) No! Grissom : It's the only way we can print her. Her skin on your hand should fit like a leather glove. (GRISSOM reaches for the hand and a knife. CATHERINE watches as GRISSOM takes the skin off of the hand. When he finishes, he looks up at CATHERINE and extends his hand to her.) Grissom : May I take your hand? (CATHERINE puts her hand in GRISSOM'S and he leads her to the table where the fingerprint kit is. Although we don't see it, GRISSOM puts the dead woman's skin on CATHERINE'S hand.) Grissom : On behalf of the decedent I thank you. (He takes the fingerprint.) Catherine : Umm ... Grissom : I think we're going to know who she is by lunchtime. Catherine : (shivers) Ugh! CUT TO: 
[EXT. WESTER LVU CAMPUS - FRATERNITY ROW - MORNING] (NICK and SARA walk into the fraternity. NICK looks around.) Nick : I can't believe I used to live in a place like this. It seems like a hundred years  Sara : And here I had all this respect for you. (They walk up to the group of college guys waiting for them.) Nick : Guys, Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab. (MATT DANIELS stands up and extends his hand to NICK.) Matt Daniels : How you doing? I'm Matt Daniels. Nick : Hey, Matt. Matt Daniels : James is upstairs if you guys want to follow me. Nick : Okay. (MATT turns and heads out. NICK and SARA follow him.) CUT TO: (SARA appears in the bedroom door. She looks inside and sees the body hanging from the ceiling. Also standing in the room is the DETECTIVE on the case. SARA walks in. NICK follows.) Sara : Hey. Detective Kane : Hey. (NICK sighs.) Nick : Good god. Sara : (to the DETECTIVE) You see a suicide note? Detective Kane : We didn't find one. Sara : Don't release anyone downstairs. We want to talk to them. All of them. (SARA puts her kit down and opens it.) Nick : Coroner pronounce? Detective Kane : Twenty minutes ago. (SARA takes out the camera and snaps a photo.) Nick : Let's get him down. (NICK turns away from the sight.) CUT TO: (CATHERINE looks a the photo of the woman who was found in the lake, WENDY BARGER. She and GRISSOM walk through the hallway.) Catherine : She's a floater, Wendy Barger. Thirty-four, local, Green Valley. Grissom : We should contact her family. Catherine : Already did. Talked to the husband. Never reported her missing. Grissom : The coroner said she'd been in the water for two days. Where's the husband now? Catherine : At the coroner's, I.D.-ing the body. CUT TO: 
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY] (CATHERINE and GRISSOM meet up with DR. JENNA WILLIAMS who fills them in on her findings.) Dr. Jenna Williams : Hey. Results are back on the rape kit. Positive for semen, vaginal penetration. Catherine : You confirming rape? Dr. Jenna Williams : Well, there are signs of a struggle. The victim's right shoulder is dislocated. Her skull is fractured. (Inhales) Give me a little more time with the body. Grissom : Sure. Thanks, Jenna. (JENNA WILLIAMS leaves. CATHERINE and GRISSOM turn and enter the waiting room where WINSTON BARGER waits.) (WINSTON BARGER stands up when they enter the room.) Grissom : Mr. Barger, my name is Gil Grissom. Winston Barger : Hello. (They shake hands.) Grissom : This is Catherine Willows. We're forensics investigators. Sit down. (They all sit down.) Catherine : We need to ask you a few questions. Winstone Barger : All right. Catherine : Is there anyone that you know of that might have wanted to harm your wife? Winston Barger : No. Everybody loved Wendy. Grissom : When was the last time you saw her? Winston Barger : Tuesday morning. She needed some time away ... to get perspective. She did that sometimes. Uh, we have a, a cabin up by Calville Bay. (GRISSOM looks at CATHERINE.) Catherine : And when was the last time you had intercourse with your wife? Winston Barger : Oh, that-that's personal. Catherine : It's part of our investigation, sir. Winston Barger : Uh, well, the average is only once a week. Saturdays. (There's an uncomfortable pause.) Catherine : Mr. Barger ... Winston Barger : (interrupts) Probably three or four months ago. Grissom : Would you be willing to give us a DNA sample, sir? Winston Barger : What's going on? I thought Wendy drowned. Catherine : We're still trying to piece it all together. A sample would be helpful. Grissom : By law, we need a warrant, unless you were willing to volunteer it. CUT TO: (SARA and NICK interview KYLE TRAVIS and MATT DANIELS.) Nick : Was James depressed? Kyle Travis : You could say that. Sara : Could you say that? I mean, the kid's 18 years old, he's got his whole life in front of him and why would he want to hang himself? Kyle Travis : I don't know. He didn't get in? Sara : "Get in" ... ? Kyle Travis : The fraternity. Pledging. I mean, it's not easy. Sara : Apparently not. Nick : So, you guys let James know he wasn't getting in, right? Matt Daniels : Yeah. I told him last night. I'm the one in charge of dinging pledges. Sara : Big job? How'd he take it? Kyle Travis : (pointedly) I think you know. CUT TO: (WARRICK shuts the car door. He carries a sealed plastic container with him. He walks up to the COUNTY COURTHOUSE 423 where he sees JUDGE COHEN walking out toward him.) Warrick : Hey, Judge. What's going on? I'm due in your court. Judge Cohen : Called for a continuance. Warrick : Well, nobody told me. Judge Cohen : Nobody was supposed to tell you. (JUDGE COHEN steps aside.) Judge Cohen : You're going to do something for me. Warrick : Judge, I thought we were even. How much longer am I under your thumb? Judge Cohen : You do what I ask, slate's clean. Henderson rape case. State's evidence. Warrick : Damn. I knew you were in tight. Judge Cohen : Judges aren't appointed on a whim. I owed the family. I need you to compromise the chain of custody. Warrick : Just like that?  (The JUDGE nods.) Warrick : We got a slam dunk on a three-time rapist and he's just going to walk? Judge Cohen : I have to have this case kicked. Warrick : I'm already on probation. Judge Cohen : Give them an excuse. You're good at that. You worked the graveyard. You pulled a double and you're tired. It could happen to anybody. Don't worry. I've got your back. Warrick : Yeah, I feel you back there, believe me. CUT TO: (GREG SANDERS looks through the scope, the music on his boom box playing. CATHERINE walks into the lab. GREG steps away from the scope and turns the music up.) (GRISSOM walks into the lab and immediately gets into the music. He calls out to GREG.) Grissom : (loudly) Hey, maestro, what's the deal on our floater? (GREG doesn't hear him. GRISSOM turns the music down.) Grissom : Excuse me. Professor? What's up with our floater? Greg Sanders : Come hither. (GREG puts the DNA results on the monitor. They look at it.) [CAMERA CLOSE UP - SAMPLE F981189] Catherine : DNA doesn't match. Greg Sanders : Thirteen markers, and not one of them matches the husband's types. Grissom : That's funny. I liked the husband for this. CUT TO: (CATHERINE and GRISSOM are in the interview room with WINSTON BARGER and his ATTORNEY.) Attorney : Well, you were wrong. My client's been through enough distress. Winston, come on. (The ATTORNEY stands up. WINSTON BARGER also stands up. Before he leaves the room, he looks at GRISSOM.) Winston Barger : When you find out what happened to my wife, I want to know everything. Grissom : I promise. (WINSTON BARGER leaves the room. GRISSOM puts the file back in his case and sighs.) Catherine : Let me ask you something. Would you want to know everything? Grissom : You're asking the wrong guy. (CATHERINE grabs her bag and they both head out of the room.) Catherine : Barger as much as told us that he and his wife were having problems. She was staying at the lake. It wasn't the first time. And what do you think the chances are she was seeing somebody else? [INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS] Grissom : You were married. You tell me. Catherine : Very good to excellent. FADE TO BLACK. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) FADE IN. [EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY] (WARRICK signs back in the evidence box he took with him to court.) Warrick : I need to see the Henderson Rape case 4217. Mike : Sure, in here.  (MIKE gets the key to the cage. He unlocks the door and they both enter the room. He reaches up on the shelf to bring the box down to the table.) Mike : Uh, sign here. Warrick : Thanks, Mike. (WARRICK watches as MIKE leaves the cage. WARRICK hesitates and doesn't sign the sheet. Again, he puts the pen down on the sheet, but doesn't sign it. WARRICK sighs.) (Behind him, GRISSOM appears in the door.) Grissom : Hey.  (WARRICK looks up.) Grissom : How's court? Warrick : Uh, damn case was continued. Clerk never called. Grissom : Look, go home. Take a day. You're been working your ass off. Warrick : (shakes his head) Nature of the beast. Grissom : I'm grateful, Warrick. I'm glad you're back. And I owe you a party. Warrick : Party? Grissom : Yeah, I made you a CSI three. (WARRICK chuckles.) Grissom : You'll see it in your next paycheck. Warrick : More money, more problems. Grissom : Mm ... Warrick : Thanks. Grissom : Yeah. (GRISSOM turns to leave.) Warrick : I appreciate it. (WARRICK sighs and looks back at the evidence box.) CUT TO: (BRASS is eating lunch in the break room. CATHERINE is also there.) Brass : If Wendy Barger was sleeping around, none of her friends knew about it. Catherine : Anybody seen her since Tuesday? Brass : Nope. And as far as I can tell, the husband's on the level. He was happier in the marriage than she was. Catherine : She had something on the side. I can tell you firsthand when you don't cheat, you don't suspect. Brass : Oh, man. I wish I had been married to you. Catherine : Not a chance. (CATHERINE closes her lunch and stands to throw it away.) Brass : (exaggerated) Oh ... mm ...  (GRISSOM appears in the doorway.) Grissom : Coroner just called. They're waiting for us. Catherine : Okay. Brass, you coming? Brass : (points to his food) I still got half a burger. Besides, I prefer live bodies. (He chuckles.) CUT TO: (CATHERINE and GRISSOM head for the coroner's. WARRICK appears behind them, trying to catch up with GRISSOM.) Warrick : Hey, Grissom. (They turn around.) You got a second? Uh, I'm in purgatory. Need some guidance. Grissom : (to CATHERINE) Meet you at the car. (GRISSOM walks toward WARRICK.) CUT TO: (DR. CORBETT goes over JAMES JOHNSON'S findings with NICK and SARA.) Dr. Corbett : Okay, here's your frat boy. We have a petechial hemorrhaging which is synonymous with asphyxia. (Quick CGI Close up of the eye.) Nick : So he asphyxiated by hanging? Are you ruling suicide? Dr. Corbett : No, not yet. When a victim is found hung we usually find some teeth marks on the tongue. (DR. CORBETT reaches into the mouth and pulls out the tongue.) Sara : No teeth marks. Nick : But we found him swinging from the ceiling. Sara : So, the question is, how did he get there? Dr. Corbett : Speaking of how did he get there ...  (DR. CORBETT lifts up the sheet. NICK turns away; SARA steps up.) Dr. Corbett : How did this get on his pen1s? Sara : Huh. Is that a tattoo? Dr. Corbett : No, no, it looks like ink. (NICK looks away. SARA looks at NICK.) Sara : Nick? You want to take a look at this? Nick : Oh, no, I ... don't have to look. I have a pretty good idea what this is all about, so ... Sara : (smiles) Okay. Nick : Knock yourself out. CUT TO: (NICK and SARA are back at the fraternity house interviewing KYLE TRAVIS and MATT DANIELS.) NICK Does your fraternity practice hazing? Kyle Travis : No. Matt Daniels : Yeah, I mean, it took a long time for Phi Alpha to get its charter. We have a strict no-tolerance policy and as president, I enforce that to the letter. Nick : (laughs) Come on, man, I was a Greek and we had all kinds of policies, too. Guys still hazed. Sara : We found ink on James's pen1s. Are you trying to tell us he was just practicing his penmanship? Matt Daniels : (insistent) State passed a law: No Hazing. It's six months in jail plus expulsion. We do not haze. Kyle Travis : But there is an initiation. (Quick flashback to: The Frat House. The new pledges and members meet.) (Cut to: KYLE TRAVIS.) Kyle Travis : Pledges, turn and face your active chapter. (The pledges turn around and the members shine bright powerful lights on them, blinding them. The heckling begins.)  Kyle Travis : For the past ten weeks you guys have accumulated points. Some of you are way ahead. Some of you are way ... behind.  (Cut to: KYLE TRAVIS holding pens in his hands.) Kyle Travis : (shouts) It's time ... to get signed! (The frat boys cheer.) Matt Daniels : (V.O.) I could tell right off the bat James was nervous, you know?  (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Matt Daniels : He was kind of the shy guy. I mean, he ... he wanted to pledge. He wanted to belong. Kyle Travis : (correcting MATT) Yeah, he wanted to belong, but you know what, I questioned his chops. I think we all did. (NICK clears his throat.) Matt Daniels : So, yeah, we gave the pledges an assignment: They were to go to sorority row and, uh, get ... different parts of their bodies signed. Kyle Travis : I mean, the menu was pretty straightforward. Arms and legs: Five points. Ten points for your chest, 25 points for your butt cheeks and 100 points for your Johnson. Sara : Your Johnson? Nick : Yeah, you know, your, uh ... Sara : (to NICK) I know what it is. (to KYLE) Don't stop now. (Quick flashback to: Fraternity House.) Kyle Travis : And Johnson ... ...your sorry ass is so far behind in points that you better get your ... "Johnson" ... (KYLE reaches down and grabs JAMES. JAMES jumps in surprise.) ... signed a couple hundred times or you're... history. (The members cheer and whoop.) (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Matt Daniels : Kyle caught him cheating in the bathroom. (Quick flashback to: KYLE standing in the middle of the common room with his hand on JAMES' shoulder.) Kyle Travis : He was signing himself. Frat Boy : Oh, man! FRAT BOY: No! (KYLE turns around and pours his cup of beer over JAMES' head.) Frat Boy : What a fake! (The other members join in and throw their cups full of beer on JAMES' also.) (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Sara : You humiliate him in front of all the other actives. Poor kid was so scared, he had to sign himself. You give him a beer shower? And you don't call that hazing? (Neither KYLE or MATT say anything. They look at each other. NICK gets angry at them.) Nick : (firmly) Answer the question, guys. Kyle Travis : I had no choice. I had to ding him. Matt Daniels : I mean, come on, you're only as strong as your weakest link. Kyle Travis : We didn't pledge him. He pledged us. He knew what to expect if he didn't measure up. Nick : Humiliation, initiation ... (beat) ... appreciation. Kyle Travis : That's what it's all about. Nick : Right, right? Matt Daneils : We're sorry, but we didn't kill him. (SARA looks at them.) Sara : I don't buy it. CUT TO: (WARRICK is on the phone in the hallway.) Warrick : (to phone) Judge ... Warrick. Listen, uh, I got a little problem. No, I can't talk about it over the phone. We got to meet in person. There's something in the evidence I think you should see. Good. (WARRICK hangs up the phone and sighs.) CUT TO: (DR. JENNA WILLIAMS goes over her findings with CATHERINE and GRISSOM.) Dr. Jenna Williams : I'll start at the top. Head contusion, right temple. Imbedded with wood splinters, lime green paint. (Camera zooms in to show the green-colored wood splinters in the head.) Catherine : What does that give us? Dr. Jenna Williams : Nothing yet, but when you find the murder weapon it might give you something to compare it against. Moving down, three words. Write them down. Minimal pulmonary aspiration. Grissom : (surprised) There was no water in her lungs? Dr. Jenna Williams : All I'm saying is, if she died by drowning her lungs would be flooded. (Quick CGI to: Camera zooms down WENDY BARGER'S open mouth, down through her wind pipe and into her lungs where water fills them up.) Dr. Jenna Williams : (V.O.) But her lungs weren't flooded. (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Grissom : So we think she was raped killed, then dumped in the lake. Dr. Jenna Williams : After a very nice dinner. Which brings me to her stomach.  (DR. WILLIAMS picks up the container of her stomach contents.)  Dr. Jenna Williams : Fried calamari and based on the extent of the digestion she died about three hours after she ate. CUT TO: 
[EXT. LAKE MEAD - LATE DAY] (GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk along the pier toward the front of the restaurant.) Catherine : Now tell me, why are we here? Grissom : 'Cause it's the only place within ten miles of Calville Bay that serves calamari. Catherine : And you know this because...? Grissom : I come here for calamari. Catherine : Oh. Alone? Grissom : No. Sometimes I have a beer with it. SHORT TIME CUT TO: (CATHERINE and GRISSOM show the WAITRESS a photo of WENDY BARGER. She looks at it.) Catherine : Do you recognize this woman? Waitress : She might have eaten here Tuesday night right around this time.  Catherine : Ordered the calamari. Waitress : Miss, everyone orders calamari. Catherine : Well, I don't care about everyone. I care about her. Waitress : Uh ... yeah. Yeah, I remember her. Um, she came in with a guy. Regulars. Good tipper. Grissom : Would you happen to know this "good tipper"'s name? CUT TO: (GRISSOM and CATHERINE interview PHIL SWELCO.) Catherine : Mr. Swelco, are you all right? Phil Swelco : (sniff) I can't believe she's dead. Grissom : Could you tell us about your affair with Wendy? Phil Swelco : Nobody knew we had one. Grissom : What about your wife? Phil Swelco : We were separated. We filed for divorce last week. I thought Wendy was going to do the same thing. Catherine : And... when she didn't, you got angry? (He turns and looks at CATHERINE.) Phil Swelco : No. No. That's not what I meant. I loved Wendy. She said the marriage was over. It's just that ... just ... she was scared. Catherine : Scared? Why? Phil Swelco : She didn't want to hurt Winston. She thought if she left, he'd ... break. Grissom : Tuesday night you and Wendy had dinner at the grille? Where'd you go after that? Phil Swelco : We went back to the marina in her car and then we took the outboard back here. Grissom : Why'd you take the boat? Phil Swelco : Wendy didn't want anybody to s-see her car in my driveway so we always met at the marina and then we'd take the outboard over here. Catherine : What happened once you got here? Phil Swelco : We made love. Then she left. Took the boat back. (CATHERINE turns to look at GRISSOM.) Grissom : Where is ... the boat? Phil Swelco : At the marina. SHORT TIME CUT TO: (CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk out of the house and head back to their car.) Catherine : Do you believe him? Grissom : I believe he had an affair. (GRISSOM looks out into the driveway and sees WINSTON BARGER standing in front of his car. He sees them and starts heading toward them.) Catherine : Is that the husband? (WINSTON BARGER walks up to GRISSOM and CATHERINE.) Grissom : Mr. Barger, what are you doing here? Winston Barger : You didn't call, so I was following you. Uh, this is ... Phil Swelco's house, isn't it? Grissom : Do you know Mr. Swelco? Winston Barger : Informally. Does he have something to do with Wendy's death? Catherine : We're interviewing a lot of people. Most of it's follow-up. (He nods.) Grissom : Mr. Barger, this is a time when you ought to let us do our job. You've been through a terrible ordeal. You've asked us to keep you posted and I promise we will keep you posted. Winston Barger : I just wanted to see if you guys have anything new. Catherine : As soon as we know, you'll know.  Winston Barger : All right. (WINSTON BARGER walks back to his car and gets in.) Grissom : Drive safely. (The engine starts and he drives off.) (CATHERINE and GRISSOM head back to their car.) Catherine : You know, eventually we're going to have to tell him that his wife was having an affair with somebody he knows. Grissom : No, we don't, Catherine. We have to tell him how he died. Just the facts, without all the other stuff. Catherine : When Eddie was cheating on me I sure wish somebody would have said something. Grissom : You mean me. (beat) (CATHERINE opens the car door.) Catherine : Who else? FADE TO BLACK. 
 
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) FADE IN. (GRISSOM looks a the tarantula in the tank he's holding up to his eye level. CATHERINE knocks on the door. He looks up; she walks into the office.) Catherine : New pet? Grissom : The African Red Baboon Tarantula -- the most feared of all arachnids. But basically harmless. Catherine : Yeah, well just keep the lid on it, okay? Grissom : I think you scared him. All his hairs are standing up. Catherine : If you're through amusing yourself I have some news on the boat. Grissom : Was it at the Marina? Catherine : What do you think? Grissom : My spider sense says it wasn't. Catherine : Right. We need to find the boat. CUT TO: (NICK puts his food in the microwave oven. SARA walks into the break room waving a file folder.) Sara : The coroner's prelim on the frat hanging. Nick : Bust it out. (SARA lifts her head and sniffs.) Sara : What's that smell? Nick : I'm nuking a burrito. Sara : Mmm, junk food and radiation-- good combo.  (SARA opens the file and starts reading.) Sara : A strip of raw calf's liver was found lodged inside the cleft of victim's throat. Cause of death: Choking. Nick : (nods) Mm-hmm. That's interesting. Sara : Microscopic threads of fabric were found embedded in the liver. CUT TO: (NICK and SARA interview KYLE TRAVIS.) Kyle Travis : Microscopic fabric? I have no idea what you're talking about. You just lost me. Nick : Kyle, I'm getting that "hazing" feeling. Sara : Did you stuff him? Suffocate him? Shove towels down his throat? Kyle Travis : No. Look, lady, I have no idea where you're going with all this but you're way off. (NICK stands off to the side in the shadows.) Nick : Tell me about the liver. Kyle Travis : What about the liver? Nick : Kyle ... Kyle ... eleven years ago I was you, man. Smoking cigars in closets, playing tanks. I wore a trout in my jean pocket for seven days till my leg went half numb. I've been there. So, don't ... don't tell me "what about it?" Kyle Travis : (sighs) Okay. James begged us for one more shot so, we came up with a challenge.  (Quick flashback to: Camera close up of a bloody piece of liver in a container.) Kyle Travis : (V.O.) Swallowing raw liver. (KYLE holds up the piece of liver. JAMES JOHNSON opens his mouth.) (Cut to: JAMES coughs. MATT DANIELS sits on the couch on the side watching. He starts to choke.) Kyle Travis : Oh, man. Oh, man, he's choking. (MATT gets off of the couch.) Matt Daniels : Give him the heimlich. Give him the heimlich. Give him the heimlich! (They grab JAMES and try to get the liver out of him.) Matt Daniels : He's turning blue! (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Sara : How does a kid choke to death and end up hanging from a rafter? (KYLE doesn't look at SARA. He looks at NICK. NICK nods his head and steps away.) Kyle Travis : (sighs) Okay. We freaked. I mean, we had a lot to lose here. We could lose our charter or get kicked out of school or even go to jail. So, me and Matt, we strung him up, and ... made it look like he'd committed suicide. (NICK looks down and nods his head.) Sara : You do realize you just admitted to killing him? Kyle Travis : We didn't kill him. It was an accident. Sara : It was an accident. But now it's beginning to look like Christmas. Kyle Travis : Look, (sighs) ... my dad's a top defense attorney so, if charges are filed ... (NICK grabs a chair and sits down.) Nick : Don't worry. They will be. Kyle Travis : It'll be manslaughter, not murder. And me and Matt wind up with community service. CUT TO: (NICK and SARA walk out into the hallway.) Nick : We can hold him for manslaughter. Sara : Manslaughter -- are you kidding? Are you willing to settle for that? Come on, Nick, you know as well as I do there is more to this. Nick : You're going 80 miles an hour in second gear. Let's just slow down, all right? Sara : Okay. Nick : They said they performed the heimlich, right? Sara : Yeah. I don't believe them. Nick : Well, if they performed the heimlich, there'd be evidence of trauma.  Sara : Yes, there would. (SARA nods and walks away. NICK follows her.) CUT TO: DISSOLVE INTO CLOSE UP: CHEST X-RAY ON A VIEWBOX (DR. CORBETT goes over the chest x-ray with SARA and NICK.) Dr. Corbett : Well, now, you're right. If they gave this frat kid the heimlich chances are we'd find a broken rib. Nick : Not even a fracture. Sara : What about abdominal or thoracic bruising? Dr. Corbett : Nope. Photos are all negative. Sara : They lied. When this kid was choking, no one tried to help him. Dr. Corbett : Take a look at this.  (DR. CORBETT moves to the keyboard monitor. He works on the keyboard.) Dr. Corbett : Now, we magnified Mr. Johnson's privates.  (SARA glances back at NICK and sees that he's watching the monitor. NICK glances at SARA.) Dr. Corbett : The ink is from a felt tip. It's a paper max thin tip to be exact. (SARA nods her head.) Sara : (reading) "JILL W." Two triangles. Nick : (correcting) No, it's two deltas. Greek letters. She's a delt. (SARA closes her eyes and groans.) Sara : Freaks. CUT TO: (NICK and SARA interview JILL WENTWORTH. NICK takes out a photograph of the 
"signature" and shows it to JILL WENTWORTH) Nick : Jill, we need to ask you a question. Is this your signature? (She looks at it, covers her eyes and laughs.) Jill Wentworth : (laughing) Oh, my god. Oh, where did you get that? Sara : Where do you think? Jill Wentworth : You don't think that has something to do with what happened? Nick : We don't know yet. That's what we're trying to find out. How well did you know James? Jill Wentworth : Uh, he was pledging my boyfriend's house. We're Greek, I mean ... we sign them. They sign us. ... Sara : (unimpressed) Of course you do. Nick : Who's your boyfriend? Jill Wentworth : Kyle Travis. (SARA looks at NICK. He clears his throat and looks down.) CUT TO: (NICK breaks the seal to JAMES JOHNSON'S dorm room. He opens the door. He and SARA walk inside.) [INT JAMES' ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] (NICK and SARA put their kits down and start searching the room.) Sara : So, looking for fibers. Nick : Yeah, fibers liver-anything to implicate these guys. (NICK looks across the room and heads for the trash can. He looks inside and empties its contents on the floor. He picks up a piece of string with a bloodied loop on the end.) (Camera zooms in to show the bloodied string loop.) Sara : What the heck is that? Nick : The murder weapon. Dingle-dangle. CUT TO: (WARRICK walks down the hallway drinking from a cup. He meets up with GREG SANDERS who is wearing head phones.) Warrick : Let me guess. Radiohead or Rage against the machine. Greg Sanders : Actually, it's an audio book on restriction enzyme analysis and DNA typing. PCR fingerprinting. Choice. Warrick : Right. (As they pass the garage, GREG looks in through the window and sees GRISSOM inside.) Greg Sanders : What's Grissom doing in the garage? Warrick : Oh, he's working that Wendy Barger case -- you know, the floater? Greg Sanders : Oh. Warrick : Only clue he's got is a missing boat which sucks, 'cause ... it's missing. Greg Sanders : (chuckles) He thinks he's going to find it in a bathtub? Warrick : It's a simulation tank. He's re-creating the conditions the night she died. Body was dumped, like, a half mile from Calville Bay. They think the boat must have drifted with the currents. Greg Sanders : And let me guess -- Catherine got bored. Warrick : Well, you know Grissom. Shortest distance between two points is science. And for Catherine, it's pounding the pavement. Greg Sanders : Hey, I thought Grissom gave you the night off. Warrick : (nods) Yeah. Something came up. See you. (WARRICK walks away.) CUT TO: 
SCENES #33: [INT. CSI - GARAGE -- NIGHT] (GRISSOM puts a card with "SWELCO" on one section of the tank. GRISSOM opens the map and double checks the cards surrounding the tank. The camera pans from BARRING POINT BRIDGE to FLAMINGO REEF to MARINA / CALVILLE BAY.) (Once he has it, he puts the map away and picks up a small motor that he puts into the tank to simulate the currents.) CUT TO: 
[EXT. LAKE MEAD SHORELINE - NIGHT] (Camera close up of CATHERINE'S boots trudging through the water and carrying a big flashlight.) CUT TO: 
[INT. CSI GARAGE - NIGHT] (GRISSOM sets up a fan on the outside of the tank to simulate the wind conditions.) (He moves around the tank carrying a compass to double check the current and wind conditions.) CUT TO: 
[EXT. LAKE MEAD SHORELINE - NIGHT] (Out near the water's edge, CATHERINE scans the shoreline with her flashlight.) CUT TO: 
[INT. CSI GARAGE - NIGHT] (GRISSOM picks up a small plastic toy boat from off the table. With the compass in hand, he heads for the tank.) CUT TO: 
[EXT. LAKE MEAD SHORELINE - NIGHT] (CATHERINE continues to walk along the shoreline, using the flashlight to look for the boat.) CUT TO: 
[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- NIGHT]  (GRISSOM carries the boat to its starting point: the label marked SWELCO. He puts the boat in the tank and sets it off. He watches as the boat swings toward FLAMINGO REEF and past BARRING POINT BRIDGE.) CUT TO: 
[EXT. BARRING POINT BRIDGE -- NIGHT] (CATHERINE walks under the bridge. She uses the flashlight and checks the shoreline for the missing boat. She sees something. She tucks the flashlight under her arm and uses the night vision binoculars.) NIGHT VISION GREEN: (The boat is tucked in the reeds on the water.) (CATHERINE puts down her binoculars and smiles.) CUT TO: (The phone rings. GRISSOM answers it.) Grissom : Yeah? Grissom. INTERCUT WITH: Catherine : It's me. I found it. Just South of Barring Point Bridge. Grissom : How? Catherine : I took a walk. (GRISSOM walks toward the water tank.) Grissom : Just South of Barring Point Bridge? What color is the boat? Catherine : It's white with lime green trim. Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound. Grissom : Well done, Catherine. Well done. (CATHERINE stifles a giggle.) Grissom : (from phone) let's get the boat back to the garage. (GRISSOM hangs up the phone and looks at the water tank. Inside, the toy boat stopped at BARRING POINT BRIDGE.) (GRISSOM looks down into the water and sighs.) FADE OUT. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) FADE IN. (WARRICK sits on a park bench. JUDGE COHEN approaches him. WARRICK stands up.) Judge Cohen : This better be good. Warrick : I need some assurances. Judge Cohen : It's a two-way street, pal. Did you do what I asked? Warrick : I checked out the evidence, yeah. But I'm not sure about the rest. Judge Cohen : What's the big deal? You break the seal on the evidence box it's over. We put it to bed, I tell Henderson "mission accomplished." (WARRICK raises his hand and gives a thumbs up signal.) Warrick : Why don't you let me do that? (The Police Siren blare and officers arrive at the park. JUDGE COHEN looks around.) Judge Cohen : What's going on here? (BRASS walks up to WARRICK and JUDGE COHEN.) Brass : Judge Cohen, you're under arrest for obstruction of justice tampering with state's evidence and violating seven articles of scumbag. (JUDGE COHEN turns to look at WARRICK. WARRICK lifts his shirt to show him the listening device taped to his chest. The officers put the JUDGE in handcuffs.) Warrick : I told you ... nobody owns me. (WARRICK puts his shirt down. The OFFICER takes JUDGE COHEN away.) Officer : Move on. Brass : Nice work, man. (WARRICK sighs.) CUT TO: (GREG walks into the break room where GRISSOM is eating.) Greg Sanders : Hey, Grissom. I hear Catherine beat you to the boat. Grissom : We work as a team. We're not competing. (GREG gets his yogurt out of the refrigerator and opens it.) Greg Sanders : Okay. But, ah, she found it first. Right? Grissom : "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, sorry I could not travel both." Greg Sanders : Robert Frost. Grissom : Very good, Greg. Greg Sanders : Thanks. (GREG takes a seat opposite GRISSOM.) Grissom : But actually, in this case, Mr. Frost does not apply. When you have a partner you each take a road. That's how you find a missing boat. Greg Sanders : Come on. Level with me. Who do you think killed her -- the husband or boyfriend? (GRISSOM looks at GREG.) Grissom : And you've narrowed it down to just two suspects? Greg Sanders : Actually, you did. You see, my second week at CSI, you told me that when a cheating spouse is murdered there's always two suspects at the top of the list: The lover and the betrayed. Grissom : I told you this? Greg Sanders : Mm-hmm. You see, I'm thinking that the husband caught Wendy with the boyfriend and when she left his house, he killed her in a jealous rage. Grissom : And this theory is based on...? (GRISSOM stands up.) Greg Sanders : Nothing. I'm just trying to help. Grissom : I'm going to the garage to meet Catherine. (GRISSOM tosses his plate.) You keep thinking, Butch. That's what you're good at. (GREG stands up to follow GRISSOM to the door.) Greg Sanders : Hey. If this theory checks out, uh maybe we should talk about a raise. Grissom : Yeah. (GRISSOM leaves.) CUT TO: (Camera opens on PHIL SWELCO'S BOAT #NV355 and around the Yamaha engine.) (GRISSOM checks the inside of the boat. CATHERINE checks the outside edges of the boat.) (CATHERINE sees something. Catherine : I think I may have found some skin. When Wendy hit her head. Did you hear what I said? (GRISSOM picks up the camera and holds it.) Grissom : Blood. Catherine : Blood? Well, you were at the autopsy. The head trauma wasn't a bleeder. Grissom : Well, maybe she fought back. Either way, we got to call Brass. Tell them to bring the boyfriend in. (CATHERINE puts her things aside and walks to find a phone. GRISSOM snaps the photo.) CUT TO: (BRASS opens the door and PHIL SWELCO walks out into the hallway.) Brass : Could you wait right here, please? (to the OFFICER) Stay with Mr. Swelco. (BRASS walks up to GRISSOM. CATHERINE joins them.) Grissom : How's it going? Brass : Aah, you know, the usual beep-bap-bop, you know? The guy said he cut his hand cleaning fish. Got a tetanus shot. That's his excuse for the blood we found on the boat. But I'll call the Lake Clinic to confirm. Catherine : (teasing) Damn, you're good. (In the background, WINSTON BARGER appears in the hallway.) Brass : Oh, shut up. Stevie, hang with him. Winston Barger : (o.s.) Phil? Phil Swelco? (PHIL SWELCO looks up.) (At the sound of his voice, GRISSOM and CATHERINE straighten and look back at WINSTON BARGER.) Phil Swelco : Winston. (beat) I heard about your wife. I'm sorry. Winston Barger : What are you doing here? Why are you questioning him? Catherine : Mr. Barger, why don't you, um come over here with me. Just walk over ... (CATHERINE takes WINSTON BARGER down one end of the hallway. GRISSOM goes to PHIL SWELCO.) Grissom : Mr. Swelco. Why don't we go in here sit down. (GRISSOM takes PHIL SWELCO back into the room.) Catherine : Have a seat. (They sit down.) Winston Barger : I always knew she was seeing someone. I just didn't know who. Catherine : (sighs) Oh, I'm sorry. Winston Barger : She was having an affair with Phil Swelco? And you think he killed her. CUT TO: (GRISSOM and CATHERINE argue in the parking lot.) Grissom : You just compromised our investigation. Catherine : He deserved to know the truth. Grissom : Knowing how she died, yes. Knowing that she had an affair -- how does that bring closure? Catherine : I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand. Grissom : You can't make this about Eddie. Look, you hurt our case because your ex hurt you. Catherine : We bring ourselves to our cases. We can't help it. I knew how Barger felt. Would you just relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse. Grissom : You can't give him anything, Catherine. We're scientists. We're not psychiatrists or victims' rights advocates. Catherine : You right, you know. I should be just like you. Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships. No chance any will slop over into a case. Right. I want to be just like you. Grissom : Technically, it's a townhouse. And the crosswords are advanced, not genius. But you're right. I'm deficient in a lot of ways. But I never screw up one of my cases with personal stuff. Catherine : Grissom ... what personal stuff? CUT TO: (NICK and SARA re-interview MATT DANIELS.)  Nick : Matt, I got to know. How much did it tick Kyle off? Matt Daniels : What are you talking about? Nick : Jill. (laughs) Man, Kyle must've been steamed. His girlfriend signs a pledge's privates? Matt Daniels : Yeah, Kyle, can take a joke. Sara : He didn't think it was funny enough to share it with us. You know, I never met a guy who could just laugh that off. Nick : Hey, Matt you know why I joined a fraternity? 'Cause I wanted to belong to something -- the brotherhood. That's what it was all about for me you know what I mean? So, I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud. You come clean, you might be able to save your house ... save the brotherhood, but ... if you don't ...  Sara : You and Kyle both get charged with murder. And the House goes dark. Nick : Everything you're trying to protect you'll destroy. Matty, I found the string. Now are you ready to tell us what happened after James got back to that house? Matt Daniels : Okay. (Quick flashback to: ) Matt Daniels : Hey, let's see what Johnson came up with. Frat Boy : Yeah? FRAT BOY: Yeah, let's see it, dude. FRAT BOY: Show it! (JAMES nods and takes off his pants.) Matt Daniels : Dude ... that's your girlfriend. She signed it. (KYLE steps up. JAMES smiles smugly at KYLE. They guys hoot in the background.) Kyle Travis : Good. (JAMES puts his pants back on.) Kyle Travis : Meet me upstairs, pledge.  (White flash to: KYLE and JAMES are up in the bedroom. KYLE holds onto the string with the piece of raw liver on it.) Kyle Travis : You're still behind in points. So this is what we're going to do. I'm going to put this down your throat you're going to swallow it and you're going to trust me to pull it back out. Okay. (KYLE holds out the piece of liver and JAMES swallows it. He pulls on the string and it comes loose. JAMES chokes on the piece of liver. KYLE sits in front of JAMES and watches him.) (Cut to: MATT sees KYLE in the doorway.) Matt Daniels : Dude, where's Johnson? (MATT walks into the room and his smile freezes when he sees JAMES dead.) (White flash to: MATT stares at JAMES' body.) Matt Daniels : Oh, oh, this is crazy. Kyle Travis : All right, all right, all right, listen to me. Anything goes down my father will bail out the chapter.  (Flash to: ) Kyle Travis : Now you're just going to follow my lead and you're going to keep your mouth shut. (End of flashback. Resume to present.) (MATT puts his head down. SARA looks over at NICK. NICK nods his head.) CUT TO: (Inside the cell, KYLE TRAVIS lies on the bed. The sliding door opens and closes. SARA and NICK walk in.) Kyle Travis : Is my dad here yet? Sara : No, but when he gets here, you can tell him. New charge: First degree murder. (KYLE sits up on the bed.) Kyle Travis : No way, come on. That's ridiculous. Nick : Your boy rolled over on you, slick. Sara : One thing about the fraternity upstate, the brotherhood's fantastic. Nick : Oh, yeah. They gonna love you. CUT TO: (GRISSOM checks the gasoline can. It clangs hollowly. He puts it down. He and CATHERINE stand outside of PHIL SWELCO'S boat.) Grissom : She ran out of gas. Catherine : Okay. Grissom : Get in the boat. Pull the engine cord. Catherine : What? Grissom : Get in the boat. Catherine : Why? Grissom : Just indulge me, please? Catherine : There's no gas. It's not gonna start. Grissom : That's not the point. Catherine : (sighs) As long as there is one. (She steps into the boat. She braces her foot on the edge of the boat and pulls the engine cord. Nothing happens.) Grissom : Pull it again. (CATHERINE rips the cord.) Grissom : Go on. (Again.) Grissom : More. (And again.) Grissom : Harder.  (And again several more times.) Grissom : Go on. (She finally drops the cord and turns angrily to GRISSOM.) Catherine : That's it. What's your point? Grissom : How does your shoulder feel? Catherine : It's sore. (realizing) But you already knew that.  Grissom : I know what happened to Wendy. (Quick flashback to: WENDY BARGER kisses PHIL SWELCO goodbye.) Grissom : (V.O.) She says good night to Swelco ... (Cut to: PHIL SWELCO pushes the boat away from the pier with WENDY inside.) Grissom : (V.O.) ... and gets in the boat. Halfway home, the boat runs out of gas. (Cut to: WENDY sits inside the unmoving boat.) Grissom : (V.O.) ... Stranded in the middle of the lake, she panics. Starts pulling on the engine cord. (WENDY pulls on the cord multiple times.) Grissom : (V.O.) ... She pulls so hard, she dislocates her shoulder and falls forward.  (WENDY hits the edge of the boat and falls overboard. She remains floating in the water.) Grissom : (V.O.) ... Wendy goes under, where she remains until a barge's propeller severs her leg. (End of flashback. Resume to present.) Grissom : She died before she ever hit the water. Catherine : It was just an accident. Grissom : Well, sometimes it's about what didn't happen. Catherine : Well ... (sighs) ... I guess we better go talk to the husband. I mean, unless you think I'm going to compromise the integrity of the case again. (CATHERINE gets up.) Grissom : Look ... could we have a truce? Catherine : I would love to. Grissom : Good.  (GRISSOM helps CATHERINE out of the boat.) Grissom : But let me do all the talking to the husband and the boyfriend. Catherine : (shakes her head) (quietly) He had to say it. CUT TO: (WARRICK spots GRISSOM in the hallway.) Warrick : Hey.  (CATHERINE walks out into the hallway.) Grissom : I'll meet you outside, okay? Catherine : Okay. Hey, Warrick. Warrick : Hey, Cath. (CATHERINE puts on her jacket and heads outside.) Grissom : Did it go okay? Warrick : Yeah. Fine. Thanks for letting Brass handle it. Grissom : The fewer people who know about this the better.  (WARRICK nods)  Grissom : I'm proud of you. You know, Judge Cohen's got a lot of soldiers. Warrick : Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. Grissom : You know, I can only help you out so much. After that, it's up to you. Warrick : Yeah, I know. (GRISSOM heads outside leaving WARRICK standing there.) CUT TO: 
[EXT. LAKE MEAD - MORNING] Cue Sound : KNOCKING (The door opens. GRISSOM and CATHERINE are standing outside on the porch.) Grissom : Hello?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco? (They open the door. CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk inside.) (They both head upstairs.) (PHIL SWELCO is on the ground, dead. WINSTON BARGER sits in the nearby chair crying. The gun still in his hand.) Winston Barger : He killed my wife. Catherine : We just came from your house. We wanted to tell you that your wife's death was an accident. Winston Barger : What? (GRISSOM walks over to WINSTON BARGER. He takes a glove out of his pocket and grabs the gun from his loose grip.) (CATHERINE kneels down to check on PHIL SWELCO.) Grissom : He didn't kill her. (WINSTON BARGER whimpers and starts crying.) FADE TO BLACK. End
