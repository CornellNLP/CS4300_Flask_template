 You are truly a weaver. 
 I didn’t finish. 
 In time, you will complete your forespell 
 and your familiar will be revealed. 
 I am no charlatan. 
 My kind are loyal to the crown, Lord Burghley, 
 Then why keep this marriage secret from Her Majesty? 
 I’ve sent ambassadors to Bohemia to retrieve Kelley. 
 -The Emperor rebuffed them. -Very well, Your Majesty. 
 I will bring you Kelley. 
 Then I may forgive your recent mistakes. 
 This is what mating is. An unspeakable urge to possess you, 
 body and soul. The rage that feeds on it. 
 Matthew. 
 I am nothing without Diana! 
 I have done all that I can do to help you. 
 Stay away from her. 
 -Kit? -Louisa! 
 -I came to see my brother. -We have much to discuss. 
 Your heart’s broken, and yet it still beats for him. 
 The Book of Life was in this possession. 
 He tore three of its pages out. 
 Kelley claims to have bequeathed a single page 
 to each of the three species. 
 Is everything all right? 
 I don’t think so. 
 You know, there’s a part of me that can imagine staying here, 
 building a life together, you, me and Jack. 
 Hmm. If only it were that simple. 
 But we don’t belong in this time. 
 Perhaps we’ve already been here too long. 
 Why can’t I come with you today? 
 The Queen can be unpredictable at the best of times. 
 But when someone has failed her, she can be especially vengeful. 
 You’re being overprotective. 
 This is not about me protecting you, Diana. 
 This is about your presence making matters even worse. 
 Find the way with your magic so we can return to the present. 
 I’ll escort you to Goody Allsop’s. 
 Oh, Diana, we’ve missed you. 
 She has been unwell. 
 We feared she would not survive the winter. 
 Goody? 
 I told you I’d come back. 
 Oh! 
 Perhaps you are the tonic I require. 
 Much has happened for us since you’ve been away. 
 Agnes Sampson was tortured. 
 And Scotland is aflame with witch hunts. 
 The persecutions are spreading south like wildfire. 
 We are the last of the weavers now. 
 I’ll see what I can do to quell any anxiety at Whitehall. 
 Master Roydon. 
 Your countenance has changed since we last met. 
 The dark clouds that circled you 
 have lifted somewhat. 
 Kind of you to say. 
 But there is something else. 
 I’m pregnant. 
 That’s impossible. 
 Apparently not. 
 Vampires reproduce through resurrection. 
 This child would be overturning 
 thousands of years, millennia, of biology. 
 It’s funny, I… 
 I felt different. 
 But I didn’t dare to entertain the thought. 
 This is uncharted territory, Diana. 
 We have to get back to our own time as soon as we can. 
 What about Jack? 
 I hate the idea of leaving him as much as you do. 
 I’ll ensure that he’s well looked after. 
 First, I must placate the Queen. 
 Then I’ll make arrangements for Jack. 
 We can’t go back yet, Matthew. Not until I perfect my magic. 
 I still have the final knots to master. 
 I will meet with the Queen alone. 
 And I will buy you the time that you need. 
 Goody, are you sure you’re well enough? 
 I’m not dead yet, Diana. 
 To return to your own time, you need to complete your training. 
 Shall I fetch the others? 
 With haste please, Susanna. 
 Matthew, going to court. 
 I thought you’d gone forever. 
 What of the witch? Are you free of her? 
 Kit, why can’t you understand? 
 As long as Diana and I are alive, we will never be parted. 
 Never. 
 You have mastered knot three, Diana, 
 but there are 10 knots. Still much to do. 
 I see them. The threads of the universe. 
 You are humming with a new and powerful energy. 
 I can feel it. 
 You know what to do. 
 With knot of one, the spell is begun. 
 With knot of two, the spell is true. 
 With knot of three, the spell is free. 
 With knot of four, the power is stored. 
 With knot of five, the spell will thrive. 
 With knot of six, this spell I fix. 
 With knot of seven, the spell will waken. 
 It is a firedrake! 
 Focus, Diana. 
 What do I call you? 
 Oh! 
 Your familiar will return when she is needed. 
 For now, you must focus on the knots. 
 Her Majesty is keen to hear why you failed your mission. 
 Perhaps your appearance will distract her from a crippling toothache. 
 -Your Majesty. -Silence. 
 I wanted Kelley. 
 Kelley is a charlatan, 
 but Emperor Rudolf will not part with him. 
 Falsehoods and lies ooze from your mouth 
 like drool from a dog! 
 The Emperor’s odious ambassador 
 informed me that you preferred to liberate a book! 
 The clove oil! 
 Your Majesty. 
 It is the book I spoke of, Your Majesty. 
 The book of greatness to all creatures. 
 But not to me. 
 I beg forgiveness, Your Majesty. 
 You are a changed man, Shadow. 
 I tire of your false deference. 
 You will hand over the book forthwith, so I may return it to the Ambassador. 
 I’m sorry. 
 It was stolen en route from Bohemia. 
 Is that so? 
 Lord Burghley, 
 you will oversee an immediate search of Master Roydon’s home. 
 It would be my pleasure, Your Majesty. 
 -I will gladly accompany… -You will remain here 
 until he returns. 
 Should you be caught in a lie, 
 your punishment shall be grave indeed. 
 Flee 
 and I will treat your wife like the witch that she is. 
 -This has nothing to do… -One more word 
 and your severed head will adorn the palace gates. 
 I want every book inside this building. 
 Tear it apart if you must. 
 Diana. Diana, Matthew is in grave danger. 
 I need you to come with me. Please. 
 Kit, what happened to him? 
 My sources at Whitehall say the Queen has cast him into a dungeon. 
 We should fetch Gallowglass. 
 It would take hours to scour all the taverns! 
 Look, I know that we’ve had our differences, 
 but surely we are united in our desire for Matthew’s safety. 
 Let’s go to him, now. 
 I will not ask you again. 
 Hand it over, boy. 
 -Master Roydon will not be… -Roydon’s feelings are irrelevant. 
 Our orders come directly from the Queen. 
 And I advise you not to interfere. 
 Why on God’s earth did you steal the book? 
 I had to. Rudolf wasn’t going to surrender it. 
 Had I known you were returning, I would have advised you against it. 
 The persecution of witches is escalating. 
 The Queen’s paranoia will be the death of us all. 
 I would vouch for you, but I am not in the Queen’s good grace. 
 I could summon Hal? Or Mary? She has the Queen’s ear. 
 I need to solve this myself, old friend. 
 Before Cecil returns. 
 How? 
 With the truth. 
 There’s nothing else here, sir. 
 Check every room again. 
 Our work here is done. 
 I hope Master Roydon’s books will be returned. 
 I doubt he will have need of books for much longer. 
 Whoa! You will stand aside. 
 Well, I am loyal to Master Roydon. 
 And I’m afraid I’ve sworn to protect his interests. 
 Your misplaced loyalties will not end well. 
 I suggest you stand aside immediately. 
 Gallowglass… 
 Gentlemen. 
 Your Majesty. 
 Your blood could make me immortal. 
 Altering the English succession by placing a creature on the throne, 
 as I told your father before you, would lead to chaos. 
 My death will lead to chaos. 
 My enemies snap at my heels. 
 What will happen when I am gone? 
 There will be no Spanish invasion. 
 And, as for the witches, they need not concern you. 
 How can you possibly know your Queen’s future? 
 Because I have seen it. 
 You are no astrologer. 
 Diana is a time-spinner. 
 We arrived here in 1590 from centuries in the future. 
 Many would think you were delusional. 
 If these claims came from anyone but you, Shadow, 
 I would not believe a word. 
 And yet, in your heart, 
 you know it to be true. 
 You are a future, Matthew. 
 Your true Shadow could not have disappointed you so. 
 And my realm… 
 It is secure. 
 And 500 years hence, 
 every man, woman and child knows your name. 
 Queen Elizabeth I. 
 Gloriana, 
 the greatest monarch in English history. 
 Matthew. 
 Thank you. 
 You’re welcome. 
 Bess. 
 Diana? 
 Pierre and Gallowglass have gone to fetch her from Goody Alsop’s. 
 Master Roydon! 
 He took every book in the house. 
 Damn it! 
 Except this one. 
 I stole it back when Gallowglass stopped them. 
 They had no idea. 
 Jack, that was incredibly dangerous. 
 Well done. 
 Well done, my boy. 
 Matthew, is Diana here? 
 I thought you were fetching her. 
 The witches said she left them hours ago. 
 And we can’t find her. 
 Matthew. 
 Matthew? Kit, where is he? 
 Are you sure this is the right place? 
 I’m certain of it. 
 Ah! 
 So this is the creature who bewitched my brother. 
 Louisa. 
 Christopher took some persuading to lure you here. 
 Spirited. I like that. 
 I did not bewitch Matthew. 
 What do you want from me? 
 Kit! 
 We should bind her, take her to the ship. 
 Oh, poor sweet Christopher. 
 There is no ship. 
 But we agreed. 
 She is to be exiled for Matthew to be freed of her. 
 No, Kit. 
 
 
 
 The witch must die. 
 There are eyes everywhere in this city. 
 Aye. Especially amongst creatures. 
 She can’t have passed through the streets without drawing the attention 
 of Hubbard’s flock. 
 I’ll interrogate every last one of them. 
 Find out. 
 Where are you? 
 If any harm comes to me, Matthew will despise you forever. 
 And Philippe will seek vengeance. 
 You dare make assumptions of my father? 
 Matthew and I are married. 
 I am Philippe’s blood-sworn daughter. 
 I’m surprised you didn’t notice. 
 Let me go, Louisa. 
 You must be powerful indeed to bewitch Philippe. 
 But I will free him from your thrall. 
 You are making a grave mistake. 
 The first shot can be yours. 
 Maybe we should just leave her down here. 
 The only way to win back Matthew’s regard is to free him of the witch. 
 Kit, your gift is your mind, your words. 
 Oh, the words have eluded him. 
 Your presence has robbed him of all that he holds dear. 
 You’re not a murderer. 
 Matthew is a fool to favor her. 
 But when she is dead, 
 you will be there to comfort him. 
 We do this for Matthew. For love. 
 “It lies not in our power to love or hate 
 “For will in us is overruled by fate 
 “When two are stripped, long ere the course begin, 
 “We wish that one shall lose, the other win. 
 “Where both deliberate, the love is slight 
 “Whoever loved, that loved not at first sight?” 
 What mischief is this? 
 They’re from your poem, Kit. Hero and Leander. 
 I have never spoken these words to anyone. 
 You want to know your future? I’ll tell you everything. 
 Please. 
 Christopher is weak. I am not. 
 Louisa. 
 You struck me down! 
 She had you in her thrall. 
 And yet you missed. 
 I shall not miss this time. 
 Louisa, no! 
 Your familiar will return when she is needed. 
 Corra! 
 Corra! 
 God save us! 
 Shall I tell you your futures? 
 You have none. 
 Soon, you will die. 
 And your deaths will not be gentle. 
 I promise you that. 
 -What the hell is that? -What in God’s name… 
 Diana, stop this. I’ll deal with them now. 
 They are tortured souls, spare them. 
 Their continued existence is punishment enough. 
 f*cking warned you, Kit. 
 -Matthew, stop. -Matthew. 
 Take them to Bedlam. I’ll deal with them there. 
 -Come on. -Matthew. 
 -No. -Matthew. 
 Successful endeavor, Your Majesty. 
 We retrieved every last book from Matthew Roydon’s residence. 
 Matthew is forgiven. 
 Now… 
 Leave me in peace. 
 Matthew? 
 Matthew? 
 Mistress Roydon? 
 Matthew should be back by now. 
 We should check on him. 
 You don’t want to go to Bedlam, aunty. Trust me. 
 You’ll take me. Or I’ll find it myself. 
 Down there. 
 Matthew. 
 You should not have come here. 
 Open your eyes. 
 This is the witch of the prophecy. 
 She will destroy you… 
 …and all our kind. 
 -Matthew, stop. -Diana, stay back. 
 Yes, brother. 
 Let her see the wolf. 
 Matthew, you’re not this man. Not anymore. 
 Yes, brother. 
 Tear out my throat. 
 You can resist it. 
 Redefine who you are. 
 Let them live. 
 They will not die well. Don’t let it be like this. 
 Not by your hand. 
 Think of our future. 
 Our baby. 
 Baby. 
 Diana, be careful. 
 Come home. 
 Matthew! 
 Matthew! 
 Every day of my life is a battle for control. 
 A war with myself 
 over the need to possess you in ways that 
 no warmblood could possibly fathom. 
 The blood rage is all consuming. 
 All I have ever wanted is to cleanse myself of its burden and shame. 
 No. 
 From here, 
 the heart vein. 
 They say it tastes sweeter. 
 To drink from one’s mate is to know that nothing is hidden. 
 And all that is left is complete belonging. 
 And honesty. 
 Drink, then. 
 But I’ll know your secrets and you won’t know mine. 
 I could. 
 The witch’s kiss 
 allows me to see inside your soul. 
 You might not like what you find. 
 You first. 
 You always smell like honey. 
 Are you ready? 
 I trust you. 
 It’s okay. 
 What did you find? 
 You. 
 Only you. 
 Time walker, Diana. 
 -Who are you? -Whatever’s coming, I’m ready. 
 There’s a whole world out there and I want to see it all. 
 Our priority has to be the missing pages from the Book of Life. 
 It’s possible that Diana Bishop’s aunts already have it. 
 I have reason to believe they’re being sheltered 
 at Sept-Tours. 
 There’s someone else close by. A powerful creature. 
 Protect the baby.
