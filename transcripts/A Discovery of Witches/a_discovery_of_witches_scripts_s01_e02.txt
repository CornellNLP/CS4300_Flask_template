 SHE WHISPERS: Matthew. 
 MATTHEW: Once the world was full of wonders  but it belongs to humans now. 
 We creatures have all but disappeared -  demons, vampires and witches... 
 hiding in plain sight  ill at ease, even with each other. 
 But, as my father used to say  in every ending... 
 there is a new beginning. 
 MATTHEW: New trousers, Hamish? 
 - Morning. 
 You really didn't need to be here, you know. 
 "Hello, Hamish. 
 Nice to see you." Good to see you, too, Matthew. 
 I can quite well go hunting on my own. 
 It's good to have a break from London. 
 I've been meaning to get out on the moors, anyway. 
 John's preparing the car. 
 FAINT OPERA MUSIC PLAYS  
 A DRINK IS BEING POURED  
 MATTHEW: I see you've redecorated. 
 I thought the place needed brightening up. 
 Looks like a wedding cake. 
 You didn't come all the way up here to diss my interiors, Matt. 
 What's going on? 
 - It's complex. 
 Isn't it always with you? 
 This is even more... 
 - What? 
 f*cked up? 
 Look at the two of us. 
 A vampire friends with a demon. 
 I came up here to get away from... 
 a witch. 
 When you say "get away"... 
 do you mean...? 
 - I'm craving her.

 - SEAGULLS CRY  Who are you? 
 You can't come in here without... 
 My boss will call you in three seconds to give it. 
 I'm looking for the body of the tourist found last night. 
 A PHONE RINGS  Yes? 
 Yes. 
 Of course, sir. 
 The body? 
 He has no blood in him. 
 And there was no blood at the scene. 
 It's... 
 strange. 
 Is there any background on him? 
 He was French. 
 Name? 
 Matthieu Beny. 
 Matthew. 
 EERIE MUSIC  Stop.

 - About 35 metres below the ridgeline. 
 Good hunting.

 Hey. 
 Busy today. 
 - Don't know why.

 SOMEONE CLEARS THEIR THROAT  
 - WHISPERING  
 SHE EXHALES SLOWLY  
 TENSE MUSIC   
 Dr Bishop. 
 Can I help you? 
 My name's Peter Knox. 
 I presume there aren't usually this many "other creatures" in the library. 
 Well... no. 
 So I suppose word has spread about the Ashmole manuscript you took out. 
 Sorry, I'm waiting on a book. 
 You're quite right to keep it quiet  but I assure you I am a friend. 
 BIRDS TWEET RAPIDLY  Shall we discuss this over coffee? 
 I don't think so. 
 Or are you a tea drinker like your mother was? 
 TENSE MUSIC SWELLS  
 BELL TOLLS IN THE DISTANCE  
 Did you know my father, too? 
 Only slightly. 
 Your mother and I met when we were teenagers. 
 I was very fond of her. 
 What was she like? 
 Passionate, clever  stubborn as a mule when she wanted to be. 
 SHE GIGGLES: Really? 
 It's truly terrible what happened. 
 I've thought about you a good deal over the years and... 
 I've wanted to introduce myself, but your aunt's very protective. 
 Yeah. 
 Could we get tea for two, please? 
 - Yes, sir. 
 INDISTINCT CHATTER  
 Feeling better? 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 I think you're wise to keep your distance from the witch. 
 Yes. 
 But the problem is, she's in possession of something that I need. 
 Or rather... 
 she's capable of retrieving it. 
 So, er, did you just call it up? 
 - Yeah. 
 How? 
 Er, the... 
 the normal way. 
 That's odd because I requested Ashmole 782 this morning  and it isn't there. 
 Not there? 
 - Missing. 
 According to the Bodleian catalogue it's been missing for years. 
 SHE SCOFFS  
 But how could it be? 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 I took it out. 
 You did return it, I take it? 
 Of course! 
 I would never steal a book from the Bod. 
 No. 
 It could be the date. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe the book only shows itself around the time of the equinox. 
 Or it could be that there's a spell on it  and that somehow, for some reason, you broke it. 
 I'm not my mother, Mr Knox, I didn't inherit her powers. 
 What happened when you opened it? 
 I only looked at one page. 
 - What was on it? 
 A picture. 
 - Of what? 
 The alchemical child. 
 There must have been more. 
 You must have seen more. 
 Why is it so important to you? 
 Because if this book is what I think it is  it contains the witches' first spells. 
 It could tell us how we created vampires. 
 That's just a myth. 
 Vampires have used their brute power and longevity  to gain far too much control, but if we created them... 
 then we could un-create them. 
 I won't have any part of that. 
 You have to try and take it out again. 
 You're the only person who's seen it in years. 
 Let go of my arm. 
 I'm quite sure I'll see you again, Diana. 
 KNOX: Not as amenable as I'd hoped. 
 We might need to use firmer tactics. 
 Juliette, good evening. 
 If you're here to see my father, he's not to be disturbed. 
 I think he's gonna want to hear what I have to say. 
 DOORS CREAK OPEN  This better be important. 
 It is. 
 It's a police matter. 
 GERBERT: Leave us. 
 SINISTER, BROODING MUSIC 
 To be honest, I still don't get what you're so anxious about. 
 How could taking out a book for a senior witch do any harm? 
 Come on, you were in the library. 
 You felt it. 
 This... 
 this book is powerful and I... 
 I don't... 
 I don't trust what Peter Knox might do with it. 
 He... 
 He hates other species. 
 He'll use it against them. 
 It's no concern of ours. 
 I don't even know how he knew I took it out in the first place. 
 These things get out. 
 - I just... 
 I don't want to have anything to do with it. 
 I want to lead a normal life. 
 I want to be normal. 
 I've known you for ten years. 
 You couldn't be normal if you tried. 
 It's so typical something like this would happen to you. 
 DIANA SIGHS  
 What shall I do, Gillian? 
 Just get it out for him and forget all about it. 
 Carry on with your paper. 
 Yeah, but that's nearly impossible with all these... 
 creatures and the library. 
 Not the vampire that was following you before? 
 No. 
 He seems to have given up on me. 
 Oh, that's are relief at least. 
 I don't know. 
 There is something about him. 
 He... 
 He seemed to know more about the book than anyone else. 
 I should have asked him about it. 
 Instead, I... 
 I told him to leave me alone. 
 - You're quite right, too. 
 Have you ever talked to them? 
 No. 
 So you don't know what they're like? 
 - And you do, after one conversation? 
 SHE SCOFFS  
 He didn't seem to be as prejudiced against us as we are against them. 
 SHE CRUNCHES LOUDLY 
 I gotta go. 
 Been invited to one of the dean's awful parties. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry to burden you with this. 
 MATTHEW: So even though Ashmole 782 might be the answer to our problems, Hamish  my interest in it puts her in danger. 
 It seems we're all in danger, Matt, if we don't get that book. 
 You know that daemon suicides are on the rise? 
 As are mental health problems, homelessness... 
 Yes, I know. 
 I've been looking into the statistics. 
 We are struggling. 
 If this book could explain our origins... 
 - Yes. 
 Wouldn't that be something, my friend? 
 RAIN PATTERS ON THE WINDOW  
 SQUIRTING SOUND  
 MARCUS: Where's Matthew? 
 He's not here. 
 Oh, just, he said he'd ring me with the results. 
 Have they come through yet? 
 James' have. 
 His blood tests are normal. 
 So the problem's with me, then? 
 It seems so. 
 MARCUS SIGHS  
 SHE PANTS HEAVILY  That was quick. 
 What did you do to your hand? 
 I think the book did that to you when you opened it. 
 Who are you? 
 You were in the library. 
 You were the magnet for it. 
 Magic attracts magic. 
 But yours is hidden. 
 SHE MUTTERS AN INCANTATION IN FINNISH 
 Someone did something to you. 
 Oh. 
 You did it to yourself. 
 Do you fear persecution? 
 Is that it? 
 I haven't until now. 
 You were with Peter Knox. 
 You tell him I won't get out his book. 
 This isn't just about the book. 
 It's about you. 
 TENSE THUDDING MUSIC  Hey, Em. 
 Have you heard of Peter Knox? 
 - Peter Knox is in Oxford? 
 He said he knew Mum. 
 Yeah, he was crazy about her. 
 - I thought so, from what he said. 
 Tried to persuade her not to marry your father. 
 Did she like him? 
 They were friends in the early days and then he just got into some stuff. 
 What? 
 Dark magic. 
 Why is Peter Knox in Oxford? 
 The book I told you about. 
 He wants it. 
 Your father distrusted him and, by the end, your mum did too. 
 Be careful of him, Diana. 
 GERBERT: Juliette. 
 A word. 
 Where were you two nights ago? 
 JULIETTE: Seeing the city at night. 
 You said I was allowed. 
 I said... 
 as long as you were good. 
 I have been. 
 - If there's something I don't know  Baldwin can use it against me. 
 Baldwin's not even in Venice. 
 - He sees and hears anyway! 
 This dead tourist... 
 is a brazen vampire killing. 
 And Domenico... 
 the nosey little fucker... 
 smelt you on him. 
 SHE SOBS: That's not true. 
 Domenico hates me. 
 SHE BREATHES ERRATICALLY  
 CRUNCHING NOISE - SHE GROANS IN PAIN  
 SHE SCREAMS  
 THE NAME "MATTHEW" ECHOES AROUND  
 PASSIONATE BREATHING  
 SHE SCREAMS IN PAIN   
 JULIETTE: Matthew... 
 HE BREATHES DEEP AND SLOW  
 DOOR CLANGS OPEN  
 SHE CRIES OUT   
 You taught me to crave Matthew! 
 No! 
 Father! 
 Father! 
 HAMISH: This book you say Diana called up. 
 MATTHEW: Mmm? 
 - I've heard stories about it. 
 The witches stole it from the vampires. 
 The vampires stole it from the witches. 
 That's untrue. 
 Demons, of course, don't get a look in. 
 We know it's important to us but we don't know why  and we're not even allowed to ask. 
 The general feeling being we matter so much less than the other creatures. 
 Can we not have a political argument? 
 It's easy for you to say. 
 You're not treated like a third-class citizen. 
 It's hardly like you are! 
 You practically run the City of London. 
 That's not the point. 
 I'm an anomaly. 
 Checkmate. 
 There is more to the game than protecting your queen. 
 HAMISH: Wait! 
 Think before your next move. 
 No, other creatures will want the book. 
 I have to obtain it from Diana before they do. 
 I know you need the book, but couldn't Marcus do it? 
 Marcus? 
 Not letting Marcus anywhere near Diana. 
 He's much less of a danger to Diana than you are! 
 Think what's happened in the past to women you've craved. 
 Elena, Cecilia... 
 I wish I'd never told you. 
 But you did because you wanted me to be your conscience. 
 After Cecilia  I swore to myself that I would never get involved  with another warmblood again and you know that! 
 But, Matt, you've never talked about another woman  the way you do about Diana Bishop. 
 I'm just trying to protect you. 
 I'll try to take your advice. 
 - Don't try. 
 Do. 
 If you hurt her, you'll never forgive yourself and I couldn't bear it. 
 Don't go back to Oxford  until you're sure you can control yourself around Diana Bishop. 
 BELL CHIMES  
 INDISTINCT CHATTER  
 Dr Bishop. 
 Good evening, Professor Marsh. 
 - Welcome. 
 Thank you. 
 I understand you gave an excellent talk  and that you are writing it up. 
 Yes, yes, I am indeed. 
 And I look forward to reading it. 
 We want to get you on that shortlist. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Now, there's someone I would really like you to meet. 
 He has a very interesting specialisation  the occult... 
 sciences. 
 Alchemy. 
 It's quite a subject. 
 Especially for someone who says she lacks interest in magic. 
 I don't just lack interest. 
 I lack aptitude. 
 - Are you sure? 
 The book came out for you and no one else. 
 I told you, I don't know how that happened. 
 But you didn't tell me a vampire's been following you. 
 
 
 
 How do you know that? 
 It would be catastrophic if it falls into their hands. 
 Can't you see the danger you're in? 
 I can take care of myself. 
 Laudable, but naive. 
 The fact that vampires are now involved  makes this so much more urgent. 
 I'm not going to call it up for you. 
 - Why not? 
 Because I don't happen to like the idea of un-creating other species. 
 They would do exactly the same to us, if they could. 
 I'm like my mother, Mr Knox. 
 If I've made up my mind  I don't change it. 
 VIA TELEPATHY: Diana. 
 Think about what you're doing. 
 You must be true to your blood  your heritage. 
 Don't make me force you to recall that book. 
 Diana. 
 Don't walk away! 
 You can't escape me that easily. 
 I can be with you wherever you are. 
 I need the book. 
 We need the book. 
 DIANA: Get out of my head! 
 SMASHING NOISE  SHE EXHALES HEAVILY  EERIE MUSIC  KNOCK AT THE DOOR  How's it going with Diana? 
 Did she get the manuscript out for you? 
 No. 
 Last night, she performed an elemental spell. 
 What? 
 Diana did? 
 Did you know she was powerful? 
 No, I... 
 I... 
 I can't believe... 
 She's never shown if she is. 
 Maybe she's used her magic to forward her career. 
 And that's why she's kept it secret from you. 
 SUDDEN KNOCK AT THE DOOR  
 Oh, thank God you're here. 
 You haven't been answering your phone. 
 KNOX'S VOICE: If this book is what I think it is, vampires... 
 then we could un-create them. 
 DIANA: I don't even know how he knew I took it out in the first place. 
 These things get out. 
 SATU: This isn't just about the book. 
 It's about you. 
 FIZZING - SHE CRIES IN PAIN  This is about a great deal more than just alchemy. 
 Ashmole 782 has been missing for centuries  and yet you were able to call it up. 
 Aren't you curious why? 
 You need to be careful. 
 CLOCK BELL TOLLS 
 Professor Clairmont's rooms, please. 
 SHE KNOCKS TENTATIVELY  
 You were right... 
 about creatures coming to look for the book. 
 Peter Knox from the Congregation  and there was this Scandinavian witch. 
 I don't know... 
 I don't know who she was. 
 HEARTBEAT PUMPS RAPIDLY  
 Try to calm down. 
 Your adrenaline is very high. 
 You can smell my adrenaline? 
 - Course I can. 
 Thank you. 
 Why did you come to me? 
 Last time I saw you, you said you never wanted to see me again. 
 I have no one else to talk to. 
 - You must have friends. 
 None I can trust. 
 It was a mistake to come here. 
 I'm sorry I disturbed you. 
 - Does Knox want the book? 
 He says it has the witches' first spells in it. 
 Is that what you think it is? 
 Peter Knox believes that witches created everything and everyone. 
 I'm obviously not of that opinion. 
 Does he know that you sent it back? 
 - Yes. 
 He wants me to try and get it out again. 
 Will you? 
 - I don't want him to have it. 
 "Dear sir... 
 Your letter of 15th October has reached me at last."  You knew Charles Darwin? 
 - Yes. 
 I met him on a number of occasions  particularly when he was building up to his publication of Origin. 
 I began to wonder how his theories might relate to us creatures. 
 I was desperate to understand our origins. 
 You see, I'd already heard rumours, whisperings  about a book... 
 hidden from human eyes, an alchemical text. 
 Ashmole 782. 
 - Ashmole. 
 That man had an uncanny ability to find bizarre manuscripts. 
 And I found and read every one of them. 
 Apart from 782. 
 You've been searching for the book since 1859. 
 Mmm. 
 How old are you? 
 - I'm older than I look. 
 Three hundred years? 
 Mmm. 
 Five hundred years? 
 Did you know Machiavelli? 
 - HE LAUGHS  Survive the fall of Carthage? 
 - Which fall of Carthage? 
 I'd like to show you my laboratory. 
 The work we've been doing recently links in to creature origin. 
 I won't harm you. 
 You have my word. 
 Alright. 
 Put this on. 
 You're cold. 
 - How do you know that? 
 Adrenalin causes a rise in metabolic heat production. 
 Your adrenalin has dropped and so has your heart rate. 
 You can hear my heart? 
 Yes. 
 All the time. 
 We're among hundreds of laboratories using genetics  to study species origin, but in our lab  humans aren't the only species we're studying. 
 You're studying vampire genetics? 
 - Mmm. 
 Witches and demons, too. 
 We take physical specimens from burial sites, mostly, and... 
 extract DNA from the samples. 
 Hey, Matthew! 
 He's been helping me while you've been away. 
 Diana, this is my colleague and lab manager  Dr Miriam Shepherd. 
 Miriam, this is Dr Diana Bishop. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 - And I'm Dr Marcus Whitmore. 
 Different type of doctor. 
 HE SNIFFS DEEPLY  Wow! 
 AB negative. 
 Don't suppose I could take some of you blood, could I? 
 It's tough getting a sample from a living witch. 
 No... 
 thank you. 
 If your friend isn't here to give blood, what is she here for exactly? 
 I wanted to show Diana that the work we're doing here proves  beyond all doubt... 
 that creatures are dying out. 
 Vampires are failing to sire. 
 Demons are increasingly prone to madness. 
 And witches? 
 Are losing their powers. 
 Come and see. 
 Please, sit down. 
 Allow me. 
 - Thank you. 
 Now, this graph shows the mitochondrial DNA  of a witch named Benvenguda. 
 She lived in Brittany in the 7th century  and she was very, very powerful. 
 A marvel, really... 
 in an age that produced.. many marvels. 
 Now, compare that to the graph belonging to Beatrice Good -  Benvenguda's last known direct descendant. 
 Now, as you can see, Beatrice's DNA shows far fewer markers  common amongst witches, indicating that... 
 her ancestors, as the centuries passed  relied less and less upon witchcraft to survive. 
 Now... 
 is this pattern of... 
 denying power  is the reason why witches will eventually become... 
 extinct? 
 Who do you think she might talk to? 
 - Well, I don't know. 
 Apart from me, Diana doesn't have any friends in Oxford. 
 Oh, forgive me. 
 I don't believe you've been introduced. 
 This is Miss Järvinen. 
 She's our new representative on the Congregation. 
 Oh. 
 Wow! 
 Congratulations. 
 Well? 
 I tried to look inside her. 
 She interests me. 
 DIANA: You think 782's going to help you with your research, don't you? 
 MATTHEW: It could explain our origins, yes. 
 DIANA: But we aren't going to go extinct tomorrow. 
 There are still plenty of creatures in the world. 
 I have a different sense of time to you. 
 When humans talk about climate change that's exactly the argument they use. 
 "Oh, the polar ice caps will take so many years to melt. 
 Who cares?"  I remember when the Thames iced over every winter. 
 I used to skate on it. 
 You're right, though. 
 It's not going to happen immediately, tomorrow, but it's already begun. 
 One day, there'll be just one species. 
 Humans. 
 And at first, they won't notice the difference  because they've never noticed us, but, gradually... 
 eventually, they'll come to see that... 
 all the magic has seeped out of the world. 
 And they'll look around them... 
 and everyone will be the same. 
 DIANA: You think whatever power I have I should use? 
 MATTHEW: I think, at the very least, you should try not to be frightened of it. 
 Although, as far as I can tell  there are only two emotions that keep the world turning. 
 One is... desire. 
 And the other is fear. 
 Magic is desire made real. 
 That's what my aunt says. 
 - Mmm. 
 Right. 
 The book's a palimpsest. 
 Old words hidden under new. 
 It was heavy. 
 It smelt. 
 It smelt odd. 
 Three pages were cut out. 
 The only page I saw showed a baby  floating in an upside-down vessel. 
 It was probably the alchemical child  although I've never seen it represented like that before. 
 Thank you. 
 MATTHEW: I thought you knew about vampires. 
 That's why you invited me to dinner. 
 I need to get a book, Ashmole 782. 
 Are you gonna give the book to the vampire? 
 Where are we going, anyway? 
 My house. 
 Did you cast a spell to call up Ashmole 782? 
 SARAH: What are you doing hanging around with a vampire? 
 He could feed off you, take your memories. 
 Seen everything you saw when you opened up that book! 
 Matthew de Claremont's harassing a witch. 
 GERBERT: Did your source tell you who this witch is? 
 MATTHEW: Her name's Diana Bishop. 
 You shy away from us and yet you seek out vampire company. 
 I'm not a bigot like you. 
 MIRIAM: You're craving her. 
 What would I taste like? 
 MATTHEW: You wouldn't be able to stop me if I struck  and I wouldn't be able to stop myself.
