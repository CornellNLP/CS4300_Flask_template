 What's up, baby brother? 
 Hey, roomie. 
 What the hell you doing? 
 You got chips and dings all in your paint. 
 Or should I say, you  had  chips and dings? 
 Well, since... when do you paint? 
 Gave myself a crash course in... flat enamels and satin finishes. 
 Oh, I also attacked the water pressure in your shower. 
 Went from a trickle to a downpour. 
 You got to try it. 
 I will do after my run. 
 What you think? 
 Where the heck's my shoes? 
 Right over here. 
 Got 'em lined up. 
 You've been busy. 
 Well, got up early. 
 Early as in  early  early, or you didn't sleep all night? 
 It's not what you're thinking. 
 Oh, yeah, what am I thinking? 
 “Here comes the bipolar”" 
 Well, it is a little manic. 
 Look, Chris, I can't pay you rent or anything, so... this is my way of giving back. 
 Did you call that psychiatrist? 
 Plan was, I'd start with group therapy... and then call the headshrinker if I felt like I really needed to. 
 Well, when you need to, it's usually too late. 
 All right? 
 You don't sleep all night, and then you go manic and then run. 
 And... I kind of like having you around. 
 Chris... there's a difference between manic and happy. 
 All right, this is happy. 
 I'm taking my meds, staying away from my triggers. 
 All right, no booze, no late nights. 
 Even laying off the ladies a bit. 
 Hey, you don't believe me, come by group therapy. 
 You'll see. 
 (phone chirps) 
 Dead body. 
 Got to go. 
 Well, you just go enjoy your body and know that when you get back, there will be a kick-ass shower waiting for you. 
 You the man, Cade, you the man. 
 Yeah, I know, I know. 
 (sirens whooping) 
 (indistinct police radio chatter) 
 Lasalle : What do we got? 
 Petty Officer Maggie Barringer. 
 (camera clicking) 
 Works as a Navy recruiter in that building. 
 Three tours in Iraq, Purple Heart. 
 No witnesses, no cameras and no attendant. 
 (scoffs) Loretta. 
 Only time I've seen a body this broken was when a skydiver's chute didn't open. 
 All injuries suggest vehicular trauma. 
 And after the impact, driver takes off and hits that parked car. 
 Glass over there from the offending driver's broken headlight. 
 Assuming the vehicle was headed in this direction and knocked the poor lady right out of her shoe. 
 No skid. 
 Driver didn't even try to stop. 
 Maybe he didn't see her until it was too late. 
 Maybe. 
 There's the skids. 
 Let me borrow your camera, Chris. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Rubber from the scuffs rises in the direction of the victim, meaning... 
 Driver was gunning for her. 
 Next of kin might know who. 
 Coworker said she was single. 
 Raising two foster kids. 
 All right. 
 CACO needs to find those kids. 
 Tell them what happened, or bring them into the office. 
 And maybe the kids can tell us who might be behind all this. 
 Boys are biological brothers. 
 Social worker said that Maggie went beyond usual fostering, became their mother in every way. 
 They got any other family? 
 Dad's a John Doe. 
 Mother's a junkie, whereabouts unknown. 
 Here, here you go. 
 You hungry? 
 Hey, CJ. 
 I need to talk to your brother. 
 Just-just be right over there, okay? 
 We need your help. 
 Can you think of anyone who might want to hurt Maggie? 
 Anyone she might have had a problem with? 
 I thought you said this was a hit-and-run. 
 That's an accident, right? 
 (clears throat) We're going with the theory it was intentional. 
 So we're following up all the possibilities. 
 Pride, social worker's here. 
 I'm Sumner St. Croix. 
 My agency works with DCF. 
 Where will the boys be going? 
 I'll take CJ to an emergency placement with a foster family, and my assistant here will drop Danny off at a group home. 
 You're separating them? 
 Well, they're brothers. 
 Yeah, I ain't going nowhere without CJ. 
 Danny, you know the rules. 
 You're too old for an emergency placement, and those group homes won't take kids under 13. 
 Man, that's crap, all right? He stays with me. 
 Dial back the attitude, kid. 
 Pride : Whoa, whoa! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, look, hey. 
 Grab your breath here! 
 Listen, they've been through a lot, all right? 
 How about showing a little compassion? 
 Sorry. 
 I'm doing the best I can with the resources available. 
 We're gonna make sure that you see your brother tomorrow. 
 (sighs) 
 It's all right, CJ. 
 Just go with him. 
 No! I want my brother! 
 Please! 
 Danny! 
 Danny! 
 Please, Danny! 
 Damn, damn, damn. 
 Damn! 
 (groans softly) 
 I called the social worker at the group home. 
 He's getting the boys together for a visit this afternoon. 
 Do me a favor. 
 Make sure it actually happens? 
 Yeah. 
 Kids have had their whole lives turned upside down. 
 They need each other. 
 I ran Petty Officer Barringer's financials. 
 Nothing that raises a red flag. 
 Her biggest splurge in the last month was on her boys' shoes at Nike Town. 
 Small savings account, IRA, and the largest withdrawal within the past year was $400. 
 No drinking, no drugs. 
 People say she was devoted to those boys. 
 Her coworker did say that she showed up an hour late for work that morning and was upset. 
 What's that about? 
 Upset was all they could give us. 
 Upset and run over in a parking lot seems like a long throw to me. 
 (phone beeps) 
 Sebastian. 
 “The nerd posse requests your presence.” 
 All right, Christopher, head back to Maggie's office. 
 See if it's possible that whatever upset her in the morning could've come roaring back that night. 
 Brody and I will check in with our man in the lab. 
 Don't you need more than one nerd to make a posse? 
 Oh, I'm not the only nerd in it. 
 See, there's, uh, Einstein, Newton, Tesla, and this performance artist named Hermie Hawthorne, who spent three weeks in an enclosed glass box with six snakes. 
 We're kind of like the Justice League, except with more pocket protectors. 
 And snakes. 
 Okay, so, I used forensic animation to recreate the incident. 
 This sequence depicts the, uh, dent that the vehicle made in the parked car. 
 Now, based on the physical evidence, the vehicle involved was a sedan, as opposed to a SUV, van, pickup or truck. 
 I'm using laypersons terms here. 
 We appreciate that. 
 I also, uh, collected pigment polymers from the  arma delinquat. 
 That didn't last long. 
 Um, uh, paint flakes left in the dent. 
 They allowed me to determine the vehicle's color. 
 It's a shade of gray. 
 Make and model? 
 I'm still working on it, but I did notice something interesting on the headlight. 
 There's this thick layer of grime on the bits. 
 It appears to be inorganic, but I'll run tests. 
 All right, meantime, let's get a BOLO out for a gray sedan with a smashed headlight. 
 I'll contact the body shops. 
 And I'll check in with Loretta. 
 Oh, uh, just to warn you, Dr. Wade's in there with the oldest son. 
 With Danny? 
 Yeah, he came by; he wanted to see his mother. 
 She hated being in the dark. 
 Always slept with all the lights on, even the ones in that damn closet. 
 How did you and CJ come to live with Maggie? 
 Our mom just kind of took off. 
 Took off? 
 She split. 
 One day, we woke up, she took all her stuff and she was gone. 
 How old were you? 
 I was 12, CJ was four. 
 I had to take care of him, so I started skipping school. 
 Got into some trouble. 
 When I got caught, they stuck CJ with Maggie. 
 Did two years in juvie. 
 When I got out, Maggie took me in. 
 They got any idea who could've done this to her? 
 Your hand-- why don't you come let me see it. 
 Yeah, I get you're some type of doctor or whatever, but it don't really look like your patients do so good. 
 Don't be a smart-ass. 
 Hand. Now. 
 It's infected. 
 There's bacteria in here. 
 It does kind of hurt. 
 (hisses) Ah! 
 It's crazy the bubbles H2O2 gives off. 
 That's your body's enzymes reacting to the hydrogen peroxide. 
 You don't got to do all that. 
 Do what? 
 Act like you care. 
 Do I look like a woman who acts her way through life? 
 No, you don't. 
 No, I don't. 
 Everybody always acting like they got your back. 
 Even Maggie. 
 She kept saying she was gonna adopt us. 
 But in the end, things always got a way of not working out. 
 Look, no matter what anybody tells you, you're alone in this world. 
 Once you get that down, nobody can hurt you. 
 I bet most people you feed that line to believe you. 
 Thanks for fixing the hand. 
 Wade :  There's a good kid in there. 
 With some bumps along the way. 
 Doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a second chance. 
 He'll be 18 soon, and DCF will literally put him out on the street. 
 Happy birthday. You're homeless. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Wade : Okay, I'm putting time of death somewhere around 9:15. 
 And beyond the injuries of the accident, she has fractures in the L1 and L2 vertebrae due to malnourishment in her formative years. 
 The enamel degradation on her teeth suggests a lack of dental care as a child. 
 Grew up poor. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And she didn't become bitter or selfish. 
 Was willing to take in these two kids. 
 There has to be a way to keep these two boys together. 
 Tough to fight the system. 
 Have we met before? 
 So what are we doing here exactly? 
 Folks at Maggie's office didn't think there was a work reason for her to be upset, but I got her phone. 
 Petty Officer Barringer sent a bunch of e-mails to a general address at Community Foster Partnership. 
 CFP. 
 What's that? 
 It's a private social services agency that the city pays for to work with foster families. 
 All of Maggie's e-mails was saying that CFP was sitting on the money that was intended for the kids. 
 Then on the day she was killed, she sent them this. 
 “You leave me no choice but to go to the press and expose you for the lousy cheating thieves you are” 
 That's a threat. 
 CFP respond? 
 Five minutes later she received a call from someone from CFP. 
 Then after the call, Maggie sent a text to someone named Jane Trahan. 
 “Meeting with CFP at 5:00.” 
 Jane Trahan lives here. 
 You don't know how I wish we could take in Maggie's boys, but we're already fostering a set of twins and their sister. 
 Is that how y'all met Maggie, through fostering? 
 She spoke at a workshop for families who have issues with CFP. 
 What kind of issues? 
 My issue. They suck. 
 Joe. 
 What? 
 We have to get six types of approval before we can get money for services that the kids need. 
 Medical, dental, psychological. 
 And no matter what the request, we get delays or outright denials. 
 We have to pay for the services ourselves. 
 Jane : Or the kids go without. 
 That's what Maggie was fighting. 
 She was in search-and-destroy mode. 
 She was out to get him. 
 Who's him? 
 Sumner St. Croix. 
 He's the only one anybody ever deals with over at CFP. 
 St. Croix. He's the guy who picked up the boys the other night. 
 Horrible man. 
 I told you. 
 When we heard what happened to Maggie, I said we should call to make sure that someone knew about this con man St. Croix. 
 Guy's a social worker. 
 A million a year. 
 A million dollars a year? 
 Maggie looked it up. 
 A million is what they pay CFP, and CFP is Sumner St. Croix. 
 Girl : Dad, we're thirsty. 
 Thank you, guys. 
 We'll help ourselves out. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Messing with his million-a-year contract. 
 That's motive. 
 I'll call Pride. 
 Tell him to meet us at CFP. 
 St. Croix :  You got a warrant? 
 Can have one in minutes. 
 Now and minutes are different things. 
 I'll call Judge Volkey. 
 We'll wait right here for you. 
 Did some digging, Mr. St. Croix. 
 Before New Orleans, you were operating CFP out of Fayetteville. 
 City sued you for fraud. 
 And you got your contract claiming you got a whole army of social workers on your payroll. 
 And really, it's just you. 
 Collecting all the money. 
 Denying services. 
 That lawsuit was dropped. 
 Dropped for the moment. 
 Called our contact at the Fed. 
 We're told they're currently in the process of indicting you. 
 Fraud, tax evasion. 
 Stealing from foster kids. 
 That's classy with a “K,” my friend. 
 What's this? 
 Just my files. 
 Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say you're destroying evidence. 
 I did not kill that woman. 
 Pride : No? 
 So then where were you last night around 9:15? 
 I want my lawyer. 
 Fine. Come down to our offices. 
 We'll get your lawyer. 
 Everything checks out, you're off the hook. 
 Either way, you're probably facing 30 years. 
 Okay. 
 But I need one more thing. 
 Tell my wife... 
 I got in over my head. 
 Wait! 
 (car alarm wailing) 
 Just got off the phone with St. Croix's lawyer. 
 He and St. Croix were at the U.S. attorney's office until after 10:00 p.m. last night. 
 Settlement conference. 
 10:00 p.m. is too late for him to have been there to kill Maggie. 
 Plus, if the Feds were indicting, there's no reason to kill her. 
 Cat was already out of the bag. 
 (phone beeping) Yeah, it was a dead end, literally. 
 Loretta's got something. 
 Hey, King, if you don't mind, uh, I got a brother thing I need to take care of. 
 Brody, you're with me. 
 Tell Cade hello for me. 
 Appreciate it. 
 “Willing to share. Takes therapy seriously. Willing to be honest with his feelings” 
 Yeah, I know. I was there, I heard. 
 So then how about backing off just a little? 
 Well, you know I'm on you 'cause I care. 
 Try caring a little less. 
 Come on, follow. I got somebody else I want you to meet. 
 Hey, I got to get back to work. 
 Hey, two minutes. 
 Okay. 
 Mind if I come on in? 
 Woman : Yeah, yeah, sure, okay. 
 Great, I'll include it in the report, and I'll get it out tonight. 
 Okay, thanks again. Bye. 
 Hey, Cade, how can I... 
 (chuckles) 
 Chris. 
 Savannah. 
 Well, Cade kept telling me he was gonna bring you by to say hello. 
 Did he? 
 How long you been... 
 What, in New Orleans? 
 About a year. 
 I moved here after I got my masters. 
 That's not a surprise. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, you were always smart. 
 That's why I sat behind you in Dragonbreath's class. 
 (chuckles) Peeking over your shoulder. 
 Checking my answers. 
 Oh, is that what you were doing back there? 
 You look good, Lasalle. 
 Well, you still got all your hair. 
 So do you. 
 (chuckles) 
 (phone ringing) 
 I got to take this. 
 Don't be a stranger now, all right? 
 This is Savannah. 
 (laughs) You didn't care if I met your counselor at all. 
 Hey, like I said, I know I'm well. 
 Hey, come on. 
 Look, don't be ticked off. 
 All right, I'm just trying to set the table for you. 
 Yeah, well, I don't need my table set. 
 Really? 
 'Cause last time I checked, she's the one that got away. 
 (scoffs) 
 Man, I got to go. 
 I'll clean your house, I'll paint your walls, I'll hook you up. 
 I'm full service, baby brother. 
 Wade :  With all the fissures, fractures and breaks,  it took a while to catalog, but when I did, I found one hairline fracture on the left ulna which is not from this incident. 
 It's consistent with a defensive wound. 
 You're saying there was a fight before she was hit by the car. 
 The fracture is a month or so old. 
 Not professionally set, which suggests... 
 Domestic violence. 
 That would be my assessment. 
 We got any information on a significant other, current or ex? 
 Nothing so far, but I'll re-canvass her neighbors and colleagues. 
 All right, do that. 
 I'll talk to CJ and Danny. 
 All right. 
 If the kids suspected someone, don't you think they'd say something? 
 Or is that not the real reason you're going to see them? 
 Troubled kid. 
 Record, anger issues. 
 Anger issues is a defense. 
 Loretta, I get it. 
 You want to give this kid the benefit of the doubt, but we can't ignore what's right in front of our faces. 
 Dwayne. 
 Danny's been in juvie. 
 You come at him, a cop accusing him, he's gonna clam up no matter what he knows. 
 You want to come with? 
 I thought you'd never ask. 
 Huh, the infection's gone. 
 Wound's healing nicely. 
 If you do say so yourself. 
 (chuckles) 
 Danny, there is something you could help us with. 
 Was Maggie seeing anyone? 
 Probably. 
 She didn't really used to talk about stuff like that. 
 She said if there was someone important, she'd let us know. 
 Why? 
 Do you think maybe some boyfriend maybe did this? 
 Wade : Well... 
 Maggie had an injury. 
 Looks like it came from defending herself in a fight. 
 Altercation would've been about a month ago. 
 Any idea what might have happened? 
 No. 
 What you trying to say? 
 Ever have any problems with Maggie? 
 Problems? 
 Things get out of hand, you and her? 
 What, you think I hit her? 
 We're not accusing you of anything, Danny. 
 Nah, man, nothing like that ever went down. 
 Boy : Shut your damn mouth! 
 Man, say that again! 
 Don't need to! 
 Hey! Hey, break it up! 
 Hey, hey, hey, knock it off. 
 Boy : Anytime you want to go! 
 I hope this isn't out of line, but I've made... 
 Don't bother. 
 Danny. 
 Look, you see what he just said to me? 
 I should've seen this coming! 
 Like I'd ever! 
 Look, the only people left to take care of CJ and me are CJ and me. 
 I just wish everybody would back the hell off! 
 Brody : Went to Maggie's apartment building, asked about this potential boyfriend. 
 What were you just looking at? 
 Uh, nothing. 
 Wasn't nothing. 
 You had a face. 
 No face. 
 Yes face. 
 Total face. (scoffs) 
 
 
 
 What were you saying about Maggie's apartment? 
 Her neighbor says that she was seeing someone. 
 She kept it from the boys for two reasons. 
 Number one, she didn't want them to get invested in someone who wasn't real, and number two, her boyfriend is the guy who owns the sandwich shop, the one Danny works for. 
 Hmm. 
 Are you sure you weren't looking at... p0rn or something on your computer? 
 (computer beeping) 
 (chuckles) 
 Sebastian! 
 Yeah, hi! 
 I have some more information about the vehicle that hit our victim. 
 Is now a good time? 
 (chuckles) It couldn't be any better. 
 All right, so I realized that the pigment polymers, uh, didn't have any silicones, which means that the paint was made before 1999. 
 But then I discovered that they did have thixotropic agents, which means that it was made after 1994. 
 I know we'll get there soon. 
 Yeah, okay, so that the pigment matches paint that GM used on both the, uh, Camaro and the Trans Am between 1994 and 1999. 
 Nice. Thank you, buddy. 
 Don't thank me. 
 Thank the nerd posse. 
 Nice pic. 
 Name of the boyfriend at the sandwich shop? 
 Anthony Antonelli. 
 Let's see what kind of car he drives. 
 Anthony :  I don't own a car. 
 I don't even drive. 
 I got in a wreck when I was 16, two weeks after getting my license. 
 Decided that was the world telling me maybe I should give it up. 
 You and Maggie Barringer, you guys dated, right? 
 Yeah, why? 
 She was killed two nights ago. 
 Killed? 
 Maggie? 
 Whoa, you guys don't think I had something to do with it? 
 No. 
 No, Maggie and I were good. 
 She just wanted to slow things down. 
 She say why? 
 It seemed like something with the kids. 
 Lasalle. 
 What's with the gray Camaro? 
 Thought you said you didn't own a car. 
 That's Danny's car. 
 Checked with the DMV; Danny doesn't have a car. 
 Maggie drove a Honda. 
 Look, I don't know what to tell you. 
 All right, Danny said he wanted to start making some deliveries, get some tips. 
 I told he needed a car; he showed up with that. 
 Danny should've been back by now. 
 I mean, we have a curfew. 
 Danny's locker? 
 Yeah. We tell the kids to keep everything locked up. 
 Well, he cleared out. 
 (sighs) I got to call my boss. 
 What's with the hat and the feather? 
 Robin Hood. 
 Dealers use cartoon stamps on their product. 
 Branding in the streets is no different than corporate America. 
 All right, so what is Robin Hood? 
 PCP. 
 Angel dust. 
 So Maggie confronts him about what he's been up to, maybe even threatens to turn him in. 
 Then that night, he shows up and runs her down? 
 Hell hath no fury like a pissed off teenage drug dealer. 
 They told me I had a visitor. 
 I was hoping it would be one of my honeys. 
 Sorry to disappoint, Ross P., but I need a favor. 
 Just as bad as the honeys. 
 Photo of this kid is Danny. 
 So you say. 
 And Robin Hood is... 
 Some kick-ass angel dust. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Give you a nice long high. 
 Make you want to hop on a cotton candy dragon and leap on a damn rainbow, you know? 
 It's crazy. 
 I think the kid is dealing it and might have killed his foster mother. 
 Need to know who his associates are and where we can find him. 
 Oh, sure thing, you know? 
 I'll just, I'll just step on out and give my-my cell phone a ring-a-ding-ding. 
 Hold up, hold up. 
 Oh, what's that? 
 I'm still in prison? 
 Oh, I'm still in prison. 
 That's 'cause you lied to me. 
 All right, but helping me here will get you one step closer to getting off the naughty list. 
 Done. Done. 
 One trip around the yard, I'll get you what you need. 
 Danny, Robin Hood. 
 You be my eyes and ears. 
 Oh, Lasalle, I'll be your hands, your feet, your spleen and your kidney, you get me out of here any quicker. 
 Thank you. 
 Chris? 
 When it rains, it pours. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We have a satellite program. 
 You? 
 Business. 
 I hear you have a week to ask me out. 
 Oh, gosh. Cade? 
 He's a man with a plan. 
 You know, he's mentioned wanting nieces and nephews. 
 I'm literally gonna kill him. 
 Don't worry; I told him it's sort of a conflict of interest, you asking out the head of the clinic where he's doing his therapy. 
 So I'm off the hook. 
 Do you want to be off the hook? 
 That's not what I asked. 
 (chuckles) 
 It's a good sign. 
 Him looking beyond himself, talking about the future. 
 He's working hard. 
 Oh, and... no, you're not off the hook. 
 Sebastian :  So even though we've identified the vehicle, 
 I kept trying to reconstruct that headlight, but of course, I got nowhere, 'cause it's like trying to put together one of those crazy thousand-piece puzzles where the whole image is just one color. 
 I mean, give me a point of reference on those, you know? 
 Like a fire hobgoblin or a basilisk, something to... 
 A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies with a single gaze. 
 Gaze like this? 
 Yeah, you-you got it down. 
 Any-who, uh, what's important is not the headlight itself, but what was on it. 
 This, um, grime. 
 Specifically silica, sulfur compounds and synthetic rubbers. 
 Sounds like tires. 
 Yeah, what they're made of. 
 Uh, I'm thinking just before the murder, last place the car was, somewhere where they're either destroying or making tires. 
 Nearest tire factory is 400 miles from here. 
 Sebastian : I mean, I can run another test, try and narrow things down so we don't have to jump to conclusions. 
 No need to jump, just maybe a little hop. 
 How about this? 
 Reworked Rubber Corp. 
 Recycles tires and turns them into ground coverings for playgrounds and such, and there is one in Mid-City. 
 All right, let's follow up. 
 And then we get back, you can tell me what the hell a fire hobgoblin is. 
 It's the most dangerous of all the hobgoblins. 
 That was obvious. 
 Man :  Never seen the kid. 
 Pride : What about the car? 
 Sure, it's Bull Costigan's. 
 Who's Bull Costigan? 
 He's a sorter on one of my work crews. 
 He in trouble? 
 First we heard of him. 
 Bull here? 
 No, he called me two days ago. 
 Said he threw his back out and needed to see a doctor. 
 What do they say about no good deed going unpunished? 
 I mean, I tried to give the guy a chance. 
 Figured he served his time. 
 Three months out of prison after six years on drug charges. 
 Let me guess. PCP is on the list. 
 Bull here Monday? 
 Monday. Yeah, I think. 
 Know what time he left? 
 I thought he was here all day. 
 I can't be sure; guys punch each other out, but we got CCTV. 
 Can we see the video? 
 Sure, we got it. 
 So, let's say that Bull is the dealer. 
 Danny's working for him. 
 Maggie finds out what's going on, Danny warns Bull that she's on his case. 
 Yeah, both Bull and Danny would want to keep her from making trouble. 
 There's the car. 
 There's Bull. 
 Freeze that. 
 Man : Hey, boss, can you sign this? 
 Knock yourself out. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Bull left at 4:30. 
 Gives him plenty of time to get into town, be there when Maggie comes out of work. 
 Or Bull delivers the car to Danny and he runs Maggie down. 
 The only way of knowing if Danny or Bull was driving is find one of them. 
 (phone beeps) 
 Lasalle. 
 Got a 411 on Danny. 
 What do we got? 
 Ross P. says this is where the Robin Hood PCP is being pushed. 
 Any sign of Danny or Bull? 
 No one in and out of the house since I been here, but I got movement in the back window. 
 All right. 
 You take the back. 
 Let's do this. 
 NCIS! 
 Don't move, Danny. 
 Danny! Danny! 
 Hands up. 
 You got anything on you? 
 Looky here. 
 Key to the Camaro. 
 Where's Bull, Danny? 
 Huh? Huh? Danny? 
 Who's idea was it to run Maggie over? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, this car, this car you've been driving, that's the one that killed her. 
 It wasn't me. 
 Danny. 
 Danny, look at me. 
 If you are telling the truth, if you really had nothing to do with this, then you need to tell us where we can find Bull Costigan, all right? 
 Where is he, Danny? 
 Look around. 
 You gonna take the fall for it. 
 He's scum, Danny. 
 He's a drug dealer, a murderer, he's a piece of garbage. 
 He's my father! 
 Mine and CJ's. 
 He's all we got. 
 I asked you if you had any idea who would want to hurt Maggie, and you said nope. 
 And you lied to me. 
 You looked me right in the eye. 
 He said it wasn't him! 
 And you believed him? 
 I wanted to. 
 Yes, he's my father. 
 How'd your father find you after he was locked up for six years? 
 He showed up at the house. 
 He wanted to take us right then. 
 Maggie knew he was trouble. 
 That why he hit her? 
 (sighs) She sent us outside. 
 And she said she slipped while they were talking. 
 You wanted to believe that, too. 
 He kept coming by the house when she wasn't there. 
 He kept giving me money. 
 Look, CJ thought it was great. 
 He doesn't remember what he used to be like. 
 I knew he would use us. 
 To deal the PCP. 
 I didn't want no part of that. 
 Did you tell him that? 
 Yeah, right. 
 Okay, I figured if I couldn't get away, the least I could do was help Maggie out with some money. 
 Drug money. 
 Green money, which was in short supply. 
 Social worker called. 
 CJ didn't come home from school today. 
 I-I got to go right now. I got to go. 
 Bull's got CJ, doesn't he? 
 Sit down. 
 You don't tell us where Bull is, he's gonna be gone, Danny. 
 And he's gonna take CJ with him. 
 Is that what you want for your little brother? 
 (sighs) 
 I'm supposed to bring the drugs to the bus station. 
 My dad will put CJ on the bus with it. 
 No one suspects a kid with a backpack full of PCP. 
 Okay. 
 And then... 
 Bull's gonna meet CJ on the other end? 
 Mobile. 
 He said he can't risk driving ten keys down the interstate. 
 (sighs) 
 King, I don't see Bull or CJ anywhere. 
 Bus for Mobile leaves in a few minutes. 
 (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) 
 Got them. 
 Through the front. 
 Hey, son. Here you go. 
 Dad says it's gonna be okay. 
 Ready? 
 Let's go. 
 Don't grab Bull till he's clear of both the kids. 
 Brody : I think he's made us. 
 Pride : Hold your positions. 
 Stay where you are! 
 (crowd gasping) 
 Get inside, get inside. 
 You, too! 
 Get with him. 
 Now! Move! 
 Danny. 
 Get my car, bring it here. 
 No, don't-don't do that, Danny. 
 Do as I tell you. Danny. 
 Danny : It's like I said. 
 He's all we got! 
 Go! Go! 
 Let CJ go. 
 Mind your damn business. 
 Let's just talk this through. 
 No talk. I'm taking my family and I'm going. 
 Nobody moves. 
 I got nothing to lose. 
 Stay in the car, Danny. 
 Come on. 
 Get in. 
 Get in. 
 (whimpering) 
 Stay back! 
 And don't try to follow us! 
 (tires screeching) 
 Bull : Dan! 
 (groaning) 
 Get off of me! 
 Let me go! 
 No, no. 
 R-Relax. 
 It's all right, it's all right. Come on. 
 You guys are okay. You're okay. 
 Get out. You better watch out, Danny. 
 It's all right. I'll catch up with you, son. 
 I'm not your son. 
 Watch your mouth. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yes, please. 
 Hang on a second. 
 Danny? 
 Go ahead. 
 I appreciate it. 
 Yes, I-I will. 
 Yes. All right. 
 We searched Bull's place. 
 We found something that we think that Maggie may have asked him to sign, dated the morning of her death. 
 Petition for relinquishment? 
 It means that your father gives up his rights to you boys. 
 She needed that so she could file this. 
 Adoption petition. 
 (chuckles) She was really gonna do it. 
 She really was. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, and I-I just, uh, talked to the D.A. 
 We're gonna work something out on the drug charges. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey, Doc Wade. 
 Come all the way over here to check on your patient? 
 No. Mind if I join you? 
 Not at all. 
 I checked into DCF. 
 They tell me you're applying to be CJ's legal guardian. 
 Turn 18 in a couple of weeks. 
 I'm tired of being split up. 
 Where will you live? 
 Don't know yet. 
 Well, I... 
 I ask because I have a room in my house that's large enough for two, and I could use a little help around the morgue. 
 For someone who's interested in science. 
 Are you serious? 
 I am. 
 Can I go tell CJ? 
 Yeah. 
 (chuckles) 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, CJ, I got some news. 
 (chuckles) 
 (clears throat) 
 You're taking a troubled delinquent with a penchant for dealing angel dust and his nine-year-old brother into your home? 
 Is that a good idea? 
 No, it's not. 
 But have we met before? 
 Hey, I got your message. 
 Cade's sponsor was worried, so he contacted me. 
 Cade : Fore! 
 Hey, baby brother! 
 Savannah. 
 Hey, so, I realize the paint was all wrong. 
 It-it didn't match the walls. 
 Then I got to thinking, I'm like, “What is really the problem here? Like, what's really...” 
 And then I realize, the walls. 
 That's the problem! 
 You don't like it? 
 That's okay. 
 That's all right. 
 We can change it. 
 I can make anything you want. 
 Oh! 
 Brought you another beer, sugar. 
 Then I got one for myself, too. 
 Who is... 
 Oh, this here is Windi. 
 Met her this afternoon at the hardware store. 
 Say hello, Windi. 
 Hello, Windi. (laughs) 
 She kills me. 
 I love her. Here, hold that. 
 Come on, help me get these drop cloths. 
 (whooping) 
 I'd like to call the clinic, see if I can get him admitted for a temp hold. 
 My guess, he hasn't slept in three days. 
 You don't do something... 
 Crash is coming. 
 Hey. 
 He had me fooled, too. 
 (whooping) 
 All right, hey, Windi? 
 Let's get some tarps over this right here, okay? 
 That way we don't get no paint on the furniture. 
 Hey, come here. 
 Come here. 
 Listen to me, Chris. 
 When I get finished with this tonight, or tomorrow, whenever I get done, it's gonna be better than ever. 
 All right? 
 The Lasalle brothers, nothing can stop us. 
 Mwah! 
 Sure thing, Cade. 
 Sure thing. 
 Thank you. Get this right over here.
