 ♪ Hello there, my old friend ♪ 
♪ Not so long ago ♪ 
♪ It was till the end ♪ 
 Her name's Savannah. She sits right in front of me in biology. She's pretty, smart... 
 Ask her out. 
 Can't. She's too... (sighs) Never mind. 
 “Tell me who you love, and I'll tell you who you are.” 
 (chuckles) The hell's that supposed to mean? 
 Creole proverb. Means there's still hope for your dumb ass. 
 How would you know? All you've ever loved is that damn dog. 
 Well, sure. What's not to love? 
 So... Savannah, huh? 
 What? 
 Nothing. It's stupid. 
 Come on. I'm your brother. Tell me. 
 Savannah :  What did you say? 
 I can't. 
 What? 
 I can't tell you. 
 Tell me. (grunts) 
 Stop that. Stop. 
 Oh. Mmm. Tell me what you said. No. 
 You better stop that. 
 Tell me what you said to Cade about me. 
 Savannah, stop. 
 Come on. Stop it. Stop. 
 Wait. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Look, look. 
 I got something for you. 
 Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 Top right drawer. 
 Chris Lasalle, if you want me to spend more time here, this girl's gonna need more than an empty drawer. 
 That can be arranged. 
 (chuckling) 
 (phone ringing) 
 It's Cade. 
 But it's so late. 
 Hey, brother. What's up? 
 Baby brother. 
 I'm in trouble. 
 What's going on? 
 You shouldn't have brought her. 
 Cade, I'm just here to help. 
 A shrink's not gonna fix this. 
 Look, just tell us what happened, all right? 
 We're here to help you out. 
 Open the trunk. 
 (Cade whimpering) 
 Savannah : It's okay.

 Her name's Windi Stewart. 
 Cade's been dating her for about a month now. 
 Pride : He claims to have found her in his trunk? 
 I know how this looks. 
 You touch anything? 
 Yeah, I opened the trunk. 
 But, look, other than the drinking tonight, Cade's been doing great. 
 He's cleaned up. He's got a new job. 
 He's been going to all his meetings. 
 Even taking his medication. 
 But you shouldn't have called me. 
 You should've called NOPD. 
 (siren wailing) 
 Look, he didn't do this. All right, King? 
 You got to believe me. Someone's setting him up. 
 You're too damn close, and this is not our jurisdiction. 
 There's NOPD. 
 Detective Messier. He's agreed to let you take Cade to the station. 
 Dwayne. Jim. 
 Bloody handprint on the trunk latch of your car. 
 Any chance that's yours? 
 I think I... touched Windi when I found her. 
 Maybe the latch, yeah. 
 And what about these marks on Windi's neck? 
 (sighs) 
 Please take that away. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Photos are tough to look at. 
 Just one more. 
 Recognize this rope? 
 No, I've never seen it before. 
 See, that looks like blood right there. 
 Lab's gonna run it for prints. 
 Good. Then you'll see I never touched that thing. 
 Look, I wouldn't hurt her. 
 So you guys, you never argued, you never got into it? 
 I didn't do this. 
 Then who did? 
 Bogeyman? 
 I don't know. I... 
 Okay, look, there was this other guy... 
 Oh, there's this other guy? 
 Last night? 
 No, of course not. 
 Look, Windi was afraid, okay? 
 She-she didn't feel safe at her place. 
 Something about this other guy in her past. 
 Windi give you his name? 
 No. 
 So some mystery man with no name who wasn't actually there last night. 
 And you really want us to believe that you...? 
 Minor offenses and bipolar disorder doesn't add up to motive. 
 He needs his attorney in there. 
 Waived his right. 
 You should be thanking your lucky stars you're not in there for obstruction. 
 Look, you heard him. All right? There's another guy. 
 Maybe you should be out there looking for him. 
 Christopher. 
 Step outside. 
 Apologies. 
 If that was my brother, I'd have shattered the glass and pulled him out of there by now. 
 We've known each other a long time, Pride. 
 This is a tough one. 
 It'd be easier if you'd run interference with the D.A. 
 Help Cade make bail if he gets charged. 
 You have my guarantee he won't leave the city. 
 I'd be happy to oblige under different circumstances, but this is a murder case. 
 Then let us ride shotgun. 
 Joint investigation? 
 Yeah, you lead. 
 We review the evidence, the body, talk to witnesses. 
 Agreed. 
 As long as Agent Lasalle doesn't muddy the water. 
 You have my word. 
 Thank you. 
 God, she's been brutalized. 
 No skin under the fingernails. 
 No defensive wounds. 
 Which suggests she trusted her attacker. 
 There's marks here and here. 
 It's consistent with being bound, and there's evidence of rough s*x. 
 She may have been raped. 
 Lab's running samples and the tox screen now. 
 Cause of death? 
 Mechanical asphyxia. 
 The killer strangled her with some sort of rope, and he pulled it so hard it left these indentations here. 
 What about the cut? 
 It's from the necklace. 
 The rope pushed against the charm, causing it to slice into her skin. 
 (sighs) Interesting charm. 
 The symbol of the voodoo goddess Erzulie. 
 If your life is in disorder, you make an offering to her and she sets it right. 
 Guess it's up to us to do that. 
 Deputies found this behind a Dumpster at the crime scene. 
 Give it here. 
 Brody : Perfect match. 
 Dust it for prints. 
 I already did. 
 Brody : And what'd you find? 
 What the hell's going on? Messier? 
 Lab confirmed his prints are on the rope. 
 Cade Lasalle, you're under arrest for the murder of Windi Stewart. 
 But I didn't do it. 
 Let's go. 
 Hey, there's no way. 
 Someone's setting him up. 
 Christopher. 
 Christopher, don't. 
 King, they got the wrong guy. 
 Messier, you got the wrong guy! Hey! 
 Chris. Hey, hey. Hey, Chris. 
 Pride : Chris. 
 Cade : Chris! 
 Cade! I'll figure this out! Don't worry! 
 King, we gotta do something! 
 We will. But not like this. 
 Messier's boys are e-mailing the case files and crime scene photos. 
 Already coming in. 
 Where's Chris? 
 Trying to get with Cade-- ask more about this guy Windi was afraid of. 
 Speak. 
 No name, no description. 
 This guy pops up out of nowhere after an hour of questioning? 
 Let NOPD play skeptic. 
 Family's on the line for murder here. 
 Least we can do is offer them another set of eyes. 
 Okay. 
 So what do we know? 
 Windi was found in Cade's car. 
 She was strangled with a rope. 
 Cade's prints are all over it. 
 Add to that-- cursory exam suggests Windi knew her killer. 
 Cade doesn't have an alibi. 
 Everything about this bolsters NOPD's case. 
 None of it speaks to motive. 
 Bipolar disorder, issues with substance abuse. 
 Cade shouldn't have been in that bar. 
 He shouldn't have been drinking. 
 But he's on meds. 
 Maybe he had some kind of psychotic break or something. 
 Cade's version of crazy is painting Chris's house like a Jackson Pollock. 
 Since that night, he's been going to group, he's been holding down a construction job. 
 No signs pointing to this kind of violence. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Agent Pride. 
 Thank you. 
 Windi's mom agreed to a meet. 
 Come with. 
 Maybe she'll, uh, shed some light on this guy that Cade's talking about. 
 Woman :  Windi was my joy. 
 We are so sorry for your loss, Ms. Stewart. 
 I told the police I had a feeling about that guy they've got in custody. 
 Cade. 
 Windi brought him by the house a few times, pretending to dote on her, acting all polite and nice. 
 I didn't believe it. 
 Why is that? 
 I know his type. 
 Windi didn't have very good taste in men, just like her mama. 
 Pride : Let me ask this. 
 Before Cade... were there others? 
 Others? 
 Pride : Other boyfriends that... Windi might have been afraid of? 
 Maybe. 
 Some guy at work... in college... someone she met in a bar. 
 Could you give us their names? 
 So you can keep me from finding out the truth? 
 Cops told me Cade's related to one of you. 
 Ms. Stewart... we want the same thing. 
 We want justice for your daughter. 
 We just need to look at every possibility. 
 Steve Jackowski, Windi's former fiancé. 
 He threw a bottle at her head after she broke up with him. 
 Rap sheet? 
 Assault and petty theft. 
 Then there's this Romeo. 
 Joe Seibel, truck driver. No direct threat, but he's got a rap sheet for assault and battery. 
 Windi's mom also mentioned a college boyfriend. 
 She thinks he's the reason she dropped out. 
 She give you a name? 
 Didn't know it. I called the school; haven't heard back. 
 Okay, the last thing Cade remembers is meeting Windi at the bar. 
 So we take these photos and show 'em around. 
 All right. 
 Not we. Just Brody. 
 Got something else for you. Just talked to our ATF friend who's undercover with Baitfish. 
 Baitfish? 
 Unrelated. This other case has nothing to do with him-- or Sasha Broussard. 
 Our friend has info on stolen guns from a Navy base. 
 You're putting me on another case while my brother sits in jail? 
 I gave Messier my word you wouldn't be involved. 
 Like hell you did, King. 
 If this was your brother... I'd break rules. 
 I would. But I can't have you on this. 
 I can't for Cade's sake. 
 This address, one hour. 
 Meantime, Brody, you go to the bar. 
 I'll follow up with Wade and Messier. 
 You drinking a milk shake? 
 Thought you went vegan. 
 Hemp milk. 
 Lot of omega-3's. Want some? 
 No, thanks. 
 So, what's this Navy case? 
 That gang I'm dialed into, 4th Street, they got a new venture-- stolen, top-of-the-line M9s, M16's, Navy issue. 
 Gang starts using them, Navy's got serious issues. 
 Well, supplier's a petty officer out of Belle Chasse. 
 I heard about your brother. 
 I got family in prison. It's tough. 
 You trying to bond with me, Percy. 
 (laughs) I'm a realist. 
 Want me to say a prayer, give you false hope? 
 It ends badly. 
 Then what? 
 This Navy case, what do you need? 
 I take delivery for this gang tomorrow. 
 I need you and your brain there to help make an arrest. 
 We will be. 
 Wouldn't mind a few surveillance pictures, too. 
 Whatever you want. 
 We're NCIS-- we multitask. 
 Wade :  Windi's killer liked to play games. 
 Her over-distended lungs present pulmonary edema. 
 I've seen this often in victims of erotic asphyxia. 
 One partner strangles the other to the point of passing out. 
 Right. The depletion of oxygen brings about a euphoric state. 
 And in Windi's case... she died. 
 So... s*x game gone wrong. 
 Wade : Given the damage inflicted on this girl, I doubt she was a willing participant. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Lab results are inconclusive for trace and DNA off of Windi's body. 
 It's been great seeing everyone. Have a nice day. 
 Lund. 
 What about the tox results? 
 Uh, both Cade and Windi had blood alcohol levels above .14. 
 Uh, Windi was clean for drugs. 
 Cade tested positive for oxcarbazepine. 
 That's a treatment for bipolar disorder. 
 Added with alcohol, would that explain Cade's memory loss? 
 Yep. See you. 
 Wait. 
 Could the combo platter also cause anger, rage? 
 I'm sorry, what's your question? 
 Could Cade's intoxicated state inspire him to strangle Windi? 
 Wade : Sebastian, we're all just doing our jobs. 
 Yeah, well, mine sucks, okay? 
 Lasalle's gonna hate me. 
 It's all right, Sebastian. 
 Sebastian : Uh... 
 The med itself has intense side effects. 
 Uh, when combined with alcohol, yes, it could cause violent behavior. 
 Cade didn't need a motive. 
 Meds may have done this for him. 
 We got some leads we still want to keep pursuing. 
 Be my guest, but I have to say, I think you're chasing ghosts. 
 Man : Cops already asked. 
 Told 'em I didn't see these guys. 
 What about them? 
 Yeah, they were here. 
 Something was definitely off with him. 
 What do you mean? 
 Came in wanting to order a grapefruit juice, and then starts pounding drinks. 
 Did he seem upset? 
 No, but he was acting weird with her. 
 And the way he was holding her by the elbow, and scared look in her eyes. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Sorry. Thanks. 
 Lasalle (staticky) :Hey, Brody, I've got something. Lasalle? 
 Cops aren't loo... right place. 
 I-I can't hear you. 
 There's too much static. 
 I'm at Windi's apart... 
 You're where? 
 You broke into Windi's apartment to search it? 
 I was thinking about what my brother said. 
 Windi's scared to be in her own place. 
 Lasalle, this is the victim's apartment. 
 Your brother is a prime suspect in her murder. 
 Was,  okay? 
 Was  a prime suspect. 
 Look at the new bling on the door and windows. 
 Brody : Deadbolts, bars on the windows. 
 But NOPD called me, and Jackowski and Seibel alibied out. 
 Well, it must be that guy from Windi's college her mom talked about. 
 I called the school. Couldn't get an answer. 
 Try again. 
 (static, beeping over phone) 
 Too much static. 
 There was static when I called you from here, too. 
 Call me. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Let's move around. 
 You think the interference is caused by a bug? 
 Yeah. Stronger in this room. 
 Keep going. 
 Somewhere over here. 
 Stop. 
 It's not a bug. 
 It's a camera. 
 Looks like Windi had a secret admirer. 
 Cade was right. 
 There is someone else. 
 Hey, got your message. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 I told you... 
 Hang on. Hang on. Just listen. 
 Someone's spying on Windi. 
 Tracked the serial number on the smoke alarm camera to a spy shop. 
 Owner gave up the name. 
 Reid Gorie, serial stalker. 
 Two stints in s*x rehab, restraining order by an ex-girlfriend, and he went to the same college as Windi. 
 Lives in that house up there. 
 Look, Gorie stalks Windi, gets jealous of Cade, kills her and sets him up. 
 You got it all figured out. 
 I told you to lay low. 
 Look, this camera's solid evidence. 
 Which isn't admissible because of your illegal search. 
 King, uh, I'm telling... 
 Go back to the car. 
 Look, just let me... 
 Go back to the car. 
 Stay there. 
 This guy's got motive. 
 You should have called me the second you knew he was in that apartment. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 You still want to do this even though nothing's admissible? 
 We're here. 
 Let's see if Mr. Gorie says something that is. 
 Man :  I've been expecting you since I saw you  in Windi's apartment. 
 Camera loves you, Agent Brody. 
 Where were you last night around 11:00 p.m., Mr. Gorie? 
 Bachelor auction. 
 I was the handsome guy in the tux. 
 Where'd you get that scratch? 
 (chuckles) 
 You know what, I thought about calling my attorney, but then that would be a waste of all our time. 
 I didn't kill Windi. 
 You just liked to watch. 
 I was protecting her from her bad choices in men. 
 Like Cade Lasalle. 
 The guy's a violent lowlife. 
 He's got a rap sheet. 
 His own brother put him in a psych lock-up. 
 You've done your homework. 
 Here. If you don't believe me, take this. 
 What is it? 
 Proof Cade Lasalle murdered Windi. 
 Cade say anything to you about this? 
 Chris? 
 Cade said they never argued. 
 This has to be doctored. 
 Gorie's done something to it. 
 Talked to the owners at the bachelor auction. 
 So far, no one remembers Gorie being there. 
 That's 'cause he was busy killing Windi. 
 Let's get this to Sebastian. 
 Bring NOPD in. 
 You can't help here. 
 King. 
 You know me. You know how I work. 
 Even though every bone in my body says Cade didn't do this, I don't speak for him. 
 I don't speak for NOPD or NCIS, all right? 
 I speak for that dead girl, Windi. 
 More than anyone, I want justice for her. 
 Best way to help both of them is for you to stay away. 
 What's going on with the Navy case? 
 Sonja's picking me up in a couple hours. 
 We're going to do recon for the gun buy. 
 Go home. 
 Wait for her there. 
 Chris. 
 Be in touch with you later. 
 Get this to Sebastian, see what he can find. 
 I'll talk to Cade. 
 
 
 
 Pride :  Why'd you lie to the cops? 
 Windi was dead in my car. 
 I'm gonna tell them I got in an argument with her? 
 Tell me. 
 Windi was upset about the guy that was bothering her. 
 I wanted her to tell me his name. 
 She wouldn't. 
 You saying you were jealous? 
 I wanted to help her. 
 We ended up getting into it, but I called her later and told her I was sorry. 
 You ever see him? 
 Reid Gorie? 
 No. 
 Maybe at the bar. 
 Outside of it. 
 Cade, try to remember. 
 I can't. 
 Okay, I messed up. 
 I had a few drinks, I woke up, and she was dead. 
 And I keep asking myself, 
 “Did I do this? 
 Am I so gone that I actually killed Windi?” 
 Christopher doesn't think so. 
 (chuckles) 
 He told me you saved him. 
 Back when he quit Vice. 
 When he was all low and angry. 
 You're kind of like the dad he never had. 
 It's my understanding that, uh, you carried some of that weight. 
 We'll figure this out. 
 Understood? 
 Savannah :  The detectives called me. 
 They asked for Cade's psych records. 
 Told them to get a subpoena. 
 Sorry you're involved in this. 
 You know, when I let you cheat off my papers in high school, I had no idea what I was getting into. 
 You didn't even know I existed. 
 What-- cute guy with the big ears? 
 I knew you were back there. 
 (car horn honks) 
 Is that your other girlfriend? 
 It's the other case Pride's got me on. 
 Well... when you're done, then. 
 So, what's up with the Little Mermaid? 
 Excuse me? 
 Oh, red hair-- Little Mermaid. 
 Her name's Savannah. 
 (cell phone chirps) 
 Ah. 
 They find something else on your brother? 
 Empathize much? 
 (laughs) That's what mermaids are for. 
 There's seriously something wrong with you. 
 (chuckles) Like I said, I've been down this road, and I've learned. 
 Keep your distance, kid. 
 It's better that way. 
 So, this gun deal-- what's the timeline? 
 Navy guy arrives tomorrow at noon. 
 Buy is 10K for a couple untraceable M9's and M16's. 
 I figure you get your camera set up here, you'll stay hidden from view. 
 Yeah, crouched down in a pile of pigeon poop. 
 Where exactly is it taking place? 
 Oh, the loading dock over there. 
 That's quite a distance from here. 
 What if I have to run interference? 
 Well, use your worldly charms. 
 I don't have much of that right now. 
 Aw, I bet the Little Mermaid would beg to differ. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 What's all this? 
 The grassy knoll. 
 These guys represent the bystanders that were there when Kennedy's limo drove by. 
 Relevance? 
 The Zapruder film. 
 In it, the bystanders on the lawn don't look at the limo after Kennedy is shot. 
 Instead... they look beyond it. 
 Meaning that the background was out of synch with the main action. 
 You're saying the Zapruder film was altered. 
 Yeah, so was yours, just not in the way that Lasalle thought. 
 So, I isolated the background action from the main action on the flash drive Gorie gave you. 
 Okay, you see the shadow from the sun on the living room wall? 
 Watch this. 
 And... Oliver Stone! 
 Shadow skipped. 
 Yeah. 
 Given where the sun rose and set on this manufactured day, I'd guess that maybe three hours are missing. 
 Gorie pulled the flash drive right out of his laptop. 
 The missing footage could still be on the laptop's hard drive. 
 I'll get a judge. I'll call Pride. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Federal agents, Mr. Gorie. 
 Open up! 
 We've got a warrant, Mr. Gorie. 
 We'll go around back. 
 He's running! 
 (bystanders scream, gasp) 
 Gorie, stop! He's got the laptop! 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 You all right? 
 Got it. 
 Computer! 
 (hissing) 
 Captain, they only have this video because Agent Lasalle illegally searched Windi's apartment. 
 Mr. Gorie, all I know is my office got an anonymous tip about an illegal camera in there. 
 The lab tracked the signal to your laptop. 
 We were in the area. 
 This is collusion. 
 It's obsession. 
 Yours. 
 Brody : Footage you left off the flash drive you gave us. 
 Showtime. 
 Look at you-- in Windi's apartment after Cade left. 
 How you got that scratch. 
 Watching her wasn't enough. 
 You had to see her. 
 Touch her. 
 And when she refused you, you killed her. 
 She was alone. Why didn't I just kill her right there? 
 Maybe you wanted Cade Lasalle to take the fall. 
 Strangled her. 
 Put the rope in his hands. 
 Cade did this. 
 I bet you he's even done it before. 
 You would know. 
 Stalking other girls... 
 I went to rehab for-for my issues. 
 You raped and tortured Windi because of your issues. 
 No alibi, Gorie! 
 No one saw you at that auction! 
 I was across the street from her apartment all night, waiting for her to come back. 
 And she never did. 
 Brody : Surveillance from a street cam outside Windi's apartment. 
 Taken during Windi's time of death. 
 Guy's a psycho. 
 Psycho with an alibi. 
 Anything from your side? 
 Where we started. 
 As is the evidence. 
 So, that's it? 
 We all wanted a different outcome here. 
 With all due respect, we got to stop digging. 
 For Lasalle's sake and for Windi's family. 
 Didn't matter what Gorie said-- his mind is set. 
 Just like yours. 
 About Cade. 
 But not anymore? 
 Gorie was a stalker. 
 He went to s*x rehab. 
 He likes playing games. 
 He fits this. Cade doesn't. 
 If the theory is he snapped, probably not. 
 What did Cade say when he talked to you? 
 Just... just that he didn't remember. 
 Come on, Brody. 
 What if whoever did this was like Gorie? 
 Calculating, ruthless. 
 Made Cade black out somehow. 
 Tied up Windi. 
 Killed her. 
 Dumped the car. 
 Setting Cade up for the whole thing. 
 Takes planning, experience. 
 I doubt it was the first time. 
 So, go back through everything. 
 Everything. Fine-tooth comb. 
 All we got on this case. 
 I'll call Loretta, tell her to do the same thing on her end. 
 All right. 
 Lasalle :  Suspect on my brother's case  alibied out. 
 Back to square one. 
 Looking for more suspects. 
 Other than your brother. 
 He didn't do this. 
 How are you so sure? 
 This one summer... before Cade got sick, he found this dog that was boarded up... 
 Story time? 
 ...but he saved it. 
 All right? A broken piece of misery that everyone thought should just be put down. 
 Cade felt otherwise. 
 Nursed it back to health. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 And he loved that dog when no one else would. 
 Is that the kind of kid that grows up to murder someone? 
 I don't know. 
 I like cats. 
 What? 
 Listen. Lasalle, I'm not your shrink, okay? But, um... it was a nice story. 
 Now, look out. 
 He's here. 
 (groans) Are we good, though? 
 I mean, you need a hug or something? 
 'Cause I feel like... 
 Fine. I'm okay. 
 All right, good. 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 (chuckles) 
 Cats. 
 Lyons, you're late. 
 90-series M9. 
 Official sidearm of the U.S. military. 
 Want to see the action? Hang on. 
 Sure. 
 You buy in the next five minutes, I'll throw in the silencer. 
 The hell is this-- QVC? 
 It's 10K. 
 We got a deal? 
 Yo! What the hell is your problem? 
 This all the cash you got? 
 (laughs) You robbing me? 
 Wait till I tell the players at 4th Street their supplier's a thief. 
 Why don't we tell them together? NCIS! 
 Get your hands up. 
 “NCIS”-- the hell is that? 
 Naval Criminal Investigative Service. 
 Lasalle : Now, lovebirds! 
 Navy guy's headed for base lockup. 
 I'll send you the surveillance photos. 
 Thanks. 
 For having my back. 
 Ah, no problem. 
 And I hope everything works out for your brother. 
 I'll say some prayers. 
 You going soft on me, Percy? 
 (laughs) Nah. 
 Just 'cause mine weren't answered doesn't mean your brother shouldn't get a little divine intervention. 
 (sighs) 
 Nothing there. 
 That is not your necklace. 
 The killer put it on her? 
 Yes, I think as some kind of sick message or ritual. 
 And you were right, there were others. 
 Cops didn't get anything because the necklaces were catalogued as personal items. 
 How many cases? 
 Three victims were raped and strangled with a rope. 
 Most recent case-- Laura Anderson. 
 No suspects, but there's a witness and she lives close. 
 907 Moss Hill Road. 
 All right, go. Learn things. 
 King. Deal's done. 
 Suspects in custody, and Sonja took the guns to ATF. 
 Lasalle! 
 Excuse his enthusiasm. 
 What's going on? 
 Dr. Wade and I went rogue. 
 Like minds, Pride. 
 I was reviewing Cade's tox report when you called. 
 Oxcar and alcohol could explain a three-hour blackout. 
 The time between the bar and when he called me? 
 Yes. However, blackouts are porous, and over time, people begin to remember missing pieces. 
 But Cade insists that he doesn't remember anything. 
 Yeah, so we ran a tox on Cade's blood. 
 I thought you already did that. 
 Well, we did, but NOPD requested the standard report. 
 But for roofies, you have to do a whole separate test. 
 Cade was roofied? 
 Yeah. Flunitrazepam. At least two milligrams. 
 Pride : How incapacitated would that make him? 
 You ever see that episode of  Star Trek  when Kirk gets tanked up on Saurian Brandy? 
 Try again. 
 Yeah, uh... flunitrazepam is ten times more potent than Diazepam. 
 There was enough inside of Cade to impair him for five to six hours and cause the memory loss. 
 Lasalle, Cade wouldn't have had the strength to strangle Windi. 
 Thank you, bud. 
 Always here for you, bro. 
 Should we fist-bump now, or...? 
 Nah, I'm good. 
 Yeah, I'm good, too. 
 Right, so Cade's memory stops right after he left the bar. 
 Yeah, the bartender told Brody that Cade and Windi sat alone. 
 And he's the one that pours the drinks. 
 Name and address. 
 Kai Bryant. 907 Moss Hill Road. 
 Where? 
 907 Moss Hill Road. 
 Brody. 
 (loud music playing) 
 NCIS. 
 Woman : Come on in. 
 (hard rock music blaring) 
 NCIS Special Agent Meredith Brody. 
 I'm looking for Eloise Sanchez. 
 You got her. What can I do you for? 
 I'm here in regards to the Laura Anderson case. 
 It's been a while. 
 Y'all still investigating that? 
 You live here alone, Ms. Sanchez? 
 Eloise : Nah. 
 The doctors say it's no good for me to be by myself. 
 (gun cocks) 
 Why don't you stay? 
 Keep her company? 
 Shouldn't have come here, bitch. 
 Cops know I'm here. 
 They're on the way. 
 Well, that don't matter. 
 Brody : Homey. 
 Eloise : Shut up. 
 On your knees. 
 This all part of your little game? 
 This is what you did with the others, isn't it? 
 Windi Stewart, Laura Anderson-- you-you played with them? 
 You could say that. 
 Couldn't you, sweetheart? 
 He finds them... 
 I adorn them. 
 Teamwork. 
 Which one of you gets off on strangling them? 
 The bartender, Bryant, doesn't have a record, but his girlfriend did a stint in a juvie psych ward. 
 Seems she gets off on watching things die. 
 Let me guess. 
 To calm her nerves. 
 She prays to the... Erzulie. 
 You really buy into her crap? 
 I love her. 
 Sure. 
 What's not to love? 
 (grunting) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Anything? 
 No. Brody's not answering. 
 (car engine revving) 
 (gunshot) 
 (three gunshots) 
 Brody. 
 Take the back. 
 Let's get you out of here.

 Hardest thing ever. 
 Thanks for sticking by me, Chris. 
 Any time, brother. 
 Let's go home. 
 I'm not going home with you. 
 What do you mean? 
 After all this... 
 I want to see Mom. 
 And you need to spend time with your lady. 
 Savannah is cooking dinner for us. 
 Don't get me wrong, she's cute and all, but Mom's a better cook. 
 True. 
 Remember what you said about her at the lake, way back when? 
 Had that goofy grin smothering your face? 
 I'm gonna marry her, Cade, someday. 
 I'm gonna marry Savannah. 
 You still remember that? 
 Hey. That was the best summer of my life. 
 Me, my dog, Alabama sun... my little brother, blissfully lost in love.

 Glad it worked out for Lasalle and his brother. 
 Little faith goes a long way. 
 I guess for some people it can. 
 Yours is about to pay off. 
 Baitfish? 
 Where is he? 
 Don't know, but he did call to thank me for delivering his drugs and wants me around for his next venture. 
 Something connected to Sasha Broussard? 
 Maybe, maybe not, but I got the vibe he's planning a hit. 
 Target? 
 Someone in town. 
 Still trying to figure out who.

 Oh, God.

 I need to get a message to his boss.

 I swear. 
 No worries. 
 You'll do.
