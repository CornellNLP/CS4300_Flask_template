 [WOMAN] 
  Previously on Queen Sugar Why I gotta worry about enemies when I got a sister like Nova Bordelon right here. 
  I'm angry at her, too, but I know that she loves Blue. 
  I need that little boy to be surrounded with love. 
  Parker Campbell. 
  Connected to Old World Energy. 
  Who are these people? 
  They want to ask you some questions about the Queen Sugar fire. 
  And it ain't about looking back. 
  About breaking bad cycles. 
  Looking forward. 
  Mom, I'm not going to Harvard. 
  You have been dealt a winning hand. 
  You just want to toss it away? 
  How dare you. 
  Got one of those for me? 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - You should've I'm sorry for how I told you about Harvard. 
  I I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that. 
  I appreciate that. 
  And my response it wasn't just about Harvard. 
  This election I just want you to have every chance, every advantage. 
  I already have advantages. 
  And I'm thankful for them. 
  I I want to use my advantages to help others. 
  I want you to help others. 
  But I'm going to need some time with this. 
  I'm sorry if that's not what you want to hear right now. 
  [POUNDING ON DOOR] 
  Miss Charley Bordelon, we have a warrant for your arrest. 
  - What? 
  - The fire at Queen Sugar Mill. 
  You're under arrest for arson with the intent to defraud. 
  Dreams never die Take flight As the world turns Dreams never die Take flight As the world turns Keep the colors In the lines Take flight Dreams never die Keep the colors In the lines Keep the colors In the lines, take flight How long they trying to make us wait till we get word? 
  Because I know they not trying to keep my sister overnight on this bullshit. 
  - Ralph Angel - That ain't happening. 
  Sir. 
  Language. 
  Sir. 
  Racism. 
  Ralph Angel, sit down now. 
  I got no time to be polite, Aunt Vi. 
  Now, we know what this is. 
  What they doing to us. 
  What they've been doing to us. 
  They trying to break us. 
  Who called all them reporters out front anyway? 
  Rah, please. 
  Micah's on the phone getting an update from Charley's lawyers Nobody was talking to you, Nova. 
  Ralph Angel, stop it. 
  [KEYS RATTLE] 
  Mom. 
  [SIGHS] 
  - Are you okay? 
  - I'm okay. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  - I'm okay. 
  - Are they letting you go? 
  It's a fixed bail. 
  And my lawyer will have this foolishness tossed within 24 hours. 
  They have nothing, and they know it. 
  [DEPUTY] 
  Sign these to acknowledge a release on your own recognizance. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  You see that? 
  That's what I don't like. 
  Charley, there's reporters outside. 
  [SIGHS] 
  How do you want to handle this? 
  Aunt Vi, do you have a compact? 
  Absolutely. 
  - [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] 
  - [REPORTERS SHOUTING] 
  Is it true you're under suspicion of setting your own mill on fire? 
  That's speculative stupidity. 
  I stand before you now because there is no substance to this arrest, and the warrant was sought after by Sheriff Guidry, who has three open cases of corruption against him. 
  Their only so-called evidence is a drip torch with my prints that was found at the scene. 
  But, of course, a drip torch is a common tool owned by most farmers and sugar mills. 
  My lawyer didn't even have to fly in to cast doubt on this charade. 
  You're saying you're innocent? 
  You're damn right I'm innocent. 
  To whomever is fueling these attacks on me and my family, to whomever tried and failed to permanently purge our supporters from the voter rolls, it won't work. 
  When you come for me and the people of St. 
  Jo, you better not miss. 
  And you missed. 
  We'll see you at the polls. 
  - [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] 
  - [REPORTERS SHOUTING] 
  I thought I called in the favor you owe me. 
  You did. 
  Well, then why did I just have? 
  Have to see Charley get arrested? 
  I'm aware. 
  I wish it didn't have to get that far, but I had to let it play out a bit further. 
  A bit? 
  All right, a lot further. 
  To be sure it was airtight. 
  And it is. 
  Everything you need on Frances. 
  My God. 
  I'd say thank you, but you owe me. 
  Did owe you. 
  Have you heard from Betty recently? 
  Baby. 
  We lost contact years ago. 
  Last I heard she had retired. 
  Your little girl graduated Spelman. 
  And then Wharton, I think. 
  That was 10, 15 years ago. 
  Maybe in a different time we could have all stayed together. 
  Your daddy would have killed you. 
  He almost did. 
  If it wasn't for you getting her out of town, convincing him the whole thing was just a rumor, I might be six feet under. 
  I ain't singing no sad song for you, Sam. 
  You grown. 
  You could've at least stayed in touch. 
  No. 
  If Frances had ever gotten wind of that, she'd have sold me out quicker than God could get the news. 
  And Daddy would've cut me off. 
  Yeah, it's always about money with you, Sam. 
  Back then? 
  When I was making my bones, my name? 
  Yeah. 
  But by the time I knew better, it didn't make sense to disturb their life after all those years. 
  Well, you know better now? 
  Do better now. 
  Maybe I will one day. 
  Sure you will, Sam. 
  Bye. 
  [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  [CHARLEY] 
  Can you e-mail me a copy of the affidavit when the charges are officially dropped in the morning? 
  Yeah. 
  Thanks, Olivia. 
  [SIGHS] 
  How are you holding up, baby girl? 
  I am staying focused. 
  Some tea, Aunt Vi? 
  I'm too upset for tea. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Thank you. 
  Like the fire wasn't bad enough, to try to say you the one that set it is a sick joke. 
  Well, I'm sure Frances had a good laugh, having me carted off by the cops. 
  Well, you know she ain't gonna have the last laugh. 
  What is all this, Aunt Vi? 
  Information. 
  The most valuable thing you can have at a time like this. 
  Well, these are these are financial books for Landry Enterprises, but not the ones I've seen. 
  There are people who are listed here who are getting payments that I've never even heard of. 
  Except Hank Miller. 
  He's in here a few times, listed next to some very large payments. 
  I've got bank transactions from an offshore account that I'm guessing match those payments. 
  Aunt Vi, where did you get all this? 
  [VIOLET] 
  Don't be worried about all that. 
  Y'all forget sometimes, I got history on my side. 
  I done collected a few chips to play when I need them. 
  [GASPS] 
  [STAMMERS] 
  Well this is something. 
  E-mails from Frances's home server between her and Hank Miller discussing the ICE raid They talked about the method most likely to flag the insurance company. 
  Unbelievable. 
  This this is exactly what we need to take Frances down. 
  Almost. 
  Remember, there are bigger forces out there. 
  We have a lot here, but we don't have everything. 
  Well, then you just keep looking. 
  [R&B MUSIC PLAYING] 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Hollywood Desonier, you are crazy. 
  Oh, just for you, baby, and only for you. 
  Hey, look all right, now. 
  There, you have a taste. 
  Just one taste, all right? 
  Okay, um Oh, that See, I got gifts, baby. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Mm! 
  That's talent. 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  That's good. 
  Okay, I am not the only one in this household who can burn. 
  It's official. 
  [BOTH] 
  Mwah! 
  Thank you, my baby. 
  Mm. 
  Hey, have you thought any more about opening that men's lounge? 
  You could make it a wing spot, too. 
  I thought about it. 
  What you think? 
  You think it's a good idea? 
  I just want you to be happy, baby. 
  Whatever. 
  I'm with you. 
  Oh Oh, I knew. 
  I knew you were going to take it too far. 
  I knew you would! 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  I finished my chores. 
  Appreciate you, brother. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Mom! 
  Ah. 
  Hi, hi! 
  Look what I brought. 
  [WHISPERS] 
  I got a surprise for you later. 
  [BLUE, WHISPERING] 
  You do? 
  Awesome. 
  - Mm, they smell delicious. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Okay. 
  Just wait. 
  - How you doing? 
  - Good. 
  Thanks for asking. 
  It's all good. 
  Um, I thought that after we talked to Blue about your father I'd cook you a meal today. 
  I know a lot's been going on, but I wanted to say a proper thank-you. 
  The groceries are in the trunk. 
  [RALPH ANGEL] 
  What I do know is you better not be peeking. 
  - Got them eyes closed? 
  - Yup. 
  [RALPH ANGEL] 
  You can open them now. 
  Come on. 
  - Ah! 
  - [RALPH ANGEL LAUGHS] 
  It's not my birthday. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - Right? 
  It's from your birthday a little while ago. 
  Found them while we was spring cleaning. 
  Hmm. 
  Wow. 
  That's from Papa. 
  What do you mean it's from Papa? 
  Remember that birthday party you were at? 
  Didn't get to open all your gifts. 
  They've been up in the closet and I forgot. 
  This box is from Papa. 
  He just wasn't able to give it to you yet. 
  Because he got sick. 
  Yeah, because he got sick. 
  You want to see what's inside the box? 
  I think you should open it. 
  Okay. 
  [GASPS] 
  Ah. 
  Blue, you are going to want to see this. 
  A beach ball? 
  [RALPH ANGEL] 
  Ha-ha! 
  Your father knew you liked water. 
  Papa Come on. 
  It's okay. 
  Papa. 
  I miss you, Papa. 
  I got you, buddy. 
  Gonna be alright. 
  [R&B MUSIC PLAYING] 
  Place really works. 
  Space big enough for both of us to have an office. 
  Alarm, laundry room, two parking spots. 
  Two? 
  Two. 
  It's close to my kids and close to the 9th Ward. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  I love it. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  It feels like us. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Wherever we are is where home is. 
  You said that. 
  And I meant it. 
  I mean it. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I have to admit I am a little bit nervous about today. 
  Oh. 
  You? 
  I don't think "nervous" is the word for me. 
  Anxious. 
  Maybe eager. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Excited, even. 
  I want this part to be over so we can get to the good part. 
  I want my family to know you. 
  And when they do they'll see what I see. 
  Those are all the groceries. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I was hoping we could talk. 
  [SIGHS] 
  We told each other that we never stopped loving each other. 
  The night of the storm. 
  And then Blue called from Deesha's, and we never really finished that conversation. 
  I'd like to finish it. 
  Me too. 
  I just want you to know that I know you always meant well. 
  All the things that happened it was never coming from a bad place inside you, but just a hurt place. 
  A lot of that hurt is my fault. 
  And I'm sorry for it. 
  I appreciate that. 
  I do. 
  But I have to be accountable for my actions. 
  You can be accountable and still good to yourself. 
  You've been through a lot, darling. 
  Your addiction. 
  An assault. 
  I mean, you was violated in the worst way. 
  But I don't want you to see me as all those things. 
  I don't want to be that. 
  I want you to look at me like you used to. 
  I don't think I can. 
  The woman I see now is more brave more beautiful [R&B MUSIC PLAYING] 
  And better than I ever seen. 
  I see you, Darla. 
  All of you. 
  I love all of you. 
  I love you. 
  [MUSIC CONTINUES] 
  Come here. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  I love you so much, Ralph Angel. 
  I love you, too. 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  Always. 
  [VIOLET] 
  Charley, you don't need to be here working. 
  Go and focus on your big night. 
  The votes are already in, and every exit poll is saying that it's just going to be too close to call until last votes are counted. 
  So I just need to keep my hands and my mind busy. 
  I got you. 
  [UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] 
  [ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYS] 
  [NOVA] 
  Aunt Vi. 
  This is my This is Calvin. 
  Pleasure, Calvin. 
  I've read so much I've heard so much about you, baby. 
  Thank you, ma'am. 
  I've heard many beautiful things about you. 
  It's an honor to finally meet you in person. 
  Well, I'm going to excuse myself. 
  This is my sister, Charley. 
  Charley, this is Calvin. 
  [CALVIN] 
  The lady of the hour. 
  Best of luck tonight. 
  Thank you. 
  I will take that. 
  Welcome. 
  Micah. 
  How are you doing? 
  Good. 
  Thanks. 
  I heard about your new college plans. 
  Congratulations. 
  You're stronger than I ever was at your age. 
  Thank you. 
  You know, I just hope it all works out. 
  Oh, it will. 
  You're going to make it so. 
  [DOOR OPENING] 
  [VIOLET] 
  So there is so much to do before those doors open, Why don't y'all make yourselves useful. 
  And go on in there and cut up some pies. 
  - [ALL LAUGH] 
  - Okay? 
  That went well, I think. 
  I think so, too. 
  [UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] 
  [NEWS ANCHOR, ON TV] 
  It's election night here in rural Louisiana. 
  It looks like it's going to be a real nail-biter in St. 
  Josephine Parish, with over 90% of the vote in and only four district left to be counted, Landry Sugarland heir Jacob Boudreaux now leads former NBA wife and mill owner Charley Bordelon in the St. 
  Jo's City Council race by a 3% margin. 
  We'll keep you updated on that race as more numbers come Okay, listen. 
  Listen folks. 
  This This was supposed to be a cakewalk for the Landrys. 
  But we are giving those good old boys a run for their money. 
  And more importantly, we didn't come all this way to give up in the homestretch. 
  I want you to remember a woman named Shannon Rainey. 
  Shannon Rainey found toxic waste in her backyard when she was just an ordinary citizen of New Orleans. 
  But did she let that stop her? 
  No. 
  She did what she had to do and she fought back. 
  That's right. 
  And if she can keep fighting, then we can too. 
  - [WOMAN] 
  Keep fighting! 
  - Three percent? 
  - We can overcome that. 
  - [MAN] 
  That's right. 
  Yeah! 
  - [APPLAUSE] 
  - Whoo! 
  - [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] 
  - Whoo! 
  Joaquin? 
  Hey, how are you? 
  Getting by. 
  I want you to know I've been getting regular updates from my attorney on your father and brother's asylum cases. 
  Yeah. 
  My mom said there was a chance. 
  Well, there are no guarantees, but I won't stop until I see them released. 
  You have my word. 
  Appreciate that, ma'am. 
  Hey, Red, turn that up. 
  All the way. 
  [NEWS ANCHOR] 
  We have an election night news alert now. 
  With 98% of the vote counted, we are calling the race for the last city council member seat in St. 
  Josephine Parish for Charley Bordelon. 
  [ALL CHEER] 
  An amazing turn of events there. 
  [WHOOPING] 
  Hey! 
  Hey! 
  Champagne on the house! 
  Champagne on the house! 
  [OVERLAPPING SHOUTS OF JOY] 
 
 
 
  Okay, everybody say congratulations to Councilwoman Bordelon! 
  [ALL CHEER] 
  I took the liberty of ordering you an iced tea. 
  Congratulations, Charley. 
  You managed to pull off a win. 
  Hmm. 
  Despite your best efforts. 
  Truthfully, I never felt Jacob's heart was really in politics. 
  But he's my son. 
  You can't fault me for wanting to do everything possible to see him win? 
  I hope the ugliness in our past won't blind you to the opportunities before us. 
  Opportunities? 
  If you show yourself to be loyal to the council's overarching goals, there may be more resources available to you. 
  Perhaps you can rebuild your mill. 
  Have more flexibility on just how the highway takes shape. 
  And where. 
  Whoo. 
  Not even sworn in, and I'm already being offered a bribe. 
  And by a dead woman walking. 
  Excuse me? 
  I'm talking about the payments you made to Hank Miller. 
  And the payments he made to two young men. 
  Poor and desperate men like Joaquin Avila. 
  The men who subsequently set fire to my mill. 
  I know about it all, Frances. 
  That's ridiculous. 
  Well, the two men have already confessed. 
  The police picked up Hank Miller this morning, so I imagine it won't be long before he does the same. 
  But if you have a simple explanation, I'm sure they'd love to hear it. 
  Frances Ann Boudreaux you're under arrest for bribery and conspiracy to commit arson. 
  Please stand up. 
  This is ridiculous. 
  I want to speak to your superior. 
  We'll talk about that at the station. 
  Don't you dare put those things on me, if you know what's good for you. 
  [CHIMES] 
  What you doing here, Nova? 
  Thought I told you to stay away from here. 
  I'm here to apologize. 
  Please. 
  Please let me apologize. 
  Rah, Mama's buried here. 
  On the land. 
  - No, she ain't. 
  - She was never cremated like we were told. 
  She was buried here instead. 
  Nah. 
  Pop would have told us. 
  I went to see Mama's cousin, Martha, by the wetlands. 
  She said Mama had Daddy bury her by the farm. 
  It was kept a secret because it was her gift to him, so she would always be close to him. 
  I ain't never heard of no cousin Martha. 
  She had Mama's journal. 
  All in her handwriting. 
  You asked me to stay away from the farm. 
  This is why I can't do it. 
  I know it's a lot to take in, but Mama didn't want us to know. 
  So we wouldn't feel tied to this place. 
  It was just supposed to be between her and Daddy. 
  There's not even a grave marker. 
  What is it? 
  "Angel cream. 
  " I remember the angel cream. 
  She used to make that when I got scratched up. 
  She said God made it just for me. 
  See what she wrote below it? 
  [SIGHS] 
  "Nova applied the angel cream last night. 
  "She's so gentle with Ralph Angel. 
  "So fiercely protective. 
  "And he follows her every move in awe and adoration. 
  "My greatest prayer is that their bond never severs, but only deepens with time. 
  " Mama would have hated this. 
  Daddy too. 
  I think that's why she's been reaching out to me. 
  This farm isn't just land. 
  It's consecrated ground. 
  For her. 
  And for us. 
  I know you can't just forgive me. 
  And I'm sorry I went about things the way I did. 
  But something good came from all of this. 
  Let me work at this. 
  At us. 
  I want to fix things. 
  Re-earn your trust. 
  But you got to let me in. 
  If we're going to fight these people who hate everything we stand for we can't be at war with each other. 
  I remember Mama used to grow these in her garden. 
  [NOVA] 
  Imphepho plants. 
  She used them to make your angel cream. 
  She used them in everything. 
  Been seeing them around sometimes. 
  Here on the farm? 
  They ain't here now. 
  Except this one spot. 
  Growing wild. 
  Where, exactly? 
  I don't remember. 
  I was out in the fields playing with Blue. 
  Rah, Martha said she couldn't exactly say where Mama was buried. 
  But if a bunch of her favorite flowers are somewhere in that cane, maybe that's where. 
  That's 800 acres, though. 
  That's okay. 
  I got an idea on how we can find it. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Parker's waiting for you. 
  - Right in there, Miss Bordelon. 
  - Thank you. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  So. 
  I finally get to meet the elusive Parker Campbell. 
  I'll be with you in a moment. 
  Thanks, John. 
  I'll take it from here. 
  [MAN] 
  Of course, Miss Campbell. 
  I'll be outside if you need me. 
  [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] 
  I'm Parker. 
  I run Community Relations at the Beckington Group, which is just a fancy and intentionally vague way of saying I make things happen around here. 
  I advise our lobbying group on where to invest and when. 
  I smooth things over in communities such as St. 
  Jo's when they give us more resistance than we anticipated. 
  So you're a lobbyist. 
  Some kind of henchwoman who basically sold her soul to work for the Koch Brothers. 
  I got it. 
  Sold my soul? 
  All that? 
  I'm a businesswoman who lobbies on the side of whoever's winning. 
  And right now, that isn't you or St. 
  Jo's. 
  But you and your family have caused us some problems. 
  Frances is our mainline into the St. 
  Jo community. 
  Was. 
  She's going to jail. 
  We'll see. 
  But she clearly underestimated you. 
  I won't make that same mistake. 
  We still got our highway. 
  But you didn't get your councilman. 
  I defeated Jacob Boudreaux. 
  Which is why I called you here. 
  To ask that you cooperate with us. 
  Us? 
  John, please send my father in. 
  It's good to see you, Charley. 
  What on earth? 
  Thanks for your help on Frances. 
  I knew she'd overstep. 
  And her reaction to you confirmed that I made the right decision years ago for keeping Parker away from St. 
  Jo. 
  And it was best to let another woman take on Frances anyway. 
  Appearances and whatnot. 
  [PARKER] 
  As I was saying, I'd appreciate your cooperation as we bring the highway into St. 
  Jo and ready the community for fracking. 
  This is all very cute. 
  But since I was elected to stop the highway, you both know this is a waste of time. 
  Then I will take your land. 
  In fact, the Beckington Group has already sent a letter of intent to condemn and possess the farm belonging to Ralph Angel Bordelon. 
  It'll never happen. 
  You don't know me. 
  And you don't know me. 
  [NOVA] 
  When I interviewed you for my article about Daddy, and we talked about Daddy's depression, you said he would call you sometimes. 
  Yeah, when he was feeling down. 
  Yeah, he'd call late at night. 
  He just wanted a friend to talk to, so we'd walk the cane fields and he'd talk. 
  Would you meet here by the house? 
  Or would you meet somewhere in the fields? 
  Both, I guess. 
  Sometimes here and sometimes out in the field. 
  Okay. 
  What's this about, Nova? 
  You said that sometimes when you would come over, you saw him talking to himself? 
  Yeah, but that wasn't what I don't think he was talking to himself, Mr. 
  Prosper. 
  We think he was, uh talking to our mama. 
  She out there somewhere. 
  Buried on our land. 
  Tru's buried on the land? 
  Was there an area that he liked to walk with you? 
  More than others? 
  Come to think of it, yeah. 
  [TYPING] 
  [NOVA] 
  My father and mother continue to show me what love is. 
  even as they struggled with their sense of self and truth. 
  And in that way, I am their daughter. 
  But it's my mother's journey that gives me what I need in this moment. 
  She is a beacon of truth, as I intend this new enterprise I'm calling "Tru Papers" to be. 
  And this time I start with myself. 
  If my mother could sometimes sacrifice on behalf of others and yet not lose herself, then surely I can, too. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  [NOVA] 
  Bravery is a word assigned to champions of industry and war, to soldiers on the field and battle. 
  But we can reclaim it and assign it to ourselves. 
  To stand up for what's right in this world is brave. 
  To stand up for yourself in this world is braver. 
  To stand up for others before yourself is the bravest thing one can do. 
  For us as Bordelons the test of our bravery comes in the form of a fight for our familial unity and our familial land. 
  We will fight with joy. 
  We will fight with trust and growth. 
  We will fight with power, the power we give ourselves in a world that tells us again and again that we have none. 
  That world is wrong. 
  I join my family and community in nurturing this land for generations to come. 
  Just relax, Blue. 
  [ALL LAUGHING] 
  There you go. 
  Oh!

  - Got it. 
  - Got it. 
  Don't be scared. 
  Next time you'll do it. 
  Well, if I do get scared Papa's breath is in here.

  Our land makes us brave. 
  It upholds our family, our hopes and our fears, our purpose and our passion, our blood and our blessings, our fortitude and our fight. 
  For all of the mistakes that I've made, I have learned the most valuable lesson in my life. 
  My family is by beating heart. 
  I cannot exist without them. 
  I will honor them first and foremost with my every waking breath from this day on, putting them first, learning from their bravery, and growing in my own. 
  Thank you for guiding me, Mama
