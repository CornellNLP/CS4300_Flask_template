 Malcolm, what the hell are you doing? 
  You know very well that your father's things are off-limits! 
  I saw something. 
  I saw a woman. 
  Never speak of her again. 
  Do you hear me? 
  You're hurting me. 
  You have no idea what your father is capable of. 
  And you triggered this memory by purposely inhaling chloroform? 
  It seemed like a good idea at the time. 
  Malcolm. 
  Chloroform is both toxic and volatile. 
  Two extremely underrated qualities. 
  You are suffering, Malcolm. 
  Let me help you. 
  We can do this work. 
  We've done it before. 
  But you have to talk to me. 
  Tell me about my mother. 
  She's a complicated woman. 
  Complicated like she's hard to figure out, or complicated like she has 23 murders on her conscience? 
  I told her about the girl in the box before my father was arrested. 
  She shut me down. 
  She got angry at me, like I'd done something wrong. 
  - But you didn't. 
  - Maybe I did. 
  What if what if she didn't want me to call the cops? 
  If my mother knew what my father was doing, she was complicit, and they would have arrested her, too. 
  Remember, you're taking all of this from a dream. 
  You're starting to sound a bit obsessive. 
  'Cause I am! 
  My parents were the Whitlys, the perfect couple with the world on a string. 
  My mother's dream. 
  What wouldn't she do to protect that? 
  What did she do?! 
  Maybe we should consider a-adjusting your medications. 
  My meds are fine. 
  Malcolm, you cannot walk out of here. 
  You are in crisis. 
  Finally, we agree. 
  Malcolm, please. 
  Thank God. 
  Gil, what do you got? 
  The victim is Tatiana Moore, 23. 
  She was a model and social media influencer. 
  And, no, I don't know what that is, so don't ask me. 
  What is this? 
  Tatiana's assistant found her this morning. 
  Forced entry at the side door. 
  We canvassed the complex. 
  Nobody heard a thing. 
  Building has motion sensors, but - you know, not video. 
  - Celebs like T don't want video. 
  Videos like that end up on TMZ. 
  - TT? 
  - Tatiana's Instagram handle. 
  You were a fan? 
  She was born in Harlem. 
  TT was a homegirl before her career blew up. 
  It just ain't right, man. 
  Doctor? 
  If you're lucky. 
  I mean, hello. 
  Doesn't seem like she was drowned. 
  There'd be signs of a struggle. 
  Agreed. 
  I'll look for water in her lungs and see what else is under the body paint. 
  Killer arranged the scene with an eye for detail. 
  Design, even. 
  Killer didn't design this. 
  Axel X did. 
  - Who? 
  - Clothing designer. 
  This was Axel X's first outdoor campaign and Tatiana's big break. 
  This campaign made her career. 
  They've been together ever since. 
  This is incredible. 
  Everything is arranged exactly the same. 
  The blue skin. 
  The sequins. 
  This crime scene was an act of devotion. 
  They were so devoted to Tatiana, they had to kill her? 
  No, the killer didn't want the real Tatiana. 
  He was after this. 
  Staged. 
  He had to kill her to make it possible. 
  Axel X is outside. 
  Claims he's her boyfriend. 
  All right, Dani, JT, run down Tatiana's friends and family, see if there's any friction there. 
  We'll wrangle the boyfriend. 
  - That's Axel. 
  - Look, Officer, I'm as close to kin as Tatiana got. 
  - I need to get in there. 
  - Sir, you need to calm down. 
  Come on, man, let me see her! 
  Don't they know who I am, huh?! 
  They're cops, Ax, not paparazzi. 
  Hey, Axel? 
  Axel? 
  My name's Lieutenant Arroyo. 
  If you want to help Tatiana, answer a few questions for us, okay? 
  Were you with her last night? 
  - No. 
  We, um - Axel had a gallery opening and then a dinner in Red Hook. 
  TT never showed. 
  And who are you? 
  Hannah Ko, Axel's manager. 
  Joey runs security and Frankie's on media. 
  We got to get ahead of this, Ax. 
  Here's your personal response. 
  Had Tatiana worried about anyone? 
  Family members? 
  - Coworkers? 
  - Tatiana loved her fans. 
  But some loved her back a little bit too much. 
  Made a second career out of filing restraining orders. 
  - She had a stalker? 
  - A few. 
  Yo, why can't I see her, huh?! 
  You don't want to see her like this. 
  No, I need to. 
  I can't just stand here. 
  Look, trust me, Axel The killer used Tatiana's corpse to recreate your first outdoor campaign. 
  The Blue Bath? 
  What are you afraid of, Axel? 
  Uh I'm not. 
  It's just, uh awful, man. 
  "Awful"? 
  That's not how you responded just now. 
  Your body triggered an acute stress response. 
  You got scared. 
  Why? 
  Yo, who is this Tom Ford-wearing cop acting like Axel's a suspect? 
  Mr. 
  Bright is a special consultant. 
  And Axel is a suspect because he's acting suspicious. 
  Hannah, call a lawyer. 
  That's it. 
  No more questions. 
  We're out. 
  What the hell, Bright? 
  You hit Axel like a ton of bricks. 
  He knows more than he's saying. 
  When Axel heard how Tatiana died, he wasn't sad or angry. 
  He was scared. 
  Why? 
  We may never know, because you came in too hot and he lawyered up. 
  Look, if you can't keep your cool on this case I can. 
  I promise. 
  What's going on with you? 
  I need a favor. 
  A favor? 
  After all that? 
  Well, you've got some timing. 
  I need access to The Surgeon's case files. 
  The video interviews from the night he was arrested. 
  All I want to see is my mother's interview. 
  What she said, how she said it. 
  Your mom? 
  What kind of rabbit hole are you going down? 
  NYPD is never going to release those tapes for personal reasons. 
  My hands are tied. 
  Come on, I'll take you home. 
  Damn that bird. 
  Mother. 
  Why am I not surprised? 
  Why did you go back? 
  You knew what seeing your father again would do to you. 
  Part of you had to know. 
  You're not sleeping I have work to do. 
  Your father has agreed to remove you from his visitor list. 
  What? 
  What did you do? 
  Anything to keep my son safe and sane. 
  Ish. 
  You went to see him. 
  He looked annoyingly good. 
  Heaven forbid prison should be an uncomfortable experience for him. 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  Get him out of here. 
  You swore you'd never visit him. 
  You kept that promise for 20 years. 
  Until now. 
  Why? 
  Why are you so hell-bent on keeping me from him? 
  Look in the mirror. 
  You are falling apart with each visit. 
  I need those visits. 
  - For my work. 
  - He needs them more. 
  You're right. 
  He wouldn't give them up without a price. 
  What was it? 
  Why are you interrogating me? 
  Because there's something you don't want me to know. 
  You kept your visits from me, Malcolm. 
  At least I told you the truth. 
  Did you know about the murders? 
  Is that what you're hiding? 
  Why you don't want me to see him? 
  Because you knew? 
  I have endured vicious whispers, baseless accusations, cozy winks from Barbara Walters. 
  I expected it from strangers. 
  Not my son. 
  It took everything I had to walk into that cell Spare me. 
  You knew what he was doing. 
  I told you about the girl in the box. 
  Before I called the police. 
  You were wearing a red dress. 
  You yelled at me made me promise not to speak of it again. 
  Your father's in your head. 
  So are you. 
  Isn't it funny to you? 
  Your father is a serial killer, yet after all these years, I'm still the monster. 
  But I don't care. 
  I don't need you to love me, Malcolm. 
  I just need you alive. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I just need five minutes. 
  What is the point of a visitation list if we're not gonna respect it? 
  Your mother is gonna kill me. 
  Why did you agree to help her? 
  Well, first rule of co-parenting is listening to your partner's needs. 
  Oh, dear. 
  Oh, you feel rejected. 
  Oh, I I should have known. 
  You're a profound narcissist. 
  You have no idea how I'm feeling. 
  I think, Malcolm, I may understand you A bit more than you give me credit for. 
  I mean you do keep coming back. 
  Did she know about your murders? 
  Come again? 
  Did my mother know you were a serial killer before your arrest? 
  Oof Now, that's a big accusation. 
  And it presents a bit of a conundrum. 
  I mean, if I say yes, you won't believe me. 
  If I say no, you'll be relieved. 
  Still, a part of you will remember that I've been accused of being a pathological liar. 
  You tell me, which answer do you want to hear? 
  The truth. 
  Oh, the truth. 
  That takes time. 
  And it can't be shouted through protective glass. 
  Look, y-y-you and your mother need to sort out your issues first. 
  I don't want to get in the middle of that. 
  No, thank you. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Great. 
  Never better. 
  Hmm. 
  So that's a "never better" shaky hand, then? 
  Is that a thing? 
  Gil said no to a favor. 
  Then a small thermonuclear war broke out between my mother and me. 
  And I capped it all off with a visit to my father, which was the icing on the dysfunctional cake. 
  Oh, and I'm a horrible brother. 
  This is Bright. 
  Leave a message. 
  Mom saw Dad? 
  What the hell? 
  Is there some kind of family reunion going on? 
  Is that why you can't pick up the phone? 
  You're out buying matching T-shirts for all of us? 
  Malcolm. 
  Call me. 
  Please. 
  Where are we with Axel? 
  His alibi checks out. 
  He was in Red Hook all night. 
  Killin' it on the Gram. 
  And what's your profile? 
  Sorry. 
  I, uh Axel was right. 
  We're looking for a stalker. 
  Someone driven by a dangerous mix of infatuation and longing. 
  Psychologically, a stalker is like an addict, but instead of a drug, they're addicted to their obsession, usually a celebrity. 
  This is the delivery mechanism. 
  Is this a profile or an intervention for JT? 
  Our killer is an intimacy-seeking stalker with erotomanic delusions. 
  He's obsessed with Tatiana and believed she loved him, too. 
  These are her restraining orders? 
  We pulled all the ones she filed in the last 12 months. 
  32 over seven countries. 
  It's a real stack of freaks. 
  But are any of them killers? 
  Let's work through the pile. 
  Or are we surfing the Internet? 
  Looks like a memorial is springing up near Tatiana's place. 
  And, boss, nobody surfs the Internet anymore. 
  Yo, man, you have your own phone. 
  It's a memorial to their obsession. 
  An intimacy-seeking stalker would not be able to resist the chance to see this. 
  We have to go. 
  Kid, what are you? 
  Keep an eye on him, will you? 
  I will. 
  Dude still has my phone. 
  What exactly are we looking for? 
  Dismiss anyone whose grief is mostly about appearances. 
  Likewise, anyone who came in a group. 
  We're looking for a loner, someone who's doing their best to not be noticed. 
  There's also a decent chance this person may want to document the experience. 
  For themselves. 
  Oh, you weren't just a fan, were you? 
  - You knew her. 
  - Nah, man. 
  Don't turn your creepy profile vision on me. 
  Not personally, but you met her. 
  Growing up? 
  Back home perhaps? 
  Kabul. 
  She was a USO entertainer. 
  They'd fly them in between fighting seasons. 
  It was nice hear some jokes, shake hands with a famous person. 
  I said three words to her. 
  "Thanks for coming. 
  " Her smile kept me going for months, man. 
  We'll find the person that did this. 
  Could you not touch me with your shaky bandage hand? 
  Cool. 
  Check out the loner. 
  Appropriately somber. 
  All kinds of weirdo. 
  Huh. 
  Solid. 
  Good spot. 
  Pretty sure I saw him in Tatiana's freak stack. 
  Excuse me, buddy, uh, you got a second? 
  Hey, yo. 
  Stop, man. 
  NYPD! 
  Yo, hey, come on, man, hey, stop! 
  Whoa. 
  Nice camera. 
  Give it back. 
  I told you to stop; you heard me. 
  It's a public memorial. 
  I have every right to be here. 
  You can't arrest me for that. 
  Yeah. 
  You had to be here. 
  To be part of it. 
  See Tatiana one last time. 
  Ugh, it's locked. 
  That's mine. 
  - B-Be careful with it. 
  - Careful isn't really his thing. 
  Yeah, I have a shaky hand. 
  I got it from my dad. 
  You want me to take it from him? 
  Keep it safe? 
  I mean, I can do that, you know, if you come to the station. 
  All we want to do is talk. 
  Okay. 
  Fine. 
  I'll go. 
  Just get my camera from him, please. 
  Nice work, partner. 
  Let's not call each other that, okay? 
  Why am I here? 
  I have rights. 
  And my camera was undamaged when it came in here. 
  Tell us about Tatiana. 
  Why'd she have all these restraining orders on you? 
  Those were all a misunderstanding. 
  I was just doing my job. 
  I'm a photojournalist. 
  Currently freelancing Do you mind? 
  Oh, is it annoying? 
  Someone taking your photo without your permission? 
  It's, uh, intrusive? 
  Offensive? 
  A-a violation? 
  Yeah, I mean, you stalked Tatiana for a living, called her in the middle of the night, sent obscene photos. 
  Yeah. 
  You proud of all that, Rog? 
  All I wanted was to take her picture. 
  Spend some time together. 
  You cared about her? 
  I loved her. 
  I'd never do something like this; I couldn't. 
  She love you, too? 
  Stop it! 
  Just leave me out of it. 
  - You should talk to Axel. 
  - Axel? 
  What's your beef with Axel? 
  I can't The guy is shady. 
  If you have information about Axel that you're not telling us What do you know, man? 
  You can't say. 
  You can't say because you were stalking Tatiana when you saw something. 
  And if you admitted it, you'd be in violation of your court order. 
  You said you loved her, Roger. 
  You said it like you meant it. 
  I did. 
  Well, when you love someone, you'll do anything for them. 
  Even if it hurts you. 
  That's love. 
  Lawyer. 
  I want to see my lawyer. 
  Roger's not our guy. 
  He's reading more like an incompetent stalker than an intimacy-seeking one. 
  What's the difference? 
  He knows Tatiana didn't love him back. 
  There was no erotomanic delusion. 
  Makes sense. 
  I smell formalin. 
  Is that Edrisa's report? 
  May I? 
  Knock yourself out. 
  Tatiana was killed by strangulation, but there were no signs at the scene. 
  Her colored contact lenses masked the petechial hemorrhaging, and the body paint masked the bruising. 
  Check out the direction of those marks on her neck. 
  Perpetrator was facing Tatiana when he strangled her. 
  But she had minimal defense wounds. 
  There's no way Roger could have pulled this off without a fight. 
  But Axel could. 
  He was out all night with an alibi. 
  And he doesn't fit your profile; he isn't a stalker. 
  But he is hiding something. 
  And so is Roger. 
  It's not enough to hold him. 
  JT's not gonna like it when I cut him loose. 
  You could tell him your hands are tied. 
  Go home, Bright. 
  You need some sleep. 
  I need to see those Surgeon case files. 
  Bright, I was there on the night. 
  I can tell you. 
  Your mother didn't know. 
  - You got to believe me. 
  - I do. 
  But I don't trust her. 
  You were wearing a red dress. 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  Martin. 
  Martin. 
  It has to stop. 
  This will destroy us. 
  Sweetheart, you don't understand. 
  I don't want to understand. 
  I have heard enough. 
  I have seen enough. 
  It is time for you to understand that this has to stop. 
  Before you ruin us. 
  Don't you think I would stop all this if I could? 
  Don't you think I want to be the perfect man, the perfect husband? 
  You're a monster. 
  Jessica. 
  Well, you may be right. 
  But nobody has to know that. 
  We can still keep our life, Jess. 
  Our perfect family. 
  We don't have to throw it all away. 
  But I don't get to make that decision. 
  You do. 
  - Hello, Roger. 
  - What the hell?! 
  Cops can't s-sneak up on people like that. 
  Funny story. 
  Technically, I'm a consultant. 
  Well, at least until my boss fires me, which, at this point, seems inevitable. 
  I need you to tell me everything you know about Axel. 
  You know I can't do that. 
  The police won't press charges as long as you tell the truth. 
  You stole my camera. 
  You manipulated me. 
  Maybe I'm a freak to you, but I cared about Tatiana. 
  Screw you. 
  You're right. 
  I can see that now. 
  You would never hurt her. 
  But I-I have to show you something. 
  - A picture. 
  - What picture? 
  The killer was facing Tatiana when he crushed her esophagus. 
  That forced her eyes open. 
  She had to look at him while he strangled her to death. 
  Who did this, Roger? 
  Who killed her? 
  I know what you're trying to do. 
  It's not going to work. 
  And you can rot in hell. 
  Gil. 
  I tried the photo. 
  Roger still won't talk. 
  Roger? 
  Roger! 
  Oh, my God. 
  Gil, I need an ambulance. 
  The corner of 52nd and 11th. 
  Roger's been hit by a car. 
  Coming through! 
  Clear the hall! 
  Coming through! 
  Corner! 
  All right, what do we have here? 
  Hit-and-run. 
  Possible dislocated shoulder, couple of broken ribs, but vitals are within range. 
  - Is he gonna be okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  He got lucky. 
  Mind if I go talk to him? 
  Sure. 
  Roger. 
  Roger, can you hear me? 
  - Look, will you just - Hey. 
  - Ow! 
  - Stay with me, man. 
  What are you talking about? 
  They're prepping the OR right now. 
  They can't they can't stop the bleeding. 
  Not with the broken rib piercing your stomach. 
  What does that mean? 
  You're gonna die, Roger. 
  Oh. 
  No, I can't die. 
  I got a cat. 
  There's only one thing you can do. 
  What? 
  Do right by Tatiana. 
  You loved her, and she did not deserve this. 
  No, she didn't. 
  So tell me who did this. 
  What do you know? 
  I need to know the truth. 
  Tatiana was leaving Axel for another fashion line. 
  It wasn't public yet, but last week Axel flipped out on her. 
  He hit her. 
  The SD card is in my inside jacket pocket. 
  Please take it. 
  Please. 
  Hang in there, Rog. 
  Wait. 
  Watch my cat. 
  Sure thing. 
  - Luisa. 
  - Uh, nope. 
  Just your daughter that you've been avoiding like the plague, which, judging by the looks of this place, you might actually have. 
  What's going on? 
  We had a fight. 
  A truly epic fight. 
  You should have never gone to see him. 
  No, not your father. 
  Your brother and I. 
  We had a real knock-down-drag-out. 
  This is about Malcolm. 
  Course it is. 
  It was biblical. 
  Shakespearean. 
  Someday Lin-Manuel Miranda will rap about it. 
  You're spiraling. 
  Both of you. 
  All because of Dad. 
  You know, I'm starting to think I'm the only one in this family who could actually handle visiting him. 
  You don't mean that. 
  Don't I? 
  I'm the only one without any baggage, and he could actually help me. 
  Do you have any idea what a Martin Whitly exclusive would do for my career? 
  Give me my drink back. 
  Thanks to both of you, he doesn't even know I exist. 
  He knows all about you. 
  Watches you every day. 
  His daughter, the ace reporter. 
  Martin Whitly is your biggest fan. 
  He is? 
  Can we please talk about something else? 
  I am sick of me. 
  Let's talk about you. 
  No. 
  Uh I don't think I can. 
  Goodbye. 
 
 
 
  Hospital says Roger is in stable condition, no matter what Bright says. 
  19th Precinct is investigating the hit-and-run. 
  No plates on the vehicle. 
  Checking security and traffic cams could take a while. 
  Tatiana and Axel got into it a few days ago. 
  Roger got the play-by-play. 
  That's no way to treat a lady. 
  That could be pretty damning for Axel. 
  What about this? 
  Aren't we still looking for a stalker who knew how important the Blue Bath campaign was to Tatiana? 
  And Axel. 
  Made him, too. 
  You're right. 
  I am? 
  This killer isn't obsessed with Tatiana. 
  They're obsessed with Axel. 
  We're looking for Axel's stalker? 
  Yes. 
  Killing the ex who broke his heart. 
  Running down the photographer who knew too much. 
  This killer is trying to please Axel. 
  Makes sense. 
  Jackie and I used to have this cat who'd leave dead mice on our doorstep every morning, like she was leaving us gifts. 
  Yes. 
  The perfect metaphor. 
  And one creepy-ass cat. 
  This killer wants credit, like Gil's cat. 
  These murders are gifts. 
  That's why the Blue Bath scared Axel. 
  He knows who the killer is. 
  How can you be so sure? 
  Oh, my love. 
  You have no idea what your father is capable of. 
  Family always knows. 
  It's someone from his entourage. 
  We got a problem. 
  Axel's having a launch party for his new line tonight and then hops on a plane to Europe. 
  Probably with his whole crew. 
  - Then let's go to the party. 
  - Hold on, Bright. 
  We can't just go in there and flash badges. 
  They don't have to answer our questions. 
  We have to have a warrant. 
  - There's not enough time, boss. 
  - I just need five minutes with Axel alone. 
  Stalker psychology causes compulsive behavior. 
  Hard to resist, nearly impossible to hide. 
  I can do this. 
  Bright, we're cops, and we do it the right way or not at all. 
  Nobody goes near that event, especially you. 
  Gimme, gimme what I want What I deserve, gimme Gimme it Gimme, gimme what I want What I deserve, gimme, gimme it Hey, baby, I miss you. 
  Let's talk all about That thing you do Hey, Ains. 
  Sorry. 
  I've been In an epic flame war with Mom. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  God, listen, I don't know what she's told you, but Bro, for once, I don't want to get in between you guys. 
  I want to talk about Dad. 
  - Does he really watch my reports? 
  - Yeah. 
  He's been, uh, tracking all the murders in the city. 
  He wants us to team up. 
  So he's watching me for you. 
  No, I didn't say that. 
  The Surgeon's a perfectionist. 
  He wouldn't be watching you unless you were the best reporter in town. 
  Why are you asking? 
  I think I'm gonna interview him. 
  That's a truly terrible idea. 
  It's really not. 
  They've been kicking back all of my pitches at work, and this would really get me in the inner circle. 
  At what expense? 
  So you don't think I should do it? 
  Yo, who is this, acting like Axel's a suspect? 
  Ainsley, sorry. 
  I got to go. 
  I got an after-hours thing. 
  What? 
  Hey, Axel. 
  Uh excuse me. 
  Hey, hey, what are you doing here? 
  There's been another attack. 
  You have a stalker. 
  One who's willing to kill. 
  I've got a stalker? 
  Yes. 
  And if we don't leave, you might be the next victim. 
  All right, come with me. 
  You know, man, you're not exactly acting like a cop. 
  - What is this? 
  - The police knew that Tatiana was leaving the company and you. 
  You lied to them about your relationship. 
  They have pictures of you two fighting. 
  Nasty stuff. 
  Looks bad. 
  I couldn't hurt her. 
  - I loved her. 
  - Axel, the person who murdered Tatiana cannot separate their feelings from yours. 
  He killed her to protect you. 
  To protect me? 
  You don't know what you're talking about, man. 
  - You know who it is. 
  - No, I don't! 
  They're in your inner circle. 
  You knew they were dangerous, but you didn't realize how far they'd go. 
  Then you saw the Blue Bath, and you knew. 
  - That scared you. 
  - My girlfriend was murdered. 
  Who is it? 
  Hannah? 
  Joey? 
  Frankie? 
  You're talking about my family. 
  I understand that. 
  More than you know. 
  But what happens next time? 
  What are you gonna do then? 
  Continue to protect them? 
  Lie for them? 
  They're family, right? 
  You can still be scared of family. 
  He knows my every move. 
  It's Joey. 
  We can't stay here. 
  - I can call for help - Ax. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah, I'm cool. 
  I'm cool, too. 
  Super cool. 
  Ax, why don't you go back up to the party. 
  We're gonna take a walk. 
  You can't leave, Axel. 
  Leaving me here is the same as doing it. 
  You're complicit. 
  How are you gonna face your family? 
  How are you gonna live with what you've done? 
  Oh, my love. 
  Malcolm. 
  Axel's got nothing to worry about. 
  'Cause you take care of his problems? 
  Like Tatiana? 
  Yeah. 
  I took care of that. 
  Just like I'm gonna take care of you. 
  Now move. 
  What are you doing? 
  All stalkers, every subtype they all have one thing in common. 
  They can't stand to lose track of their obsession. 
  I made a bet. 
  I told them I could lure you out within five minutes. 
  It took six. 
  Them? 
  Yeah, you know. 
  Them. 
  You're under arrest! 
  Put the gun down now! 
  We got Axel inside. 
  TT deserved so much better than the two of you, and I'm gonna make sure you get what you deserve. 
  You're both going away for a long time. 
  That was impressive. 
  For a second there, I thought you were really scared. 
  Trust beats fear. 
  I knew you were coming. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Whoa! 
  Your hands are cold. 
  Why are your hands so cold? 
  Okay, tough guy. 
  Love what you've done with the place. 
  Very cozy. 
  - Whiskey, rocks? 
  - Thanks. 
  D. A. called. 
  He's pressing charges against Joey and Axel. 
  You were right. 
  Axel helped orchestrate a cover-up for his old friend. 
  But you didn't come here to tell me something I could have read in the report. 
  Right again. 
  So, why don't you tell me why I'm here, Sherlock Freud? 
  Well you know I've been off my game, you know I've been seeing my father, and you know about my mother's new role in my nightmares. 
  Damn, you are a good profiler. 
  Guess I can't fire you. 
  You want to? 
  Not usually, no. 
  Lately, though. 
  I need to know the truth, Gil. 
  If my mother if she knew. 
  I have to see that tape. 
  Sure you want to see this? 
  You certain you didn't know anything, - Mrs. 
  Whitly? 
  - No, I did not. 
  How is that possible? 
  Your husband killed 23 people. 
  You've been married for years. 
  This is the guy who was next to you in bed. 
  I said I didn't know. 
  How many times do I have to say it? 
  How many bodies do I have to look at? 
  Where is my lawyer? 
  He should be here by now. 
  I'll go check. 
  Stay here. 
  You've been here a while. 
  Can I get you anything? 
  Water? 
  Some tea? 
  Got anything stronger? 
  Sadly, no. 
  You're the officer that arrested Martin. 
  You spoke with my son. 
  Did did he say anything? 
  Not much. 
  But he's a good kid. 
  I'd be happy to talk with him again if you want. 
  What's in this pile, it's all too horrible to even And I knew. 
  I kn-knew. 
  Mrs. 
  Whitly. 
  You asked for a lawyer. 
  That's your right. 
  I am telling you that I kn-knew. 
  These last few months, I knew that something was wrong. 
  He was gone at odd hours. 
  He was making excuses. 
  He sometimes he reeked of discount perfume. 
  But I thought I thought it was another woman. 
  I thought he was having an affair. 
  I couldn't see. 
  I Oh, I could never have imagined that he was killing people. 
  Maybe it's the shame or the fear, but I should have known. 
  I let him get away with this. 
  I enabled him. 
  God! 
  Think about how many people I could have saved you know, if I could if I had just Mrs. 
  Whitly. 
  Do you know how many lives you're responsible for? 
  Two. 
  And they're waiting at home for you right now. 
  Do you think they're okay? 
  They will be. 
  With your help. 
  Good evening, Mother. 
  Malcolm, what are you doing here? 
  You mean, the last place on earth I'd look for you? 
  At a homeless shelter? 
  Why are you here? 
  I'm just checking in on a renovation I'm funding. 
  Anonymously, of course. 
  Who would trust the Dr. 
  and Mrs. 
  Whitly Women's Shelter? 
  You know, if you let your children know how much real charity work you do, they wouldn't go around accusing you of being complicit to murder all the time. 
  Now, I was taught that when a mother truly shows her heart, her children will immediately rip it out. 
  Case in point. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm sorry, too. 
  I was drunk, Malcolm. 
  Toward the end, before they took your father, it was a dark time. 
  If you asked for my help I had no idea how bad it really was. 
  But you made it better. 
  I know that now. 
  How much you did for us. 
  How hard it must have been. 
  Thank you. 
  What I can't stand is knowing that he is chained to a wall and happy while we are out here miserable. 
  We let him get between us. 
  Let's not do that again. 
  Malcolm, you really should respect your mother's Ainsley? 
  Dr. 
  Whitly. 
  It's been a long time. 
  It has. 
  But please call me Dad.
