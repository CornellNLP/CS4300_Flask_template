      "CHEAP pizza and lots of it. Order a slice and you get a full third of a pizza for under $3 if I remember correctly. It's not the most orgasmic pizza you'll ever have, but it's good and the price makes it even better! There's not much atmosphere and the seating upstairs gets a little stuffy sometimes. If it's nice out, take your pizza down the street and around the corner to the plaza at 100 Summer and enjoy!\n",
      "Five stars for LOTS of food!  Their \"small\" subs are about 10\", and their large subs is exactly 20\".  (Quality is not bad at all, and they don't cost more than usual.)\n",

      "Restaurant: Floramo's Deli\n",
      "Huge, flavorful grilled chicken kebab, over a pile of rice pilaf, and with a large side salad. Cost? $6.50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Order this and be happy. :-)\n",
      "I just returned from Floramo's Deli and I've gotta tell ya... my stomach is revolting. So why two stars? Here's the deal...\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are in need of comfort food, but would rather not resort to the pasta route, then Floramo's is a good place to check out. I've been there a couple times, always on overcast, though not rainy, days, to get some sort of poultry with salad and rice pilaf (that's a funny word). Up until today, I'd only had their chicken, which I think is really dry and kind of stringy. Today I got turkey tips, a pleasant change, but still a little dry. Not as stringy, so that's cool. The rice and salad mix is pretty incredible. But as far as the meat goes? If you can do without, then just get rice and salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always feel kind of crummy after I eat there. It's not like I'm rushing to the bathroom or anything, but I just feel like I weigh a lot more than I do. That's not really fun. I'm insecure enough as it is, I don't need a deli making me feel worse about myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing about Floramo's is that it's not the most welcoming atmosphere. It's really dark with a cafeteria style set up, and the people behind the counter totally rush you. They don't seem to enjoy it very much when you wait around and stare at the menu. No, it's much better to stay on their good side, order quickly and pay up. You don't want to mess with these people, or so it seems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink selection? Weak. I didn't realize this was so important to me until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to sum up, Floramo's is totally fine is you're already feeling bloated and just need some comfort food sans dry poultry. The rice is delicious, the dressing is good, but it's nothing you can't make at home where it's cozier, cheaper and where you can eat in your pajamas without being judged.\n",

      "Delicious Cold Brew. Super smooth coffee. I had been walking around Boston all day, over 30k steps and counting. Busy day, right?!? I needed my coffee fix, and was told that this would be a great place to grab coffee. My friend who was giving me the tour doesn't drink coffee, but swore that it's a very popular joint and heard it's good coffee. I had him try my black coffee, and he enjoyed it as well. Didn't get a chance to check out their pastries. I had already planned to walk down the street to grab a donut. I know, I'm a fatty. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place has a very old, vintage, hipster feel. It's quite dark inside and a bit stuffy actually. It was busy inside and a lot of people were in there reading and using their laptops. It's very difficult to escape the heat and humidity. On this particular day it was raining, so people were inside hiding from that.\n",

      "I've been here before as I live close by, and have been here to play pool, eat, and try their breakfast buffet. Generally, I think the food is decent, drinks are very reasonably priced, but the breakfast buffet is lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point in time, I wouldn't be able to recommend the breakfast buffet to friend/family, as I've had better at other local businesses. It seemed like they had a random assortment/selection, we did not have the best service (the staff was friendly enough, but it wasn't busy and we had to track down someone to give us utensils and to take our drink order).\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost seemed reasonably priced, it was ~$23 for me and my boyfriend so I think it was a good value, but I'd rather pay more for better selection.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We had been ordering from this place for a number of weeks and the experience has been either nice/accommodating or just plain rude. There's a gentleman that gets our orders every time we're able order successfully (60% of the time). He's great when he's there, but everyone else couldn't be bothered to be decent over the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "We always call in advance (very politely, mind you) to check whether they have delivery that night, and until what time. Tonight I was told yes, so I called back before deadline and the lady just said, \"No delivery! Sorry I don't understand you!\" and hung up. I called back to speak with a manager. She said, \"No manager!\" and hung up again.\n",

      "\n",
      "But here's the secret.  After 3 pm, it's suddenly half price.  So it's an amazing deal.  Shhhhh, don't tell.\n",
      "I had been avoiding this place because of the lukewarm reviews here. But I work a block away and I love sushi like a sickness. And I think my daily diet of Al's is making me tubby. So I tried it. The sushi is of supermarket quality and was inoffensive until the last piece of salmon, which I had to spit out due to chewiness. Good thing my officemate was out of the room. Its main attribute is that each piece of fish sits on a massive mountain of rice, as Jane's charges by weight. Not very good rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's other marketing tactic pertains to the hand's inability to divine a pound. My (I thought) fairly restrained selection of several pieces of sushi, a small salad with tofu and one pork dumpling came to $9. At $5.24 a pound, that's 1.7 pounds of food. Not so healthy after all. It's okay though because I didn't eat it all. The salad was bitter and the dumpling gross and chewy. I'm switching back to Al's. Really, how fattening could prosciutto and mozzarella be?\n",

      "Never been to a restaurant as bad as this one... The menu is very small and the restaurant is blasting music to the point, I cannot hear the person who is next to me. I encourage you to go elsewhere if you planned on taking your family or your significant other to dine here/grab drinks. It looked like the other 2 tables were just people who randomly found the spot since everywhere else was packed on a saturday night and were just too drunk to even care. \n",

      "Location: 5 Stars (Fenway is always a great area)\n",
      "Food: 1 Star (Korean Sausages tasted like plastic)\n",

      "\n",
      "Sorry for the no pictures, however did not think it was worth it for a place like this.\n",
      "I cannot say enough terrible things about Jyuba. I came here for a friend's birthday party and the management could not have been ruder. It was clear we were not wanted there, despite the bar/restaurant being empty. The food and drinks were so/so. One of the people in our party was charged an extra $2 for getting water in his scotch. Read your receipt before you sign!!! My friend pre-paid for drink tickets and then the staff tried to tell people they couldn't order drinks that had previously been paid for by the party host. The manager then had the nerve to call the host cheap after reneging on their deal. Tables with drinks and appetizers were never once bussed in four hours. The worst was the DJ. House music was played endlessly, despite the requests of at least five or six people. At one point I asked if they could play different music and I was rudely told by management they would not change the music. Our group were the only ones at the bar! The rest of the patrons were dining at the tables, and I'm sure they wouldn't want to eat with house music blasting away. Despite this restaurant being a new business they did not seem to care about their patrons, nor get return visitors. This is not a good way to start your business. Despite bringing in forty paying guests, the party host was treated terribly. I do not plan on coming back, nor would I recommend it to anybody.\n",

      "My top pick for late night eats in Boston.\n",

      "I wasn't prepared for the latter, so ended up choosing the \"Metabolic Conditioner\" with blue corn tortilla shells and cabbage and lettuce and then cajun shrimp added. Tasty. I don't know if it conditioned my metabolism, but I enjoyed it.\n",
      "Love this place! Where do I begin? Was in town visiting and my friend recommended this place. First impressions when I walk in is how spacious and clean it is! Ample seating and great signage everywhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "This California girl was excited to see all the yummy healthy options. It took me 30 mins to figure out what I want. I ended up getting the energy toast. Fig Jam yogurt with sweet potatoes?? I had to try this combo. Love the display as they packed it in on a thick piece of toast  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also had the matcha tea. Normally I just get the tea or whatever/however they make the tea. But this place asked me if I wanted some milk then proceeded with all the milk options (soy, almond, OAT, whole milk, 2% etc..) so great. \n",
      "\n",
      "When my friend came I also had the metabolic conditioner. This sounded good but slightly disappointed with the flavor. Also it was pouring rain outside so I think I was hoping there would have been some warm ingredients to it like the tortilla but still good. I think I'd want to try something else next time. \n",

Last night my boyfriend and I were eating there and they were short staffed and apparently the chef had just started. Our waitress was fantastic and attentive and so welcoming but had the unfortunate task of informing guests of several menu items that they had run out of and encouraging patience since wait times for food were longer than usual. This was no problem as we had plenty of wine and we were in no rush. Then the owner, Robert Ciampi, made a loud entrance and started yelling at the waitress and making a scene. He then continued outside the front of the restaurant and had an altercation with two other men. It was an uncomfortable situation as his conduct was so unprofessional, disrespectful, and the waitress was clearly afraid of him. I can't condone this type of behavior by scumbag assholes who manipulate and intimidate women and employees. Shame on you ROBERT CIAMPI!!\n",

We started each day with an incredible breakfast and then a better dinner at this FANTASTIC restaurant. The staff are very friendly and welcoming.

Dunkin has dried sugary donuts; Krispy had gooey warm ones. AHHH! WHY IS THERE NO KRISPY KREME IN ALL OF MASSACHUSSETTS??? why do rich people not appreciate such things? They will eat a 1000 calorie dessert at max brenners, but rail against the sugar in a small donut. GOSH\n",
      "Krispy Kreme doughnuts are like pastries coated in crack - they are that sinfully good! Seriously, I'm surprised that more people haven't reviewed this place because their doughtnuts are unbelievably good. Melt-in-your-mouth, mini-orgasm good... mmmm!!\n",

      "I really liked this place--but they were forced to close do to corporate bullying. It seems the owners husband owns 3 Dunkin Donuts franchises in Boston, and Dunkins sued them over \"lost business\". Anyone that lives in this area of Brighton knows the closest DD is down Washington St in Brighton Center, so the lost business in BS. There is a new place opening in its place, called the Happy Owl. I hope they do well!\n",
      "I had high hopes for Cafe 57 & Grill; I walked by many times as it was undergoing renovations.  Now that it's open, I'm pleased to say that Brighton Center can lay claim to a well-priced, relatively healthy, delicious place to eat.  I've stopped in a few times now and continue to be impressed.  \n",

      "The Area 14 ($6.50) is a solid take on the classic Italian sub (I love it when I can enjoy prosciutto and salami on the same sandwich), and it goes without saying that that the grilled cheese and bacon panini ($5.95) is ridiculously awesome.  The souvlaki spears and hand-cut fries are also quite tasty and well-seasoned. Cafe 57 & Grill is quickly becoming a regular part of my neighborhood routine.\n",

The other day, I had a chicken breast sandwich on foccacia, with pepperjack cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and roasted red peppers, with a side of pickles. Pretty stinkin' delish, if I say so myself. Today, I opted for lighter fare, and went with my usual spicy tuna roll... at $5.20 (plus tax), it's not a bad deal AT ALL. \n",

Whether you have the beef, chicken or plantain empanadas, you will give to you a real pleasure. Crispy, warm, with the inside (beef, or chicken) soft, well prepared and cooked. I don't know exactly how to write about it, because it is hard, for me, to describe the flavors and texture of the empanadas at La Sultana Bakery. Totally recommend it, you won't be disappointed.

The coffee is FANTASTIC and the do-it-yourself fixit bar has different types of milk, syrups and sugars. Kind of bugs me that the iced coffee is so much more $, but hey, ice is costly right? Ok, maybe not, but I want to love my Greenlight. They have Diet Coke and yogurt and fruit to make my afternoon better. And friendly staff to make me smile.\n",

I'm grumpy and hungry and pissed off and completely regretting my choice to order from you instead of Ghazal.\n",

Five minutes- ten if traffic is bad.  And then, when we call to ask where our food is they give us attitude.  No thanks.  And let's not even get started on the credit-card-debacle-of-december-2009.  You do not show up at the door, two hours after we called, and claim that the credit card didn't work and that you need cash.  You. Just. Don't.  It's sketchy and unprofessional.  And, by the way, the credit card works just fine, I'm guessing if it took you two hours to deliver a couple of boxes of food god knows how hard it is for you to operate a credit card machine.\n",

      "How in the holy hell have I never gone here?  It's maybe two and a half block from my house and today is the first time I've checked it out and it's so good!  I would recommend it highly, and they DO deliver.  It's a flat rate charge to deliver within a mile (it's like $2) or if it's further there are added charges, but not by too much.  I would say very well worth it if you want awesome Jamaican food and don't want to walk around in Dudley.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went in and the staff working the counter was mainly teenagers, but very pleasant ones (they DO exist, but are a rare occurrence, particularly in the Dudley area) and they were very accommodating.  They have the menu on the board, and also have menus to take, and they have a very wide array of options, spanning from vegan/veggie to all sorts of tripe and oxtail and goat.  I went with the Jerk Chicken dinner, which came with rice and beans and plantains, and also a patty with bread and cheese.  Why is it called a patty with bread and cheese instead of a patty sandwich?  I would have given a crap, but I was too busy enjoying whatever it was called.  The patty was moist and delicious and the bread was fresh and tasty.  The dinner itself was really good.  The rice and beans were clearly fresh and moist and delicious, plantains, cabbage with carrots and onions and spices, and then three big chunks of jerk chicken.  The chicken was perfectly tender and amazingly spicy and peppery.  It was honestly the best food in this area I have gotten for takeout in the Dudley area, and I have leftovers for tomorrow!\n",
      "\n",
      "One other awesome thing about this place?  There's an ice cream parlor.  I didn't go for ice cream, but I definitely would.  And did I mention they have vegan options for ice cream treats!  It also appears that they do a lot of baking (I know it's a Jamaican restaurant, but not THAT kind) on the premises, and they have some awesome looking cupcakes, red velvet cake, and pineapple upside down cake in the case.  It looked heavenly.\n",

You may have to use their brand name, \"vodka tonic,\" but you will quickly see that what you get is their signature lemony-flavored soda, with no discernable vodka in it. They sure do know how to enjoy a good joke at the customer's expense. Fun for all.\n",
      "I guess Eurotrash need a restaurant too.  OK, I've been to 33 three times.  The reason they get stars is certainly the food.  Overall, the food I've had there is really quite good.  And, I like that much of the restaurant changes color with funky built in lights.  If you can eat outside, its quieter, and overall nicer.  But something about this place bugs me.  First off, the do try to hard, as someone else mentioned.  At first the service seems great, but the more time goes by, the more you notice.  The waitstaff is made up of some normal girls who just need a boost to their sense of humor, and a hell of a lot of creepy guys.  Just weird, and kinda cold.  It strikes you because its pretty wide spread.  Then you have the music, which is too loud (and i love loud music), all over the place too loud.  Plus, its this sad Buddha Bar style techno, which anyone who knows better, well, knows better.  Worthless.  And then there is the overall pretense.  So much eurotrash clubber folks trying to look so cool and hip, yet they all remind you of high school.  This is staff and clientele.  As for the overall decor, its pretty cool, but there seems to be no upkeep.  Downstairs and in the bathrooms there's trash all over the place, and it doesn't seem they clean too often.  Its the little things, like a broken wine glass or a pit in the olive tappenade (which was, however, quite yummy).  A bit here or there is one thing, but there are just so many little things that add up, it makes for a nonplussed frequent diner, myself.  I'll probably not go back there, unless i feel the need to look at sluts in short skirts.  Nice try, 33, but it just ain't cuttin it.\n",

The lychee green tea was so good, but the other 3 drinks were lacking in favor and texture. The brown sugar milk tasted like moch latte. The preach just didn't go well with the milk . It's pricy, probably won't be back. There so much more options in Chinatown\n",

They use all fresh and natural ingredients. And even their cup design is high quality and creative, kind of reminds of hey tea in China. \n",
      "\n",

They seemingly like working there and enjoying having you there.  They are also very helpful in food choices.  The atmosphere is great for couples or small groups.

Not much else to say. I wouldn't come here if it was out of my way, but it's a good choice when already here\n",
      "I am so glad to see this place open again. It used to be located over on beacon hill. This place has fed me on many nights while at Suffolk. It is now located right accross the street Boston Medical Center. I ordered a quick slice of the rotating daily pizza special. The slices are big, almost a quarter of a pizza. Just as good as I remembered. The slice I ordered had quality chorizo on it and it hit the spot.  It looks like you can order food to go or there it a cute little area where you can sit to have a casual bite. I am excited to see the menu has expanded to include quite a few pasta dishes.

      "They must've done their homework that's why. Kenmore has ESK getting great business every day but very little else other than burgers, bagels and burritos.

      "So yes, on a Friday lunchtime they were doing great business from the BU-clad Jersey Girls with their Uggs and LV bags. They should thrive here. And why not? It's actually far more bearable than the Harvard location as here they are content to just be cafe that serves good food, and not try to be a million other things either. The decor is neat and bright and the big windows make it an appealing spot.\n",

I wasn't sure what I wanted to make--they have their fair share of frozen-ready to cook Lobster Ravioli, Spinach & Ricotta Raviolis, Butternut Squash--Pumpkin--but I decided I wanted something a little more ...classic and went for the Lasagna. Fortunately for me, they had no-boil lasagna and I quickly started trying to find ricottacheese. One of the workers saw me with the lasagna and recommended another kind for me saying that it was much better & came with more lasagna sheets. I was happy he said something since I wouldn't know better. Then he said--will you be needed meat sauce for that--It was raining outside and after thinking about spending an evening browning meat and chopping onions, I thought, what the hey--they probably know better than me anyway.\n",

All of that on a seeded roll. The bread is fresh, the meat is salty, the sun dried tomatoes add a bit of tang, while the oil and vinegar join the party to enrich the bread and tie it all together\n",
      "\n",
      "What I really love about this place is how fresh everything is. Really fresh. I ordered a sandwich the other day and requested salami. There was nothing sliced at that moment so he went and sliced some for me. Additionally, their mozzarella are little balls that they slice for you. \n",

I was very excited to find another location opening up near my office, and I've been going here about once a week for lunch since then.

A lot of restaurants probably do that, esp. during RW when they are serving so many, and I just never knew. It didn't stop me from ordering the steak anyway.  \n",
      "We were seated at a nice table by a window and it was easy to forget we were dining in a hotel restaurant. I know hotel bars/restaurants are all the rage, but I'm not really sure how I feel about them. I sometimes think they don't try as hard because they have a captive audience and can coast on their reputation even if they suck. Not the case here. \n",
      "The wine list was very reasonable and we had an amazing Malbec. For the starter, 3 of us had the chicken enchiladas. The portion was enormous. Seriously, after eating the warm bread and the 2 chicken enchilada appetizer, I had no business eating anything else (but that didn't stop me). They were perfectly spiced and the black bean sauce was perfect.  (The 4th had a roasted beet salad that she said was equally good).\n",
      "For an entree, 3 of us had the skirt steak with a gorgonzola cream and balsamic onions served with a tomato bread salad. The meat was very good and cooked perfectly, but my piece had a really thick, sinewy tendon or something running through the middle (sorry vegetarians) so I had to eat around it. The 4th had roasted chicken which she enjoyed.  \n",
      "I was thrilled with dessert! Two of had the chocolate torte with a little scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Some would say it was \"too rich\" but that's exactly how I like it! Two others had the strawberry shortcake. They thought the shortcake a bit dry but I tried it and didn't really think so. \n",
      "All in all, a great meal. My faith in Restaurant Week may have been restored, thanks to Bonfire!\n",
      "My bf and I walked in to Bonfire without reservations and were seated promptly at a table very close to the bar.  I noticed that there were plenty of tables in the actual dining room but they chose to seat us across from the bar for some reason. We were so close to the next table that I thought I could practically sit on our neighbor's lap. I'm sure they felt the same.\n",

      "The food: I had a kobe burger--I've always wanted to try one. It was 1 POUND of Burger and a plateful of Parmesan french fries.  I ate 1/4 of the burger and took the rest home. I tried to eat as much as I could but I still didn't leave a dent in the french fries--so that also came home with me.  I ordered a glass of sangria and ended up having to send it back because it was just tooo sweet.  My bf had the steak tacos and he raved about them.  After having the leftovers the next day, my bf and I both had really bad stomach aches.  All in all, I thought the meal was ok but it could have been better, primarily because of where we were seated and what the food did to our stomachs.  Now I can say that i've had a kobe beef burger and No Merci the next time.\n",

      "For the car dealership visit, I brought my good friend Larry H. with me.  Larry H. is like a Honda and Toyota encyclopedia on every car so any question I had, he could honestly answer during the test drive.  I moved on to more pressing questions with our car salesperson as we were test driving around the city.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Forget about questions on leather interior, gas mileage, or pricing information, to the car salesman I asked my most pressing question, \"So where can we get a good meal around here?\"  The salesperson, a good guy and also a foodie like myself, recommended two Indian places Punjab Palace and Dawat Fine Indian Cuisine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was tempted to try both Indian restaurants.  Part of me thought while I was test driving two cars, why not take it a step further and test drive two Indian restaurants?  However, I thought better of it especially since I've been trying to get back in shape recently.  Of the two places, the car salesman preferred the buffet at Dawat Fine Indian Cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawat Fine Indian Cuisine did not disappoint.  There are plenty of seats for larger groups, and I would highly recommend the lunch buffet.  The lunch buffet was a reasonable $10 and change, and came with a complimentary dosa, almost like a very thin crepe stuffed with seasoned potatoes, which I thought was a nice touch.  This is a great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  My favorite vegetarian dish was the saag paneer, absolutely delicious and flavorful.  On the meat side of things both the chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala were really tasty.  Everything I had on the buffet was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often in a buffet, you sacrifice quality for quantity, but that was not the case at Dawat Fine Indian Cuisine.  Dawat Fine Indian Cuisine has only been open for a few months, and I would highly recommend giving the lunch buffet a try.\n",

      "Stir provides an intimate private dining experience for up to 9 people, set in their kitchen with bookshelves full of cookbooks and a single bathroom. The chef and wine sommelier are the only staff present throughout your meal, explaining each course and wine pairing to every detail. The location is set directly next to the Butcher Shop and across the street from B&G Oysters, completing the ultimate Barbara Lynch triad in the South End.\n",

      "RESERVATIONS:\n",
      "Look up their class schedule online and e-mail reservations@stirboston.com to reserve a class. The classes fill up so quickly that I ended up signing up for waitlist spots and got multiple openings last-minute. I would suggest looking into classes a month in advance! \n",

      "Before coming in, I thought it would be an interactive cooking class where we would help prepare the meal, but in reality the chef just cooks in front of you and shares techniques from a specific cookbook. They will lay out some of the prep work required, and share tips on how to cook the course. Our wine sommelier shared each wine's origin, flavor profile, and ideal food pairings. In total, we had 5 courses with 5 different wines from Michael Psilakis' \"How to Roast a Lamb: New Greek Classic Cooking.\" At the end of the meal, we received this cookbook! We can now attempt to duplicate this amazing experience at home. This was the most unique dining experience to date, and my boyfriend and I agree that Stir tops Barbara Lynch's restaurants.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had heard about Stir and had it on my bookmarks for some time, but I really became interested in attending a course after getting to know Kristen Kish on Top Chef. At the time, Kristin was the chef at Stir and I was so excited about the opportunity to try her food. Apparently I wasn't the only one, because the Stir website crashed from too many people trying to book classes after she won!\n",

      "\n",
      "We arrived for our 6 o'clock class a few minutes early and were sat around a counter with 7 other guests. The room was very small -- there was hardly any room to walk around the table! In addition to the 9 guests was the chef (Jason) and the very knowledgeable Christine who put the class together and conceived of the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "In front of each chair was the night's menu and some paper to take notes on. We started the night by getting to know each other and talking about our favorite summer beers. And then the food started!\n",
      "\n",
      "The first course was a house cured Oregon Wild King Salmon with creme fraiche, Siena Farms beet, orange and radish, paired with Brasserie Dupont Saison. I loved the clean flavors in this dish and was especially a fan of the radish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our second course featured some beautiful beer battered hake (fried in a restaurant across the street), which was served with a potato & fennel salad, homemade tartar sauce and topped with lemon confit. This was definitely one of my favorites of the night. The fish was cooked perfectly and the tartar sauce was amazing. The fish was paired with Green Flash Saison Diego, which was both my favorite pairing and beer of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next course was the one I was most excited about: Miso Ramen with hand-cut noodles, an onsen egg, pork jowl, mushrooms, and lots of other good stuff! I'm sad to say this is the first time I've had ramen and I loved it. The broth was so delicious, the mushrooms had that strong umami flavor, and the egg was perfectly cooked. The ramen was paired with High & Mighty Pas de Dieux, another great combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this point I was very full -- the portions were huge -- but we still had two courses to go. The fourth course was a charmoula-rubbed Misty Knolls chicken, served with turmeric cardamom jasmine rice and braised greens. For someone who doesn't really like chicken, this was fantastic. We all got to choose between white and dark meat (I chose white), and the chicken was super moist and the skin was crispy and flavorful. The rice was perfectly cooked and I loved the braised greens. This course was served with Pretty Things Americaine Jack d'Or.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our final course was appropriately a cheese course! The cheese was paired with Jolly Pumpkin Farmhouse Ale Bam Biere and was served with local honey, hazelnuts, pistachios, preserves and crackers. A great way to end the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left the class with a head full of facts and a very full and satisfied belly. The classes are pretty pricey, but remember that you are paying not only for fabulous food, but for an experience you can't get from a restaurant. When else do you get to watch a chef cook and ask questions as they do so? The environment was very casual and I felt more than comfortable to make comments throughout. The level of knowledge around the table varied and I never felt embarrassed or intimidated about asking a question. I can't wait to attend more demonstrations!\n",

The woman who made it looked pissed! A man quickly said we will remake it. We then asked what he would recommend. So he suggested a chocolate banana. It was out immediately!\n",

      "Tasty, quick, and healthier breakfast options at this airport location! If you'd like to decrease your amount of human interaction, order and pay using the screens. Then wait by the pick-up area until they call your name. I ordered the wake up bowl with acai as my base (other options are yogurt and oatmeal). It was great, and at just around $6, much more affordable than other acai options... even outside of the airport! The \"wake up\" toppings included granola, coconut flakes, nuts, and craisins with a drizzle of honey. It provided me with nice energy without feeling bloated before my trip. Be good with an acai bowl from B.Good!\n",

The sushi is very good, the price is pretty standard, the sashimi and nigiri seems to made from very high quality fish, and the place has a beautiful newly renovated interior.  Hey people waiting for a table at Fin's!  This place is better and has tables to fill!  The half-price menu seems like kind of a gimmick, but this place is really good enough without it.\n",

      "This place is just getting started, so they're still ironing out the kinks. It used to be called Falafel Place, and was one of my favorites, so I was bummed when it shut down for a while. When it reopened under new ownership (the brother runs Crispy Crepes, next door) I was delighted to discover that the food was actually better than Falafel Place had been. The staff are very kind, but the service is pretty slow. If you can afford to wait a bit, you'll be rewarded.\n",

      "\n",
      "I chose the barley base and lamb meatballs (they were already cooked) and the young lady behind the counter added tzatziki, feta cheese, hummus and a cucumber tomato mix to it. Back at the apartment, it was still hot and ready to dig in. Lots of flavors, lots of textures, it left me completely stuffed and satisfied.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, to answer your question, NO.\n",
      "I ordered twice in the same week to give noon another chance. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first time, I had a free entree (still had to pay tax, though). I ordered a salad bowl with spicy lamb meatball and extra falafel (because I wanted to try both and thought might as well because I didn't have to pay for it--classic moral hazard). I felt extremely eggcited to pick up my order and chow down because I had been craving Mediterranean food all week. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I got back to my office, to my d i s m a y, my bowl was missing the most expensive component to my hyped up salad bowl: THE SPICY LAMB MEATBALLS! GASP. I thought that because I had added in so many extras, they were at the bottom and I just didn't see them yet. But halfway through (it was all I could get through--the portion sizes are huge!), I realized that my naivete tricked me and that I was in fact missing my spicy lamb meatballs IN ADDITION to my pita croutons! Dejected, I put away the bowl, full but unsatisfied, and proud of my past self for adding in extra protein with the falafel. Strike 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so today, I ordered something similar, to give noon another chance. I ordered a quinoa bowl with less toppings and the spicy lamb meatballs (b/c i still wanted to try them ]': ) , but without any extra protein, so that it would be clear if I was duped yet again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excited once more and hoping noon would pull through, I again picked up my order, walked back to my office, and opened up the bowl. Guess what was missing? THE SPICY. LAMB. MEATBALLS. Strike 2. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend who also ordered with me also was missing hers, so we went back. The staff graciously added in our meatballs that i had journeyed so far and long to get, and once I had gotten back to my office, I had to set it aside because my lunch break was over by that point, and I had to get back to work. Now, 2 hours later, I sit in the office, quinoa bowl beside me, filled with my spicy lamb meatballs, when all of a sudden, I realize--something else is missing: THE QUINOA. the literal name of the bowl. STRIKE 3.\n",

      "A friend who works in the area said it's quite nice for lunch, but at night, they clear out the tables and they pack the place full of people. There's no room to move around and it's incredibly crowded -- not to mention overpriced drinks and shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd go back to JA Stats for lunch to possibly check it out, but I wouldn't go back there on a Friday or Saturday night. Some people might like the scene, but it's just not for me. Very crowded, rope out front with a line and just a very awful experience. I always like something more low-key, but if you like crowded, cramped places with thumping music and expensive drinks -- feel free.\n",
      "I hit up J.A. Stats a couple times over the past week after work and both times came out with a positive vibe. The service was just as attentive on a quiet President's Day evening as it was on a busy Friday night.. \n",

      "Finally we decided to get up and move to the outdoor bar, we were giving up prime seats but figured we would get better service sitting at the bar itself. The bartender was busy, but came right over, handed us menus, and took our drink order. I got a delicious rum punch type cocktail and my friend got the cucumber martini. Both drinks arrived and were quite good, strong, yet good! We ordered the Guac, and it was Delicious! It came with freshly fried plantain chips instead of tortilla chips and I have to say... they are on to something! Why would you eat quac any other way?\n",

The sandwiches there were delicious. The one here is a bit different. There is no line to get your sandwiches (which is definitely good), but the service is a tad slower (they don't need to rush). I got the Tuna Melt and the Earl's Club. The Tuna Melt was just as delicious as the one in Vegas. Plenty of tuna and the cheese was perfectly melted on that crunchy bread. The Earl's Club wasn't as good. The bacon was soggy (I hate soggy bacon) and the sandwich itself was overly salty. However, the Tuna Melt made up for everything. Must come back every time!!! Terminal E is the best.\n",
      "This was among the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Yet another example of a place's title (\"yummy pasta\", \"perfect grooming\" etc) being grossly misrepresentative of the product offered. \n",

      "The teenager that took my order was hardly qualified to be working at a fast food restaurant. He moved at the pace of a two-toed sloth (not to be confused with the slightly more mobile and robust three-toed sloth) and was indifferent to the basic tenets of restaurant service (eye contact, avoiding wiping body parts in front of customers). \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered an egg and cheese sandwich (aka \"egg mcmuffin\") just before a flight back to Toronto and it was $6. It took nearly 15 minutes to prepare and the quality of all three ingredients was so soggy and awful that I took two bites and promptly threw it out. What a waste.\n",

      "A new hand pulled noodle restaurant has hit the scene and lunch time options in downtown has expanded yet again. After reading about then on Eater, I took the stroll to the Corner Mall twice in one week. I first stopped by around 4pm to grab some cold noodles and the pork rougamo, a sandwich made with super flakey buns. The cold noodles didn't seem to be hand pulled but were pretty delicious with a peanut sauce on top. I next stopped by with my coworkers around 1230. It seems like they're not staffed to handle the lunch time rush. We waited 40 minutes to get our orders of sauteed hand pulled noodles. The food is good though not quite worth that wait. You'll need to stop by during non-peak hours to avoid the rush but it's worth the trip, at least until they increase their capacity in the kitchen. They take credit cards as well and have many more options than Genes flat bread.\n",
      "Was so excited for a new hand-pulled noodle place to open up in downtown however my experience was disappointing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the N7 sautéed noodle with beef. While the portion was moderately sized and had some good flavors, there was no soup (see pictured). The bowl was half full of broth and oil. I think I assumed wrongly that there'd be soup but when it has half a bowl of broth, it's a bit confusing. The noodles were very thick and seemed either over cooked or were pre-cooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "For close to $12, I would rather go to Gene's for noodles next time I get a craving as it's cheaper and tastier. Hopefully this place improves as it is new, may try again after a few months if it's still around.\n",

      "Restaurant: French Quarter\n",
      "I think this place has a ton of potential, but the owner/chef needs to trust Bostoners to actually want to eat Cajun food.  We read about this place opening in boston.com and were able to get a reservation on Saturday night.  This was their 6th night open.  There were a few first week issues that will undoubtedly soon be corrected, e.g. not enough water glasses for everyone.  That won't be relevant if you visit a few weeks from now.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is a serious problem with this place.  The food was lovingly prepared, you can see the skill of the chefs.  The server told us that they had only been open for 6 days, and not to expect New Orleans level of spices, as the chef/owner didn't want to overwhelm Bostoners' palates with too much intense flavor.  This was a serious mistake.  Granted, I like food to be a lot hotter than most New Englanders, many of whom consider black pepper on boiled potatoes to be too spicy.  But this was magnificently prepared food almost completely devoid of spicing.  We both had gumbo as a first course (my wife's the vegetarian option), and I had crawfish in taso ham cream sauce over linguini while she had blackened salmon.  Both were perfectly prepared, but there was truly no flavor to my linguini other than what was supplied by the crawfish, pasta and ham.  No detectable other spicing.  Abby's blackened salmon somehow managed to be blackened with no detectable heat whatsoever.  It also came with a horseradish sauce that had little detectable horseradish in it.  This place is going to fail unless the chef stops storing his tail between his legs and actually makes Cajun dishes like one might get in a place like Louisiana.  I don't demand it be authentic, I don't know what is actually authentic.  I just want there to be detectable flavor.  Who opens a Cajun restaurant with dishes that are utterly bland?\n",
      "\n",
      "The server was intensely interested in our feedback, and was overtly appreciative that we wanted the food to taste like, well, something.  It was weird how he warned us about the chef not spicing things, like he knew we wouldn't like that.  He totally agreed with our assessment and said he would make sure to pass that on.\n",
      "I was there for opening night with three other guests. We sampled many items on the menu. Cocktails were nice and the food was great. It was a nice atmosphere and service was perfect, the wait staff was present but not hovering. The BBQ shrimp and fried chicken were outstanding.\n",

I was SO disappointed with my chocolate chip cookie and iced coffee that I  felt sad on my walk back to work.\n",

      "I had really gone in for a red velvet cupcake that someone else yelped about, but the only baked goods left by 1pm were a couple of forlorn looking tarts and some chocolate chip cookies. I went for the rather large cookie and a small iced coffee which rang in at $3.35, which is very reasonable for the neighborhood. The coffee was just awful - stale, bitter,  and weak. It was so bad that I ditched it after about four sips (and I love coffee with an unholy passion, so it had to be pretty bad). I can forgive bad coffee once in awhile, but I can't forgive the bland, flavorless cookie with very few chocolate chips that tasted like the Tollhouse recipe without the sugar. \n",

      "Anna, the owner, sold me a dozen eggs at Christmas .  She knows me.  I'm no stranger.  When we cracked them open we saw that half of them were black and smelled up the whole kitchen.  The expiration date was 8/14/16!   I brought the empty package back to show her the date. Unfortunately Anna denied ever selling them to me.  Basically calling me a liar.   My 5 month pregnant daughter could have eaten some as the first few we cracked we're not black and rotten.  Since then many neighbors have said the same.  Watch your expiration dates when going there.  Lord knows what they put in their cooked food!  I would not be back nor will my neighbors.  All she had to say was they made a mistake, but no.  Anna is not known for being pleasant at all and is usually grouchy but basically calling your customer a liar is over the top.\n",
      "The Market is on Tremont Street across from Picco / Barcelona it is owned and operated by a über Greek Husband and Wife -- George & Anna, ala \"Georgianna's!\" They HATE each other and it shows. They have a KILLER location and full wine / beer / liquor licence -- wow. Read: GOLD MINE. I wish they took a little more pride in understanding what it is people (\"customers\") want. They certainly have customers that have $$$$ to spend and are willing to pay for quality -- alas half the time you grab the fruits and veg are very much past prime or even just rotten. There is a crap-load of wasted space selling things that no one ever buys. South Enders want great organic products and will pay for it. We do not need 36 hour old hot food that clearly has been sitting in the water bath for HOURS if not from the day before. They should also broaden their horizons a bit and understand that just because they are Greek not all Greek products are the best (e.g. run over and shop Formaggio's or Whole Foods). Lastly, the attitude . . . as I said, nice folks but want something special or different cooked, the wife is not a very big fan ;-) Want to use Amex? Well they got rid of that so if you are bringing a bottle to clients house for dinner, forget expensing it. When a person turns off Amex it shows they do not ultimately care for the customer -- it is very simple minded of people to not treat customers like gold. Once the customers are gone -- so is the business. I wish them well and I hope they kick it up a notch and recognize the opportunity.\n",

      "In all seriousness, can you really have faith in someone's products if they don't understand even the minimal power of something like yelp? They haven't even \"claimed their store\" five years later as their business. What a shame. Come on Anna, you can do it!\n",

First, Charcarero's quality is incosistent, like when the owner isn't on site the sandwich isn't good is the joke at the office.  Second, El Molino's meat is juicer and the bread are fresher.  Third, El Molino puts more and 3 green beans on a sandwich.  Fourth, there are three different sauces to choose from.  Fifth, they aren't afraid to put some guac on the sandwich.  Sixth, they don't have the strange and inconsistent sizes add on prices that Chacarero employs. Seventh, you don't have to wait in two lines and tell you order a second time and make sure they get your order correct.  Finally, they count higher than to one and a half when putting peppers on the sandwich. \n",

The lady of the house decides that it would be a good idea to conjure up some delivery, perhaps the scent of pizza will awaken me from this vegetative state. Consult the pizzadeliverynets and Nicole's is delivering and happens to be someplace that we haven't tried yet. BEEP BEEP BOOP BUZZZZZZZZZZZ (sound of internet smoke signals) and a large pie with a few toppings and a salad is ordered. Mind you I am not yet aware of this. I lift an eye lid and see her studying her laptop, looking diabolical with credit card in hand. Back to sleep. Peek at clock. Has an hour passed? Lift other lid look at clock. Is it that late? Did somebody mentions a pie? Did she eat the whole pie? Where is my pizza pie? I want pizza pie NOW! No, no pizza for an hour and a half after this order was placed. The Bourne Ultimatum is on, I bet Jason Bourne would slice the head off the delivery guy that had the balls to show up to an address a mile away with a cold pizza 90 minutes after an order was placed.\n",

      "The pizza came pretty quickly, probably around 30 minutes after the delivery time. I do enjoy the sauce and toppings from this place, but feel like the crust is a bit underwhelming.

The manager brought out all the gluten-free stuff, they were able to make a number of different dishes gluten-free even if they weren't already listed as such (they didn't have a specific gluten-free brunch menu), but the server was knowledgeable and they even had different special gluten-free plates so you knew they weren't contaminated.  my friends were served gluten-free rolls and were provided with a host of gluten-free menu options.\n",

Also, since I'm clearly a 5 year old, I ordered chocolate milk to go with my pancakes.  Not only was it huge (a full pint glass of chocolate milk), but it was also JUST the right chocolate: milk ratio.  you may not think that chocolate milk is that hard to screw up, but as a connoisseur of chocolate milk i must say that was one of the more positive experiences i've had ordering it.\n",

At one point when the person making crepes finally finished mine, they tried reaching for a to go box in a cabinet but was too short to reach. The guy at the counter didn't even help and just stood there watching. So the crepe person took a different box and put mine in, then put it on the counter? I had to awkwardly go up to the cashier after a few minutes and ask if it was mine, which is was, not sure why they didn't give it to me. The crepe was savory and for some sacrilegious reason they put it on a whole wheat crepe? It was disgusting. I had to throw my crepe out it was so horrible, and I hate wasting food. Not sure that the egg in mine was even cooked all the way. I've included a photo so you can see the shape of the crepe. I've never seen a crepe shaped that way in my life. \n",

Also the bubble drinks/bobas/pearl drinks here are fantastic!

Delicious, cheap and a lot of fun.\n",

Mystery counters that seemed to have had food stuffs at some point in time, but those days are, well, gone. Not an atmosphere to be recommended. The saving grace, albeit not that day due to serious rain, is that when the weather's nice, you can sit outside next to one of TWO fountains.

      "I recently discovered this place and the food is excellent. Located within 100 federal (but is actually closer to the Congress street entrance). It is Mediterranean food with an option of salad or rice as a base (or you could get everything stuffed in a pita). My go to is the beef/lamb rice bowl. The greek salad is true greek salad (without lettuce) and the pita that comes with the meal is warm and soft. The beef/lamb is perfectly cooked and juicy and all of the sides i've tried have been great. After you pay, there is a station for extra sauces (tahini, garlic sauce, etc.) with little to-go cups. The garlic sauce is fantastic. The line gets really long at lunch but they are extremely efficient and the line moves quickly. My only two (small) complaints are the prices (just a little high, but its the financial district so it is what it is) and the sauce station is missing a ledge or nearby table to put down your food while you pour sauce so there is a precarious balancing act that has to happen. Luckily i've had no spills yet but I'm sure I will at somepoint. Definitely eat here if you are in the area. There is an order-ahead option if you don't want to wait in line but I like my food hot so I wait :)\n",

Stuffing fantastic. Mac n cheese fantastic. And for the price and amount/quality food you get, best deal in the area. Seriously, everyone should give this place a try.

It's located now within the Plaza Deli, but you can't miss it.  Carlos isn't too shy about showing off his food, so you will see all the main courses right behind a sneeze guard made of bullet proof glass or diamonds or something.  Nobody is fucking with this mans food.  He usually lays out the same courses each day; Roasted Pork which is super crispy on the outside and soft as a baby on the inside.  He also has ribs which fall off the bone and are super tasty.  Whole roasted chickens that he breaks in half right in front of you with his bare hands.  Also chicken with peppers and steak with peppers.  All of which can be served with white or a delicious yellow rice, fried plantanes, potato salad, macaroni salad or salad salad.  Pricing is typically consistent, based more on what he can fit in the tray as opposed to the variety of food you choose.  Also available is a very tasty seafood salad, comprised of shrimp, bay scallops, red onions and peppers doused in a lemon sauce.  Minimal, yet delicious.  Let's talk burritos.  His burritos are AWESOME.  You can choose from his steak and pepper selection or his chicken and pepper selection, which he covers with cheese, beans, onions, lettuce, tomatos, rice and this delcious pink sauce (mild or spicy (get the spicy)) which I can only imagine is the blood of gods mixed with some MSG.  He then throws it onto a panini press so when it's all said and done... and all the smoke clears... and the dust settles, you have a beautiful crispy burrito.

      "The portions are enormous; but I personally value quality over quantity. I had the Homemade Lasagna to go and was quite disappointed when I got home. First off, the food was cold (I live close by) since they didn't even have a heater to rest it on prior to the customer's arrival. So I nuked it and took a first bite; my tastebuds were assaulted by the horrendously salty tomato sauce (what did they put in there; extra-strength salt?) Secondly, the bland \"ground beef\" was not ground at all but in pesky large chunks that I had to break up with my fork. Thirdly, an hour later, I was panting from thirst (MSG anyone?) and consumed close to a gallon of water. The only redeeming aspect of my meal were the garlic and olive oil foccacia cubes which were absolutely delicious; I will order this item (and this item alone) next time which deserves a star on its own.\n",

And as of December half of the market is empty but when asked why it was like that the woman behind the counter was borderline offended \"have you been here recently?\" and then acted as spin person \" Steve does things in projects.\" Well Steve if you're listening: maybe just focus on one thing at once.

We were there on the early side (since it was for an event) so we sat at those big cushy sofa's and sipped overpriced drinks (like the beautiful people do). My friends and I sort of got a kick out of the fact that this kind of bar is not really our \"scene\" but it was fun all the same.

So loud in fact that a speaker blew right near us. (Imagine for a moment how bad it sounds when a big speaker blows and gets staticky). \n",

I mentioned to him that we specifically chose the table we were at because we were told it was NOT reserved. He wasn't going to give up (I am sure someone in line offered him a hundred to get them a table) but neither was I.

      "My friend and I have been  season ticket holders for 20 years. When they announced this club my friend and I decided that we would like to  get two season tickets to the Royal Rooters Club (RRC) after reading the promotional announcement that they mailed us. I called 6 times to try and get two tickets for $250 for each season ticket seat that we owned, and could never get through. I left messages and  they never returned my calls. My friend then tried to get through and finally after two weeks  they got back to my friend to tell him that they had sold out and they would put us on a waiting list. My friend was disappointed  because he wanted to have access to this new club. Well tonight, Thursday night 6/21/2012, my wife and I were going to the game and I knew it was going to be 96 degrees at game time. I had bought  tickets on Ace ticket earlier in the year for the 100 anniversary and  I saw that they we selling 1 game tickets for the  RRC. I stuffed that in the back of my mind and since  it was going to be so hot tonight, I thought this could be  a nice oasis to cool down before the game.I went to Ace ticket and found two tickets to RRC for $18! I was elated.  So I bought the tickets and my wife and I went before the game. The memorabilia was great but the atmosphere was like a warehouse, everything was overpriced, the service was horrible. We had to fight with our server to get extra salsa for our chicken quesadillas. For two of us we ended up spending $120. We have been going to Audubon for at least 10 years and Island Creek Oyster Bar (and before that Great Bay in Kenmore Sq.) and had sumptuous feasts with great bottles of wine and never spent that much.  I texted my friend and told him how lucky we were that the Red Sox never called us back for two weeks and gott shut out from spending $500 for season access. If you are tempted to go (and your should go once to see the memorabilia.. (Babe Ruth's Contract!) go on to Ace Ticket and buy a $9/person single game  ticket to get in. Thankfully,  they never called us back at the beginning of the season to buy season admission, because we would have wasted $500.\n",

      "My first visit was during a temperate May night tilt vs. Cleveland (welcome back, Johnny Damon), but where this place will probably really shine is during the stretches of mid-summer heat beating down on fans game after game - to be able to wander into climate control intermittently will probably be a very solid option (you can leave and return with a \"ROOT\" hand-stamp). \n",

Most bars in Boston have pricey drinks but here they are at least $5 more. It's a good place to get away, it's quite and beautiful so if you want to avoid the pompous ladders district crowd this isn't a bad place to choose.

      "Not all that impressed, especially given its location in Louis Boston. Waitress didn't know what was in one of the drinks of the week, and had admitted she had been asked about it several times all week (you figure after the first time you can't answer a customer, you go and find out the answer!). Waitress pointed out a fruit fly that we otherwise wouldn't have noticed, which then of course made us notice the three or four other fruit flies. Haven't seen a fruit fly since I was in college and in a fraternity house. We were presented with a chef's tasting of a drink (?) containing tomato \"water\" (whatever that is) and crunchy rice which was repulsive. (Unlike the cantaloupe soup the chef at Aujourd'hui presented to us) However, the appetizers and entrees were very good. (My gnocchi melted in my mouth) The \"Mixed Berries and Cream\" dessert had a few slices of strawberries and was filled with blueberries - not a very \"mixed\" assortment (raspberries? blackberries?). \n",

Whether it was an Asian inspired coconut-based seafood soup or cold-poached green and white asparagus laid in alternating rows, his food was set to highlight the simple purity of the ingredients.  The waitresses weren't the greatest, but the atmosphere was quite a respite from the Euro crowds of Newbury.  The majority of diners were in their 50's and 60's, dressed to the nines, enjoying the cool elegance of Restaurant L.\n",

      "This review is purely for the customer service that was experienced yesterday and if Maxine's wants to maintain a good reputation they need to seriously get it together! My friends and I ordered 3 dinner plates and all of them were supposed to come with mac and cheese as the sides. They said it would be 30 - 45 min and we said that would be fine. We arrive and when we go to pay they tell us that one of the plates don't have mac and cheese and they aren't going to make any more for the day. This is actually absolutely fine because we understand that items can run out; however, if this does happen and you already took an order in advance, I believe you should offer something complimentary due to your error. In addition, we also ended up waiting over an hour for our meals. You would think it would end there, but no, no, no there is more! We paid and left and when we got home we realized they did not include any cornbread, which was supposed to come with each meal. We call them back right away and told them they forgot the cornbread. They then said they would deliver the cornbread to our residence since they messed up yet again. They took down our address and number and informed us they would call when they arrived with the cornbread. No call, no cornbread and now it is the next day! This type of customer service is unacceptable. If you say you are going to do something, you better make sure you follow through especially when it is something that was your fault from the beginning! It does not matter to me how good the food is, Maxine's needs to get their customer service in check and I would advise that they do that sooner than later!\n",

I got an omelet instead, which was very fluffy, but there was barely any cheese in it (I love cheesy omelets). The potatoes were awesome, sesoned perfectly and extra crispy. For the price though it really wasn't worth it, I also did not realize the coffee was 5 bucks, thought it was included. Being from Jersey, I would rather go to a diner for a omelette, cheaper and more food.\n",

Sapore has some nice outdoor seating and plenty of seating inside as well.  Atmosphere and decor was clean, open, fresh and modern.  The faucets in the bathroom are very interesting.  The menu is a mix of Italian and American themed choices.  I had the lobster carbonara that came with a poached egg on top.  Others in my party had the burger and customized flatbreads.

They have also consistently showed up when scheduled unlike some of the other food trucks we have tried. The line for this truck gets extremely long the closer to 12PM, so we go early. I love this family run business and it's nice seeing their friendly faces behind the truck. I have talked with them directly on social media (Instagram) several times about stories I've posted, and they are very responsive! When I shared with them that one of my bowls wasn't of the same quality I was used to receiving, they immediately apologized and comped the next bowl! I really appreciate that they are receptive to feedback!\n",
      "\n",
      "Their bowls are so tasty and filling! The combination of protein, rice, various veggies and their sauce meld together for a truly flavorful experience. The standard rice bowl, burrito, or salad bowl are ~$9. On days when I want something extra, I get the kimchi fried rice (+$2). Otherwise the white rice also goes great especially with the sweet bulgogi beef. The sweet & spicy pork and chicken are also good options but I think the beef is still my favorite. I have also ordered double/extra meat (+$2) and to be honest I can't tell the difference. Their veggies also always taste fresh and crisp. Only questions are do they have a rewards card or loyalty program haha for people who frequently indulge and a future standalone restaurant (would love to share with friends who don't work around Boston)?! Their menu also offers smoothies, but I haven't tried those yet. Maybe next time!\n",

Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have better. Anywho, chicken and shrimp teriyaki is what I would recommend. They have generous portions and I like extra teriyaki sauce, which they gladly oblige in giving me, which is always nice. Cheap as hell, and always a good stop if you are hungry and impatient, perhaps from a busy and exhausting day of shopping...

I practiced restraint and didnt eat any bread, but watched with jealousy as Doug dipped bread in that tasty lemony broth.  The mussels were really sweet and fresh, just yum!\n",

My scallops were really tasty -- 4 huge scallops that came with a tangy cranberry sauce that really complimented them.  They also came with this crepe thing filled with onions and a mystery meat -- maybe pork?  maybe duck?  i dunno, something fatty.  I wasn't feeling the crepe.  The only thing i would change is adding some kind of vegetable to the dish, because the watercress salad was literally like one piece of watercress.  That's okay because Doug's dish came with some delicious salad and he game me half, because he's awesome like that.  His mahi mahi was the freshest i have ever had, it was light and delicious and the cucumber tomato sauce was really good too.  It flaked apart and the consistency was more like halibut, rather than the crappy steaklike mahi mahi you get at a chain restaurant.  The quantity of food qas really perfect, it's rare that i eat my app and my dish but i made a happy plate --well, other than the crepe thingy.\n",

We always call ahead for orders, but even when getting there, there's always a slight delay- not because they didn't plan ahead, but because they wait until you come in before adding the finishing touches so that your food comes out nice, hot, and tasty every time! Over the years, the price has only increased by a small amount in keeping with inflation- you still get a lot of food here cost-wise.\n",

They come in quart containers (over the quart line actually, so a bit more than a quart!) for $2 each. Their lemonade is also really good too (both use real fruit as evidenced by the citrus inside), but personally I prefer the sweet tea. Where the lemonade is a 4.5, the sweet tea (they call it iced tea) is a solid 5/5. Marginally better in my opinion, but both are good!\n",

Honestly, some of the best American Chinese food in the area- I can't vouch for every item on the menu, but everything I've had is great.\n",

      "Glad to see another P&R popping up around Boston. First time I went here I got a small jerk chicken plate w/ cabbage and brown rice & peas. I definitely recommend just getting a small plate because they really like it on. Only sad part was that the jerk chicken itself wasn't really spice but good nonetheless. I've also had their beef patty w/ cheese and coco bread. I'd 100% recommend this combo. Cheap & filing. I'll be coming back.\n",

      "Restaurant: Sakura\n",
      "Located right in the Longwood Galleria this is a great central location if you work in the area. I was looking to pickup food where my bus transferred and found this place through yelp! \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have ever had mall chicken teriyaki, this is exactly what you're getting. Tons of white rice, some steamed vegetables, and freshly cooked chicken. It's around $8.50 and very filling because of the rice. You can also double the meat for $1-$2 more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even though no one was in line I had to wait awhile for my food, but it tasted like I thought it should and was still warm after a 30 minute bus ride home. If I had a craving for this again I would  definitely go back.\n",
      "The chicken teriyaki here is incredible. They make it right in front of you and it tastes amazing! Full of flavor and big enough for two meals. Dangerously addicting, I need to go at least once a week.\n",

      "Restaurant: Addis Red Sea\n",
      "As someone who has little experience with Ethiopian food, I'd have to recommend Addis Red Sea specifically for that reason. For anyone in my position you should feel comfortable heading into their cozy, subterranean living room of a dining room, sitting down and asking the staff for recommendations. Their gracious dispositions, smiles and warmly attentive service makes you not only feel at home, but will allow you to enjoy your meal without worrying about being unsure of your order.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel no need to rave about the food, because as you can see from other, more experienced reviewers, it is some of the best Boston has to offer in this style of cuisine. Thought I cannot offer comparison, I can say (lacking vast Ethiopian-food experience) that it was spicy, hearty, filling, served quickly, enjoyed quietly and seemed to be made with care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect for a group of friends or an intimate dinner for two, Addis left me satisfied in hospitality and satiated in appetite. \n",
      "\n",
      "One tip: the table on the far left, way at the back corner of the restaurant has a nasty cold draft in the winter time. It's very out of the way and offers a view of the entire restaurant, but it was hard to ignore the chill.\n",
      "Before checking this place out, I admit I was very skeptical.  Ethiopian food?  I couldn't imagine what it would be like.  Much to my surprise, however, this place was fantastic.  You don't have utensils, instead they lay a large pancake like item on the table, and serve your food on top of it.  Once all is set you get more little versions of this pancake object... I had no idea what was going on, and then it hit me-- you use a piece of the pancake to scoop up your food!  Its like eating with your hand but you only touch the (I'm being repetitive) PANCAKE THING!\n",
      "\n",
      "Each bite is a little wrap of your food, WHICH is delicious.  This was about a month ago so my memory is lax, but I believe I had a chicken lemon dish, delicious.  But don't forget the steamed veggies.  The last vegetable you might ever eat you just cannot get enough of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment is quaint and dimly lit, but not as though it will give you a headache like low lighting often does to me.  The help, couldn't say if they were Ethiopian, but they sure knew what they were doing.  They might have had a slight issue with understanding me when I spoke to quickly but I like that sort of thing.  They were super helpful and answered every question I had about Ethiopian food.  They also gave us warm clothes to wipe our hands before we began.\n",

All good vibes just upon entering! Derek, the owner and Jordan, the bartender took such good care of us. I was in the mood for Mediterranean food and the meal most definitely satisfied me. \n",
      "We started with the olives, hummus, muhammara, and mussels. They were all very delicious although my ultimate favorites were the hummus and muhammara (compliments of the owner). So complex and tasty especially with the house made pita bread made from black flour. Our main dish was the sausage pizza. It was spicy and cheesy and the crust was deliciously chewy! Such a good choice that was. We ended the meal with a their house made baklava and pistachio ice cream. What a memorable meal! I can't wait to return the next time I'm in town.\n",
      "Wow, what a surprise!  We were staying at the Marriott across the street, wandered across the street and had one of the best restaurant experiences ever.  The Med. menu was excellent, wide variety.  My wife had the vegetarian plate, I had the beef adama.  We split the cheese pizza with old world dough/crust.  Amazing.  I would go back again!  The staff was so welcoming  we felt like we knew them.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "I've been trying to check out Bakey's a couple years now but things have always gotten in the way. I finally got a chance last week with a few coworkers. This place definitely lives up to the hype. Hearty sandwiches and quick service. We had no problem getting a booth on a Friday evening. If they offered french fries it would have been a perfect score.\n",
      "Bakey's is synonomous with the Financial District's casual power lunch; although, I think I just made up the term casual power lunch.... But whatever.  The throwback decor (Feels like twenties or maybe late thirties?) and theme lends itself to reminding Bakey's patrons of an earlier time when in Boston, Finance was king, and bowler hats and fedoras dominated the crown's of the cobblestone kings From State Street to Summer.  It's the kinda place you'd expect the patrons to be puffing on a pipe or cigar with the wall street journal spread out infront of them as they sipp on coffee or maybe something stronger while chomping away at a thinly sliced roast beef sandwich.  Minus, the tobacco, thats pretty much what Bakey's is today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sandwiches are simple, but hearty, as are the sides and entrees, but you'd really expect nothing else from a place that has the front fascia of a chromed up classic car on the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service is usually courteous and quick, and no one is rushed out despite the fact that dozens are usually waiting if it's any where close to lunch hour.\n",

      "Day-umn! Don't let its tiny size or cramped location fool you: T Sushi is the French Laundry of food court stations! \n",
      "\n",
      "The miso soup that comes with combos is some of the best I've had in any restaurant. It's huge and filled with tig ole bits of silken tofu and sliced konbu. The quality and preparation of the fish are both exemplary. Prices are reasonable and the sushi chef works remarkably fast, especially considering she makes everything to order. I had a fantastic lunch, and I will definitely come back for more!\n",
      "If you have food allergies this place is NOT SAFE. I asked them not to use ginger. Guy put it on the plate. I told him again and requested he remake my order. Instead he remade only the piece directly touching the ginger- and put it on the same plate. I objected and said that was not safe, and both men argued with me. I told them to forget the whole thing as I felt unsafe but they continued to argue with me and I had to ask several times before they'd refund me. Highly irresponsible and unprofessional staff whose allergy training (or their give-a-damn about it) is severely lacking. Would give zero stars if I could.\n",

      "I'm quite fond of their pizza. Boston Pizza Express was the very first place that I ever conquered eating a large cheese pizza on my own. It wasn't even a dare or anything. I was in high school and just had a fantastic appetite. There was no reward in the big picture, but realistically? I got to eat pizza and boy, it's good.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I used to think that being able to wolf down large amounts of food wasn't incredibly attractive or good looking, but as I've gotten older and explored new ideas regarding food, I've come to realize that the idea of eating food, regardless of the amount, is incredibly attractive, depending on the gender! In reality, gender plays a huge role when it comes to food.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if someone asks you to imagine a guy eating pizza, you'll probably imagine a huge, hungover guy with a pot belly standing in front of the fridge, naked, with a cold slice out of the fridge in one hand, a glass of milk in the other hand, all while leaning against the kitchen counter, putting down the glass once every so often to scratch his butt. However, if someone asks you to imagine a girl eating pizza, you'll probably see a good looking girl with beautiful hair that is inexplicably, somehow, blowing in nonexistent wind, taking a bite into a hot, crisp slice and seeing the cheese string out and she'll look at you seductively all while licking extra sauce off her upper lip with her tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've eaten at Boston Pizza Express since I was an itty bitty child and I've always avoided writing about it because well, I couldn't write so many reviews about eating such large amounts barbarically, right? Well, not anymore. I'm not scared to tell people that I like to eat large quantities when the quality is great, especially since now, I'd like to think that people imagine I look great when I'm eating a whole pizza by myself. I hope that as you're reading this review, you're imagining what it looks like when you stuff your face when you go to a place as good as Boston Pizza Express as well.\n",
      "I am almost too embarrassed to Yelp this place. We stopped in here for a slice of pizza after going to Wilderness Sports nearby. Wouldn't you know, it was everything I hate. Actually, I knew it would be bad when we walked in the place but I didn't want to be difficult.  It was greasy, had cheese that tasted slightly burnt, and the crust was really dry (as in not chewy at all). I guess it's what I've come to know as \"Greek style pizza\". \n",
      "However, it was cheap, ready in a flash and the server was friendly. Although those things are nice enough, I can't see myself ever going back here. In fact, I'm disappointed in myself for even going this once.\n",

      "Passable beef noodle soup if you're not going to Chinatown, Yum Yum will get the job fairly done. The beef is a little dry but is reasonably flavorful. The soup is spicy and savory enough to not equate it to dishwater. The noodles aren't amazing but they're not horrible, as they have decent texture. The portion, overall, was sizable and not too skimpy. \n",

      "\n",
      "I ordered the small beef noodle soup for $7.99 and I think is plenty for lunch. Spend a little more and you can share with a friend. The soup itself doesn't really doesn't have much depth in flavor, the beef a tad dry, and the noodles were okay. However, it is a nice change from the regular mall food. If you have a craving for some beef noodle soup, you can wander down to Chinatown. This will do in a pinch.\n",

Definitely best bang for your buck.\n",
      "Love this truck! It is Downtown at Milk and Kilby every Thursday and the price for the quantity of delicious, flavorful food is unreal! I got a Bulgogi Pork Noodle Salad ($7.99) with a side of Kimchi ($3). Foremost, noodle salad was amazing, meat well seasoned - forewarning: they put the gochujang sauce on the food for you so if you can't take heat or want to control the amount, ask for it on the side! Skip the Kimchi side. I was really excited because it was a legit full portion, container you can get from a grocery story (think cream cheese sized container), but it wasn't that good. Not sure if it's home made or actually is store bought.\n",

Owner makes up his own prices when you ask to add something to your sandwich. a $6.99 sandwich apparently is $10.99 when you ask to add 2 slices of salami. An additional .50 cents is OK, not $4. Not good business to overcharge customers.\n",
      "This cafe is tucked away in the basement of 239 causeway building and I must say it is a gem! My boyfriend and I came to Boston for a board meeting and grabbed a quick shake from the cafe. There are many different options and flavors to fit everyone's needs between protein shakes, energy shakes and fruit smoothies. We shared a 16 oz shake since we were just getting something to hold us over until lunch. We decided to get the kale storm which had kale (obvi), spinach, mango and lemon juice. The staff was 2 very kind middle eastern employees, one being a middle aged gentlemen who rang us up and joked around while the younger woman went to the back to make our smoothie. It was very fast! The shake mostly tasted like banana but I loved it. Nothing makes you feel healither than drinking a green smoothie! I highly recommend this place for a quick smoothie even if you're not stopping in the building!\n",

They specialize in sandwiches that have pre-made fillings on display that are slid into a baguette when you order, so it's quick but nothing is sitting around to make your bread soggy. I've been really impressed by the sandwich options; the ingredients are fresh and nicely chosen. I love the Parisian one with beets and goat cheese. Although not cheap, the prices are very reasonable for the area and you get a lot for your money. They also have excellent (dark!) hot chocolate. As a locally-owned business, it's a nice alternative to going to Au Bon Pain everyday!\n",

      "This place brings back memories. Living in Southie as a kid, you quickly learn where to buy good fried things. The Pier definitely gave you fried in fish and chicken form. I don't know if I could eat it today, but I will still be sad to see it go.\n",

      "Restaurant: Cafe Esplanade\n",
      "I got the grilled chicken Panini yesterday and it was awesome!  Just what I needed for lunch in the park. This cafe seems to have changed, I think they are under new management because they were making lots of improvements and the menu was changing. They were asking me what smoothies I liked to which I replied \"anything cold for a hot day....and strawberry.\"   This place is a great find when strolling along the Charles!\n",
      "This place could be amazing.  They've got hot dogs and ice cream.  They're only opened at odd times....okay when there is an event....but imagine if we had a nice restaurant overlooking the river.  A place to get breakfast, a nice lunch, to have a coffee or a cocktail?  I mentioned it once to them and they said the clients don't want \"fine dining\" - I think their idea of fine dining is serving a good cheeseburger or something.  I usually bring food from elsewhere and enjoy the ambiance.  Too bad there's not a good place to get quality food that has some clean outdoor seating - the place could be a gold mine.\n",

      "Restaurant: Maria's Kitchen\n",
      "I've been meaning to come here because I live in the area and walked by the new construction several times before they opened this year. I was happy that we stopped in to have dinner. The place is brand new and immaculate and my husband has already eaten there before so this was a real treat for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the $15 lamb chops which was accompanied with roasted potatoes, pita bread, and a small greek salad. I certainly enjoyed my chops since all of them were gone in two seconds and they gave a generous amount of potatoes which my husband helped me eat. I sampled some chicken kebabs and it was so good. The potatoes have a lemon tart rosemary and oregano flavor... Very healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were lucky to sit down since they primarily do a lot of takeout. It was very nice. What's nice about the menu is that they have regular takeout food like burgers and salads and pizza. I haven't tried them yet but if I'm in a mood I certainly will give them a shot.\n",
      "Burger was dry borderline tasteless price good but burger quality is fair at best, the burgers at Gerry liquors across the street are phenomenal and much heftier and  bulky on meat and toppings. Price is sane at Gerry and they give you more food. Was expecting more from this place given all the hype, hence short lived\n",

      "Restaurant: Bon Appetit Creperie\n",
      "4.5 stars! I stopped by for lunch at Bon Appetit Creperie in the Boston Public Market and was really glad I had a chance to try this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a crepe lover (particularly savory ones) and I was so happy the vegetarian crepe I had from Bon Appetit was so stuffed with all the veggie goodies and properly layered with sweet balsamic sauce (many places like to skimp on the fillings...but ah ah...not this place!). So...price wise...this place is really reasonable!\n",
      "\n",
      "The crepe is made fresh to order...so be patient. There was only one lady at this shop and just a few crepe pans..so be nice and patient to her! She's a kind lady and was trying her best and fast as she could to get to those yummy crepes of your choices out there for sure.\n",
      "This place definitely did not disappoint at all. The quality and tasted of the crepe was I point. I got the classic crepe which came with Nutella, banana, strawberries, powder sugar and chocolate syrup. It was fantastic tasted fluffy and rich. Reminds, of a dessert. All the textures, just gel into to make a perfect  item. Definitely, would come and recommend to every one.\n",

      "Restaurant: Seaport Elite Private Yachts\n",
      "So I got married on the seaport elite and all in all it was a great service. There are a couple of things to consider though when doing this. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) If you end up not liking what comes with the package it is going to increase your costs immensely to get what you want. I found that the people that were coordinating with the elite seemed to try and talk us out of the customization that we did. (To be fair we were looking for a pretty fancy look). \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The yacht is not HUGE like the Spirit of Boston so you are very quickly going to run out of spots for guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) The DJ they arranged for us was pretty awesome and really helped keep us on schedule for the night. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) The food is pretty plain, meaning that its not spectacular but its not bad. The hors d'eouvre options they give you are pretty sweet. I would definitely suggests purchasing individual platter as opposed to going with the packages because the options are better. (Note they change the offerings from time to time so that might not be the true anymore)\n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Ceremony spot on the boat is just the upper deck so you may need to do some things to spruce it up. We actually added our own chairs to the mix. \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Look at the chairs in the pictures they have. Not very wedding-y in my opinion. We also rented chairs from a separate vendor which added to the amount we paid. \n",
      "\n",
      "We loved the venue but we gave it three stars specifically for people considering using this place for a wedding because I have a feeling it won't be for everybody\n",
      "My husband and I got married aboard the Seaport Elite II in October 2016.\n",
      "While the yacht pretty much sells itself there are a lot of caveats. \n",
      "They do not provide an itemized list of add-ons...like the dance floor being am additional  $500. The centerpieces are flowers and you can't pick your own colors.\n",
      "Thankfully, I didn't want flowers and made our own ostrich feather centerpieces.\n",
      "The food was bland we chose filet with prawns, maple glazed tri color baby carrots and potatoes.  It was disappointing that there was no flavor. The salad was ok.\n",
      "Now, the epic fails section. \n",
      "1. No sound check before and we had no speakers up on the deck. Guests could not hear the music that was painstakingly chosen. No microphones for our officiants or us. Guests had no idea what was being said. I was assured several times prior to our wedding that we would have microphones and guests would hear everything clearly. \n",
      "2. They forgot my cake stand that cost a couple hundred dollars...so I'll never have those pictures of my cake on that beautiful stand.\n",
      "3. They forgot our favors! Also costing several hundred dollars...they put them out when we docked...no one handed them out and guests didn't realize that everyone was supposed to get one. I came home with more than half of our favors. To say I was and pretty much still am livid is an understatement. \n",
      "4. After spending several hundred dollars on a fabulous cake, they didn't cut slices...they cut slivers...wtf? The cake was huge! Give the guests a friggen slice of cake!!!!! \n",
      "The bartender and waitstaff were amazing and if I could have only tipped them, I would have.\n",
      "I received a survey via email a day or two after and when I pointed out the major mess ups they never reached out to even apologize. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the Boston background is truly amazing and so beautiful. My wedding itself was spectacular because of our guests and we had a awesome d.j., Mario...highly recommend him. He was so on point and paid close attention to every detail. \n",
      "\n",
      "The venue is unique and certainly fit our 1920s vibe, but the wedding coordinator needs to brush up and maybe make a check list to make sure they don't forget super important details. I spent nearly 2 years planning and as perfect as some things were, its the mess up stuff that the elite ll staff that makes me cringe everytime I think about it. Which is everyday.\n",

      "Restaurant: Daily Grill\n",
      "We went here because we got a $100 gift card as a wedding gift (just under a year after our wedding). Until then, I didn't even know this place existed. Apparently, it's an upscale chain that's popular in California.   \n",
      "\n",
      "It was pretty empty inside, but it's a nice atmosphere. The menu is expansive and not overly expensive. They have really good bread, which I could have made a meal out of.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the sesame tuna sashimi appetizer and it was really good. I wasn't a fan of the fried seaweed that came with it. It was oily and weird. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the steak salad and the meat was really good and it came with 2 huge onion rings on top, like the picture someone posted here. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband had the prime rib (only on weekends)  and his looked terrific. My father-in-law had the crab cake entree' and it was remarkably small for an entree' and for the price. It was strange because the portions of everything else were very large.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We had dessert (key lime pie and creme brulee). Both were good but nothing blew us away. My husband's cup of coffee arrived at room temperature so we mentioned it to the waiter who said he'd bring a fresh cup. Approximately 60 seconds later he came back with what looked like the exact same cup, that was too hot to touch after obviously having been microwaved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was overall a very mediocre experience. Not bad but not fantastic either. The kicker is that when we tried to redeem the gift card, we were told it had no $ on it. Hahahahahahaha! We had a lot of laughs about that and I still haven't decided if I should say anything to the person who gave it to us.\n",
      "DG is a little on the pricey side as far as mall restaurants go, but they do have some pretty good lunch deals.  The BEST deal however is my beloved Happy Hour.  With the order of any adult beverage, you get a free appetizer!  They have a whole page to choose from and depending on what you pick, it's usually a very decent portion.  The mac and cheese is delicious, as are the hummus and quesadilla options.  After your first free app, you can get more at a cheaper price.  Awesome place to grab a drink after work!\n",

      "I love this place! I work at Tufts University so on my lunch break I would just run across the street and grab this quick fix box to go. The meat is alway fresh. The lady is super nice. They're generally nice people and always give enough of a portion for you. 6.75 you can get three different types of meat! This is like a more cleaner version of tjeoriginal wai wai downstairs. Cash only! And no ice cream haha they should really change the title.\n",
      "This review is for the upstairs location. I went in as usual ordered roast duck and roast pork. Im standing there making sure the guy doesnt give me bbq pork because they always get it wrong. I see he has the bbq pork and tell him I want the roast. He gets mad for some reason looks me straight in the eyes starts cursing me in Chinese. He thinks cause its in another language I wont understand when he's looking me dead in the eyes. Then he switches to english says this is skin pork not roast pork. Skin pork? Lol do you mean pork rinds. Im like okay which one is roast and bbq then. He doesnt tell me. Theres only two types of pork on their menu roast and bbq. Im like so you have a third kind all three people ignore me. They all talk about me in Chinese at this point. I wasnt even mad the guy got mad all on his own. All he had to do was switch it over and thats it. Just switch it dont make up a new name for roast pork just to prove you are superior. The other two backing up him were so ridiculous. Youve worked in this industry for years you still cant tell which one is which? You going to swear at your customers to their face in a different language over something like this? You have a one page menu and you cant tell what is what in english after all these years. Im not going back here. They have no manners. All you need do is google chinese roast pork and chinese bbq pork there are thousands of examples of each. Mistakes are normal but acting this rude over your own mistake is kind of insane. Go to the other Wai Wai that is basement level the food is actually better there.\n",

What they did is gave us boneless wings twice, and first time I just let it passed , but second time I'm not taking it. The worst part is when we called them, they blamed on us. The manager is very unprofessional, he even made this situation worse, he literally fight with us till the end.  I'm not banging for refund or credit, but I'm really upset and disappointed with their attitude. Food supposed to make people happy, but  they end up with giving us bad attitude and wrong food.\n",

There are different fixings as well: hazelnut creamer, French vanilla creamer, almond milk, skim milk, half-and-half, whole milk, cream, soy milk. It's self-serve so you can make it exactly how you like it! I'm fortunate in that I only have to take the elevator down and I'm there!\n",

Their potato chip inventory is ridiculously expansive too- every brand imaginable. My lunch has never been more than $6 and I always leave with more than enough to satisfy me on days when I forget to pack a lunch at home.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a tiny little shop in Fenway with nowhere to sit (mostly a grab and go location) - but they're pretty efficient in getting people their order and sending them off into the world with their delicious ice cream. The textures and flavors were SPOT ON and you would never guess that this is vegan ice cream. It's so thick, flavorful, and creamy. We ordered the chocolate cookie dough and the seasonal, apple cider donut and both were so sweet, so creamy, and large portion sizes (even though we ordered the kiddie size). The ice cream here is chunky and there were good bites into both the apple cider donut and cookie dough flavors - almost felt like biting into a cake, YUM! \n",
      "\n",
      "The ice cream comes with compostable cups and spoons or you can opt for the cone which I think was a pretty great and sustainable touch. It is a tad bit pricey (I think I paid around 4.50 for a kiddie size) so definitely would not come here on the regular but glad this is an option for all my vegan & lactose intolerant friends out there!\n",
      "Super decadent and a healthier kind of ice cream that ditches the dairy... so  you don't need to feel TOO guilty about it (okay maybe just a little). I tried the lavender and the strawberry rhubarb and found it surprisingly delicious. It truly tastes just like regular ice cream--but I really like this place because they have some unique flavors that you don't commonly find. I highly recommend the lavender flavor- the hint of coconut in the base really elevates the flavor! Keep in mind that this place is on the pricier side, but they don't call it a treat for nothing. Definitely will come back!\n",

I have a mental image in my head of someone rapidly organizing tomatoes for 10 minutes.\n",

This tiny place has a wide array of amazing dishes, beautiful to look at, sensational to taste, and many completely new to this palate. The menu lists  19 Carribbean dishes, ranging from the familiar jerk chicken to ?? cow foot. The African portion of the menu consists of delicious sounding soups, noodle dishes, yam dishes, and rice prepared in several ways. Breakfast is also served. The place is small, VERY neat and clean, and fresh in appearance. While we were there, there was a constant stream of customers, both to eat in and take out. I wasn't brave enough to try the cow foot, so I had curried goat, red rice, mixed vegetables, and plantains. My husband had the jerk chicken. We thoroughly relished the generous portions of of our sumptuous meals. A word of caution to those who like bland food: this ain't it. The food is FULL of flavor.\n",

They didn't care if it was cold outside and so my sister went with my friend outside and I tried to be quick about it. There were two people blocking the area between the door and the desk so we had a difficult time with it.

I made the standard weather comment one makes when they're alone in a store with silent employees and they just seemed busy. Overall, I wouldn't say the staff was super friendly, but I guess I wouldn't consider them mean either. Anyhoo, I needed a cake. The prices ranged from $25-30 and I wasn't sure I wanted to 1) carry it around because it was super windy (how sad to drop)  2) spend that much. So I went with 1/2 dozen of the cupcakes for $12. A little steep, but they were actually pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of the white chocolate woman on the top of my cupcake, but that's easily removable.

I came here early in the morning with high expectations, after all, it's run by Colombians, and I was not disappointed, I'll be coming back regularly. In fact, I came back for lunch. It's raining and I didn't feel like wandering around too much. I got the Chicken Sudado, a classic Latin American stew like dish, it was today's special and it was delicious! Served with rice and a small side salad for $8.50. One of the guys I work with happened to be sitting at the end of the counter when I sat down, he had the Lentil Soup which he said was great. The staff is a little weak in the English speaking department, which is fine by me, I was hoping to brush up on my Spanish while assigned here.

Great food, fast service and a nice selection of salads, wraps and sandwiches. They also have great grill platters and smoothies. I come here at least once a week. I love the Cajun chicken wrap! The veggies used are great too! Zucchini, broccoli...not typical wrap material.\n",
      "Bagel Plus Cafe has awesome breakfasts and lunches for those in the Downtown area.  The name of it and the look of the front of the store is very deceiving.  I really thought it would be some dinky sub-standard bagel shop with only hot coffee, etc.  After I was introduced for lunch I have been going back like crazy! The Georgina sandwich on any bread you choose (croissant) is delicious.  It's oily with pesto in a non-messy way and the fresh chicken breast is moist and the tomato gives it a nice extra moistness.  I may be addicted to this sandwich because I have to tell myself to stop going in there so much for it alone! The have AWESOME iced coffee, and considering the only other choices in the area are DD's, BK and Finagle WITH considerable lines..make me turn to the right every time I'm off the train.  The fruit salad is pre-packaged but definitely cut up fresh that morning.  The have healthy selections like a hard boiled egg or odwalla bar or smoothie along with some more greasy spoon type selections (but always prepared with fresh ingredients on the spot).  They have stevia and soy milk for those that care about that.  The owner and staff are always friendly -albeit slow at times-and keep everything very clean.  I'd love to have more time to enjoy a breakfast there but so far no real report on anything with eggs.\n",

But of all the things I tried including the falafel (which tasted almost uncooked in the middle), the baba ganoush, the veggie kabob, and a couple other appetizers, everything was extremely bland. The lentil soup was so tasteless that it was inedible. Fortunately, when we told the staff about the soup, the owner/cook came over to us and asked what was wrong, and to their credit they gave us a refund for the soup. I was really rooting for these guys, but I think they just need to find a new cook.\n",

I could tell by the stickers on the glass overhead that they had hanging over the bar that they have a salad bar later in the day. So I will definitely be back next time in the afternoon since I love salad bars and they are so hard to come across. They have a small seating area here and it is right by the front windows so you get a great view of the Boston Common as you're enjoying your breakfast, lunch, etc.\n",

They weight the meat out and it's a fairly meaty sammich for the money. I usually can eat half a sandwich and be satisfied. Also, if I ask for extra pickle spears they will hook a girl up.\n",

      "I had the chicken salad with lettuce tomato and pickles. The chicken salad was all white meat and had a bit of spice to it...almost white pepper tasting, yum! The only disappointment was that they forgot the pickles, but they probably thought it was a weird combination. The sandwiches are cheap from $4.25 to $5.00 for a large size roll or wrap. They also have some slices of cake in to go boxes and other snacks, but I didn't give those a whirl.  I don't think anything on the menu is more than $7 so MG's definitely beats the hospital cafeteria and seems like a BMC employee favorite.\n",

      "Ding Ho is a A tiny little corner spot with standing room only for about six people shoulder to shoulder. It is more like a cafeteria point and they put it into a little Styrofoam container and ask if you want hot sauce. There is always a line here because of the pricing and quickness of receiving an order. Standard procedure as you get in line you point to one of the five or six items they have in the trays you tell them large or small they package it up and you pay cash. It is one of the best bargains for fast food in Boston much quicker than ordering McDonald's you actually get authentic Asian cuisine cafeteria style a small order is $2.50 a large order is $4.50. No frills no extras just a Styrofoam container filled with rice noodles and maybe a protein if you're lucky definitely fills the void when you have three minutes and you're hungry. The staff is all business no chatter. FYI if you want chopsticks you have to give them back the plastic fork they only give you one of the other I find this extremely hilarious but what do you want for $2.50 this is definitely the place to go for a quick stop. Next time you can't find a parking spot in Chinatown and you're by yourself you don't want to risk a ticket you'll be in and out of here in three minutes tops have your cash ready when you walk in you'll be out the door before you can even imagine what you want to eat.

      "NOW, I'm not sure what is going on, but two Sundays ago (Feb 12th), we went for breakfast before they were closing (they close at 2 in the afternoon I believe and it was 1:30).  We ordered two takeout specials.   I noticed a new sign that said any combo breakfast ordered after 11 AM would cost $1.00 extra (so the $4 breakfast became $5, not a big deal).   When we got home and opened the boxes, it was a sad sight.  The meals were both the #2 (corned beef hash) with two eggs (over-easy) and toast.  The takeout box was your standard 3-section styrofoam box (with the two small sections at the top and the large section on the bottom).  The corned beef hash was only a few spoonfuls, burned, and fit into one of the smaller, top sections.  The two eggs were improperly cooked and stuck in the other small section of the container.  The toast was untoasted and the butter was globbed on and not melted.  I don't know what was going on but I had never seen the people working there before.  I don't know if it is a temporary thing or if there is new management.  I will go back again one more time, but if I end up with the poor excuse for a breakfast that I got I will never go back.  I mean you would probably have had to have seen it to really grasp how bad it was.\n",

The Sumatra is amazing, full and fruity, and the house blend is also very nice. It's pretty clear that the owner has an obsession for great coffee and I believe they have won some prizes too.

      "China House is a great alternative to the Italian restaurants in the North End. Everyone behind the counter is very friendly and works very hard to prepare a ridiculous amount of orders. I had the Crab Rangoons and the General Gau Chicken tonight and they were great! Other times the Lo Mein and Boneless Spare Ribs did not disappoint! \n",

      "I occasionally go here when I don't want to be bothered with the food court, when I do go things go wrong, like wrapping my sandwich with a wet pickle, making my sandwich so incredibly slobby that I sort of don't want to eat it but this last time was the worst.  I had ordered the vegetarian pasta chili, I briskly walk back to work after psyching myself up for some chili on a cold day, I open the container and it's vegetable soup.  Vegetable soup!  I was so hungry and I didn't feel like walking back, I ate it anyway.  They are also a wee bit expensive but their food does have good flavor.\n",

      "One of my favorite lunch spots in the area. I usually stop by once every week or so. I like that they keep it simple. Marinated grilled chicken kebab, fresh veggies, rice pilaf, and pita bread. You can get it as a dinner, a salad, a wrap, or a sub. I don't know what's in their dressing, but I'm glad they started putting it in bigger containers because that stuff is addicting. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually get either the sub or the dinner. The dinner includes rice pilaf, chicken kebab, whatever veggies you want, and pita bread and dressing on the side. They keep everything separate and make each order individually, so you can ask for no onions or no hot peppers if you're picky. I get it with everything, and they'll ask if you want hot sauce drizzled over the rice, which hells yeah I do! Then I smother the whole thing in that tasty dressing. Best bang for your buck in the Copley area when it comes to quick lunch spots, and even when there's a line it goes by much faster than most of the food trucks and takeout places. They're out there all year too unless it's stormy or too cold out.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It's cash only, so keep that in mind, but there's plenty of ATMs along Boylston St. They have another location near Downtown Crossing that's been around for years, and one of my co-workers used to venture over there for lunch all the time, so when they opened up another cart at Copley a few years ago I was pumped to try it out because it always smelled so good. It's just a food cart, so I'm not sure what the expectation was for the reviewers who gave it three stars, but if you're looking for a quick bite on the go that's under $10 in the Back Bay (a tough feat), give it a shot.\n",
      "For a food stand I\"ll say if you want some Medeteranian or a simple chicken sandwich this will do & not break the bank. All in all these ones are excellent with order accuracy and adjusting the call or help you if you got any questions on how it will be. Now you see.\n",

The prices are not too bad but I still feel that the whte tablecloths do not make up for the casual atmosphere induced by the location and clientelle. The spinach and portabella tortellini in a white cream sauce are amazing.\n",

Farmer Horse is one of my local coffee shops and I frequented it regularly (really enjoy some of the food and beverage!!), however, me, and multiple of my female friends, have been made to feel uncomfortable by one of the baristas (who has been written about on here multiple times). As other reviews noted, he has repeatedly hit on me and others while in the shop (calling me and friends beautiful, complementing our appearances, adopting pet names...) Most recently, I was walking home and was stopped by him on the street (having had recognized me from the shop) and asked for my social media information. When I told him I had none he then repeatedly asked for my phone number so that he could set up a photo shoot with me. He has also approached another one of my friends in a park next to the cafe, soliciting her number while she was reading a book on a bench. I do not know this person and was just trying to walk home without being approached by my local barista. I will unfortunately not be returning to this location while this individual is employed there.\n",

      "The Goods JP just opened in the last week, so I dropped by for lunch today. It's a small place, with seating for ten, but it's comfortable and well decorated. Like many places in JP, the menu covers a mix of sandwiches, burgers, and pizza, but the offerings here are more creative than what you might find at your typical pizza/sandwich joint. For example, the Teacher's Pet is a pulled pork sandwich with apple, pickled onion, balsamic, and BBQ sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "I has a Satay Burger ($8 with a side), which has a tasty peanut sauce, sauteed onions, and a dash of sriracha. The beef tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly, and the flavors worked well together. The bun was great, too. It's a great burger. I had corn salad as a side, which was a nice combination of sweet and savory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sell pizza by the slice ($2.60 for cheese, $3.00ish for pepperoni), and other customers mentioned that their fries are great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prices are affordable, the service was quick, the menu is interesting, and the food is delicious. 5/5.\n",
      "The Goods JP is a great addition to Hyde Square.  The pizzas are now the best in the area. The thin crust gives a satisfying crunch. The topping combinations are unique but still somewhat traditional. The Eggplant Milano was delicious, and the Italian Relish was perfect with creamy ricotta, vinegary spicy peppers, and thin-sliced meats. The Veggie pizza had a great topping distribution and the price was definitely right. \n",
      "\n",
      "The standard cheeseburger must be cooked over the right heat, because the outside had a nice crispiness to it. The meatloaf burger was dressed in a nice spicy ketchup, and was, well, very meaty. The spicy green beans had some tomatoes I could do without but the beans themselves were crunchy, fresh, and tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the JP JPs (jalapeño poppers) are awesome, and the staff is super friendly. I'm really excited that this place is open now and has exceeded my expectations so highly!\n",

      "This place just opened up a couple weeks ago. I went in to try a few things and was impressed. They did a complete renovation inside. It used to be a seasonal ice cream shop. They have rearranged the inside with a more practical layout to provide more seating. Everything was new and bright. The menu is primarily Mexican items like burritos and tacos but does have a few American options like chicken wings and burgers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Latino Burrito-rice, beans, pork, sweet plantains, beef, tomatoes, sausage and cheese. It was enormous and very tasty. Not too salty but enough spice from everything for a good flavor. I love that it had plantains in it. My boyfriend had a BBQ steak burrito. It too was very large and he enjoyed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The girl behind the counter was very nice. She came over a few times to ask if we needed anything and pleasantly brought over more condiments when we asked. The cook also asked us how things were too. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the way out I noticed they had prepared plantains in the hot case so I got one to-go. It was warm with melted butter and sugar. Awesome! They also have a bakery case with muffins, cookies, cake slices, etc. I got an apple turnover to go. I would think they use a local bakery for that stuff. \n",

      "Where this place is located there are almost 10 other Mexican places within a couple blocks of it. I would give it a shot if your looking to try the newest one.\n",
      "Another stop on my tour de Boston. I guess because most of Boston is a \"college town\" (according to my friends who live there), not much opens up before 10 or 11am. Since my flight back to Chicago was early and I was hungry, this was one of the few, if not only, places open at 7am! I believe the cuisine is Colombian -they have basic egg dishes in the a.m. with a Latin American twist. Since Boston native Katie S. drove me to the airport, I treated her and my friend and the entire bill was $19.26. Not too shabby -that was including each of our entrees and we each ordered a fresh fruit juice blend. I can't remember what my entree was called but it was basically an omelet with some veggies in it and an arepa which is sort of like a thicker, more durable tortilla -if that makes any sense. I wouldn't consider anything on the menu \"Mexican\" as I am pretty familiar with Mexican cuisine. It may be a hybrid of other Latin American cultures besides Colombian -I admit I'm not as familiar with other cuisines. Summary: cute little place, friendly service and a very, very good price for 3 people!\n",

      "\n",
      "Anyway, D'Angelos has something going for it that those Quiznos types wouldn't even understand...a grill.  So when you order your steak & cheese, steak bomb, or my favorite and a D'Angelos specialty, a No. 9, the steak gets cooked wholly on a grill instead of just heated up in an oven as seems to be passable now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back when I worked full time in the Fenway, I'd eat lunch here more than my bank account probably cared for, so the cool guys working here would hook it up with coupons and other loyal customer making devices like that.  Plus they'd come around and hand out coupon strips on the occasion at the retail establishment nearby where I work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in all the times I've been here for lunch, my order only got screwed up once since it got forgotten, and so took a little longer than normal.  I think it was someone's first day as I didn't recognize the cashier, not that it would have bothered me anyway...30 minute lunch breaks at work were always simply a suggestion for me anyway.\n",

I mean... come on. That's great! \n",

If someone asks for a recommendation for a HK-style cake in Boston, this is on top of my list.\n",

      "Wanna know something funny? I don't think my parents ever taught me \"if you don't have something nice to say don't say it at all\". Although I do think the 200 something people that know me on Yelp.. and the 1000s of people I've met on my travels around Boston for the past 6+ years (I've worked/volunteered a LOT in this town) know that I'm pretty tolerant of things/people and I'm generally jovial. Yes, I said jovial. When I do poke fun, a lot of the time it's at myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I was taught, was that if someone attacked me then I had the right to defend myself. I thought a bit about writing this update because I don't think retaliation is always the best way to approach things but you made it personal by mentioning my name.. so here goes. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll admit.. my review of Wheeler's is a bit rough.. but I've seen worse and this is the flat out truth. Yours however is a lie. I have 3 witnesses that can say there were no people in the shop when we went in. 5 including the staff.. but for some reason I think you know the staff.. which if you read the italics as you were writing your accusatory review.. states.. \"if you know the owner or have a conflict of interests, please don't review\". \n",

      "I was in a celebratory mood that day. It was my last day at work and after I had celebrated/hugged/laughed with co-workers, I had been invited for frosty goodness at Wheeler's. I was even told I'd be treated because the person inviting me (not Yihwa) had had Wheeler's before. She is vegan and was/is a big fan. Since she couldn't have any ice cream that day (due to allergies).. I refused her offer to pay because I felt bad (who wouldn't?). And since I was in such a good/non-argumentative mood I made my order as quick and as painless as possible. Chocolate and peanut butter in a medium cup.. NO QUESTIONS asked. I was not told my ice cream was almost out. I was in fact told that peanut butter was one of my cashier's favorites.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'll admit I shared a laugh with the owner when he first poked fun at Yihwa while she was choosing ice cream. Looking back on it now, who says everything is experimental? The owner said everything was experimental. Where's the control in the situation? But with no real tried and true method, should he taste all of flavors to ensure quality? Not that he should personally do that himself.. but that seems somewhat off. Where's the consistency?\n",

I don't know if you had your super secret binoculars on, but from my angle, I have no idea how anyone else could have seen him do it since we were leaning on the counter.

      "Restaurant: Fort Hill Bar & Grill\n",
      "9/25/2017 This was my second time at Fort Hill Bar&Grill and it was very disappointing. Note: this review is solely about the service and the way the place operates. We did not eat a meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We attended what was billed as their Grand Opening this past Sunday from 3-6 pm. Upon entering shortly after 4pm I there was a nice crowd in the establishment eating and chatting, buoying my hopes for a successful dining experience. Unfortunately for the 60 plus minutes that we were there not only did we not get to order but, by the time I was able to get someone's attention I was curtly told that the kitchen was closed. I found this to be confusing because when we were initially seated (limited brunch menus were on the table) and gave our drink order, the waitress returned with our drinks asked if we wanted to order then never returned to our table until we were ready to leave, frustrated by the news of the kitchen closing delivered by another waitress. Our original waitress told us that the reason we didn't get to order was our fault since we weren't ready when she asked. An untrue statement because when the waitress started to take our order she turned to me first. Since I was the last to arrive to table (only on street parking!) I nudged my daughter and told her to go first. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the waitress interpreted that as not being ready because she walked away from the table (I'm not even sure if she promised to come back) and we didn't see her again for another 40 minutes or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to get the attention of another waitress who told us that kitchen was closed. When I explained our dilemma, she stared at me blankly stating she would let someone know.  An older gentleman in a suit came over to our table with a large tray of empanadas. He offered them to us as I guess a peace offering. But even this gesture was sloppy because didn't have place settings or bread plates. When I pointed this out to him he told us to use the cocktail napkins on the table. Oh yeah cause if the kitchen is closed then there's no clean dishes! We hungrily accepted the cold empanadas waiting to see if further nourishment would be offered to make up for the gross oversight. I then decided to get up and let the owner know what had happened. Once again she told me the kitchen was closed but, would be reopening in 30 minutes. She said our dinner order would go to the top of the list. I declined. Not because I didn't think my meal wouldn't be good. I'd eaten there about a month ago and the food was tasty. I declined, because the service was so poor that at one point my daughter got up to refill my water glass. \n",
      "\n",
      "The waitstaff on one of the most important days was so focused on serving the VIPs (Mayor Walsh) and taking photos, that they ignored the local, paying customers. This isn't a good way to gain community support for your business. Mayor Walsh won't be the one coming to Roxbury weekly for a Friday evening meal. Poor service without comping your customers can seriously hurt a restaurant's reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we were leaving the assistant manager (there wasn't a shortage of staff just good service) approached us to say that our original waitress wanted us to know that she thought we weren't ready to order. Huh? Why are you wasting us time making excuses for an employee who clearly is not ready to work in a restaurant? This was a bad move on his part.  It made it crystal clear why the place doesn't function as well as the local Friday's in South Bay. Stop making excuses and hire some quality staff so diners will want to eat there!\n",
      "I often walk to/from Downtown Boston to/from our home in South Newton via Washington St. and the Arboretum (10 miles in total).  It's a very interesting walk, but the three miles between Mass Ave. and Forest Hills are now and always have been a culinary desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd been intrigued by the Fort Hill Bar & Grill since it opened this summer - it stands out as a clean, modern restaurant in a neighborhood that has very few dining choices (particularly between Egleston and Dudley, where there are maybe one or two other commercial establishments - a liquor store and a convenience store).\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I finally checked out the Fort Hill menu and, having missed my normal lunch, decided to give it a try.  The haddock imperial with crabmeat sounded good and it did not disappoint.  I'm a haddock expert (we usually make fortnightly trips to Maine so I can get my fill) and this plate went above and beyond - a fresh and flaky filet, generously sized, with a delicious lemon-butter sauce that had a fresh pico de gallo folded in.  The sauce wasn't too heavy and it had a perfect kick to it.  Very balanced and well-prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been trying for the last 20 years to find a go-to haddock spot in Boston, and now I've finally found one.  If you like fresh seafood, order the haddock imperial and you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To drink I had a homemade guava-tamarind smoothie which was also very delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only wish they had more vegetarian options - I spoke with the owner and she said that they did have a homemade veggie burger for a while but there wasn't much demand for it, and since they make everything fresh the chef decided they couldn't keep it on the menu.  She did say that the Sunday brunch always has a vegetarian menu which varies based on the chef's choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the Fort Hill Bar & Grill will be successful because it's a real asset to the community and sorely needed.  There's nothing like it in a two- or three-mile radius.  The owner said that she had owned the bar that had been on the same site a couple of years before - I was happy to hear this, as I'd presumed from the very modern appearance of the place that it was opened by some wealthy outside investors.  Also, the owner mentioned that she would be carrying on her tradition of offering up a free Thanksgiving meal to the community on Wednesday.  Well done. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, it's definitely worth the trip.  For out-of-towners, that area of Roxbury (Washington Street and points west) is perfectly safe, and Fort Hill has some amazing history and architecture including the Victorian water tower and its surrounding square of townhouses on Fort Ave., with great views of the city and some unique outcroppings of Roxbury puddingstone.  I would recommend that you park directly on Washington Street, which has plenty of free parking.\n",

      "So happy to have a Thai restaurant in the neighborhood now! Got the pad see ew which is my go to and it was made perfectly. Noodles were not mushy or overly wet. It wasn't too sweet which I liked and they used chinese broccoli which I don't really see all that often for some reason. I'll be coming here a lot. Also welcome to the neighborhood!\n",
      "we got take out. the containers were smaller than average asian restaurants' takeout containers. but since they just opened up so we decided to give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "we had the chicken pad thai (a must for a thai restaurant), crispy chicken over rice and the jtk chicken wings. the pad thai didnt have any color but surprisely it was not bad. the pad thai flavoring was just right, it definitely wasnt overwhelming or too much sauce. the crispy chicken was actually crispy. the sauce on the chicken was actually not bad. they just covered the chicken with the sauce, instead of drizzling it all over. we preferred a little more sauce. the jtk wings was good. but when you get to the bottom of the container, you can tell the sauce was really thick. but when we had the chicken wings, our fingers werent too sticky from the sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was ok overall, but we will go back again if we want to have thai again.\n",

      "i feel like this place deserves 4.5\n",
      "screw that. im making it a fifthstar!\n",
      "i ordered here with my roommate on new years day. the food was good and quick. the person who took our order was very nice and we had our dinner at the front door within half an hour. \n",
      "their food was very clean and prices were very fair. scallion pancakes were yummy. ive never enjoyed chinese take out as much as i enjoyed this one. and no, i wasn't hung over. in the least bit.\n",
      "This place seemed to pop up out of nowhere at the end of my street.  I picked up a take-out menu out of curiosity, but I immediately dismissed the place, since, as a vegetarian, I'm generally wary of Chinese places that have \"bean curd\" instead of tofu on the menu. My girlfriend doesn't share my arbitrary prejudice, fortunately, so we ended up ordering some take out from them tonight.  I was pleasantly surprised.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up our take out order, and as soon as I set foot in the door I immediately liked the place.  It had a nice, big, clean (and sadly empty) dining room, it was well decorated, and the three ladies who were working there were all smiles and very friendly as I paid and picked up my food.  They were well dressed, and I could tell they were trying to give a good first impression.  The two I talked to (and the one I spoke to on the phone) spoke English very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The General Gao's bean curd was surprisingly good.  It was lightly fried, and the sauce was served on the side.  The girlfriend likes brown rice, and they had a brown rice option here (which we hardly ever see anywhere).  The veggie lo mein was better than most, but the missus wasn't crazy about the broccoli in garlic sauce, although I thought it was pretty good.   My fortune cookie told me I was a kind and understanding person, and the girlfriend's cookie told her she had a sympathetic heart, so I guess these were more like compliment cookies.  I'm easily flattered, though, so I was okay with it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't vouch for any of the meat dishes, but they were highly satisfying for a pair of herbivores.  They're definitely my new go-to Chinese place.\n",

      "¡Los desayunos son deliciosos y peligrosos!\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I initially balked at the price point of over $6 for a breakfast plate, once I actually saw what was served, it became clear that you're getting one gigantic serving of food when you order it.  The desayuno con chorizo (well, what -else- did you expect me to order?) came on an enormous plastic platter with a generous pool of refried beans, a huge scrambled mess of chorizo and egg, four huge slices of browned plantains, and a little (excessive) cup of sour cream.  Tossing in a jalapeño from one of the containers sitting on the counters kicks up the flavor a notch, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authenticity of a meal here is pretty much unquestionable.  Not only does the help speak a marginal amount of English, not a single other customer who came in the door spoke English either.  Plus, it was a handy opp to practice mi español, claro.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to holes-in-the-wall, Rosticeria Cancun epitomizes what makes them so unexpectedly wonderful to stumble upon.\n",
      "This place owns my soul now, what with its unrivaled awesomeness. In fact, I would pay to see a cage fight between anything from Rosticeria Cancun and the wimpy, flavorless, heatless Bolocco \"burritos\" everyone drools over. I can tell you that an RC pupusa would absolutely body-drop a Bolocco. It would make that Bolocco its bitch. (Imagine two burritos wrestling. Cute, right?)\n",
      "\n",
      "Rosticeria Cancun is a teeny tiny little hole-in-the-wall storefront in Maverick, with maybe nine stools, a tiny bar, and no actual counter at which to order. (You kind of hang in the space between the kitchen and the \"restaurant\" itself.) If you're like me, you order off the menu in extremely broken Spanish--which itself comes with a kind of nasal-faux-Italian-by-way-of-Pennsylvania Dutch accent--and for some reason, instead of using the only word you actually KNOW in Spanish (\"gracias\") you instead say \"k, thanks, bye.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "But no worries. Non-counter help is friendly and kind and quick, and I promise I won't be such an [insert Babelfish translation of \"ri-TARD\" here] next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food is fantastic. I mean this. The food is unequivocally authentic, served fresh and hot (read: just fried) and tasty. I would easily give away my firstborn for just a side of rice and beans (how does someone make a simple protein and grain taste that flavorful? Ah. Yes. Lard.) All of the meat is tender, spicy and delicious. The salsas and hot sauces provided are zingy and tomato-y and fresh, with actual jalapeno seeds floating about. I didn't even get mad at the piles of cilantro. Three tacos, rice, beans, salad, and half an avocado (?) set me back less than $9, and constituted at least 2 meals. I think pupusas and tacos a la carte are a buck and change; burritos somewhere around $5-6. Nothing tops $13. What. The. What. Oh, and they have beef tongue.\n",

      "My tortillas did come from a packet and then grilled but the toppings were fresh. I had them all the way, one chicken, one beef and one pork. Loaded up with salsa and guac and sour cream and onions and tomatoes and then cilantro, they were awesomely tasty. Loaded to the max. Yum!\n",

      "Best Hatian Food In Hyde Park Period....didnt get 5 stars cause they kinda on the pricey side with their dishes\n",
      "Like many other have said, the customer service can be horrible at this place. I think they assume that everyone who orders from this place must be Haitian. Bad assumption. They speak to you in Creole and when you dont understand them they seem to get frustrated... sucking of the teeth... so Haitian. I can say that because I am a surrogate Haitian. Anyways... what does save this place is the food. Very good, hands down my favorite Haitian outside of Brockton. I recommend the chicken, make sure they give you extra red sauce and picklez (doubt I spelled it right). I like to get one of my Haitian friends to order for me because I feel like you would get better service, although they complain too, so who knows.\n",

      "That being said, they have a $5 card minimum, and they made the large iced coffee $4.95 after tax? Are you serious. I grabbed a small bag of vegan granola near the register because I didn't want a pastry that would be stale in a few hours and my total somehow came to $10. \n",

I was dropping someone off at the airport and was looking for any place that was open at 4AM and I saw this bakery located in the North End that's open all day, all night. Ding-ding-ding! So I drove down here where the streets are narrow and only parallel parking kings and queens dare to park. Prices are a tad bit high but looking at what they bring to the table, homemade baked goodness whenever you want in one of the more prominent areas of Boston, I say make that money Bova's Bakery.\n",

      "Large Lobster Tail- I haven't had a good one in ages. Ages! And not having to wait in line around these parts for this, I had to grab 2 for myself and it was pure pleasure in my mouth. Very flakey pastry with enough denseness in the bottom to hold this luscious sweet cream of all cream right in the center. Absolutely amazing. \n",
      "Spinach and Cheese Arancini- Speaking of dense, this hefty size ball is tightly stuffed with cheese and spinach inside a deep fried rice ball. The marinara sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment for this.\n",

Good local pizza, pretty cheap, and reliable delivery.  This is definitely a takeout or delivery place- there are only a few little tables inside.\n",

They are always very friendly and willing to chat with you while they are making your sandwich. Don't see a sandwich that suits your craving? Don't be afraid to ask them for what you want, they are always happy to make you just what you want if they have the stuff to make it. I live in the area, so I find myself cutting through the food court a lot, and if they see me, I always get a wave, smile, or handshake.

      "The ice cream wasn't bad - it's made with coconut milk and other animal-free products. It was creamy and not icy, like other vegan ice creams I've tried. The chocolate ice cream was subtle but with the graham cracker bits and pieces of marshmallow, it was a nice textural treat. The prices are competitive with other local Ice cream shops - so if you're looking to shake things up and try a new sweet spot, give FoMu a try!\n",
      "I love this place!!!!!!! 100% vegan dessert shop. The frozen treats are coconut milk and avocado based but they don't taste too strongly of either one. They have super unique and creative flavors here. Sample some before you commit to an order!!! All of the flavors are so fun and amazing. I've had the lavender and blueberry shortbread. Both are super delish!!\n",

Two entirely separate people's orders also got mixed up: the person who asked for no cilantro actually got the bowl WITH cilantro. One person wait nearly 20 minutes for their food.

I was sick of all the icky meats used in traditional pho (rubbery chicken skins and duck still on the bone). It's just not satisfying. We have two vegetarians in our groups and I've always noticed how full and colorful their bowls always look. My belly grumbled in resposse. I then pulled an out-of-character move and ordered the #89, a vegetarian/tofu option at Pho Thien Thien. It was so good, I will never go back to ordering my pho with meat ever again.

The tour guides are really personable but I found it boring, overpriced, and kinda bootleg. They just brought a pizza to the group at 3 random park benches and told everyone to grab a slice. I personally figure you don't really need a tour guide to find pizza shops in the north end... They're everywhere.\n",

      "I've been to the Tous Les Jours in Burlington several times and it's not my favorite - just okay. I wouldn't go out-of-my-way to come to a TLJ. I think I might like Paris Baguette a little more. However, I can't complain about the baked goods here. Nothing here is terrible or sub-par.

I thought the mini pain aux raisins in an open box was cute and creative. They also have mini pain au chocolat or mini plain croissants, which is great for snacking. I sampled their green tea bread and I might buy it the next time I'm around.\n",

      "The mango mousse cakes here are so good! The cake is light and fluffy while the mousse is like a soft creamy texture that you can tell is made fresh with real mangoes. It is such a treat to buy a single serving-sized square of it on my way home from work. They also offer larger mango mousse cakes that you can order in advance with writing for birthday parties or other celebrations. You can add a layer of fresh mango slices to the outside for an additional $1 (essentially encasing the entire cake in mango -- perfect for fruit lovers). I once ordered an 8 inch birthday cake without adding the mango slices and it was still a huge hit because they decorated the outside very nicely with colored cream. Another item I really like here is the chocolate Swiss roll. I've tried this at other nearby bakeries and always found the chocolate flavor to be too faint. At 180 Cafe, their chocolate Swiss roll is FULL of chocolately flavor and the texture is so dense/rich with just the right amount of cream filling.\n",

I reached out to the bakery, and the response was prompt and friendly. I was in touch with Fernando, who was very informative with ordering a birthday cake. I went with the coconut tres leches cake. I was a little worried how everything would turn out since I was ordering from out of state but Fernando was very reassuring and detailed the entire process. I was able to pay over the phone and confirmed the delivery information.\n",

There are a half dozen in the Boston market, then Chicago and finally the west coast. And yes, it's the first stop I make after getting off the plane at SFO.  So I ponied right up when I had five minutes to myself this week during a business trip to Boston to get some of the best drip coffee this side of the Continental Divide. As a former west coaster, I find the lack of good dark 'crack cocaine of coffee' too hard to find. This store, though not particularly welcoming for their lack [none] of seating gets the pertinent details right - mainly how to roast and brew one unforgettable cup of coffee. I've been before; and I'll be back again.\n",

      "I always get their bistec taco, which consists of grilled steak, a smattering of avocado spread, cheese, and a chipotle crema. They don't skimp on their fillings! You can always expect lots of flavorful steak strips. The steak and avocado combination is amazing! They go together so well. :- ) \n",

      "\n",
      "I've also tried their smoked tofu taco, which consists of refried beans, salsa, crema sauce, and a few chunks of fried tofu. I found this taco to be lacking when compared to the bistec. The refried beans didn't help the dryness, either! The salsa addition​ was probably the best part because it added some pizzazz to an otherwise plain taco. \n",

It stinks up the immediate area you are sitting in (take care when you are in a crammed lecture hall haha) but it is fairly filling and decently priced.

I went expecting some kind of California nouveau thing based on the flyers stating that everything is all natural this and gluten free this and fresh that...I was kind of shocked when I walked in and watched my steak terriyaki wrap being made.  Pre-fried noodles sitting in a canister (when I bit into the wrap a bunch of them were hard and it was kind of gross), pre-marinated yet flavorless meat just sitting there, and pre-mixed soggy vegetables, all smooshed together in a flavorless tortilla.  And for over $6 the wrap was small.  When I order a $6 wrap I expect it to weigh a metric ton- guess I should have gone with a burrito.  Plus it was mostly mushy cabbage- just filler.  I finished my wrap feeling like I hadn't eaten anything, except that I found it kind of gross so my desire to eat had vanished even though I was technically still hungry.\n",

Their prices are very reasonable with most of the entrees around $15. Last time I was there I had the salmon, which was done nicely. Our table shared several desserts, all of which were delicious. The best thing about this place, however, for me is the price. It's hard to find this kind of nice atmosphere with a reasonable price. If you're looking more for very very good food, there are better places to go, but you will not regret going to Laurel if you want to be conservative with your cash.

We just arrived and ordered our first drinks and food , took one sip of our drinks when a woman (supervisor) walked out of the kitchen area and informed me that my friend could not have any more drinks because \"she was too drunk and  causing trouble.\" First of all, my friend had one canned margarita before she left the house almost an hour before. Secondly, we were in the restaurant for about 5 minites and obly spoke with the bartender and security guard.  Then supervisor became rude and beligerent my friend and then told us we had to leave...with oir drinks still on thr counter.  I can attest to the fact that neither my friend nor I were drunk, nor did my friend cause any trouble. I'm not sure what the supervisor's problem was but it was extemely unprofessional and incredibly insulting.\n",
      "We went in for a bite. Ordered 2 beers & 2 chicken ceasar salads.  The beers were fine, but the salads took 35 minutes each.  We were kind of in a hurry, so after about 25 minutes, we asked for the food wrapped to go.  My buddy went ahead, and I waited to pay and grab our food. I would never normally be upset about a long wait time - but we were literally the only people in the place.  The salads were nowhere near the chicken ceasar advertised - the dressing was more of a creamy italian, no croutons, no parmesan cheese, and shaved lettuce v. the typical ceasar variety.\n",

The chef revealed that he made the Mushroom Bisque with chicken stock ('hey, I was trained in a French restaurant, what do you expect?'). I pointed out that their sign claims the soup is vegetarian, so they took it down. Who knows how many people relied on that sign?

The eggplant slices came in a thin layer, but were nice and moist. The sprinkle of feta wasn't overwhelming, but was just enough to add some flavor. Actually there wasn't a lot of anything (neither caramelized onion, nor roasted pepper, nor tomato) - I had to open the other half of my sandwich to see if there was any evidence of the caramelized onion - yup! There it is! Hiding under the eggplant. But for not a lot of any item in particular, it added up to a tasty sandwich that I'd order again. A half sandwich with the cookie and the chips would make a decent light lunch. But no, I finished off the other half in the afternoon.\n",

From my understanding the white chocolate was worse...but I'm biased against white chocolate to begin with. In my eyes, not only is the gelato poor, but expensive too.\n",

To that end, we headed on the opposite direction, hoping to wind up in some Back Bay hot spot.  Our cab dropped us off at the Four Seasons.  When we arrived, we realized that it would probably not be classy to walk into the hotel bar carrying the water bottle of red bull and vodka that we were sharing, 17-yr old style, so Crazypants (CP) got rid of that shit.  Yeah, we're cool.\n",

Since I hadn't had dinner, we decided to pop into Aujourd'hui (which is french for \"today\" in case you dont know and in case I decide to make any jokes about that later in this review) and check out their selection.

      "Let's flash forward to the arrival of the much-anticipated cheese plate.  That shit had the three smallest pieces of cheese on it that I have ever seen, and some figgy jelly goo that to be honest, could have been anything.  I was pissed that a microscope didn't come with the cheese plate so I could see the damn cheese.  There is no way this wasn't the three ends of whatever cheese they had from the rest of today.  At least, I hope it was.  Because if this was their TWENTY DOLLAR cheese plate, I would hate to see their lobster dish.  It would probably be the runt lobster that ran into the honey I shrunk the kids machine and ended up slapped on a plate in Boston.  Weak.\n",

Shut up.  Seriously, don't train them to do that.  Your cheese plate is pretentious enough as it is.  Don't make things worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Host Two: this is the guy that hits on the women who are trying to enjoy a tiny tiny bit of cheese at 930 on a Friday night.  We don't want to talk to you.  You're the host at a restaurant.  Why don't you try your luck on the cougars at Clink?  Goodbye forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Waiter One:  this is the guy who couldnt grasp the fact that we wanted a cheese plate, only a cheese plate, not a full meal, just cheese.  Don't give this guy the benefit of the doubt either - he wasn't french or anything.  He was an American, like you and I.  Well, like I.  Anyway this guy was annoying and I wanted to kick him.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Waiter Two:  Oh. Brother.  Where do I start.  This man appeared to see how things were going and fill our water and see if we wanted more wine - I THINK.  He came up to the table and mumbled something incoherent that sounded like \"hlkfhjdsklfjslgjl;jgl;djg;dgjd\"  and it didn't get any better or more clear.  Now THIS guy may have been foreign.  But as Crazypants says: \"I'm French, not retarded.\"  This guy was almost certainly both.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it looks like I'm Aujourd'hui's first crappy review.  Oh well.  Maybe this will inspire Auhourd'hui to serve a better cheese plate - TODAY, not tomorrow. HE HE HE HE I'm so clever.\n",
      "My meal at Aujourd'hui was almost 2 years ago, but it still lingers in my mind as one of my most abysmal \"fine dining\" experiences to date.  So yelp, here you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, let me say that the hostess and the bar at AJH are lovely.  The setting is lovely, the ambiance is lovely, romance is so thick in the air that you half expect white doves to flutter down and tie ribbons into your hair.  When I made the reservation for my husband and myself, they were so perfectly gracious (\"is this for a special occasion?\") that I wanted to take an early flight to Boston just to have the meal sooner.  Not to mention all the rave reviews that place AJH at the top of most fine dining lists in the Boston area.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived a few minutes early to have a glass of champagne in the bar area, and our interactions with the hostess and the bartender were just as positive as my initial telephone conversation.  However, once we were seated, the floor dropped out from under us and we found ourselves in the seventh circle of hell.  A beautiful, romantic hell...but hell nonetheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if it's because my husband and I look younger than our 30-something years that we were treated this way, the fact that I left my Harry Winstons and Dior pantsuit at home, or if our server just woke up on the wrong side of the \"lit,\" but the service during our meal was appalling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the chef's tasting menu, which looked awesome.  My husband ordered several selections a la carte from their menu.  But when we asked our server to help us choose a couple bottles of wine to go with the meal (I did not opt for the wine pairing), he simply flipped opened the wine list to the \"$50 and under\" section of their extensive list, and assured us that any of those would be good choices for our meal.  When we asked about our other options, he seemed exasperated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As our meal continued, and the service became increasingly pretentious and condescending, I found myself wondering how I was going to make it through 4 more courses without throwing my napkin down and walking out.  Really, any pleasurable aspect of the food we were served was completely negated by the service we received.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The assistant server, who presented several of our beautifully-plated courses, could not even remember what she was putting on our table.  The lobster bisque that my husband ordered was so salty that it was pretty much inedible (we were starving, so we choked it down anyways rather than deal with our server voluntarily). \n",
      " \n",
      "The coup de grâce came with dessert, when our server unceremoniously picked up a spoon and hacked into my sexy Valrhona Chocolate Soufflé, rendering it just as deflated as I had felt through our entire meal.  We had also ordered a cheese plate to share, and when it was served, our served remarked, \"I'm sure I don't need to tell YOU what these are.\"  I'm sorry.  Did I ask too many questions about the cheese?  Did he take offense to the fact that we're from the San Francisco bay area and that's where the majority of the cheeses on their menu were from, so we were familiar with a few of them?  Was he put off by the fact that neither of us care for goat's milk cheese?  I suppose I'll never know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say that writing this review has certainly been a cathartic experience for me, and I can now forget all about AJH and the $450 it pick-pocketed from us.  Plenty of more worthy fine dining options in the Boston area to choose from.\n",

It is served with briar patch fresh raspberries and blackberries (tasted just like they were from my families estate in the rural Berkshires) along with fresh strawberries and Finales signature cookie chunks (more like a delectable brownie) plus white cake AND Finales home made gelato! \n",

      "The set up of this Borders is such a mess and so large and disorganized that you almost get lost trying to figure out the sections. The stacks are very high and it is hard to see anything on the upper shelves. Add in that there is hardly any staff to assist you on the floor and the existing staff behind the counter is in la la land and you have a place that you want to avoid. They have an upstairs with DVDs and other random items plus the Seattle's Best Coffee where you will find most of the time, people just hanging around for hours. Skip this spot and head over to Boylston or one of the many other locations in downtown.\n",
      "Oy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over all I much prefer B&N but since there's not one near work this is where I come to kill time.  the store itself is laid out strangely and I've never quite figured out the layout.  Mind you I have no real intention of learning their layout so there's that.  \n",
      "What gets me most about this place is the near constant lines coupled with the hideous prices and the fact that it smells like urine in the elevator and on the second floor.  Since their escalators are often on the fritz you're forced to take to the elevator and hold your breath for a while.  Fun times.\n",
      "\n",
      "They often have \"big\" 30% off sales on their DVDs but even at 30% off their prices are too high.  Really, $65 for one season of a TV show?!? I guess when compared to FYE's bend over and take it pricing structure it's not as bad but still, wow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oddly their bargain books are always outside.  The section for them inside is eensy and contains more kid's books than anything.

Their breakfast sandwich tastes home made because it is, even the english muffin and sausage, and the cheese they use, forget about it!\n",

      "In the afternoon they are also serving an Italian style flatbread sandwich. Basically the Classic consisted of a unique style of wrap/flatbread filled with prosciutto, arugula, and some type of aioli. Exceeded my expectations, it was really good but there was too much aioli at some parts. Good thing it was delicious.\n",

We're talking 1 egg, 1 slice of cheddar, and sausage on a english muffin for $6.  Last week I paid $5 for the same sandwich.  Next week?  Maybe they'll add coffee and call it an even $10.\n",

      "I set up a an event there for my company this summer for the board of directors and the management team, and they were a dream to work with. We had full use of their lower level dining area (which was gorgeous, dark brown exposed beams) and both the chef and the owner sat down with me to compose a menu that would facilitate a social dining experience for our higher-ups. The pricing was also insanely competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later I went there with my husband and the owner recognized me even though we'd only met once months previously. I found both the food and the service to be quite good, however now I'm almost worried it was mostly because they were hoping to impress me so I'd send more corporate events their way. I thought the appetizers were great, as were the entrees (I'll be honest, I'm not big on Italian food, which I always assume is pasta smothered in sauce, so maybe I'm easy to please)\n",
      "\n",
      "I was (both times) impressed by their wine selection...I hope that the negative experiences people have been having there as of late are just a fluke (obviously I feel really badly for the people who had such miserable experiences) since I was impressed with both the service and the food, both on an individual level as well as as a venue for holding corporate events.\n",
      "I was fortunate enough to come here gratis with a large group, so I got to try a lot of La Brace's offerings. Their appetizers are delicious. Our group partook of the Fall Caprese (mozzarella and cherry tomatoes), the lobster-stuffed mushrooms, calamari duetto and zuppa di cozze (mussells in sauce). I especially recommend the mushrooms and the fall caprese. The entrees we ordered were the grilled veal chop (which was quite a large dish to our pleasant surprise), grilled salmon, chicken tortellini, and shrimp scampi. The only dish that we really had ANY complaint about was the salmon, which was a little dry. The owner, Gail, is really attentive to her patrons, and the ambiance was nice and relaxed. They have an excellent wine selection as well. I do not particularly like white wine, but I would definitely recommend Lacrima Christi since it has less of a dry taste. A great place to go with a group if you can reserve the downstairs (especially for an engagement party or bridal shower dinner), and an even better place to go out to with a date. The quality of the food was well worth the price.\n",

      "If you went to BC, your Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights usually ended one of three ways. 1) at CheChi's waiting in line for a delicious sausage and peppers or the equally awesome kielbasa, 2) urinating in your dorm common room and alienating your roommates, or 3) in an uncomfortable and awkward situation. Or if you were really lucky, then all of the above.\n",

I seek out his cart after every Sox game I attend, just like I'd seek out his cart on the BC campus after striking out again on a weekend night in college.

      "\n",
      "As a true BC Eagle, I had my first Che-Chi's hotdog on a drunken weekend night as I stumbled across the holy St. Ignatius Church. I didn't remember a thing from the possibly wonderful party that night, I didn't know where the heck I actually got the money from, and god knows (literally) where I was going wondering around Comm ave at that hour, BUT, I DO remember the divine tastiness of my first Che-Chi's hotdog. Ever since that first bite, I was hooked like a serious addict and I would wait for the Che-Chi dudes to visit campus each weekend and get a nose full of the fresh grill smell of hotdog, chicken, sausages....etc with the peppers and onions... and then i'd have to take some time to decide which sandwich I should go for, it's always a struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some cool things about this hotdog stand is that, a) Che-chi's make their own secret sauce for the sandwiches and I have no idea what this secret mix is (even when I am sober, I promise, I usually am), but it's a perfect balance of hot, sweet, salty, smokey and tanginess all in one.  b) They sometimes give you a free bottle of beverage with any sandwich purchase, which I think is a great deal around Fenway park.\n",

      "This store used to be one of the best. Now, there are no more deli sandwiches, they're frequently out of the items one needs and the employees don't bother communicating to the customers. When I last stopped in, the person behind the counter was so busy with their cell phone thay barely registered my presence. It's a shame because, under the previous owner, this was a well stocked, courteous store that boasted a first rate deli. All of that is a thing of the past.\n",
      "LOVE THIS PLACE. The original convenience store that was in this location when I moved into Allston was like a scene from a horror movie. Outdated and expired products, stale tobacco, terrible employees..the works. The building experienced some fire damage about a year ago, and up until a couple months ago when M&M moved in it was vacant. I could not be happier living on Glenville and now having this store here! They are one of the very VERY few convenience stores in Allston to carry fresh fruit or vegetables of any kind, with prices that are extremely fair. They are never out of stock of anything without it being replaced ASAP, and they carry a large variety of everything you would expect in a local store. But the REAL leg up M&M has on other local convenience stores is its DELI! Not only can you buy fresh sliced Boar's Head meats and cheeses by the pound, but you can also by $5 fresh foot long subs made in front of you. They aren't premade and stored in the fridge...but you order exactly what you want and they slice the meats and cheese in front of you and make you a delicious sub that for $5 is not found anywhere else in this city. On top of all that, the staff are incredibly friendly and very personable. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to pick up some groceries, grab a snack, or (my personal favorite) grab a delicious $5 fresh sub!\n",

Haddock is one of my favorite fish, so I was excited to know the sandwich was made with this type of fish. While the sandwich did not skimpy on the fish, they also did not skimp on the SALT!! Would I try them again, maybe, but I would ask that they refrain from using too much salt.\n",
      "If you have some time and only if you have time, stop by and grab a fish sandwich or afish and chips.  They are sooo damn good.  This place is my new fav spot.  If you're in a rush DON'T GO!! Everything is made to order including the fries.\n",

It started with a dysfunctional ordering system and got worse from there.  I managed to order a Corned Beef on a Bulkie Roll  with brown mustard.  I requested pickles with it.  I was informed that they cost extra and of course I said no problem. My sandwich was thrown together like it was on an assembly line.  The corned beef was not freshly cut it was taken with tongs out of a tray of previously cut meat. Then the meat was placed on a panini maker to warm up I don't recall asking for hot corned beef WTF Anyway not to prolong a bad review my sandwich was skimpy (see my photo below) I was charged extra for a few not even bite sized slices of pickle. They must get 20 slices from one small pickle.  RIPOFF.  Fifteen dollars for a small crappy sandwich made incorrectly and few extra small bites of pickle. Also note I went to the rest room down a small hallway and there was meat just sitting on a cart next to the bathrooms Discusting‼ And the cashier wears his pants down his butt? Is he a ex-prisoner advertising??  \n",

There's a whole lot of food going on here. A healthy portion of thin-sliced turkey, followed by stuffing and then cranberry sauce. Nicely done and I could barely eat half. Tasty and a good portion. I will likely be ordering from Max's again.\n",

      "I can see why people love this, because I do think Mass food (not the kind in church, but the Bostonian kind) is often disappointing, so this is a very good sub comparably speaking in this region. However, overall, I found their steak and cheese to be juicy, but just okay, and their chicken parm to be juicy and tomato-y but fairly average, and nothing that I would rush back to order again.'\n",

      "\n",
      "Too often when eating a cheesesteak, I'm disappointed because the huge roll obscures the fact that the steak is reaalllly thinly shaved - and that there's not much of it to begin with. This is absolutely not the case here. While the steak is shaved somewhat thinly by definition, there's sooooo much of it in a large sandwich that you could easily split it in half and save it for later. Not to mention the fact that it's soooo delightfully cheesy. So much so that my car stunk - in such a good way - for days afterwards with the smell of all the cheese, steak, and grease. Mmmmmm!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It would all be even better if the staffers could wear their masks over their noses and if customers were encouraged to wear masks too.

Ive gone a few times and my favorite is the steak and rice, and ask for banana peppers on the side! However, chicken and goat dishes are both good as well.

      "When this truck is parked it is by far the best pizza on offer in the downtown area. The crust is delicious, salty and gorgeous. I love the goopy tomato sauce fired to perfection. They cut it into slices to appease the takeout crowd that frequents the food truck, but be warned the center is generally that somewhat messily neopolitan authentic middle. I have tasted the meat options and love the basic pepperoni. \n",

I'm thrilled he decided to open a place closer to home. \n",
      "We've tried a little bit of everything, subs, pizza, salads, dinners. The salads are fresh (try the delicious honey-ginger dressing), the turkey club on toasted wheat was great, the sliced tomato & garlic pizza was very good. Delivery was quicker than we expected and they don't charge for delivery either.  I recommend Pat's.. thanks\n",
      "The latest triumph from Pat's was the Bianco pizza,,, a white pie you can get with or w/o veggies (broccoli, red bell peppers) we ordered plain white, without veggies.. The big test for us was; Will he use fresh or dehydrated garlic? and I'm pleased to report that Pat's passed our test, fresh garlic all the way. There's nothing worse than ordering pizza, whether it's a sliced tomato & garlic or a white or a potato and the entire pie is ruined bc the restaurant uses dried garlic, ugh.. We can often tell just by the smell if it's fresh garlic or not. Dehydrated garlic is horrible, like garlic powder, worse even. It has a bitter taste that ruins the entire pie no matter how good the other ingredients are..This pizza was really good, surprisingly light, delicious and not oily.. I can't wait until we try the sliced tomato & garlic pie, soon very soon.. Pat's also has some of the best sides I've ever had.. better than sit down restaurants that serve you the industrial style slaw or potato salad. This is another sign of quality. \n",
      "I finally broke down and threw away the two dozen menus on top of the fridge, anything we want I can get at Pat's Trattoria. His original Dorchester location is the stuff of legends, I'm happy to say he's serving delicious, fresh take out here in SB and offers FREE delivery.. Keep up the good work, Patrick!\n",

The food arrived pretty fast, 30min or so (delivery guy kinda weird) and I must say I was again very very satisfied.  The food was a-touch greasy (no biggie) but it was very flavorful , I could actually taste all the individual flavors from the different dishes, even the different dipping sauces where really good.  It's wasn't a one note experience, finally, sigh..

      "My sushi box was 4 pieces of nigiri plus miso, plus a side salad, plus fruit, plus two gyoza plus two pieces of a california roll. Everything was delicious. The only slight problem was the shrimp nigiri was the sweet kind which I just dont like. For $9 and being that close to the theater district and the Common, it is a very good deal. \n",

Here's what I can tell you... Do NOT and I repeat DO NOT bother! We sat there w the menus waiting for acknowledgment from a sever... We waited 15 minutes and still nothing? I am thirsty and now pissed. We left and I will never bother to go back again!!\n",

      "Here's the deal. This place used to be Lion's Tail, my favorite Boston restaurant. Then the owners changed it to Yellow Door after I had already made my OpenTable reservation for Valentine's Day. We decided to check out the new food since Lion's Tail had been so amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place was slammed (in a good way), so I was glad we had a reservation! We were seated within a few minutes. The tables are pretty crammed together so you don't get much personal space, but in my experience, that's city dining unless you go super upscale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's talk good and cocktails. The cocktails were solid. I'd give them 4 or 5 stars as stand alones. The Tequila Do You Love Me and the Yellow Rose were hits after our table. They also have drinks on the menu like a classic Cadillac margarita and homemade sangria that I didn't have the chance to try and I'd like to.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for food, we started with the crab tostada and the street corn. My boyfriend liked the street corn a lot. I prefer mine hotter and grilled personally. The food was luke warm by the time we got it. The crab toasted was light and refreshing. It was a little heavy on the dill flavor for me, personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then ordered a whole mess of tacos. There are so many kinds from pork belly to fish to carnitas. The fish was my favorite of the evening. The pork belly was okay, but not memorable. My boyfriend had the duck taco and said it was good, not great. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is no dessert menu. So dining stops with dinner. But they do have a hot, chocolate cocktail I didn't try that sounded very dessert-like. \n",

      "The elote was good, too.\n",

      "Restaurant: Maria's Pastry Shop\n",
      "We came across this Italian pastry shop over 8 years ago while visiting some friends of relatives who live in Boston.  Since then we have been fortunate to be remembered by them as they annually send us a big box of Maria's amaretti (macaroons) and assorted biscotti for the Holiday Season.  Their amaretti are truly delicious as the baked exterior is crisp while its center is a bit soft and chewy.  These amaretti are great for shipping as our packages arrive in great shape with few broken or smashed cookies.  I give kudos to whoever it is who packs these goodies because even the biscotti arrive in great shape, too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Another Italian specialty that I miss is their fresh made cannoli.  I felt like I lost my \"heart\" in Boston after tasting them from Maria's.  Living in Hawaii, we don't have guaranteed overnight shipping especially if refrigeration is involved.  I dare not tempt my taste buds or health to the courier services, nowadays.  That package could very well arrive warm and ruined.  Um, back to the cannoli... The shells are golden brown, crisp yet not hard while holding that luscious subtly flavored ricotta or Mascarpone cheese filling.   I remember making a total pig of myself while gorging several of those crisp tubes of creamy cheese filling.  Ah, I have just my memories to rely on because I haven't found anything as good or fresh like Maria's in Hawaii.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All of our cookies have \"mysteriously\" disappeared since their arrival in early December.  I often wish that I had a nonna or mamma who could make these specialties to fulfill my sweet tooth.   But, I thank my lucky stars for our lovely Bostonian friends.  I accidentally deleted the pictures from our 2015 Christmas gift box so I've had to borrow images from the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "#505\n",
      "Maria's baked goods are great, there's no denying that but the service doesn't come with a smile. May be they just don't like New Yorkers. I can't compare their pastries to the other bakeries in the area since I haven't tried them but after reading yelp and being the impatient sort who was determined to get a good lobster roll I decided Maria's would be my best option. I didn't feel like waiting in line at any of the other bakeries. \n",
      "\n",
      "The seating area isn't much to look at but serves it's purpose if eating in. There's only room for just a few people so you would be better off eating your pastry at the park across the street. \n",
      "\n",
      "In short bring cash unless you plan on purchasing at least $10 worth of goods. There's a minimum to use your card which isn't posted anywhere but that's what I was told and then I was basically forced to buy additional items to use my card. The lady behind the counter wasn't particularly friendly either. She had the \"I'm just here to do my job personality\". I added on a chocolate dipped pizzelle to my order to make the minimum. The pizzelle was a bit pricey considering its just two pizzelle with a little chocolate. Around my way an entire bag of pizzelle's are $3-4 so two dollars for just one is pretty insane. I also got a vanilla cannoli and a lobster tail. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster tail was amazing. It was filled with soooooo much delicious cream. It was short and stout rather than the really long kinds I see at other bakeries. That definitely saves space on the baking tray and allows for a bigger bite of creamy goodness that oozes out the sides. The outside crunch seemed be be wrapped around the inner dough in a layer because as I bit into it the outer crunch started to separate. Not really an issue but can get a little messy. This lobster tail is definitely in my top five of best lobster tails ever. We walked back to our friends apartment and the cannoli did not really hold up as well as the lobster tail did in terms of melted filling but was also still quite delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a small selection of beverages as well including sanpellegrino, yum. I didn't get to try the Italian ice or gelato on this visit but I sure will on my next one. I am already craving more of those lobster tails. Now if only the people who worked here were a little more friendly and there wasn't a card minimum this would have been a five star experience.\n",

A big spot for statehousers and state employees, Derne St Deli appeals to neighborhoodies and Suffolk students alike with its delicious muffins (a wonderful wake-up meal) and tasty sandwiches.  I enjoy the meatball sub, and so does my boss, who sends me walking down there once a week or so to pick one up for him.  Major yum!  The service is always efficient and the employees are super friendly.  Definitely get your lunch here - it sure beats a McDonalds or a Finagle if you're near Beacon Hill/the Common.\n",

      "* They don't take forever to make food! I had class from 4:30-7:10; 7:30-9:50 p.m. I only had 20 minutes to run from Donahue to Sawyer. Time was of the essence, friends. I would go in, bark out my order, pay, and receive the deliciousness shortly after\n",

      "Restaurant: Landmark Public House\n",
      "Five of us went here this afternoon to take my father in law out for a nice lunch, or so we thought. We were seated right away which was nice, and the server was quick to come over to see if we wanted anything to drink. She filled our waters and brought the drinks that we ordered over fairly quickly. This is where the service becomes pretty much nonexistent. It was nearly 15 minutes before the server came back over to see if we were ready to order. It was not busy at all in the restaurant. There were maybe 6 other people sat in the restaurant. A lot of times, the young waitstaff were just standing around talking with each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a couple of salads and apps/fries to start. Once the apps came out, we were never asked if there was anything else we needed. No ketchup on the table for the fries. I had to flag down a different server to ask for ketchup. We sat around with empty drinks for pretty much the entire time we had the apps. Our server walked past the table several times and not once stopped to see if we needed refills. Finally after me turning around and staring at her she comes over and asks what we need. I asked for another soda and more water for the table. She brings me a coke and fills up one persons water and just leaves. All of the other waters were empty. Very odd that she wouldn't fill the others. Again, I have to flag down a different server and say we all wanted waters. Several minutes later our server came back over and filled the rest of the glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little while later, the food comes out. While dropping the food off, our server asks if we need anything else, and at the time we didn't since we just had our drinks refilled. She leaves, and never comes back to the table. I had ordered the quesadilla. It came out cold in the center and the peppers in it were not cooked (very crisp). I wanted to send it back.... but again, the server never even came to see if things were ok with the food. She continued to walk past our table multiple times, and had she been a good, attentive server, she would have noticed I wasn't eating my food. I shouldn't have to continuously flag someone down, so I sat there not eating. My niece ordered the steak tips. They were so burnt they were hardly edible. They came with fries and broccoli. There were barely any fries and more broccoli than steak. The broccoli was AWFUL. I mean this as a serious question to management... have you tried the broccoli? It is so flavorless and bland and chewy. It became a joke amongst my family. My 86 year old father in law tried it (and he never complains about anything) and he said it was the worst thing he's ever tasted. He had to spit it out. Seriously, if you're reading this, try your broccoli and you'll see what I mean. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After about half an hour, and me having to turn and look around for the server again, she came over and I told her I was sending the quesadilla back. She asked me if I wanted something else.... yea, maybe 30 minutes ago before my family finished eating. And we sat there with empty drinks again. Our server was awful. She never gave her name. Young girl with a blond ponytail. You definitely need to tell her she should be more attentive to her customers. $100 later and it was such a waste and awful experience.\n",
      "I'm giving 3 stars because the place shouldn't be fully judged on it's second day operating. However, since we most likely won't be going back I wanted to leave a review giving others a heads-up but don't want to blast it with one or two stars on it's second day. I know. I'm a helluva guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE GOOD: It's REALLY nice in there! You can barely picture what the old Girard's looked like when you're in there. VERY nice. And the buffalo chicken tenders were great. Different than most places - reminded us of a place we loved in New Hampshire - those were great. And the pizza looks good. We didn't try it, but it looked good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for...\n",
      "THE BAD: The food came out very inconsistently. My wife's pulled pork sandwich came out first. It resembled the store bought pre-cooked packaged pulled pork. Not saying it is - I doubt that - but it was odd. Tasted so so. About 10 minutes later my daughter's grilled cheese and fries came out. She says that was yummy but kind of burnt - it definitely had that charred/blackened look. The fries are good too - mentally add that to the GOOD section. 5 minutes later my other daughter's hot dog came out. She says it was ok - she ate it all so that's good. 10 minutes later - a full 25 minutes + after my wife's sandwich came out my Reuben came. At this point she was done with her meal - my kids were still picking. Barely any apologies were made about the service. I thought that was bizarre. The housemade corned beef was brown and tasted like nothing. Zero flavor. Even the sauerkraut was bland. I get my rubes with no Russian dressing so the whole sandwich tasted like nothing. So disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the check came out I paid and the receipts came with no pen to sign my credit card slip so I had to track one down. And another heads-up, the Shirley Temples are $4.20 each. Daaammmnnnn that is some expensive ginger ale and grenadine!!\n",

      "A welcome new addition to our neighborhood. Filled with coffees, smoothies, and all sorts of breakfast items, this is the spot for breakfast. The staff was incredibly nice.

      "Restaurant: Achilito's Taqueria\n",
      "Shockingly bad given the glowing reviews here.  Maybe the quality of food will depend on when you go and how busy they are, but last night I ordered takeout for three people.  We gave them an extra 20 minutes past the estimated ready time just to be safe and arrived, and after waiting for several minutes at the cash register without being helped, someone approached and told me it still wasn't ready.  That's fine - they're new, they're busy.  We eventually got our order and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arriving home, we found that one of the larger items was missing despite him reading the order back to me.  On top of this, three of our seven tacos were completely missing half the ingredients, including all add ons and salsas.  $4-$5 is on the pricier side for a hand taco, and is just plain unacceptable if that taco contains a chunk of meat and nothing else.  Considering you can't actually place an order without adding a salsa, I don't understand how this could happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food we did receive ranged from mediocre to poor.  The flavor on the carne asada was fantastic and the queso was great, but that's where the praise ends. The carne asada steak itself was unusually tough, and the flavor of the spicy chicken, the pork, and the lime chicken were bland.  However the chips & guacamole was the worst offender of the entire meal.  The chips were so hard we at first thought they were stale, and the guacamole itself  tasted as though it had been made with unripe or poor quality avocados that had no flavor at all, with an unpalatable amount of lime and no onion/tomato or even salt added.  Hands down the worst guac I've ever had, including stuff from supermarkets and chains; I am really confused by this one.  We picked the guacamole based on a reviewer who specifically called out how great it was, so I have to wonder if that review wasn't from a real customer or if different people are responsible for seasoning every day.  Everything except the carne asada lacked in any kind of spice or flavor.  Maybe I just went on an 'off' day but for the amount we paid it's extremely not worth it if the quality can vary as wildly as the range of yelp reviews implies.\n",
      "Food is good, but customer service is ATROCIOUS. I ordered from Postmates 2  bowls (one shrimp and one fish), and what arrived was one burrito. The sticker on the bag had my order correct, but the food was not. My angel of a Postmates driver said, not to worry, she would grab the right order, and asked if I could just call in advance. Ohhhh lordy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I called and was first told that my Postmates order didn't exist, even though i had just received a Postmates order (albeit wrong). Then I was told very rudely that I didn't order properly, that I didn't say if it was a bowl or a burrito, or tacos, or enchiladas, etc.. I explained that I didn't WRITE the order I clicked a button from THEIR menu. She yelled at me for a bit about that.  She then yelled that I needed to bring back the burrito...no problem lady, my Postmates girl is on it. She then hung up on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "5 minutes later I got a call from the angel Postmates driver saying that the restaurant has agreed to make 1 bowl, but is refusing to make my other bowl....so i text her my receipt which clearly indicates that I've paid for two bowls... doesn't matter. Postmates Corporate gets involved and speaks to the owner of Achillitos and he is now getting yelled at, and they STILL won't make my bowl. \n",
      "\n",
      "My poor Postmates driver had to leave because they were yelling at her in the store and she was afraid she was going to get out. Me, my Postmates driver, and the man from Postmates Corporate are all totally baffled as to what happened, and why, but take my advice, NEVER order out from Achilitos!\n",

      "ok so here's the deal: we went at 8pm on a friday night in late summer.  we were the only diners in the entire restaurant, which you'd think would make it pretty romantic and intimate, but no.  it was creeeepy.  the bartender screwed up our drink order not once, but twice.  (vodka tonic and vodka soda are two different things, dear!)\n",

      "2. It's got decor - yes yes, that thing Boston always lacks. The design is Indochine, and it's mighty fine, so come and dine, and drink wine.\n",

The bar can take you 20+ mins - hell on earth when you're thirsty for fun.\n",

I prefer to pop over on a slow weeknight, plant at the bar and challenge myself to a lychee martini and perfect storm marathon.

      "Sunday, after dim sum, I stopped next door into Best Cafe, on Tyler street. This is a little place in Chinatown (Boston) that I guess serves up quick Chinese meals, but it also has a takeout section. In the takeout section, you can buy whole roasted birds and other meat, or you can get what my friend and I did, yummy drinks. They have a variety of bubble teas and bubble smoothie/shakes. I got the bubble milk tea and it was SO GOOD! At $3.00, it was nice and cheap, and very very sweet with condensed milk. My friend got the mango bubble smoothie shake, which they also made in front of us. This was only $3.50 and had the real fruit. It was so good and mango-y! This is now the best, closest place to my house to get these good bubble drinks, and I look forward to going again as the weather gets warmer. The woman who worked there was also very nice, and spoke english very well, which is good for ordering. I've been to other places where the order gets all messed up because no one can understand each other. I absolutely reccomend Best Cafe.\n",
      "The first time I went to The Best Cafe my friend just grabbed a boba to kill some time before our dim sum table was ready across the street.  It wasn't until a few weeks later that I actually got to try the food here.

      "\n",
      "Both of these varieties were tender and juicy. The filling wasn't mealy or dry but instead, bursting with flavor. The sauce that accompanied the dumplings was absolute perfection - the perfect combination of salty and tangy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I grew up eating my dad's homemade dumplings and these took my back to childhood. These were, by far, the most authentic, homey, and delicious dumplings I've had in Boston!! I would recommend these to anyone who was looking for authentic, homemade dumplings!\n",

      "\"We are just yer basic bah, nothing on tap\", the waitress told me as I inquired what they had on tap.  Now maybe I was spoilt as a college student since I had friends who had their own taps in their living rooms, but can you really call yourself a Bar, much less a Pub, if you aren't serving draft beer?  I think not.\n",
      "Bottles of beer - $3\n",
      "The tri tips were juicy and had flavor, but the other meats; sausage, chicken, and ribs were overcooked and dried out.\n",
      "The quote outside the Quiet Man Pub's window put a bad taste in my mouth.  \"America, Love It... Or Leave It.\"  Are you telling me that if I am unsatified with our educational policy, welfare reform, or war on terror that I am unwelcome in your bar?!  What kind of closemindedness is this?  Are you purposefully trying to reduce your business and profit?  Or maybe the management is a close-minded jackass?  Anyway, whatever they're trying to do, it was quite successful in putting me off from going in there.  Hooray!\n",

      "I saw a Groupon for Umai so I figured I would try it out. I ordered takeout and it was ready in 20 minutes. The sushi way very good, however, the spicy and tuna and spicy salmon rolls lacked a little spiciness. Service was friendly. There is street parking on Washington street and a municipal lot about 25 feet down next to the Corrib.\n",

      "I chose the \"Noodle It Over Shrimp\" and let the young lady prepare it as it is on the menu with sauteed mushrooms and scallions and carrots. The spicy roasted sweet potatoes were awesome. Several large shrimp (deveined and peeled) were placed on top. At the counter, a small pot of tahini dressing was packaged with the bowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meal was easy to eat with chopsticks and delicious. It did require some eating before there was enough room to toss it properly. It felt healthy, certainly more so than the mac & cheese or pizza or sauced chicken from the other vendors.\n",
      "One of the few healthier options in Faneuil Hall and Quincy Marketplace. They offer a fast casual seafood experience similar to a Poke Bowl place. The food tasted fresh and was prepared quickly. However, the portion size was quite small for the price. They filled the whole thing with white rice and skimped on the toppings relative to other Poke Bowl places. Either way, if you're in the mood for a healthier seafood option when visiting Faneuil definitely check them out.\n",

One of our closest friends had volunteered to pick up the cake and deliver it to the reception sight and consequently missed the ceremony.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My bridesmaid called a couple of times when it looked like the cake was going to be late and I followed up with a phone call and then a letter to the manager after the wedding.  They never responded to my letter, but on the phone they were actually pretty rude and defensive and made up all kinds of  excuses instead of just apologizing for a major mess-up.  \n",
      "When the cake finally arrived, it had to be brought in through the seating area where everyone was already seated and set up with everyone sitting around.  So ridiculous.  I'll never go back.\n",
      "They need to have a better staff.  Not the most professional place.  They are known for their Peaches N Cream cake and recently ordered one for work.  It was delicious but what was asked for writing and logo was not even close.\n",

      "Sorry Cha Feo, but I'm gonna be the first to say this boba joint wasn't cut out to what I thought it would be based on the reviews. I know they just opened, but there still is a lot that needs to improve before I would want to dish out $7 to $9+ on bubble tea again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the ambiance of the place, the aesthetics are incredibly cute and looks legit like a Pinterest board inside. But I just can't justify the crazy prices of the bubble tea. I have never in my life paid $7+ on a small sized bubble tea, only to get hard as rock tapioca balls and a very much bland bubble tea taste. I ordered the few mango milk tea which comes with mango puree and jasmine milk tea. My friend ordered the dragonfruit smoothie (red dragon fruit smoothie cheese) with cheese foam as it was recommended and it came out to $9+ plus tax which is just insane - you could literally buy a meal for that price. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to go on about the flavors because to each their own..., but I really did feel a little cheated after grabbing a drink here. I thought for this price range, I would get a premium green tea flavor but it tasted so watered down. I know there are a bunch of other bubble tea places in the back Bay Area that are within the $5-6 range (that offer cheese toppings too). Just so shocked that people would dish out this much money for cheese tea - their most expensive drink goes up to $10.95!!! All I can ask for is to make your tapioca balls a bit more soft (they really were rock hard...) as baby steps to improvement and that would make it at least a bit more worth the price for me!\n",
      "A local insisted I have this coffee before I flew out of Boston on my way home. He described it as the most sensory experience a cup of coffee could ever achieve in his book. Well, I was sold! After scouring Newberry St. looking for it without knowing the name, we found it in the nick of time. I entered on a cold January evening anticipating this delectable treat. The Dirty Coffee Latte is served dine-in only and so I took a seat and awaited this caffeinated concoction. \n",
      "\n",
      "The presentation alone was magnificent in every way. I mean c'mon! That is truly a sight for sore eyes! How did it taste ? Well, It was frothy on top with like a salty foamy covering the creamy coffee underneath resembling a thicker version of a latte. The bottom of the mug was lined in chocolate which I discovered at the end of it. The spoon they included to stir it was made of stone so it perfectly scraped up all the inner pockets of goodness it had since you were instructed to mix it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had to congratulate them on the most exquisite coffee experience I've ever had. Yes, they sell lots of bubble tea which I am a huge fan of BUT the Dirty Coffee is a must order on some many different levels.

Two dollar charge for me to walk downstairs to pick up food. So, this restaurant lost out on an $18.00 order because they wanted to gauge out unnecessary fees. This is certainly the first time I've ever heard of a restaurant charge for a takeout, and will certainly be the last.\n",

Prices are reasonable, most menu items are cooked to order and the quality is actually good. Did I mention the huge serving sizes? With the lack of quick Thai in Downtown Boston, Bangkok Express stands well above the rest.\n",
      "Bangkok Express is a fast food Thai kiosk in Faneuil Hall. Their menu lists various offerings, including soups, appetizers, a \"buffet\"-style choice (pick from 1-3 meal choices and rice or noodles), and entrees like spicy basil leaves with beef, chicken, shrimp, or tofu.\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting in a crowded (but thankfully short) line, I placed my order. It took roughly three minutes for my food to come out. (FYI, the Bangkok Express is cash-only.) For the curious, I think the cashier was Thai, but the cooks definitely didn't look to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had tom yum soup and basil drunken noodles ($10, $2 more than fast food Thai should be, perhaps?). I found two forks, a spoon, and napkins, all in a to-go bag along with the food. Everything was warm, not scalding hot. The tom yum was a little watery but had tang to it, was a nice size (not stingy), and had lots of mushrooms in it. The drunken noodles weren't dry, filled me up (generous portion sizes!) and I could taste the basil. Overall, the meal was delicious, not outstanding.\n",

      "\n",
      "Holy cow, their roast beef sandwiches! Absolutely delicious -- an artisan roll piled with just the right amount of thinly sliced, high-quality, perfectly cooked roast beef -- plus two different options for toppings/sauces. I preferred the classic with BBQ (and their BBQ sauce was an excellent balance of sweet, smoke, and spice), and my partner liked the 8OT (though it could have used some more of those amazing pickled onions). Make sure you order sides of onion rings and fries (both ridiculously good), and of course stuff the onion rings on your sandwich. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why the missing star? \n",
      "\n",
      "We like to think of ourselves as chicken finger aficionados. We decided to try an order along with our sandwiches (wayyy too much food) and were intrigued by the fact that they were smoked. Well... mistakes were made. I have rarely had the misfortune of putting anything that regretful in my mouth (and you haven't met my ex). The smoke flavor was so overwhelming, so overpowering, that I genuinely wasn't sure I could chew, much less swallow. I also couldn't tell if the chicken was, potentially, spoiled. Probably from being over-smoked, the chicken was dark tan in color and had this flaky rubber band consistency. Super weird. I'd genuinely like to know if they're supposed to be that way or if we just got a bad batch...\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall we will definitely be back to try other menu items and get some more roast beef sandwiches, but we'll definitely pass on the smoked chicken.\n",
      "Best roast beef sandwich in the city!! A little pricey, but worth it. The roll is absolutely delicious. I WISH THEY WOULD STAY OPEN UNTIL 4-5pm!! I work outside the city & by the time I get back home they are closed. That's the only negative. Try it! You won't be disappointed. Hint: they have a little side window to order takeout from.\n",

It was just up the street, and luckily the top deck, after perusing with the security people a bit, our group of top notch yelpers all made it up there and had some tables on the deck all to ourselves, complete with a waitress who was willing to take our orders for us, which I guess isn't usually the case once the kitchen is closed here. The bad news? Up there, from the waitress you can only get bottled beers....And a bud light in a bottle is $3.75, which isn't the cheapest of prices...especially for bud light! I wanted to get a sam adams or something, but nope---only bottles beers and there wasn't too many options of those for the upstairs bar!!\n",

      "The clam chowder was thick and flavorful with nice soft potatoes, the best part of the meal. I was not impressed by my lobster roll, which was all claw meat with little to no tail. The lobster meat was shredded, not in chunks, and the overseasoned dressing masked the purity of the lobster.\n",

However, after trying this place in person and through delivery, I can confidently say that this place is better than the previous business. The ingredient is fresh and all the dishes are prepared to satisfy your Korean tastebuds. I dare to say that this place is like solid B+ (8/10) when compared to NY and LA Korean-Chinese restaurants (joong-guk-jip). Don't get me wrong. That is a huge compliment considering this is Boston, where good food comes to die. \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely recommend this place to all Koreans, who have craving for some good jjambbong and jjajangmyun. Their tangsooyook is bomb too (very clean and not as greasy). I honestly hope they don't skimp out on their ingredients in the future. Their seafood and vegetable are great quality, and they compliment the overall seasoning (yangnyum) of each dish.\n",
      "OMG FINALLY - a legit Korean restaurant in Allston that serves a variety of Korean foods other than soondooboo (tofu soup). I really loved Seoul Jangteo and notably their jam-pong. They seem to have a lot of korean-chinese dishes which is so hard to find in Boston and they do it sooo well. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I came here on a Monday night and it was pretty empty (during Covid times) but they did a good job at spacing tables out. Their side dishes come with picked radish, kimchi, and kimchi radish which is perfect when eating noodles. I would love to try out their tangsuyook and jjajangmyun next time! \n",
      "\n",
      "Their jam-pong was MASSIVE and the noodles were on the thinner side, which I'm not used to but the flavor and spicy levels were on point with generous portions of seafood. I also ordered the spicy tofu soup (soondooboo) which was really really good, especially on a cold day. It was hearty, thick and felt like comfort food for me. I just wish the rice came out in a dolt (hotpot) like other soondooboo places so you could get the scorched rice, but it was stellar, compared to what boston has to offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend coming here if you are with a group of friends who have different tastes. They really do have something for everyone, whether you want chicken, pork, something spicy or non-spicy, noodles, rice. I also like the more traditional feel of the restaurant and does feel very comforting in a way (as someone who grew up in a Korean household :') Can't wait to come back!\n",

I'm happy that I no longer need to travel to the South End, Back Bay, Downtown  Crossing or (yikes!) even Cambridge for a decent burger under $10.  The decor is fresh, clean & modern, service is friendly. Prices are decent  and the burgers are tasty. The bun was a little too dry for me but that won't keep me away. I had the fried egg burger. I was expecting a regular fried egg, with a slightly runny yolk, but it was like a scrambled egg patty which only added to the dryness. But, the burger & toppings tasted very good. Cajun fries were awesome !  I will come back to try the cheeseburger next time.  Check out the special on the sidewalk blackboard. My fried egg burger was only 4.50 yesterday.\n",

      "This restaurant is a treasure. None of the Hanover St nonsense (a plate of pasta drowning in sauce is not good food and certainly not worth the price). The food is amazing, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. We were actually turned away because it was already 10pm when we arrived (without a reservation) but someone else came running into the street and told us to come in and they would serve us. That, my friends, is awesome. And then a member of our group spilled a glass of wine all over the table and we felt like total jerk-offs but it was all good! \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not usually a big fan of cozy 'intimate' restaurants (to me that usually means crowded and loud) but they do it right at Sage. Be prepared to spend $20-30 per entree. It's worth it.\n",
      "My favorite North End destination and definitely one of the best impress-your-date intimate Italian restaurants in Boston.  The cuisine is an artful balance between innovative and classic Italian, with particularly noteworthy risottos and seafood dishes (although I have yet to find a mediocre dish).  Their prices are also quite reasonable compared to the other top restaurants in the North End (entrees run $20-$30).  While some might view the small size of the restaurant as a fault (they have approximately 10 tables), the result is an incredibly intimate dining experience with absolutely impeccable service.  But given the size of the restaurant, I strongly recommend having a reservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One word of caution - their menu is quite small (ten entree options) and is heavily geared toward Italian meat and seafood dishes.  If you are looking for vegetarian dishes (or even a lot of pasta options), you should probably look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for an intimate dinner of seared tuna or rabbit milanese (delicious!), this is the place for you.\n",

The sandwiches are all the same and differ on the meat inside - bacon, sausage, or egg white + spinach, all served in a Portuguese roll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices are $6 a pop, which I think are pretty reasonable. I usually get a sandwich at Starbucks or a bagel place. The sandwiches here are like twice the size of one from Starbucks, which run ~$4 a pop, and about the same size as the ones from the bagel places which go from $7-$8. Eggs are fresh made and you can see them flipping the bacon and sausage on the grill. Definitely seems like a good deal for the portion size. You can also get grilled onions. The only thing I wanted maybe was for my bun to be toasted, but perhaps they will do that if you ask. \n",
      "\n",
      "The guys who run the truck are veterans and very very friendly. Orders are delivered with a smile. Selection currently is simple, limited to the three sandwiches. I'd love to see them offer fries. \n",

The other day i had a bacon and caramelized onion grilled cheese that i made up myself and it was the best.  ate it at the end of the road watching airplanes land and cranes in the drydock.  with truffle tots that are also excellent.  i am eating ramen noodles on the days i don't go here so i don't have to feel guilty about it, because it is yummy.\n",

Each of the designated stops had extremely long lines an I heard the crowds complaining to our driver about waiting there for hours and that the trolleys could not accommodate them. Our trolley was abuzz with people proclaiming that there was no way they were giving up their seat. The 2 hour line to get back on is ridiculous.  Others were just getting off of the trolley and opting to Uber to the cool destinations.\n",

This rivals my favorite NYC Chinese food spot.  Delivery was quick, and I was legitimately surprised to see a Chinese spot on GrubHub.  \n",

      "To the guy complaining about having to walk outside 10 feet to pick up food, are you kidding me?  Are you that lazy? Seriously, that's pathetic, and I don't think they need business from a guy like you.  You were never a loyal customer if you're giving them 1 star because you're too damn lazy to walk outside.\n",
      "My favorite chinese food delivery in East Boston... it gives my childhood favorite a run for its money!  The food is really fresh and loaded with veggies.  The sauces are great, the delivery is quick, and I appreciate the deals they have (buy a certain amount of food, get a free chicken wing etc.).  I haven't even bothered trying anywhere else because they've been awesome every time.\n",

      "Don Ricardo's is not your usual South End dining establishment.  It is not fancy.  It does not have swanky decor.  It does not have yuppies waiting in line for food.  In short: it is awesome.  I'm so sick of the usual South End restaurants.  The same menu everywhere you go (Steak, Chicken, Salmon, Vegetarian Risotto); the same decor (exposed brick everywhere); the same annoying clientele (yuppies with SUV sized strollers and/or obnoxious bug-eyed-rat-dogs).  \n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to the usual Tremont Street crap, Don Ricardo's is a simple, lovely establishment with incredible South American food.  My favorite things to order: the Yuca (cassava)- deep fried with some sort of amazing carrot sauce.  Don't balk- the carrot sauce is awesome.  Even my freakish I-hate-vegetables-I-only-love-bacon-and-blue-cheese husband likes it.  Maduros (ripe plantains)- how did I not know about plaintains until I moved to Boston?  They are amazing.  And finally, Tacu-Tacu (rice, black beans, onions, tomatoes, cilantro)- very similar to Costa Rican gallo pinto which I fell in love with after vacationing there in March. It's simple, down to earth, but incredibly flavorful and tasty food.  What I can't believe is that I'm the first person to review this place- I thought it would be too awesome to stay hidden away.\n",

      "All of the appetizers are worth a try, but the guacamole and the yuca with carrot sauce are the ones that keep me coming back. The guac is rock solid, and it comes with a really unique, spicy salsa that nearly steals the show. A dab of each and you're all set. And the carrot sauce... my god, the carrot sauce. I pair it with the yuca (it's like a Peruvian french fry) instead of the plantain because it seems like a better fit with the savory sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the entree, I'll make it easy on you - you want the albondigas. Two massive meatballs stuffed with a magical combo of eggs, olives, peppers (and, judging by my intense cravings, a healthy dose of Peru's infamous national export).\n",

      "Having been in school for quite a while now, I've learned to not expect much when it comes to on-campus eateries.  That being said, the bar was set pretty low when a friend and I decided to pop into Basho in between classes for a quick meal.  Modeled after Chipotle, the premise is quite simple: choose bowl or roll, and then add protein, veggies, and other toppings.  You would think it wouldn't be too difficult right?  Wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, they only have one menu and it is inconveniently hung at an awkward angle right at the entrance of the food assembly line.  So, if you're in the middle of an order and don't know what to put next -- because none of the trays are labeled -- you're going to have to move away from the counter and either squint your eyes to see what veggies they have for your salad or walk to the end of the line and back.  Secondly, the price really doesn't justify the quality of the food.  I know we're eating on campus so everything will be a little more expensive than elsewhere, but $11 for a dinky little salad that had slimy raw salmon, wilted spring mix greens, and bland kimchi is ridiculous.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since they just opened, I'm giving Basho the benefit of the doubt and adding an extra star in hopes that they'll smooth out the kinks after a month or two.  But even when that happens, I highly doubt I'll be coming back.\n",
      "Of all the sushi burrito/rice bowl restaurants I've been to, I'd say that Basho express is just okay. The first time I was here, I ordered a sushi burrito which I thought was pretty small - it was more like a sushi roll than a burrito. I wasn't expecting it to be thick like an actual burrito, but it was pretty thin compared to other sushi burritos I've had. The other times I've been here, I ordered a bowl because it was bigger in terms of portion size. I really enjoyed the bulgogi rice bowl and will definitely order it again! I think that's the only thing I like here on top of the arrange of Asian drinks they sell here. I think I just need to explore the menu more. But so far, the flavors are just meh and nothing stands out to me.\n",

      "I'm a huge fan of their pomegranate flavor.  My most favorite combo ever is pomegranate flavor with blueberry topping.  For a small size plus 1 topping, it was $3.25+$.50 per topping.  Although that being my favorite, I got the pomegranate topping instead.  Yea! you heard me right, pomegranate!  Back in CA, I've never seen pomegranate offered as a topping.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This place has an indoor seating area, so if you think you have to eat your froyo out in the cold, think again!  Froyo is a year-round dessert.  They also play some cool elevator music while you kick it back in some lounge chairs.\n",

      "Yeah, won't be coming back here again unless I'm starving or dying for tart yoghurt and happen to be walking by.

      "Pizza Bye-er\n",
      "I appreciate the sentiment - offer people a brilliant range of options including some mouthwatering sauces and toppings and make it all look cool and modern. But please, when you charge 8 dollars for 7 inch pizza with one topping, it's too much. If you get the base right it might work. But my advice would be move. Yes, move. You're in the wrong place. Go to Newton or somewhere else where people have more money than sense. You'll go down well there. Good luck. Bye!\n",

The girl who answered the phone told us that our pizza had just come out of the oven and that the delivery guy was about to pick it up.  I mentioned that when I called 40 minutes ago the pizza was allegedly already ready, she told me that it was her that I had talked to, that she had never said that, and that it was only 10-15 minutes ago and not the 40 minutes I claimed.\n",

      "The texture was good and pistachio had nice chunks of pistachio scattered throughout. Hazelnut flavor was very good -chocolate based with a creamy base. Overall a good spot in the mall.\n",
      "Small ice cream shop tucked away in the back of the Corner Mall food court. They also serve food - pastas, etc - but the gelato display is in the front. \n",
      "\n",
      "Extremely underwhelming. The options aren't really gelato as much as they're ice cream, and we're talking pretty rock hard, somewhat icey ice cream as well. The Pistachio tasted a little off, and the caramel was overwhelmingly sweet without any other depth. Flavors were pretty run of the mill boring. Sizes and prices are reasonable, except with the small ($2.99) they are strict about the 1 flavor/1 scoop thing when other places will let you get multiple flavors as long as it can fit. \n",

      "\n",
      "The steak itself was fine - it was a tad bit tough and salty. However the pork rind was fantastic. The rind is essentially a cut of pork including the skin. The combo of the steak, rind, and egg went well together. The highlight of the meal though was the rice. I have no idea how they make it but it was absolutely amazing. You also get an incredible amount of rice with each of the meals we ordered.\n",

      "I probably will order delivery from here again. I got 3-4 meals worth of delicious food for a great price!\n",
      "I have ordered from this place before for breakfast so I assumed it would be a safe bet. My daughter was already starving so I ordered the food around 11. GrubHub said it would take about an hour and that is weird since I literally live like 7 blocks away. They updated the order and said it would be there around 11:35. At 12:05 I checked GrubHub and it said my order was delivered so I call the restaurant. It took me a while to communicate to the woman who answered the phone that I was not trying to make an order but was checking on my previous order. She asked me if I could wait an hour and I asked why on Earth would I wait another hour when it had already been an hour and a half. She then asked if I could wait 40 minutes, I LIVE 7 BLOCKS AWAY. I asked her why I had to wait and why someone updated the status on GrubHub to delivered when I didn't get my food and she simply said they didn't know. Although I like this place this is a bit ridiculous for a Sunday morning when my daughter was hungry and looking forward to her meal. I will think twice before having food delivered from this place again. \n",

      "\n",
      "The burrito was awesome with great melting cheese but again the tater tots were so greasy all you could taste is the oil it was fried in. The salchipapa was good and the quail eggs are definitely a good touch but again for the second time I was left wishing the fries could have been fried for like 1 minute more, It was a bit soggy and underdone in the middle. I really believe if these were some crispy golden brown fries this would easily be my favorite breakfast dish.\n",

      "My office is in Faneuil Hall and thanks to my co-workers, I found a great little place to get lunch when I'm too lazy to bring my own to work. And on top of that, it's not inside Quincy Market, which for me is a wonderful thing. As most Bostonians already know, Faneuil Hall is filled with annoying tourists who not only take up space, but also refuse to move out of your way when you're hungry and trying to get back to the office before your break is over. Nothing makes my blood pressure rise as high or as fast as when I used to walk through Quincy Market to get food and I would literally trip over a clueless woman from Omaha who can't seem to look at menus and walk at the same time. I thought it was an unwritten rule that everyone walks to the right side of corridors, and if you choose to stop and look, you should move off to the side. However, Quincy Market seems to be a place where the tourists feel rules can be broken...and for that, I feel their faces should be broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANYWAY...enough of my rant. So, TASTE OF THE TOWN. Apparently there are two other locations in addition to the one at 60 State (which is in the lobby of the tower)...they are 10 Post Office Sq & 125 Summer St. in Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "This little place is open for breakfast and lunch and according to their website, they also have catering. I think they have really great sandwiches which are all made fresh to order. They also have salads and other varieties of pasta available for customers, but I always stick with a nice, big, scrumptious sandwich.\n",
      "\n",
      "They offer the usual sandwich options (with your choice of bread) like chicken salad, turkey, ham, etc...but I would trust this restaurant and order one of their \"specialty\" sandwiches because THEY KNOW HOW TO INVENT STUFF! My favorite so far has been the \"Madison\" which consists of turkey, ham, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, coleslaw, Russian dressing on light or dark rye...I get dark rye. There is a large list of specialty sandwiches to order from, so why not just rotate through until you find a favorite...ya know...like us fat kids do.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Madison costs $6.25 which is well worth the price. I give this place 5 stars for several reasons...their sandwiches are delicious, their prices are fair for the area of the city it is in, they're quick to make your food, and it saves me the burden of having to kill a tourist who probably deserved it anyway.\n",
      "How did i not review Taste of Town? Its on 60 state street. Usual lunch joint. Great salads, sandwiches, there are tables inside, and there is some seating outside too. Not very crowded. Usually work people.They have good selection of breads and soup as well.\n",

      "I'm a huge fan of this chain and always visit when I'm north of the border. I was excited to hear they were opening close to North Station. I went on a quiet Thursday night. The woman behind the counter were very patient as we made our selections. They have a lot of yummy looking bakery and lunch items too. We went with the iced caramel coffee and the iced chocolate espresso (with 2 shots). The place was immaculate and had nice seating. Drinks took a bit to make and I wasn't sure the women knew the recipes as they were consulting each other quite a bit. It might be a long wait if the place is busy. The iced caramel was delicious. Perfect taste. The iced chocolate espresso was just so so. No taste of chocolate but we figured 2 shots would overpower it a bit. Sadly, it wasn't strong. Tasted bitter but my coffee drinking partner in crime was feeling tired a few hours later when normally two espresso shots are enough to keep him wired. I'd go back, of course as I love the brand and hope they stock the k-cups soon along with the other coffee they stock now.\n",
      "Coffee is good, but prices are steep. 4.25 for a tough bagel and cream cheese that wasn't even spread will definitely keep me away from getting breakfast there on a regular basis.  Hopefully options will improve with time.\n",

I've bought several items before that have expired dates on them. 4) They tried to steal my debit card! Got a few items one afternoon, he swiped my card and then kept it behind the register. I started to walk out, then remembered and said something to him and he said he didn't have it. I said \"well, I don't have it and you just swiped it.\" Then he played dumb and pulled it up from behind the register. Are you effing kidding me?\n",

But when we added the tropical colored linens combined with tropical floral arrangements, the room looked totally different and fit perfectly with our theme.  Rentals Unlimited was so easy to work with.  They were able to deliver within out tight schedule and they were professional every step of the way.  I would totally recommend Rentals Unlimited.\n",
      "Just wanted to say how OUTSTANDING the customer service was from Peak North when they delivered on Saturday.  Bill \"The Hammer\" and Alexi were absolutely a Godsend in helping us prep for the event.  I would personally like to request that they now deliver for all events that we do with Peak.  Their customer service, help, and outstanding attitudes have certainly made me feel confident in continuing to do business with Peak Event Services.  They not only delivered the stuff on top and without complaint, they also help set up different pieces of the delivery items, AND THEN went back and added additional drapes to every pipe and drape that my team had done.  They ALSO paid so much attention to detail that they went in and fixed all the pipe and drape that my team put on backwards.  When they were done, they also asked if there was anything else they could possibly do to help.\n",

They have a big version and a small version, and the small version is only available as a box of several. You can get one big version by itself and oh my God every bite is heaven. They really know how to make a wife cake. I can't wait to give it to the wife. The cake I mean.\n",

They have a Hong Kong version like everybody else does which I'm sure is really good but their Portuguese version is off-the-charts spectacular. It's burned and Flaky and crispy and gooey and everything that you could ever want from a Portuguese custard tart. It's like one of the really good ones up in Toronto or Newark New Jersey. But it's right here in Boston and is the only one of its kind that I found.\n",

I used to live in Miami, and this food tasted like home...even better than home!  The flavor, the technique, the variety, the love that goes into this food is just completely unforgettable.  It's like eating at someone's grandmother's house, but better.  The prices and portions cannot be beat either.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the arepa con carne mechada or shedded beef in creole tomato-based sauce with cilantro.  The flavor was just ridiculous--tangy, garlicky, zesty, pure perfection over a crispy yet tender yellow arepa.  An arepa is griddled corn cake made from pre-cooked corn, so it has zero grittiness, just crispy exterior and tender interior.  Arepas of this size are for breakfast.  I got my husband the paisa version with rice, eggs, and yummy pork belly cracklings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as we marvelled over our food, we got distracted by a ridiculous seafood rice at the counter.  It was freaking exploding with tender, juicy-looking seafood.  We caved and got what was supposedly a side portion, but it was meal-sized in my book.  Picture it, mussels, lobster, real crab leg meat, clams, shrimp, scallops, calamari, octopus, all cooked to tender perfection in an expertly-seasoned, fluffy rice.  This stuff was last meal status, and it was our last meal in Boston, and certainly one of the BEST!  Stop by on your way to the airport, if you're a visitor.  If you live in Boston, go tonight!  Seriously, today you MUST try this!  Super short walk from the Maverick train stop, by the way.\n",

Be sure to clear your table and put your plates on the far end of the counter if you eat in.  Order first and pay as you leave.  They'll bring the dish to you.\n",
      "This little place has truly made a name for itself. I'm from East Boston, and have been going for as long as I can remember.  Located just minutes from the Maverick Blue Line Train station, it's a brisk walk for some real Colombian food. I have to say that by far, my favorite item there, are the empanadas. You can get them with either carne, or pollo. Either way, you can't go wrong. The staff is great and they move quickly with your order.

      "While the Fin Point Restaurant downstairs gives off a very sexy and chic vibe, that is not matched once you enter your suite. The first room they put me in had a major crack down the wall because of obvious water damage, and I expressed to the staff that I wasn't happy about it. They were very apologetic and moved me to another room, which was better, but still looked old, basic and again - in need of a major renovation. \n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. I do think they could also improve on their lost and found practices here. I lost a favorite hat of mine in the restaurant downstairs and I don't think the staff did enough to look for it. I had a flight to catch back home so I couldn't do my own investigation, but if I ever came back to Boston, I'd come back here to look for my hat - and choose to stay at another hotel for the night.\n",

The lobby hides it a bit, but when you get to the hallways and rooms upstairs... it's like a 1999 Marriott. Pool is cool (view) and the gym is actually quite impressive for a hotel one. Breakfast? Not on weekends... are you kidding me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this Marriott stay-able? Sure if you don't mind burning money, but there's nothing special about this Marriott. I'd go elsewhere if I could. Save some money, pay less for parking, don't deal with the crowds, and enjoy yourself elsewhere. I won't be back!\n",

      "\n",
      "What I found was a boring three table restaurant crammed into the doorway of The Place.  No love seats, intimate lighting, or hot art on the wall.  No go-go dancers in cages hanging from the ceiling.  Just a REALLY white dude waiting tables and bad Latin jazz playing on the overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awkward enough having a white guy wait tables at a Japanese restaurant, but I would have overlooked it if he wasn't completely inept at his job.  Instead this typical \"Yeah Dude,\" couldn't remember what half the items on the menu were (and since there's no description for the \"Bed for Two,\" \"Big Balls,\" \"2 Hot 2 Handle,\" or \"Menage a Trois,\" we had to ask).  Even after he checked the kitchen, his descriptions were hardly accurate.  Furthermore, we asked if there was spicy mayo on a couple of the rolls, he said \"no,\" and yet they arrived smothered with hot yellow mayonnaise.  When we called this to his attention, his response was, \"yeah, they come that way.  But you can wipe it off with a fork.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "But wait, you're missing the best part of Flirt Sushi: the pricing: $20+ per roll and $4 for a single piece of sushi or sashimi.  A single piece!  Are you serious?  We ordered two rolls, a bowl of miso, the \"Menage a Trois\" and a Chirashi (no drinks), and the bill came to over $100.  No wonder they don't list their prices on the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the end, the food was subpar at best.  The whole operation strikes me as self-delusional: unremarkable restaurant, mediocre food, poor service and outrageous prices.  I suspect Flirt Sushi will be gone within a year, and it won't be missed.\n",
      "I came here twice since this week since I work nearby and I am a big fan of sushi. The place is very small. There's only 3 two persons tables and a bar in this tiny place. The sushi is good, the music is good but a little too loud for lunch. There's no combos and the names of the food r kinda naughty ( it's flirt sushi for real I guess) but I won't know what they mean by just looking at the menu.I spend more than $30 per person here for lunch, sashimis are $3.50-4 per piece and green tea is $3.50 here.  \n",

      "Restaurant: ArcLight Cinemas - Boston\n",
      "When I heard about the ArcLight opening in Boston I was really excited. A brand new theater opening in Boston is a big deal, particularly one opening right at the Garden. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I thought perhaps they simply aren't ready for prime time, but the company itself despite having the self-proclaimed ethos being well thought out are anything but. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me walk you through the issues as I experienced them. \n",
      "\n",
      "#1 The App - I downloaded the app and to my surprise, the Boston location isn't even an option. You have to use the website, fine. Not ideal, but whatever. \n",
      "\n",
      "#2 The Website - The Website is designed fairly poorly. A slight upgrade over GeoCities only made worse by the maintenance of the showtimes on the website. I wanted to see a movie on New Year's Eve and as of Friday the 27th of December, no showtimes were available. \n",
      "\n",
      "#3 Phone - I tried calling ArcLight Boston to see when showtimes would become available, but there is no Boston number. Instead, there is a central hub that answers all of their calls. I stayed on hold for entirely too long and when I reached someone he claimed that all theater showtimes are updated on Sundays. I asked why the Hollywood, CA theater (which the website defaults to when you refresh the page) had showtimes through Wednesday, he said that theater was the only exception. \n",
      "\n",
      "#4 Showtimes - For some reason I checked the site again on Sunday and what did I see? Showtimes had become available. I would say I was fortunate that I checked early, but the theater was nearly completely empty the day of. Regardless, it was frustrating to be told one thing (that sounded a bit ridiculous) only to confirm through my own efforts that it wasn't accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "#5 Locating the theater - We had to ask around as there wasn't great signage showing where the theater was located. ArcLight must have spent millions of dollars putting a theater in North Station, but couldn't get signage as part of the deal? You would think, once you know where it is it won't be a problem, but I don't think they're going to get much repeat patronage. \n",
      "\n",
      "#6 Printing Tickets - I went to the kiosk to print out my tickets with the card I used to purchase the tickets. The kiosk was unable to print out my tickets and said to go to the ticket counter. I asked an employee where the ticket counter was and she was confused and directed me back towards the kiosks, despite me explaining the situation at the kiosk. She then proceeded to try and print out tickets, which took her entirely too long. At least 5 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "#6 The Bar - The Bartender was very nice, but seemed a bit in over her head. There were two other patrons getting a drink when we arrived, and two others who arrived after us. It probably took her about 10-12 minutes to make the drinks and charge each group for them. What made matters worse is that she would make a set of drinks and rather than charge the group immediately, she started on the next set of drinks, making each group wait before they could go to their movie. \n",
      "\n",
      "#7 The Heat - It felt like a furnace at the theater. I've never gone to a theater and felt like the heat was on and it felt like it was on blast. It was hot in the lobby and it was hot in the theater as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "#8 - The Seating - Millions of dollars spent and they made a terrible decision with the chairs. They aren't remotely comfortable and are entirely too small. If you're an average adult, your legs are almost certainly going to hang off the end of the recliner. In the age of modern theaters, these are by far the worst chairs I've seen. To make matters worse, finding your seat is a pain as they've made it as difficult as possible to ascertain which row is which at least in the room we were in. The bass kickers in the seat were weak and felt like more of a distraction than anything else. There is also no elbow room to speak of.\n",
      "\n",
      "#9 - Audio/Video - Others have complained that the audio system isn't great. And it isn't. I went to an Atmos-enabled room and I'm surprised that Dolby has signed off on this. The audio quality was quite poor. The widescreen was underwhelming as was the projection. After seeing Dolby Vision projectors at AMC in Assembly. I know that Dolby Cinema is exclusive to AMC in the US, but you would think they would have put in at least a 4K laser projector. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't see the value in this theater. Its location isn't quite as convenient as the AMC in Boston Common. It isn't as quaint as the theater in Somerville. It's not as impressive as the theater in Assembly Row or as I would guess the new theater in the Seaport. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't imagine this theater will be successful given how much it must cost to rent the space. They've oddly gone for quantity over quality and when that fails, they will simply end up marking up the ticket prices and at that point, people will just go to the Common AMC.\n",
      "What a dumpster fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been to 2 Arclights -Bethesda and their anchor tenant location in LA where they run the old Cinerama dome with a multiplex connected to it in Hollywood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked forward to a new theater in Boston with some trepidation given those experiences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Arclight's shitick is \"conservation of the purity of the cinematic experience\".   This includes barring late arriving patrons, popcorn in buckets instead of bags because they are less noisy (seriously?) and a low risk smattering of low risk/broadly distributed Indy movies mixed in with the mainstream fare they actually trade in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing with ArcLight is they seem to have lost touch with the times.  A pioneer in reserved seating, that's now available pretty much everywhere.  And the stadium seating that their pre-movie commercial acclaims as such a great thing is such a very decidedly 90's sort of innovation it barely qualifies as quaint that they would try to make something of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is an ArcLight with a difference - recliners!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so Ive awaited its opening with hopes it would deliver something no Aarclight Ive experienced has done before:  film obsessive compulsive purism plus creature comforts that serve the customer buying a ticket rather than the director or actor who want you to hang on their every word and gesture as though your life depended on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there's the rub.\n",
      "\n",
      "On arriving I was struck that unlike the Icon in Seaport, the garage doesn't deliver you to the theater.  You have to walk around the building on an outdoor sidewalk to get to the front door.  What a privilege for your parking fee (more on that later).  That will be fun when it starts snowing in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the entry is pretty starkly utilitarian in a modern sort of way.  But once up an escalator you are delivered to a mini lobby, with a mini bar and a fully automated mini concession stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AMCs entry in Somerville looks like a football stadium in comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmmmmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the menu?  Literally just 2 preparations of hot dogs, popcorn and a half dozen candies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmmmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on to the theater.  A nice sized hall with recliners.  All is good, right?  Yes?\n",
      "\n",
      "No.  The seats are firm to the point of therapeutic and of the most bizarre design.  Hard fabric covered things with narrow arm rests, tall backs and 8 inch tall headrests on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting in one I was struck by a few things.  They are hard.  The top of the seat back leans back so far that if you recline the seat and lean back to relax your head it will be pointed at the ceiling.  So to see the screen you have to lean your head forward while reclined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you just how comfortable that is.  On the other hand, let me tell you the truth - it really and truly sucks.  Did no one sit in these things before they bought them?   The ArcLight hype is that every seat is designed to provide the optimum viewing angle.  Apparently that only occurs if you torture your neck and leave with a crick in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I moved forward in the largely vacant theater a few rows at a time as the movie played.  The closer to the screen I got, the better the seat angle worked, but unfortunately, by the time it did, the second problem presented itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 8 inch tall headrests on the the rows in front stuck up in front of the screen as though the heads of patrons of a cinema from the 60s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful.  Hard, uncomfortable recliners that are torturous to sit in in any way other than not reclined that cause pain when they are unless you sit where the seats in front of you obscure your vision of the purity of true cinema.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way I could sit that didn't hurt (initially) was to scoot forward in the seat so far my head rested on the seat back with my legs hanging half the way off the kick out reclining foot rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is literally half as comfortable as it sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left 3/4ths of the way through Knives Out in spite of the promised post movie prerecorded interview with the director.  It felt as if I hung around for that I would have needed orthopedic surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "So forget the recliners.  Buy a ticket to a non reclining seat in the back third of the theater the way god (ArcLight) intended and take your movie medicine.  Sit bolt upright, transfixed on the screen the way Hollywood intended without the slightest concern for your own comfort or preference, never mind a superior user experience served up at AMC Assemby Row, AMC Southbay, Icon Seaport, Superlux....fill in the blank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah.  The parking.  That was the saving grace.  Parking in the North garage on a vacant night only cost $40.\n",
      "\n",
      "$40 freaking dollars.  Grab your wallets and go catch the late show!!!!\n",

      "Restaurant: Hilton Boston Back Bay\n",
      "After a terrible Hilton experience in Portsmouth, NH, we were given a Hilton free stay pass to any Hilton in the US to give them another shot. We were understandably gun-shy about going back to the brand after such an excruciatingly bad last stay, but we were pleasantly surprised and delighted at the turnabout experience at the Hilton Boston Back bay!\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time we stayed, there was a ton of construction surrounding the hotel. They even had police outside trying to direct the traffic because there was construction on the street, on nearby buildings, and on sidewalks. When we did manage to get into the breezeway, we were guided into their self-parking garage, and took the elevator down to the lobby. Inside, the décor was clean, inviting, and fresh, with a bright and airy feel. Our front desk attendant was helpful and accommodating at check in, and we had no problem getting our room promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our pass was for a king bedroom, and ours was beautiful. The room was expansive with wraparound bay windows, a gorgeous bathroom, and the most surprising of all: AUTOMATIC BLINDS! I was so stoked. I played with them for a good 3 minutes before I saw our view, which was the new building going up right in front of us, covered in construction orange fencing, and blocking any semblance of what could have been a view. Le Sigh. Undaunted, we left the sheers closed, and remarked on the cleanliness of the room, and the perfectly soft yet supportive bed. The sheets and towels were plush and well-kept, and I was very happy to see boutique-level prestige bath products on stock, as well as chocolates on the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regular cost for this room would have been more than what we paid for the hilton hotel in Portsmouth (over $400), but this hotel actually was WORTH the price. This is what a Hilton should be, this is the Hilton name and legacy proving why Hilton continues to be a timeless beacon in the industry. We absolutely would stay here again, and it was a refreshing change from our previous Hilton experience. Maybe Portsmouth Hilton should come stay here and figure out how it's really done? Just a thought...\n",
      "My girlfriend and I got a room at the Hilton Back Bay for around $100 for a Sunday night in February. We snapped it up, which proved to be a very good decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the rooms themselves are nothing amazing, they were clean and comfortable and just fine with us. The service was also good. They even brought a little can of shaving cream up to the room when I realized I'd left home without mine. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best part about this hotel is its location -- just a few blocks over from both Boylston Street, Newbury Street, and Commonwealth Ave. A 15-minute stroll had us walking on the frozen ponds in the Commons. We were also right around the corner from Top of the Hub (http://www.yelp.com/biz/top-of-the-hub-boston#hrid:LKarAojqKH-TlIEj9C99uw) and the Prudential T stop. Parking cost us $41 for the day, but they let us leave the car in the garage for a few hours after checkout at no extra charge.\n",

      "I was not impressed with this poke place at all. I recognize that they just opened but since poke places have been around for quite some time I would have expected that they would have known how to do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a make your own poke bowl and got the large, which means I got to choose 3 \"meats\". The regular size is one meat only, and is 10.95. I got 3 TINY scoops of fish on top of a huge bed of rice. All of the toppings I added were also dollop sized or smaller and I had to ask for more of everything. Being stingy about sesame seeds is beyond me. I got the classic sesame sauce but overall the whole bowl was rather tasteless and I ended up putting on several packets of soy sauce to give it some flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The meal put me back $15, and it is definitely not worth it.\n",
      "If you've ever read any of my other reviews for Poke places in the Boston / Greater Boston Area, you'll know I've been making my way to every single Poke Place in the area. I found out this place opened up and just had to try it! The place is on the smaller side with some seating. The menu is written on chalk and not the most organized so it was a bit hard to read / understand if you'd never ordered a Poke Bowl before. I will agree with other reviews in saying the ordering is a bit confusing and the people who work there weren't the friendliest / most helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The listed items on the menu also differed then what the actual protein and topping were. It was a bit disappointing that Crab Salad was considered a Protein here since pretty much every other Poke Place is considered a topping that is part of the price or maybe a $1 more. They do however have a few more options that typical Poke Places as far as Protein and Toppings and Sauces. I got the Tuna tossed in Poke Sauce (which he didn't actually ask me but just did it on his own, which is fine, but probably should have asked), and drizzled with Sriracha Mayo, then topped with Seaweed Salad, Sweet Onion, Tamago, Jalapeno and more. They don't give you a lot (tiny clamp worth) of toppings, but a decent scoop amount of Protein. Eating it was still delicious though and filling. This place is on the lower end of the spectrum of pricing of a Poke Bowl compared to others. It's a bit far from my office, but if I was in the area, I'd still come here.\n",

      "I just happened to be passing Finch, and noticed that there was a menu displayed near one of the rear doors. I stopped and took a sneak peek. To my surprise, the breakfast menu had a Crab Cake Benedict on it and for a premo location between the garden and the court house it was only $15. It was 7:30 am and I didn't have to be to work until 9, so I decided to sit and enjoy a nice breakfast. Well let me tell you, that's exactly what happened. I went in ordered the Crab Cake Benedict sat in one of the comfy living room chairs and enjoyed the lobby area. When my breakfast arrived, It looked beautiful and tasted even better.  The English Muffin was soft and crunchy with 2 perfectly cooked crab cakes topped with a poached egg and sauce. They served it with perfectly prepared home fries. This was as close to a perfect plate as it gets. I will defiantly be going back for a second round of Crab Cake Benedict. \n",

      "When it is late at night on Beacon  Hill and you have that craving for a late night snack, Felcaro Pizza is the right place at the right time. At least it was for us when we were up for a late night snack. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Felcaro Pizza is diagonally across from the Beacon Hill Wyndham where we were staying on Cambridge Street. If you are unfamiliar with Cambridge Street it is the busy arterial that divides Beacon Hill from the West End and connects Cambridge with downtown Boston. In the vicinity of the Beacon Hill Wyndham, Cambridge Street is devoid of activity on a late weeknight in Boston. The CVS has long closed for the night. When you are by this hotel and Massachusetts General Hospital, a late night pizzeria and sub shop is golden. \n",
      "\n",
      "  When we were walking west on Cambridge Street hoping that the further CVS by the station was open, we came across Felcaro. In addition to Felcaro being the cure for a late night snack attack, it would bestow me with one more chance to eat and savour that delicious Boston pizza that is rare where I live in Las Vegas. For sure, the slice of pizza that went for around $3 and 16 ounce bottle of soda exceeding $2 was inflated; but it was worth it. It wasn't the best but at the time I ate it in the  late night for those minutes it was. Although it is considered Boston style pizza, the slice was identical to the New York slice that I grew up with. There was zero difference in the thin slice, marinara sauce, and melting cheese. Just like the New York slice of pizza that molded me into a life long pizza lover, I couldn't have only one. I'd return to the counter for a second. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Where my brother and I seemed to have the northernmost sidewalk of Beacon Hill (Cambridge Street) to ourselves, we shared Felcaro Pizza with several night owls. There was a constant line to the counter and the pizzeria was close to filling up. The clientele ranging from college kids to seniors created a moderate to loud noise level. If I wanted to listen to a professional sports broadcast on the TV that hung from the brick wall or to the right of the counter, it would be hard to hear. Felcaro was more about the scent of taste than hearing. \n",
      "\n",
      "   When we left Felcaro it was a much closer walk to the hotel than it would of been from the CVS by the station if it was even open. My post dining mood was appreciation for the facts that Felcaro was open late and granted me an additional opportunity to eat and savour  Boston pizza.\n",
      "There are a few pizza and sub spots along Cambridge Street and Felcaro is one of them. We popped in for lunch. A few different pizzas available and ready, they also have a wide menu of others they'll prepare and sandwiches/subs too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered two slices of the veggie pizza and after a few minutes of being reheated in the oven, they were ready. Nicely topped with red onions, green peppers, mushrooms, chunked and sliced tomatoes. The crust was nice and crisp on the bottom. Very thick, almost too much to fold in half. Two slices was plenty for this big boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some tables and counter space inside.\n",

      "Restaurant: Bombay Club\n",
      "Not a real fan of this place. It is really the only place in teh Fanueil Hall area for Indian and, unfortunately, it is not that great. It seems like a lot of the food sits out way too long. I suppose that is fine for lunch, but, when I am usually here in the evening, the food looks real gross. The naan is not bad, but everything is rather overpriced. Not recommended.\n",
      "Darned if I didn't spend $2.00 for naan here that was spongey, lukewarm, and tasteless. My saag paneer was fresh from the oven, so it was delicious, but the naan was enough to leave a literal bad taste in my mouth. Next time I'm going to Gourmet India in the Pru for lunch.\n",

      "Restaurant: Elements Café\n",
      "Elements is one of those lunch places I would go to every day if I were rich (like most of its patrons, current or future MDs of Harvard). They have a wide selection of offerings that are all really fresh (mostly pretty healthy too) and generally made to order, relying on local and sustainable ingredients. Everything I've had there has been super tasty and many items they offer are quite unique... for example, today they had a Native American themed flair (which apparently translated into swordfish, roasted cauliflower, and potato wedges?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Features:\n",
      "-a cold salad bar (fresh spinach and mixed fish salad anyone?) and a hot entree bar (usually with a protein and 3-4 sides) that are both pay per ounce which is nice (.44 I believe)\n",
      "-sandwich bar where you can get your usual ham and cheese as well as some inventive offerings (mango chicken wrap?)\n",
      "-action station (changes daily but is generally things like pastas, rices, etc, made/mixed to order)\n",
      "-flatbread station (they have some really interesting flavor combos, like butternut squash and prociutto)\n",
      "-bbq station (meat, sides, cornbread, all kinds of bbq sauces)\n",
      "-grill area for things like hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, etc (HUGE plus for me: their turkey burgers are not only locally sourced and delicious, they're cheaper than the beef burgers! So often are beef burgers- which I don't eat- cheaper than turkey and veggie burgers- which I do-, but not here! the whole unhealthy-foods-are-less-expensive trend is the major cause of our country's obesity epidemic IMO... but I digress)\n",
      "-daily specials throughout (one of today's was a brisket sandwich with a side of cheesy potato hash and marinated cherry tomatoes for $6.50)\n",
      "-chef's table- generally a really fancy entree made by a dedicated chef for about $10. The other week it was scallops and some kind of puree, and it looked and smelled fabulous (but who has $10 to spend on lunch?)\n",
      "-build your own snack cup (mostly candy and dried fruit offerings)\n",
      "-various prepackaged sushi options, and the usual chips/cookies/sodas/juices/waters/etc (with some organic options, of course)\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the meats proudly list what local source they come from (I think my turkey burger was from Nieman Ranch), and they strive to obtain most offerings locally and are good about labeling everything they offer in terms of diet (i.e. lacto-ovo vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free, etc). They definitely care not only about the environment but about their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really do love this place but can barely ever come because it's just too expensive, which is why it only gets 3 stars; rarely will you walk out of here for less than $7 (and that's not including a drink). Today's minimal meal of a plain turkey burger and a bag of chips cost me $5.50, which for Elements' main clientele may seem like pennies, but to a poor (non-Harvard) grad student it's about 2 times more than I'm willing to afford for lunch on a daily basis. So sadly, Elements remains an infrequent (but delicious) treat for me...\n",
      "So I've seriously been trying to go here for almost 6 months now and every time I do something happens and I never make it there. Well today I finally made it and I'm kicking myself for not going sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "First I have to say I like that they post the menu on a website that is kept up to date so you can see if there is anything you want before you go. Next, the amount of selections available is very varied and I would have been happy with almost any of the choices that were available. Lastly, I liked that everything was healthy and locally sourced.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is far from perfect though. The signage for what was being served is way tiny and placed in a way that you have to look like your cutting in the line to read it. The price is a bit high for lunch coming in just a bit more than the CHB cafe, but lower the O'Naturals (MIne was $8). The atmosphere in the seating area was a bit stuffy. It sounded more like a library then a busy cafeteria/restaurant at peak lunch time. I was a little weirded out by this to be honest especially since my lunch companions and I aren't exactly quiet sometimes. Lastly, cash only? Seriously, WTF. I understand little family run joints that are cash only or whose transactions are all under $5, but Harvard University can't spring to get a POS device in there.\n",

      "This place will definitely be added into the regular lunch rotation now.\n",

      "Restaurant: Cindy's Planet\n",
      "Good place to go to for boba tea. Very nice brew, and the boba is always perfect, not to mushy, not to hard. They also serve great finger food, such as satay fishballs on a stick, great spring rolls, and other daily specialties. So it's a good place so stop by when you're on the go, and don't have time to eat. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer, they make their own ice cream. Flavors like sesame, green tea, azuki bean, taro.....asian flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh, and don't forget about the watermelon freeze in the summer. fresh cubes of watermelon in a blender with a little bit of crushed ice. omg! you're literally drinking watermelon through a straw!\n",
      "If based strictly on food, this place deserves only 3 stars.  However, what is surprisingly pleasant about this place are: Boba tea, cleanliness and that it is never too crowded.\n",

      "Restaurant: Mo'Rockin Fusion\n",
      "We tried Mo'Rockin Fusion and enjoyed the experience overall. They offer a full halal menu, several protein options, and a bunch of sauces. They offer a chipotle style experience where you add toppings as you go. We really enjoyed the lamb, although the chicken was still good. Prices are fair, and service was friendly and fast. They were in their opening month (transitioning from a food truck), so things didn't seem all there at the time. That being said, the food was solid, so we'd definitely try them again.\n",
      "Now for something different!!\n",
      "Tons of food trucks yet this one stood out as having Moroccan food. Took me a minute to figure out the name-duh!  Had the lamb which was delicious. Had a little rice and quinoa which were both really good--he was nice enough to give me a little of both.  Lamb was melt in your mouth. The sauces--I mixed white garlic with the tomato at his suggestion and it was a really good choice. People with me had the chicken and loved it. The dish was only $10 and there was plenty of food. Came with a small side of salad with olive and tomato. Guy that runs the truck could not be friendlier and helpful.  Really enjoyed my meal. Will definitely try again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Restaurant: Pizza Shuttle\n",
      "Pizza Shuttle is, frankly, a little strange.  There's no denying it.  If you spend any amount of time in Pizza Shuttle, you will see among the customers more local flavor than you could ever get on a pizza.  \n",
      " \n",
      "A man with a bag full of nips once told me to never start drinking or do drugs. He then went on a paranoid tirade about he knows my parents (who live in Maine, by the way) and knows what they think of him and that's why they sent me down to pick up the pizza instead of coming to get it themselves. I once saw a man in his 60's hitting on some teenage girls, which actually wouldn't seem overly strange if not for the fact that they seemed to be flirting back. Then there are the men who I see coming in from the door next to Pizza Shuttle which simply has the words \"Private Club\" on it in stick-on letters.  \n",
      " \n",
      "All of that, though, does not change the fact that Pizza Shuttle is my go-to pizza place.  Other more well-known places may be within walking distance of my house, but 99 times out of 100, I'll go to Pizza Shuttle.  The pizza, first of all, is delicious.  The dough is very tasty and just thick enough to hold up the toppings without everything sliding off when you try to pull it apart.  They have a good selection of toppings and specialty pizzas, too.  We usually get the spinach and garlic pizza, which is great and really packed with flavorful garlic.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Also, love the fries.  Anywhere else we go for pizza, it's usually just the pizza, we rarely even mention the idea of getting fries, too.  But one day we tried Pizza Shuttle's fries, which were crunchy and well-seasoned and just as greasy as you would want your fries to be.  Now, every time we order pizza we have to decide between the fatty choice of getting a greasy pizza or the super tubbo choice of a greasy pizza and a giant order of fries (there is only one size, and it's huge).  There is often some hemming and hawing, some \"Should we get fries?  I don't know... okay, let's just get them,\" like it's some kind of special splurge, just this once.  But the truth is, we make the same decision almost every time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There is one benefit to getting the fries beyond just the fact that they are excellent.  Pizza Shuttle has a $15 minimum on credit card purchases, but most of their pizzas are under $15.  So if you want to go but don't have any cash?  Fries cost just enough to get it over that threshold.  It's like some kind of devious trick!  A delicious, delicious devious trick. \n",
      " \n",
      "Finally, as I've mentioned before, I like when people I don't know call me \"my friend.\"  I don't know what it is about it, but it's very endearing, and some of the guys here do that.  They are very nice, and even though they are all a little hard to understand, they always have a smile.  I usually call in my order for pickup, and when I show up to pick up the pizza, they immediately know who I am.  Someone usually catches my eye as soon as I walk in the door (I know my pizza is done when I walk in because all I can smell is garlic) and they have my pizza sitting on the counter before I can even walk up there to pay for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really like Pizza Shuttle.  Come here for great, cheap pizza and fries.  Do not come here for something upscale or healthy.  Come to stuff your face and be happy.\n",
      "call me crazy, but i am a sucker for your typical greek pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "not only does this place save my phone number and remember i always order a pineapple pizza, but their delivery time is respectable, and their delivery guys are very sweet.  never had a smooshed or messed up pizza, and i have always received it hot and steaming.\n",

      "Restaurant: Fillbelly's The Kitchen Kingz\n",
      "Ugh. I hate giving 2 stars to a family biz, but this Sunday I stood in line for Fillbelly's at the 1st annual food truck festival in the (fake wanna-be Soho) neighborhood of SoWa. I really don't think some of these trucks, including Fillbelly's was prepared at all for the kind of crowd that arrived for this event, which I think means there's a demand for food trucks in one place in Boston on a more regular basis than once a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I'd heard good things about Fillbelly's. So I stood in line for an hour and 45 minutes! YES! almost 2 hours! First, it took a while for the truck to start taking orders. Then 20 minutes into taking orders, they ran out of the chicken and waffles and mac & cheese! I should have left then, but I mean at that point I'd waited 45 minutes and there were only about 25 people in front of me. How much longer could it take!? UGH! Plus, the mac and soul casserole (mac & cheese and collard greens) sounded interesting and so did the West Indies platter (grilled pork, rice & beans, and friend plantains).  Also I wanted to try the bosolitos.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really really really wanted to say that the food was worth the wait.  But I was soooo disappointed.  The pork was dry like rocks. The plantains were really hard.  The mac and soul casserole was dried out and cold and almost flavorless.  The only thing that was ok were the bosolitos which were kinda like empanadas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe under less pressure and with a smaller line, Fillbelly's would make me happy. Unfortunately, it was a very very sad experience.\n",
      "Twice I've had the 'pleasure' of experiencing the food from Fillbelly's at the SoWa market and twice it was a fiasco and disappointment. The first time might not entirely be their fault, it was at the 1st annual food truck festival and they were slammed beyond belief. Erick H and I waited in line for 75 minutes before finally placing our order; at that point they ran out of almost everything, including their empanadas. The only thing left was their West Indies plate which was a few pieces of fried pork, plantains and some beans and rice. It was decent but not great. The pork was very dry as where the plantains which were in the oil too long and came out hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I I really wanted to try was their empanadas, which they call bosilitos, and which some people have raved about. This opportunity came last Sunday and I seized it, ordering two sets of chicken and two sets of BBQ pulled pork bosilitos. What they didn't tell me was that I'd have to wait another 25 minutes before they were ready at the window. I wish I had been told that before I ordered them, especially since it was 90+ degrees outside and there was no shade in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once they had arrived, I grabbed them all excited and bit my way right in. They were ok, not nearly as good as I had expected them to be. Definitely not worth it. So to sum things up, my first experience there, the pieces of pork were really dry and the beans and rice were decent, and then the second time, the bosilitos were overrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service isn't very friendly, especially in comparison to other food truck's I've been to and the wait is ridiculous. Twice was enough for me, I'm done.\n",

      "Restaurant: IL Mondo Pizzeria\n",
      "I ordered a pizza and an appetizer from them for delivery, and when they called 40 minutes later (me thinking they were at the door with my food), they told me that they couldn't fulfill the order and that I lived too far away (I live in Boston, by the way). He wasn't apologetic at all. I can't understand how it took that long for him to tell me that; he clearly just looked at the order 40 minutes after receiving it. Now it's 11:30 at night on a Sunday and other options are closed, and I'm starving. \n",

      "\n",
      "My first encounter was last week.  He abruptly asked me if I wanted a slice, I told him which kind, and he pulled one out and said, \"there, nice and fresh for ya, boss.\"  They normally put the pizza in the oven, but I took him at his word.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was cold.  Jerk move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I come in, order from another guy who's cool, and pay the girl, and then I stand back from the counter, all while guy 1 is looking RIGHT at me.  I start looking at the TV, and I hear yelling.  I ignore it. I hear it again, turn and see this guy yelling, AT ME, \"hey, buddy, c'mon whatcha want?\" in a super \"stop wasting my time\" tone.  I say I'm all set, and he just glares at me.\n",

      "- Breakfast BLT. This was amazing. The addition of pesto and some kind of really delicious cheese makes this a sandwich an adventure with every bite. This is not your regular BLT.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Egg sandwich w/bacon. I don't remember exactly what made this sandwich so good, but it was good. Even eating it with the seemingly similar breakfast BLT didn't seem redundant. \n",

      "- Brioche French toast. My friends loved this one, and I did too for the most part. but I thought the brioche slices were just too thick, and the egginess of the bread was overpowering. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Millionaire's bacon. The hostess/server/comedian who took our order saw that we were ordering lots of bacon and recommended that we try this side dish. She described it as \"spicy and sweet,\" and we were sold. It was, with no doubt, the most delicious bacon I'd ever tasted. Caked with brown sugar (I think), it was just marvelous. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Parsnip soup. This was a great complement to the very heavy (but of course YUMMY) breakfast dishes that filled our side of the table. A bowl of this stuff was enough for the four of us to share. It was mild, creamy, and tasted delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were lucky to have gone on an extremely rainy Saturday morning and were only one of two or three groups to be in there during our stay. But really, there is hardly any seating. So, like others have said, be prepared to wait if you're not there on the early side or on a disgusting (but glorious!) day like last Saturday.\n",

      "We started taking segway tours last year and we have toured 6 or 7 cities throughout the country.  This is by far the WORST tour.  When booking we were told only 6 in a group for safety sake.  But when we arrived, our group of 5 was joined with another group of 7 making a very long segway train and only one \"captain.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "But - what made the tour not only terrible, but very dangerous was the traffic.  In Boston they don't allow segways on the sidewalks, so we were stuck driving in rush hour traffic.  And I do mean \"IN\" rush hour traffic.  Local drivers were yelling and honking at us since we were blocking turn lanes and rushing through yellow lights.  My 14 and 16 year old kids were too nervous to enjoy anything. (I can't imagine  how nervous the other father was with his 3 kids on the tour.)  We spent so much time waiting in traffic we were cheated out of a good tour due to lack of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to top it off, my segway ran out of juice the last 1/2 mile so I walked it back and missed the last 15 minutes of the tour.  While waiting at the shop for my group to complete the tour, two more people were walking and pulling their segways as well.\n",

      "I quite liked Caffe Umbra when I visited on a saturday night in November. It was quite tastefully done up inside and the staff were excellent and attentive. I don't think either myself or the menu knows whether it's an Italian or French restaurant but actually that's not too bad a confusion to cause. I would recommend the wondefully rich bouillabaisse and the devine salted caramel ice cream (yum yum).\n",
      "\n",
      "It was relatively painless compared to other South End dining experiences and quite nicely combined with pre-dinner cocktails at Pho Republique. I found the wine was a little expensive but the food was reasonable value for quite creative and well-executed dishes.\n",
      "The sommelier at Caffe Umbra is some kind of wine avatar.  Ask what's great and you will be impressed by the offering. The food is excellent, I have eaten here many times and always been very pleased. The sticky toffee pudding is delightful.  I prefer to eat in the bar area, I find the dining room to be a tad oppressive.\n",

      "Restaurant: TeaMoji\n",
      "The owner at TeaMoji has a strong aesthetic sense as far as understanding what the folks around Allston would like. There was a beautiful handpainted backdrop, natural lighting, clean wooden furniture and counter, adorable decors in a fun boardgame-friendly atmosphere. What's mainly their focus is their picturesque worthy desserts and drinks which was one of the reasons why we had to stop by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taro Frappe- Such a cute looking drink but it was completely bland. It wasn't sweet nor did it tasted like taro. Perhaps it's because it's a powdered drink.\n",
      "Milk Shaved Ice- The container for this was huge but there were only 5 spoonfuls of sweet-milk flavored shaved ice in there submerged in red beans and topped with marshmallows. The combination was okay since I was sharing with my nephew but definitely one of the most underwhelming desserts I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall Service: The young man at the counter was less than helpful. We asked if there's anything he would recommend to us since we have a toddler with us and he pointed to the menu and said he didn't know. Okay so we asked what's popular and he didn't respond. How about what's a good combination of toppings to throw in the shaved ice since there was no layout of the ingredients, nothing. Right. I would highly recommend a signature menu of curated shaved ice bowls. And the owner responded to one of the review advising the customer to come back and to let them know if they are not satisfied with the items. Absolutely, I agree 100%, if the staff was friendly or self-aware of how he comes off when refuses to interact with the customers right from the beginning. But take this friendly rebuttable with a grain of salt, I think the manager, who seems like a nice young lady, should work with the staff on customer service first before giving out advice on what customer should do.\n",

      "Restaurant: Boston Public\n",
      "The service was the worst I have ever experienced in Boston; the staff was completely inept and unapologetic.  First we waited over an hour to be served our appetizer and only then because I told the manager we had been waiting a long time.  The manager did not apologize, but instead proceeded to reprimand the waiter in front of us.  Next we asked for a second bottle of wine and had to make no less then different five selections and each time we were told the restaurant was out of that bottle.   There must have been twenty bottles on the list and even using the list our next selection was not available.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter did not bring out any of the sides we ordered.  When asked where the sides were, the waiter told us they were no longer available.  We stated that we didn't want any other sides he offered another potato option, we said fine and he proceeded to charge us for it.  He should know to give the customers something for the many inconveniences throughout the night.  He never once checked in to ask how everything was or if we needed anything!!!  The manager did nothing even though he clearly knew service was bad, he never apologized and we were not the only table complaining. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've written a letter to the chef/owner and have receive NO response, there are SOOO many better steakhouses in the city.\n",
      "Just went here for Restaurant Week lunch. The food was very good. The rolls (sort of flatbread) were a fantastic start to the meal. Next, the edamame, which was a bit buttery, was still delicious. The skirt steak was great, very tender and tasty. For desert I had the cheesecake which was really good and served with a slice of fresh orange and grapefruit. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. The decor was very nice, with a view out to boylston street and some interesting light fixtures. I could see this place attaining a fifth star, but I'd have to go back another time and see the prices and selection on the non-restaurant week menu. Overall a great experience, though, I highly recommend giving it a try.\n",

      "\n",
      "Each skewer costs $1.50. I wish there was more meat per skewer. Before I could savor the taste of the delicious lamb, it was all gone! :( I could probably have 10 of this to be satisfied. I especially like sprinkling the spicy chili powder on the skewers!\n",
      "\n",
      "This truck is located in Chinatown! These skewers are great for snacking!\n",
      "I LOVE LAMB. Since moving to Boston, Wow Barbecue has been the only food truck I've consistently visited every few weeks (or basically whenever it's near my vicinity). Skewers feature pieces of cumin-seasoned lamb alternating with succulent pieces of fat, creating an addictive taste that keeps me coming back for more. The quail eggs here also a treat and perfect late night snack! \n",
      "\n",
      "Fun fact: the caucasian guy who sometimes works the cash register speaks better Mandarin Chinese then I do (sad but true), which is why my husband forces me to practice with the guy by ordering in Chinese. This small effort probably won't help my language skills much, but if it means eating more lamb, I won't complain.\n",

      "Restaurant: Kim's Tofu\n",
      "It's rare that a new restaurant gets so many 5* reviews early on so when I saw the ratings for Kim's tofu, I knew I had to try it and this is now my new go to Korean restaurant (sorry kaju). Banchan offerings were limited to 5 items (ask for refills) including a whole fish and the menu is simple: selection of tofu soups, kalbi, pork, fish, and seafood pancake. The only thing I wish they offered is japchae, but I ordered the usual - seafood pancake, kalbi, and medium seafood soup with oyster rice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seafood pancake is unlike any other places, it was a lot less oily and it was much thinner and crispier, which I really liked but I could see why some people would pass. The kalbi is a must try! It was juicy and perfectly flavored, hands down the best kalbi I've had in Boston yet. The seafood tofu soup was delicious; the seafood is fresh and soup was very flavorful but spicy. I tried medium and thought it was a true medium Korean level of spice but my friends thought the mild was too spicy, so keep that in mind if you're someone who's shy about spice. Last thing I wanted to mention is the oyster rice, which I absolutely loved and would definitely recommend paying more for! \n",
      "\n",
      "Other cool highlights - the barley tea they pour into your rice pot to create a light porridge and the sweet drink they offer at the end of the meal!\n",
      "After coming here with another Yelper (shoutout to Teresa C), I have to say this place produces pretty solid soondubu. They start off with an organic tofu appetizer that is served with a side of soy (?, confirm if I am wrong) sauce. I ordered the regular old beef tofu soup at medium spicy level while my friend ordered seafood (?) beef tofu soup at mild spicy level. Their banchan is stronger than other Korean restaurants as they served eggplant, fresh kimchi, marinated shrimp, cucumbers, and a fried grouper (rare to find in Boston). The soondubu stew was filled with a supple amount of tofu and had a more robust soup base, making for an all around pleasant dining experience. Please note that the medium spicy level is nothing to sneeze at and should be approached with more caution than if you went to Kaju. They also poured tea into the leftover crispy rice to let you clean off your bowl and then wrapped it all up with some cinnamon tea. They did have a few minor hiccups regarding service (forgot the egg for my friend's soondubu) but all in all, I like what I see from Kim's Tofu and am definitely interested in returning. Do try to get here as early as possible (5:30 or so on Thursday was enough to avoid the dinner rush) because a line started forming little by little after we got seated. Serendipity or not, this was definitely a good, semi-impromptu food adventure.\n",

      "Food: I got the yellow eel clay pot rice (a classic) and something I've never seen before in Boston. Fresh made cheung fun (rice noodles)! The rice is served in the clay pot as usual topped with stir fried slivers of eel and topped with a handful of cilantro. No need to add soy sauce as the rice is already really flavorful from the eel. The noodles are fresh made with ground pork and egg (+$1), served with a sweet soy sauce. Aside from actually being in Taishan, I haven't seen these fresh made cheung fun before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just for the noodles itself I am giving this place 5 stars for its unique offering! The rice itself is a 3.5/4 stars which is comparable to the Clay Pot Café. After eating it at the source in Taishan, nothing else compares to it. But I will most definitely be back to eat again when I have the craving!\n",
      "Never judge a book from its cover. This tiny restaurant is hard to find and it is located near Chinatown, not inside Chinatown. \n",
      "It only has four tables in the restaurant, but it provides multiple choices of dishes. In particular, Asian swamp eel with claypot rice is a specially recommended dish. The claypot rice is crispy and the Asian eel is soft and delicious.\n",

      "They have food of less than average quality.   The atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  It's been mostly empty every time I've gone.  It's pretty out of the way.  And they don't mix very good drinks (in my opinion).\n",
      "Was looking for a late-night bite in the North End and stumbled upon this place mainly because it was close to where we were before.  It was close to 9pm on a Friday and we were the only patrons on the 1st floor.  Granted, a large group had just exited the establishment, hollering and jumping on a car parked in front of the place.  It was not their car, I presume, because they stumbled away.  \n",

      "Our waitress took our drink orders quickly, generously offering to split checks amongst our group of ~10, but not so generously telling us they didn't have tap water and would have to call in a plumber to fix their broken faucet.  Pretty unlikely.  However, pretty likely someone spit in our water.  It took forever for her to return for food orders.  By this time, more people had come into the 1st floor.  There was definitely a gaggle upstairs because we kept seeing the same few guys and girls walking up and down the stairs...to the bathroom?  To smoke outside?  Not sure, but it didn't look like they worked there.  \n",

We entered to an entirely deserted restaurant: tables set, lights up certainly a welcoming space, but no sign of life, no sounds. \"Hellooooo,\" we called, \"Anyone hereeeee?\" We peeked around the bar, admiring the brassware and Moroccan decor. Noting a stack of applications on the counter as a sign of life, we waited, pacing, glancing around. Noticing the winding hallway in the back, we yelled into the darkness. Out waddled the owner, who peered at us and then incumbent upon us being allowed to stay, asked what we wanted to eat. \n",

      "Picture the man behind the curtain. That's right, I'm talking about Oz. Make him from North Africa with an unbridled, strident manner and outfitted in a navy blue track suit .

      "And then when you ask about the price he'll say that the warm, intimate restaurant has been graced by luminaries such as Faye Dunway and the Bush family, and that the four guys who dined last night and stayed til 2am spend $1K each. So you'll be quaking in your shoes at dish after amazing dish. I'd suggest capping the night with the mint tea, served in gilded little glasses. At the very end we found that without tipple it was three figures for two. And yet I look forward to the special occasion when I can bring the S.O. here to experience the eccentricity  and charm.\n",

Scott Fitzgerald novel. \n",

You ever been in a room where there's this one guy that just sits there staring at you? That is the feeling you get with him. \n",

He actually is a warm family guy at heart, who absolutely adores his kids, and can be the most gracious of hosts to patrons of his establishment. When he's in the mood, he cooks up a freakishly amazing meal, accompanied by spectacular wine, and can end the meal in the most amazing rose-essenced fruit.\n",

In the 5 years I've been in and out of this place, I've never seen a single hired staff member that has lasted more than a month or two.... victims of Marvin the Martian throwing one of his many conniptions. Also, there have been days when he will 'recommend' his specials based on the fact that the food supply is old and greening, and he needs to get rid of it before it turns into nuclear matter. I have been disappointed on a couple occasions that I was victim to this. I initially thought that my taste buds just didnt' accept the dish, but a few months later, when a friend's colleague from the Westin Copely took a job there in the kitchen, he was horrified to report and confirm my suspicions. \n",

      "Tasty BBQ is cafeteria style, where you order up, they scoop pre-made food, and you're out of there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was quite friendly.  The meat tender enough, and the collard greens wet and overcooked with dry bits of meat, but okay on the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Double Tasty $11.75 so that I could sample both their brisket and pork belly on one visit.  Both had some fat layered in there, but not overly so.  The belly was preferred.  Their bbq sauce was a good non-spicy option, and their pickles and onions helped to make the meal a tad healthier.  Their onions were surprising mild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, the Double Tasty is served with 2 meats, a hot & a cold side, pickles, raw onions, & bbq sauce, but they will allow a double portion of a side.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sampled a few other items on another visit, and found that I preferred the potato salad over the cole slaw for their cold side options.  The mac & cheese was pretty good, and their bbq brisket quite tender and tasty.  I didn't try the broccoli, but they were a beautiful vibrant green.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in terms of their meat, I recommend the bbq chopped brisket, then pork belly, and last but not least - the brisket.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for their desserts, I had their banana pudding $3 and caramel flan $3.25.\n",
      "\n",
      "The banana pudding is assembled before your eyes, with the pudding squeezed out of one of those plastic bags like frosting, several of those round Nilla Wafer type cookies placed along the edges, and topped off with whipped cream sprayed from those aerosol cans from the supermarket.  As such, the whipped cream doesn't last too long, and the cookies will soften over time.  There is no real banana sliced in unlike what is traditionally known as banana pudding in the US.  The pudding itself is rather dense and could do with a boost of banana flavoring, since it is after all called a banana pudding.  In short - tasty, eat it sooner than later, but not quite befitting its name.  (Turns out they forgot to add the sliced banana.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The flan was cut from a tray not quite 3/4 of an inch thick.  It is quite a dense dessert.  Creamy, sweet.  I liked it, though it wasn't the best rendition I've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another visit I tried out their banana bread french toast $3.50, biscuit with sweet butter $1.30 and french fries $2.50.\n",
      "\n",
      "The banana bread came in three slices, griddled warm (not sure if they did anything else to it to warrant the \"french toast\" description.  But warmed, with a swirl of whipped cream and some sliced banana, it made for a nice comforting (yet not too sweet) sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The french fries were nicely salted, and crispy in bits.  They were good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their biscuit reheated well and was quite nice.\n",
      "First of all, set your expectations as this is BBQ in a mall food court. That said, the staff was friendly and helpful, but the food was about what you'd expect. If you think 80/20 beef is way too lean, this may be the place for you. The pork ribs and chopped brisket were both very tender...fall off the bone ribs, not competition BBQ. Unfortunately, the chopped brisket was too fatty and the rub on the ribs was overly salty. The mac and cheese was gritty, but the greens were pretty decent. The portions were fair, and nothing was bad, but I gave it a try due to a Groupon and it's not likely food that I'd return for given other options in the area.\n",

My \"bargain radar\" brought us here. Our sandwiches were with fresh and flavorful ingredients, and the owner and his son were quick, friendly and conscientious.  I will be back as their prices can't be beat (7.99 cheeseburger with fries, same for his--to quote him, \"phenomenal\" Reuben).

Her husband got The Cowboy (Roast beef, cheese and BBQ sauce)  He enjoyed his, but commented that the BBQ sauce tasted like it was from McDonalds-- but hey, maybe that was a compliment!

Yesterday I walk into this sub shop and im greeted by a greasy guy who doesn't even say hello.  I proceed to smile and say \" Can I please have a Italian sub, but I do not want any \"- . Cut off.  He stops me there and states that the subs are \"pre-made\" with the meat so I would have to get it as is.  Wait... so I walk into a sub shop to get a Italian cub that I have gotten many times before(a very sweet younger guy usually makes it) and apparently I cannot customize it.  What if I was allergic to an ingredient.  Well long story short he rudely told me I can go somewhere else to get my sandwich because he was not making it.  I have never in my 28 years of life had such bad service and I will never go back there.  They lost a customer due to his ignorant behavior and that sucks. I ended up going to JOE'S SUB SHOP across the street and had a excellent customer service experience.  Go there if you want quality food.\n",
      "I don't know what the hell happened with this sub shop. Seems like the younger staff took over and now they're just unprofessional, tacky and the phone is ALWAYS off the hook. Why did I come in here to order food and when I get up to the counter there's 4 dudes sitting there (one with a hoodie on his head) just looking at me like \"what do you want\" instead of simply asking \"HOW MAY I HELP YOU\"? Other times I've come in here and they were playing playstation on the T.V. and another time they were playing Chess at one of the dining tables....no I'm not joking! A few times the guys that work here came in smelling like weed then went behind the counter to serve food. Okay I understand Dudley Square is considered the ghetto, but I will NOT spend my money where I can't get basic customer service. I went up the street to Suya Joint where the staff is more civilized, I'll never step foot in this raggedy ass restaurant again although they USED TO be one my favorite spots.\n",

      "Though quite pricey for $7 each, I really enjoyed both flavors!

If I really had to choose my favorite, I would say it's the Fruity Pebbles flavor that comes with sweet cereal ice cream, strawberries & fruity pebbles with condensed milk. Other favorites are the Thai Milk Tea and Cookies & Cream (Oreo) flavors. The menu has several signature flavors to choose from, but you can of course create your own as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "the past, when it came to Thai style ice cream rolls, I wasn't really a big fan because the ones I've had from other shops were lacking in flavor or the ingredients were just not fresh. However, I-CE-NY is different, and I love it I definitely recommend this place to everyone!\n",

I didn't want to be disappointed; but I was. I had the Caesar salad, and it was alright - nothing too special about romaine leaves with shaved parm. The ribs (being the star of the show) were quite a let down however, being unforgivingly chewy, stringy and tough. Perhaps they left it on the grill too long and forgot about it, since it had the consistency of leather basted in bourbon barbecue sauce. My desert (mudslide pie) was really, really sweet in a sickening way and I gave up about 3 forkfuls later. But my biggest gripe was probably my server Joe who obviously didn't want to work there and displayed the corresponding unprofessional attitude quite apparently.\n",
      "I am torn. I love the food at Chili's, the apps and the fajita quesadillas are awesome, and it's featured multiple times in one of my favorite shows, The Office. However, the service at this place really sucks. When we went the other night we waited 1.5 hours for a table. I wanted to go to chili's but I didn't want to be there for 3 hours. Other times that I've been the waiter has just been horrible, forgetting orders, giving us the wrong food, etc. Luckily for them, the tasty food has kept my rating up at a 3.\n",

I love everything on their menu (except the mussels, you can do without).  Their martini menu is what you should come for, very girly drinks with their pop rock martini and mango martini.  Gentlemen, I recommend you have your martini straight up (or dirty) if you don't want any raised sexy eyebrow from your dates.\n",

      "Theory 2: Each of the extremely-weak martini's here go for about 12 bucks. While I will grant them the acknowledgement of having interesting names like \"French Kiss\" and \"I can't believe I'm paying 12 bucks for a Martini,\" I think the owner named the club after the tendency to burn through money on drinks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Theory 3: The swank, yet laid-back atmosphere is inspired by a website designed for those trying to find a soul-mate electronically. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Anyway, the place sorta stinks. Not in a \"full-of-odor\" sort of way, but it's just really expensive without needing to be. Perhaps they feel like their location justifies the prices, because it sure as hell isn't the quality of the beverages. Martini's were weak and small. Mixed drinks (Rum & Coke, Seven & Seven) were watered down and also small. On top of that, the waitstaff was fairly neglectful when I went, visiting the group I was with once every 40-60 minutes.\n",

Therefore, workers in Longwood are left with the Dana Farber cafeteria which is an absolute Shangri-La of delicious food goodness!  The Dana cafeteria always has a wide selection of pizza, deli sanwiches, pasta dishes, soups etc.  Pretty good for such a small place!  They also have hot Starbucks coffee all day which really comes in handy at times.  The best thing about the Dana cafeteria is that you can get lunch at a price that is about half of what you would pay for food at other places around the Longwood area.\n",
      "There are not a lot of options to have quick and decent lunch in Longwood area. I would say Dana-Faber cafeteria is one of the best places to grab lunch. Their Friday clam chowder is my favorite. Also there are varieties of pizza slices, wraps, plates (fish, chicken, pork, beef), and fresh salad bar. Also microwave ovens are available.

The bbq beef in my sandwich was huge and had a lot of fat on it. It also did not have a flavor that would keep me coming back for more. I asked for extra spicy and was treated to 6 long slices of jalapeno. Mmmmmm I had to take some off because it was overkill. The spring rolls here were okay, but the peanut sauce that came with them was VERY watery. Next time I will stick with Ba Le.\n",

      "This right here ?! Today I had the pleasure of walking into the establishment better known as Blue Mountain Jamaican restaurant as a curious consumer and now I sit here as a faithful customer. First off, being a part of the Boston community for 27 years I have never been to a Jamaican restaurant that had such great customer service !!!! I was able to quickly order my oxtails, curry chicken, beef patties, and more. Each part of my order was met with an \"of course\" and a pleasant smile which automatically made me know I would be back in the near future ( tomorrow). However, what really hooked me was the actual flavor and decadence of the food. The alluring smell does not do this establishment the justice it deserves. All the food, piping hot but not scalding enough to have to toss in your mouth. Oxtails fresh off the bone as if you woke up to your West Indian mother's Sunday best. Rice and peas that carry love in each grain. And provisions touched by the hands of God himself. From the patty to the Mac and cheese I do not ever think that my stomach has had such pleasantries when it comes to Jamaican food in this city and now both my stomach and my mind have no shadow of a doubt when we search for a quench of hunger. Blue mountain, thank you for the amazing and hospitable services, if you ever get a chance please stop by to have a life changing experience. \"Out of many, one people\" is the motto of Jamaica and \"out of many only blue mountain\" is my new adaptation.\n",

It's dark and dingy looking. Very basement feel to it. The menu apparently changes often so don't expect to have what you see online. Very nice people though which is why I have given a 4/5\n",
      "I personally don't eat the food as some of my coworkers have gotten food poisoning here. The workers are very pleasant. I go there with my coworker frequently and we have been the only people \"in line\" to buy a water and it takes no less than 10 minutes to be rung up. I ordered a coffee and was the only one there and it took 15 minutes. There is no efficiency and it takes way too long to buy anything. If you're in a rush, don't go here\n",

On their inside-out rolls (sea weed in contact with the filling instead of on the outside of the rice), the owner/chef put chopped scallions over the rice, which I thought was a nice touch.\n",
      "Osaka is my favorite standard-issue sushi place. There was a time when I went there for lunch at least once a week. It got expensive but mmm was it good! The two sushi chefs I've had are great and the owners are wonderful. Service in the dining area is fast and courteous too. The sushi is above-average. It's a little expensive (their sodas are way overpriced) but that's probably because all the other sushi places in the area (Beacon Hill/West End) are pretty lame.\n",

That's why when people start telling me about their favorite place in the North End I roll my eyes and sigh dramatically: because that's a chump game. Just fuckin' pick one, you'll be fine.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's totally a gimmick! Whatever, there are like five different kinds of mozzarella and you pick one and some meat and that's your starter...it's not like revolutionary. It's just a restaurant where cheese is definitely your first course. But so what? It's a fun gimmick. You have fun doing it.\n",
      "\n",

I got the Risotto with pancetta and tomatoes which I loved.  My husband got the pasta and meatballs.  The meatballs were supposed to be filled with mozzarella but there weren't so that was disappointing.\n",

Their food is amazing, from the fish to the lamb. As far as drinks go, I give them five stars as well ... let's just say they are not fearful of filling up your martini glass! Drink and food prices are a bit expensive but other than that this place is one of our favorite seafood and martini restuarants to go to in Boston by far.\n",
      "I had a negative experience at Turner a couple of months ago.  I was served some oysters that weren't fresh, and I let loose in a Yelp review (I like oysters).  Michael, a manager there, contacted me immediately with his apologies.  He deserves a lot of credit because (1) he responded; (2) he didn't make excuses and actually apologized; and (3) he did it via a private message on Yelp, instead of a public response, which showed me he cared about my personal experience, not just my bad, public review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael invited a guest and me back to dine at the restaurant (all I'll say is that we weren't looking at the prices when we ordered), and I took him up on his offer over the weekend.  He was there and welcomed us when we arrived and checked on us during our meal.  I was impressed with his courtesy and attentiveness, as well as that of our server's.  The oysters were fresh, and the rest of the meal was very good.  Unlike many businesses in the area, Turner obviously cares about customer service and continued business, and I appreciate that.

Who will fiil this void that Bob's Southern Bistro (formerly Bob the Chef's) has left in my heart...and my belly?

      "Uh, I'll stick with chicken. And I sort of ended up picking the last thing on the menu book that the waitress handed me, chicken lo mein.

      "However please be very careful, do not fall for their tricks. They post ads on their window which says $1 per skewer, but the size for one skewer is way too small for being sold for $1, and to be honest the taste of skewers is not good. \n",
      "Moreover, they have another trick which is pre-tip. With almost 0 service, they pre-tip 18% and when you sign the check they don't mention it. They still give you a space to sign tip amount and they even carefully give you suggested tip amount at the bottom from 18% to 25%. What a thoughtful restaurant! \n",

      "It was a lot of fun.  Like other people said if crass sexual humor isn't your thing you probably won't have fun.  If you are looking for an authentic medieval experience your not going to get it.  They serve pizza, mussels, cold tomato soup, salad ribs and chicken.  I doubt they had tomato basil soup in medieval times.  Who the F cares.  It was fun.\n",

      "Just have fun.  Drink alot of crap beer.  Totally worth the $40.\n",

      "Look - you go because it's a fun and different thing to do with a group of friends on a Friday night. You know you're paying for the entertainment and certainly not for the food. Although if you do go hungry, the food hits the spot... just think of late-night eats at your standard college dining hall an hour before close. It's not impressive but it gets the job done. The beer and wine were ample, generously re-supplied throughout the night. However, no matter how buzzed my friends and I got (let alone everyone else in the theatre restaurant), the line that the actors overtly and inappropriately crossed at the expense of my friend mid-way through the show was absolutely no laughing matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, I went with a pretty diverse groups of friends this past Friday night for the 7:45pm show. The head of the table, let's call her Katie, is Asian. In one of the poorly written musical numbers, the \"town fool\" and the \"court jest\" do their little song and dance, and then break every so often to ad-lib for a couple minutes at the expense of their guests. The \"town fool\" impersonates the head of the table and the \"court jest\" is someone conversing with them. Without skipping a beat, the \"town fool\" took one look at my friend Katie and continued to portray all grossly absurd Asian-stereotypes you could possibly imagine. \n",

      "No. One. Was. Laughing. Not a person. That didn't stop them. \n",
      "\n",
      "They continued to ad-lib for a good FIVE MINUTES despite the defeaning radio silence throughout the restaurant. My friend Katie was absolutely mortified, and not a single person was smiling (oh, wait... the rest of the cast was laughing on, so it wasn't just the two racist idiots on stage thinking they weren't hurting anyone's feelings that night). So, I guess, when you fail to be funny and come up with your own creative material, you resort to racially putting down your audience members? The very audience members that are all paying a ridiculous amount of money to see you \"perform\" and eat your crap food? I guess the joke's on you, because I'm not telling anyone to invest their time or money going to this dreadful place.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my dear friends, if you go to this show... please think long and hard about it. This is also no place for children (especially on a Friday and Saturday night). One mother brought her 10 year old during this particular risque and offensive show. The cast members even celebrated this child being there, dubbing her the court's \"Princess\" - but that didn't stop them from being racist, bawdy, and crude ass clowns. Some role models... some \"artists\" I should say.\n",

They do \"Italian tapas,\" so you might be thinking, why don't they just call it cicheti?  The answer is because cicheti is inexpensive.  These are like $10 a pop, which of course means it could get pricey pretty fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it totally didn't get pricey for us, because they forgot our lamb chops.  The manager came over all apologetic and stuff and he was like OMG this is inexcusable, of course you won't be charged for these, and here's some champagne on the house! and we were like a) we forgot we ordered those; b) we didn't actually order anything; our awesome waiter Marc rattled off this long list of the things he likes on the menu and we were like \"Okay sounds good, bring us...whatever you just said\"; c) we probably don't need any more booze; d) not to say we won't be happy to drink it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of how plowed we were when we left, I know I'm like the 100th person to point this out but ALL THE WINE IS $26.  That means if you have a group that's going to do at least as much drinking as eating, and the group enjoys wine, your dinner is actually gonna turn out relatively affordable.  \n",

      "I haven't really talked about the restaurant at all, have I?  Dude the food is awesome, for real.  We had - well, we had almost everything, and not a single dish let us down.  Those lamb chops particularly were worth the wait.  \n",

      "My roommate and I have a four years long tradition of dining out on Christmas Eve; since neither of our families are big into doing anything, we spend it going somewhere nice and indulging our fabulous selves. After narrowing down our dining wish list to establishments that were actually open, we selected Ivy, which we'd visited for the toga Yelp elite event and had been meaning to try ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a reservation for two at 8 pm using open table. Parking near Temple Place was impossible (duh), and we parked at the Common garage. Since the clocks were striking 8, I called the restaurant to let them know we'd be a little late. I was placed on hold before I could give the host my name, and lost service. I called right back and said I'd be five minutes late to my reservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrive after a brisk walk in the ass cold to find a man standing maybe 3 inches from the glass of the front window staring intently into space. I make awkward eye contact and then open the door. This creep is the host/manager, who I tell I have an 8 pm reservation. He asks my name, which is hilarious because there is no one else in the restaurant! Literally. He says the kitchen closed at 8, but if we get our orders in right away, we can be served.\n",

      "Instead, I say we should sit away from the doors and move toward the back of the restaurant. \n",
      "Our waitress is okay, and arrives instantly with bread and a pitcher of water. Considering how quickly they want us to order she gives us a decent amount of time to go over the menu and choose a bottle of wine and food.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fairness, I thought having all bottles be $26 was great, and the prices for the small plate food were also reasonable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anywho, we settle on a charcuterie, duck confit pasta dish, and the pork tenderloin. We're advised that the pork will be served medium rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried my best to ignore the passive aggressive tactics in play as our dining experience went from possibly bad to worse; the main plates were served too soon after the appetizer, our waitress constantly topped off our wine glasses, and the house lights were raised significantly upon delivery of the main course. The food was all fine, except for the pork, so we just kind of eat and drink in awkwardness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's what really sucked and set us over the edge. Have you ever been asked by waitstaff how your food is cooked? Me too. I usually say everything is good. Even if something is slightly off (i.e. my beef is medium and not super medium rare and bloody), I don't say anything. Our pork was super well-done, though, and tough to chew. So, when our waitress inquired how the food was, my roommate said matter-of-factly that the meat was overdone, but everything else was decent. Our award-winning waitress proceeded to top off his wine glass and walk away. Now, we're sure she's not mute, since she was able to ask how we were doing and then carry on a joking conversation with other employees sitting by the bar. \n",
      "\n",
      "We promptly threw our napkins on the table and waited with angry crossed arms for another employee to check on us. Now I understand the phrase \"lose your appetite.\" I was literally disgusted and lost all interest in the food in front of me. It was a fight or flight moment of panic and I wished I could just walk out but somehow didn't have the balls.\n",
      "Soon after, this host creepster came by, we asked to see a manager, and low and behold, it was him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Gross. We basically had an embarrassing confrontation where his two -year old maturity level showed through and we were scolded for being late, told to chill because it was christmas, and told \"Just tell me what you guys want and I'll do it.\" I wanted to punch him in the face and get a free meal, but since I felt sort of guilty and awkward about the whole thing, instead we asked for the meat to be taken off the check and for him to ask his waitress not to ignore her customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon exiting, we were asked for the second or third time if we wanted to take our food and wine, to which I responded that i wanted to have no recollection of this night ever happening. His response was a spiteful \"Merry Christmas\".\n",
      "\n",

      "So far five stars,  got a ticket for the David Ortiz bobblehead night last year in 2014 and got grandstand 33, near Left field, right up near the green monster. Wicked Pissah  view (that means wicked awesome for those of you out of townies.) - anyway just ordered tix for the Zac Brown band today at Fenway for August 8th. got Pavillion box level seats.. in pavillion box 11... for about $138.00 after the taxes. Not bad all things considered, plus I can choose to pick them up at either Fenway location or TD garden. I chose TD garden as its closer to my house in Winchester convenient to the MBTA .... and since I like to walk around the North End and such =)  I will rate them again after the concert to make sure the tix are legit. So far no issues with ACE Ticket. I will update my review after the concert in August. =) They really do mean it when they say \"Sit your Ace Down\" in the commercials =) Also NEVER USE  STUBHUB. STUBHUB ARE FRAUDS. HALDF THE TIX NEVER WORK. I work at TD garden and we have nothing but PROBLEMS with STUBHUB. Use ACE TICKET INSTEAD, much more convenient and more importantly the tickets work 99% of the time.\n",
      "Legal Ticket Scalpers! Purchased tickets to a Bruins game for 129.00 a piece. Game was supposed to be played on 2/9 but got canceled due to a massive blizzard. I called them around noon as I had not heard anything and was told that they could sell my tickets as a consignment at the value I purchased them at and would receive 75% back if sold and would receive confirmation that they sold. I found out at 4pm that day that the game was canceled. I called Ace Ticket to confirm that the tickets had not been sold as i had not, and still haven't received the email. The rep that I spoke with on the phone continued to fumble around on the phone and initially could not find my order, then when he eventually did he told me they sold the tickets for $30 a piece less than what I paid for and I would receive 75% of the amount they sold them for. Very poor customer service and when I asked if there was any recourse I was told \"sorry they are not your tickets and there is nothing you can do about it\". Very disappointing! Ashamed that I even have to give them one star.\n",

      "Service is great! Location is small. Maybe 6-8 tables. Not an issue for me as I prefer takeout. I went in the middle of the day on a Friday. I ordered fried chicken dinner with Mac and cheese, yams and cabbage. The cabbage was very flavorful. The Mac and cheese is not the baked Mac and cheese i expect from a soulfood spot. It's more macaroni with a cheese sauce poured on it. Cheese sauce is a tad runny. Flavor is ok. The yams were really good. Very sweet, but that's how I like mine. Chicken was fried good. If you don't like dark meat, let them know when ordering it. Dark meat is the standard for the fried chicken meal. The kitchen was clean. The music was uplifting. I wish there was parking, but it's a major city. Overall, decent food and experience.\n",

      "This little cafe is a breath of fresh air for broke downtown office zombies tired of eating at Au Bon Chain and Funicular Bagel...I should know - I'm one of them. And as a zombie, when I'm released from my cubicle for 60 minutes of freedom mid-day, I race over to Nashoba Brook - located right by Back Bay Station, its handful of tables on the edge of the South End are the perfect place to relax with a delicious made-to-order sandwich. They come fast and fresh, and even with several solid vegetarian choices...and cookies. Did I mention the cookies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nashoba Brook Bakery itself is located in West Concord, and they specialize in slow-rise bread - unsurprisingly, this means the breads take about a day to rise and be baked. Some of that bread makes its way to the eponymous Boston cafe, destined to become sandwiches filled with kicky, but not offensively experimental, ingredients. My favorite is sweet pea guacamole, mozzarella, tomato, and mesculin greens. The best part, in my small-bellied opinion, is that you have the option of buying a half sandwich - a relief in this world of expanding waistlines and supersizes. Complete sandwiches run $6.25-7.50, while halves are $4 or less! Couple all this with fresh soups and salads, delicious cookies, and a selection of soda, coffee, tea, and good juices, and I have to ask why anybody would eat elsewhere for a workday lunch near Back Bay. Oh, and the staff are nice, too. I recommend this place above any other for a lunch under $10 within a mile of Back Bay Station.\n",

My childhood was filled with dehydrated roll-ups, sprouted legumes and mysterious, odd-colored \"smoothies.\" My epicurean sensibilities have been skeptical ever since. Until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Grezzo: bright and tiny, ambitious and interesting. And completely transformed my entire experience and perception of raw foods as bland and one-dimensional into that of vitality, complexity and utter deliciousness.\n",

      "The key to enjoyment is not to dine comparing the meal to traditional tastes, but to appreciate the real flavors of the organic ingredients in their own right. Because the menu changes every week depending on available ingredients, I'd suggest opting for the tasting menu. To Vanessa's point about making the cuisine less nut heavy, sprouted beans can often do the trick without the dense lipid content.\n",

      "It hurts me to say this. It really REALLY does. I have been dying to try this place since the second I heard it was coming soon. I've had it bookmarked for months. I love tons of vegan food, love the idea of raw food, and had a very open mind about this... but I just didn't love Grezzo. Or even really like it. So sad!\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, we had a reservation for 4 well in advance for 8:00pm on a Wednesday, and we weren't seated until past 9:00! I think this is unacceptable, especially since I was the birthday girl and would have appreciated them being a bit nicer about it. They never apologized, explained, or tried to compensate us at all. And sadly for them and this review, one of the best things I consumed that night was the bottle of wine we threw back at a bar down the street while we waited for our table.\n",
      "\n",
      "So finally we sat down in one of the most cramped, uncomfortable seating arrangements I've attempted to squeeze into in a while, and were then handed absolutely ridiculous, laughably cumbersome, and frankly cheap and stupid looking plastic block menus. Sorry, but you guys need to change your menus. They are not innovative-- they are idiotic, and they look like you bought them from the framing section of Michael's for $2.99 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to the food!\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to share a soup, a salad, 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 1 dessert between the 4 of us. This was the best decision of the night, as this is the kind of food you think is interesting for about two bites and then you are completely over it. I can't imagine eating a whole plate of just one of these things by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the sweet potato, pink grapefruit, and thai basil soup. It was okay, almost more like juice in a bowl because it was cold (of course) and citrusy. Then we shared a capreze salad (heirloom tomatoes, basil, and nut cheese) which was the highlight of the night. Not only is nut cheese a freakin BLAST to say (we were laughing like 10 year olds throughout dinner) but it was really wonderful and surprisingly cheesy stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "As appetizers, we tried the gnocchi carbonara (made with pea shoots, eggplant, and rawmesean) and the spinach ravioli. Both were pretty good, but neither was amazing. In particular the gnocchi was good for what it was, but absolutely should not have been called gnocchi. It didn't even attempt to imitate real gnocchi, which should be soft, chewy, and hearty, but rather was served as hard and crunchy clusters-- and therefore I felt it was very misleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "As entrees, we tried all 3 highly disappointing menu options. The vegetable lasagna was more like a layered salad of tomatoes, zucchini, and more of that yummy nut cheese. It was probably the best of the entrees, but was still boring and didn't strike me as particularly innovative. The \"land and sea\" was a variety of mushrooms served with raw ricotta, kelp, and truffle. I'll admit my fellow diners liked this one a lot, but I didn't like it at all. The truffle came off as a cover for the bland flavors, and the kelp didn't work at all, in my opinion. Then lastly we had the green papaya pappardelle, with the green papaya shaved into \"pasta\" and some garbanzos, currants, and spices mixed in. The papaya had a nice texture, and the dish wasn't bad. But again, I never could have eaten more than a portion of it myself without getting bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finished the dinner off with a slice of cheesecake, which was very good and tasted kind of like banana bread. It was topped with fresh fruit, and was a nice light way to end the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I was left wishing that they had abandoned the \"Italian\" theme and branched out a bit. They simply should not call crunchy clusters \"gnocchi\" or a pile of zucchini \"lasagna.\" It is trying too hard to put recognizable dishes onto the menu, only to disappoint the person ordering it. I felt that they should have been more true to their genre and more innovative in their recipes. It's a great concept, but they just didn't nail it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly most annoying was the fact that the waitresses, granted a very happy, smiley bunch, didn't bother to ask us how our meals were, but rather literally just said \"I'm so glad you LOVED everything, I'll be sure to tell the chef.\" Get your heads out of the clouds, ladies, and ask us how we really feel!\n",

      "The sandwiches and wraps here are solid! The only issue is that with the job market plummeting and enrollment rising there aren't enough staff here to fill the orders fast enough! I have to say though overall I can't complain! Except one time the nice lady making my sandwich forgot to take the wax paper off the slice of cheese. So when I sat down with the high school students I was working with and took a bite we all had a good laugh! The staff in the entire dining hall here bust the behinds to serve a student body of 15,000 and I have to say they do a pretty darn good job at getting it done!\n",
      "Located in the University of Massachusetts Boston campus center, It's A Wrap offers a decent variety of custom wraps. Think of subway, but for wraps. They have different wrap flavors available: plain, tomato and spinash and they also have pre-made sandwiches that they offer as well. The line is always huge during the lunch hour and it can take up to 30 minutes of waiting before you get a chance to get your own which really sucks. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff really sucks and doesn't understand what a tiny bit of mustard really is. I swear to god everytime I go there and ask for just a tiny little bit of mustard they squeeze the hell out of that thing they use to dispense it until it oozes from all sides. That really ticks me off and for some reason I don't have the courage to yell at them and ask them to start over in fear of being told to fuck off and being sent to the back of the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Past that point I'd recommend you get your wrap toasted, it tastes much better. But yeah the food isn't that great and is expensive for what it is. It's about the only healthy thing you can get at UMB though along with the salad bar and sadly enough they are there to stay due to the fact that everyone goes there for food. Hopefully they will introduce better foods on their wretched campus at some point.\n",

Definitely worth to try!\n",
      "I was starving this morning so that I ordered a meal in Seoul Chicken, expecting for something delicious. However, after waiting for over an hour, the app showed me that my order was here and had been picked up. The thing is I never received any phone call from the delivery man and my food was not there. When I called the custom service of Seoul Chicken, they claimed that I was responsible for this and I could not get a refund for the food that I paid but never received. They could only give me a 50% percent discount for the next order as a compensation for this. Yet, I am 100% sure that I am never going to order from Seoul Chicken again.

I called and let them know I'd be bringing a large party and wanted to book the time and event with them.  Stix is close to our office and I knew it would be pretty quiet in there on a Thursday at 5pm so it should be a good call.\n",

It's been a month since I went there.  We all gobble it up.  Nothing spectacular, just standard apps.  Next round of apps come out.  Same three apps.  Next round.  Same three apps.  I ask the manager to switch it up and he says no, it's chef's choice.  We get into a big conversation about the fact that I brought 20 people there and we were spending a TON of money on drinks.  Please change it up.  He wasn't really having it.\n",
