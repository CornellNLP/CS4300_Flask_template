EGGS:When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS:Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yoghurt.  Yoghurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese.  Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can't get any more spoiled than it is already.  Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realise you've never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE:If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS:Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled (or wreckedanyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES:This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you'll spend more on groceries.  Perhaps you'd benefit by having a calendar in your kitchen. MEAT:           If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD:Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable \"spots\" that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread.  Fuzzy and hairy-looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR:Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT:It never spoils. CANNED GOODS:Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a tennis ball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS:A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS AND SULTANAS:Raisins and sultanas should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES:Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP:If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS:Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with your mother or have a maid.

        "joke": "One day in the great state of Alabama a man walks outside and hears this strange noise coming from one of his trees. He proceeds to walk over to his tree and looks up in the tree to find the source of this noise. What he finds is a large gorilla moving around in the top of his tree trying to get comfortable. The man stops and thinks to himself, \"How on earth am i going to get this gorilla out of my tree? There aren't any gorilla catchers in Alabama are there?\"The man walks inside his house and gets his phone book and is looking in the animal control section and low and behold there actually is a gorilla catcher listed, so the man picks up the phone and calls the number. He reaches the gorilla catcher who says that he'll be there in ten minutes. The gorilla catcher shows up in a big truck with a tool box in the back and a very large dog sitting on top of the tool box and a very large cage sitting in back of the tool box.  The gorilla catcher gets out of his truck and walks up to the man and shakes hands with him. The man then shows the gorilla catcher the tree and points up at the gorilla. After looking at the gorilla for a minute, the gorilla catcher walks back over to his truck and gets old Clyde off the tool box and gets out a gun and walks back over to the tree and sits the gun down next to old Clyde. The gorilla catcher looks over at the man and says, \"Here's the plan. I'm gonna climb this here tree and knock the gorilla out. When the gorilla hits the ground old Clyde here's gonna bite him in the nuts and hold on 'til I can get out of the tree and put the gorilla in the cage. Any questions?\"The man can't think of any so the gorilla catcher starts making his way up the tree. When the catcher gets almost halfway up the tree the man notices the shotgun next to old Clyde. He quickly calls up to the gorilla catcher and says, \"Hey, what's the gun for?\"The gorilla catcher replies, \"OH, that's in case the gorilla knocks me out of the tree, I want u to shoot old Clyde before i hit the ground.\"",

Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home. \n\nDINING OUT\n1.

If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label. \n\nENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME\n1.

Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. \n However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money.\n3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they\n  tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of her\n finger foods.\n\nDATING (Outside the Family)\n1.

The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week, the first time for three days and the second time for four days.  About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be to heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.  John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.  Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if your an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.  Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.

Almost breathless with anticipation, Bobby escorts his date out the front door.About 20 minutes later, Carrie rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her, and screams at her father, \"DAMMIT DADDY!

For three days, the African ambassador was wined, dined, and generally treated to the best hospitality that Russia had to offer.\n\nOn the last day of his visit, the Russian ambassador said, \"As your stay is coming to an end, it's time for you to play our traditional game, Russian roulette. One of the six chambers of this gun is loaded - you spin the cylinder, point the gun at your head, and pull the trigger.\"\n\nThis phased the African slightly, but he was a proud man of a warrior people, and to show fear would be unthinkable. Both men took their guns, spun, and pulled the triggers.\n\nBoth chambers were empty, and both ambassadors breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe African ambassador was impressed with the couragous game, and thought hard about the subject before the Russian Ambassador was due to visit his country the next year.\n\nWhen the visit came, the African ambassador treated the Russian with all hospitality, until the final day of his stay. Leading him to a private room in the palace, the African ambassador spoke, \"Now, time for you to sample our game, African roulette\". He then led the Russian into the room, the only occupants of which were six stunning and naked women.\n\nThe African ambassador said, \"These women are the most beautiful members of one of our tribes. Any one of them will give you a oral sex - take your pick\".\n\nThe Russian was not entirely averse to this idea, but he couldn't see the connection with Russian Roulette. He said, \"Well, ok, great, but where's the roulette part? Where's the danger?\"\n\nWith a big grin on his face, the African ambassador answered:\n\n\"One of them's a cannibal.\"",

I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right.

Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots.Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in.\"Mrs. Jones leaned forward. \"You mean they actually chewed on your ...equipment?\"\"That's right.

        "joke": "A team of sociologists have planned an experiment in isolation. They send an American, a Frenchman and a Japanese man to a deserted island, and arrange to come back and pick them up in a years time to see how they have adapted.  The sociologists leave, and the three men decide  to split up  the tasks amongst themselves. \n\n\"I'm an engineer\" says American,  \"So I'll handle building a shelter\". He turns to the Frenchman and says: \"You French are pretty good cooks, why don't you handle the cooking?\" The Frenchman agrees, and the American turns to the Japanese man \"That leaves you to organize the supplies\" he says. The Japanese man agrees and each man sets about his tasks.  \n\n \nA year passes, and the sociologists return to see how the men have done.  They expect to find three desperate men, unhappy with having to live on the  island, but instead find a huge wooden house with verandas and porches  and  balconies. The American comes to greet them, and when they  express their surprise about the house he just shrugs and says  \"Yeah well I  had a lot of  raw materials so I kind of went to town and did the place up\"  The teams are  amazed and are shown inside to the kitchen where they're  greeted with the  most amazing smell of delicious food.   \n\nThe Frenchman sees their  surprise and  just shrugs \"I had lots to work with\" he says, \"This island has  loads of  edible herbs  and plants.\"  \n\nThe team sits down to eat and are about to start when one of  them inquires  about the Japanese man. \"Oh we don't know what happened to him\"  explains the  American, he ran off into the woods to sort out the supplies  and hasn't been  seen since.\" They all agree that they should find the man, and  a search  party is organised.  They make it about 100 yards into the woods, when the Japanese  man  jumps  out from behind a tree, stark naked with peacock feathers  sticking out of  his ears and shouts:  \"SUPPLIES!!\"",

So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steady. Twenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless. \"I NEED FOOD!\" he says with a hint of dementia in his voice. \"NO!\" Joe retorts. \"We promised.\" Five more days pass. Joe realizes that Poncho probably skipped out to the Burger King down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat. But then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out behind a rock. \"Just for that, I'm not going.\"",

The zookeeper offered the mime a job to dress up as Sparky until they could get a new gorilla. The mime accepted.The next morning, the mime put on a gorilla suit and entered the cage before the crowd arrived. He discovered that it was a great job! He could sleep all he wanted, play and make fun of people and he was drawing bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However, eventually the crowds tired of him, and he was getting bored just swinging on tires. He began to notice that the people were paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbed to the top of his cage, crawled across a partition, and dangled from the top over the lion's cage.

The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old flight attendant who waited on me hand and foot!\" \n\n\"Hmmm,\" Joe says, \"Well, I bet the hotel was just like I described.\" \n\n\"No, quite the opposite! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling. It's the finest hotel in Rome, now. They were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the Presidential suite for no extra charge!\" \n\n\"Well,\" Joe mumbles, \"I KNOW you didn't get to see the Pope!\" \n\n\"Actually, we were quite lucky. As we toured the Vatican, a Swiss guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained the Pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into this private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, after 5 minutes the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand. I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.\" \n\nImpressed, Joe asks, \"Tell me, please! What'd he say?\" \n\n\"Oh, not much really. Just \"Where'd you get that awful haircut?\"",

He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them. Rabbi Moishe's Latin wasn't very good - in fact, he knew very little--but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community. The pope agreed. What could be easier than a silent debate? \n\nThe day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.\" \n\nAn hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. The Pope said: \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\" \"And then?\" asked a woman. \"I don't know,\" said Moishe. \"He took out his lunch and I took out mine.\"",

        "joke": "On the farm lived a chicken and a horse, both of whom loved to play\ntogether. One day, the two were playing, when the horse fell into a bog and began to sink.  Scared for his life, the horse whinnied for the chicken to go get the farmer for help! Off the chicken ran, back to the farm. \n  \nArriving at the farm, he searched and searched for the farmer, but to no\navail, for he had gone to town with the only tractor.  Running around, the\nchicken spied the farmer's new Harley. Finding the keys in the ignition, the\nchicken sped off with a length of rope hoping he still had time to save his\nfriend's life. \n  \nBack at the bog, the horse was surprised, but happy, to see the chicken arrive on the shiny Harley, and he managed to get a hold of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to him. After tying the other end to the rear bumper of the farmer's bike, the chicken then drove slowly forward and, with the aid of the powerful bike, rescued the horse! Happy and proud, the chicken rode the Harley back to the farmhouse, and the farmer was none the wiser when he returned. \n  \nThe friendship between the two animals was cemented:  Best Buddies, Best\nPals. \n  A few weeks later, the chicken fell into a mud pit, and soon, he too,\nbegan to sink and cried out to the horse to save his life.  The horse\nthought a moment, walked over, and straddled the large puddle. Looking\nunderneath, he told the chicken to grab his hangy-down thing and he could\nthen lift him out of the pit. The chicken got a good grip, and the horse\npulled him up and out, saving his life. \n \n  The moral of the story?  (Yes, there's a moral!)   \n    \n\n\"When You're Hung Like A Horse, You Don't Need A Harley To Pick Up Chicks!\"",

Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, \"I hate playing with your Dad.\"",

She walked up to the bartender, and asked, \"May I please use the restroom?\n\nThe bartender replied, \"I really don't think you should..\" \"Why not?\" the nun asked.\n\n\"Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private parts are covered only by a fig leaf.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the nun, \"I'll just look the other way.\"\n\nSo, the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she preceded to the restroom. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again. However, they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause.\n\nShe went to the bartender and said, \"Sir, I don't understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?\"\n\n\"Well, now they know you're one of us,\" said the bartender, \"Would you like a drink?\"\n\n\"But, I still don't understand,\" said the puzzled nun.\n\n\"You see,\" laughed the bartender, \"every time the fig leaf on the statue is lifted up, the lights go out in the whole place. Now, how about that drink?\"",

He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain. As it was still early, she decided to go to the party.

His wife sidled up to him. As a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had sex.

As they had not been dating very long,\nafter some careful consideration, he decided that a pair of elegant winter gloves would strike just the right note - romantic, but not too personal.\n\nAccompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to a\nfine department store and chose a pair of lovely white fur-lined gloves. The sister did her own shopping, buying a pair of panties for herself. \n\nWhile the clerk was wrapping the items, she got the boxes mixed up, and gave the gloves to the sister and gift-wrapped the panties for the young man.\n\nThe young man sealed the package without noticing and sent it to his sweetheart, who opened it on Christmas to find his enclosed note:\n\n\nI chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the  buttons, but she demonstrated the short ones she wears that are easier to remove.\nThese are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from\nShowed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled.

When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away, as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.\n\nJust think how many times I will kiss them during the coming\nyear. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night. \nAll my love. \n\n(P.S... The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.",

The attorney kicked off his shoes, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the physician in the window seat said,\" I think I'll get up and get a coke.\" \"No problem,\" said the attorney, \"I'll get it for you.\" While he was gone, one of the physicians picked up the attorney's shoe and spat in it. When he returned with the coke, the other physician said, \"That looks good, I think I'll have one too.\" Again, the attorney obligingly went to fetch it and while he was gone, the other physician picked up the other shoe and spat in it. The attorney returned and they all sat back and enjoyed the flight. As the plane was landing, the attorney slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened. \"How long must this go on?\" he asked. \"This fighting between our professions? This hatred? This animosity? This spitting in shoes and pissing in cokes",

They were so confident going into the final that two days before, they decided to go up to the University of Tennessee and party with some friends. They had a great time. However, they overslept and didn't make it back to Alabama until the morning of the exam. \n\nRather than take the final, they found their professor afterward to explain why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to the University of Tennessee for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back, and didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time, so they were late in getting back to campus. The professor thought this over and told them they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day for the final. The professor placed them in separate rooms, and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. \n\nThey looked at the first problem, which was worth 5 points. It was something simple. \"Cool,\" they thought. \"This is going to be easy.\" They did that problem and then turned the page. Question #2 said: \"Which tire?\" (95 Points).",

Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed claim against the insurance company.In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost \"in a series of small fires.\"The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued....and won!In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire,without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire,\" and was obligated to pay the claim.Rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000.00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the \"fires.\"NOW FOR THE BEST PART... After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim andtestimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.This is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent Criminal Lawyers Award Contest.ONLY IN AMERICA",

Finally one day Justin said to Christian, \"I'm bored and frustrated at being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten...\"As Justin had his mind firmly on becoming a predator, a mysterious cod appears and says, \"Your wish is granted\", and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.  Time went on (as it invariably does...) and Justin found himself becoming bored and lonely as a shark.  All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them.  Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.While out swimming alone one day he sees the mysterious cod again and can't believe his luck.Justin figured that the fish could change him back into a prawn.  He begs the cod to change him back so, lo and behold; he is turned back into a prawn.  With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. (The punch line does not involve a prawn cocktail - it's much worse).Looking around the gathering at the reef, he searched for his old pal. \"Where's Christian?\" he asked. \"He's at   home, distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark\", came the reply.Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's house.  As he opened the coral gate the memories came flooding back.  He banged on the door and shouted, \"It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.\"Christian replied \"No way man, you'll eat me. You're a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked. \"Justin cried back \"No, I'm not.  That was the old me.  I'vechanged.\"...............................\"I've found Cod.

        "joke": "1 star hangover * - No pain.  No real feeling of illness. You slept in your own bed and when you woke up there were no traffic cones in there with you.  You are still able to function relatively well on the energy stored up from all those vodka red bulls. However, you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as the Sahara. Even vegetarians are craving a Cheeseburger and a side of fries.2 star hangover * * - No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler.   The coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is craving a full English breakfast. Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing, followed byaimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails.3 star hangover * * * - Slight headache. Stomach feels crap. You are definitely a space cadet and not so productive. Anytime a girl or lad walks by you gag because her perfume / aftershave reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends, after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching daytime TV. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 Sausage Rolls and a litre of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.4 star hangover * * * * - You have lost the will to live. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might spew. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but you smell of socks, and you can't hide the fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgemsdepending on your gender. Your teeth have their own individual sweaters. Your eyeslook like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the second-grade class picture circa 1976. You would give a week's pay for one of the following:Home time, doughnut and somewhere to be alone, or a Time machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before. You scare small children in the street just by walking past them.5 star hangover * * * * * - You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you. Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body.    Death seems pretty good right now. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic.   You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is breathe ... very gently.6 star hangover * * * * * * - You arrive home and climb into bed. Sleep comes instantly; as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi.  You get about 2 hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you up.  You notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying relentlessly around the room. No matter what you do you now, you're going to chuck. You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in ayacht under full sail. After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking off all the pictures, you find the toilet. If you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls. You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the walrus noises, spitting, and farting.  Help usually comes at this stage, even if it is short lived. Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into abuse and he/she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark. With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent. You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils projectile out your mouth on the last occasion. It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed.   She / He abuses you again for trying to get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair. You reluctantly accept their advice and have a shower in exchange for them driving you to the hospital. Work is not an option.",

        "joke": "Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, \" He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on.\" So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, \"Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone. The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a Happy Birthday!!!",

        "joke": "Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true?\n\nA: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it... don't waste them on exercise. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.\n\nQ: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?\n\nA: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat?  Hay and corn. And what are these?vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable).  And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily\nallowance of vegetable slop. \n\nQ: Is beer or wine bad for me?\n\nA: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables.  As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal,\nmineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table\nof elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger\nand a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.\n\nQ: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?\n\nA: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your\nratio is two to one, etc.\n\nQ: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?\n\nA: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain - Good.\n\nQ: If I stop smoking, will I live longer?\n\nA: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual statement and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress\nyourself to death in record time.\n\nQ: Aren't fried foods bad for you?\n\nA: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How\ncould getting more vegetables be bad for you?\n\nQ: What's the secret to healthy eating?\n\nA: Thicker gravy.\n\nQ: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?\n\nA: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger.  You should only be doing sit-ups if you want\na bigger stomach.\n\nQ: Is chocolate bad for me?\n\nA: Are you crazy? Cocoa beans... Another vegetable. It's the best feel good food around!\n\nI hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets.\n\nHave a cookie... flour is a veggie!",

The mechanic says he has a few others to look at first but if he comes back in an hour he can tell the penguin what is wrong with his car. The penguin agrees and goes for a walk. He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he's a penguin and it's Arizona in the summer, after all.

        "joke": "We've all been there but don't like to admit it. We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2001 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.ESCAPEE.Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.COURTESY FLUSH.Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.WALK OF SHAME.Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.SAFE HAVENS.Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.TURD BURGLAR:Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.CAMO-COUGH.Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.ASTAIRE.Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.WATERMELON.Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.HAVANA OMELET.Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.UNCLE TED.Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.FLY BY.Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.",

        "joke": "As he was quietly watching television at home, the chap heard a sound on the roof of his house and rushed out to investigate. Seeing it was a fair-sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home, he promptly called up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped. He was reassured that a gorilla recovering units was on the way and to remain calm. A few minutes later, an old beat up truck, displaying the Gorilla recovery unit logo on its panels, pulled up to the house. The elderly driver proceeds to recover from the back of the truck, a chihuahua dog, a pair of handcuffs, a ladder, a baseball bat, and a 12-gauge shotgun. Puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla that had by now torn half the roof apart, the chap asked him how he would go about doing this. As he handed him over the 12-gauge shotgun, the zoo employee explained the plan: \"First I'll climb up there with the ladder. Then I'll approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat. As soon as the gorilla hits the ground, the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts. When I get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs. Then, I lead him to the truck, lock him up and take him back to the zoo...\" Amazed at the procedure, the somewhat startled house owner asked why he was handed the 12-gauge shotgun? \"Well,\" explained the experienced gorilla retriever, \"It's just a precaution should things not go exactly as planned. In the unlikely event that once on the roof, the gorilla knocks me off with the baseball, shoot the dog.\".",

Here is one of those stories. As he tells it, he was waiting at a taxi- stand outside the railway station in Paris. When a taxi pulled up,he put his suitcase in it and got in himself. As he was about to tell the taxi-driver where he wanted to go, the driver asked him: \"Where can I take you, Mr. Doyle?\" Doyle was flabbergasted. He asked the driver whether he knew him by sight. The driver said: \"No Sir, I have never seen you before.'' The puzzled Doyle asked him what made him think that he was Conan Doyle. The driver replied: \"This morning's paper had a story about you being on vacation in Marseilles. This is the taxi-stand where people who return from Marseilles always come to. Your skin colour tells me you have been on vacation. The ink-spot on your right index finger suggests to me that you are a writer. Your clothing is very English, and not French. Adding up all those pieces of information, I deduce that you are Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\" Doyle said: \"This is truly amazing. You are a real-life counter-part to my fictional creation, Sherlock Holmes.\" \"There is one other thing,\" the driver said. \"What is that?\" \"Your name is on the front of your suitcase.\".",

Then I waved my finger around me to show him, that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground, showing that God was also right here with us.

She was instructed to place the gold in several bags with handles and place them in the attic directly over his bedroom.  His plan was that when he died, his soul would rise up out of his body and ascend to heaven.  As he passed through the attic, he would grab the bags of gold and take them with him. Days later he finally died and the next day his wife went to the attic to see if the gold was gone, but found it was all still there.  \"The damn fool,\" she said to herself.  \"I told him we should have placed the bags in the basement.\" Moral:  We're not going to be able to take it with us when we go.  Even if we're so clever as to place half our riches in the attic and half in the basement, they'll probably take us out the side door!",

        "joke": "A dying man gathered his Lawyer, Doctor and Clergyman at his bed side and handed each of them an envelope containing $25,000 in cash. He made them each promise that after his death and during his repose, they would place the three envelopes in his coffin. He told them that he wanted to have enough money to enjoy the next life.A week later the man died. At the Wake, the Lawyer and Doctor and Clergyman, each concealed an envelope in the coffin and bid their old client and friend farewell. By chance, these three met several months later. Soon the Clergyman, feeling guilty, blurted out a confession saying that there was only $10,000 in the envelope he placed in the coffin. He felt, rather than waste all the money, he would send it to a Mission in South America. He asked for their forgiveness. The Doctor, moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity, confessed that he too had kept some of the money for a worthy medical charity. The envelope, he admitted, had only $8000 in it. He said, he too could not bring himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to benefit others.By this time the Lawyer was seething with self-righteous outrage. He expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his oldest and most trusted friends. \"I am the only one who kept his promise to our dying friend. I want you both to know that the envelope I placed in the coffin contained the full amount. Indeed, my envelope contained my personal check for the entire $25,000.\"",

If he refused and didn't have a good excuse he would be \"mulcted of ye sum of one pound or less\" (essentially, he would owe her a dollar). France enacted a similar law a year later. At one time, there was a law in India that forbade lower-caste people from casting their shadows on a member of the Brahman (the upper class). After January 14th you will be charged a fine for having your Christmas decorations still up. (Maine)In the kingdom of Bhutan, all citizens officially become one year older on New Year\u2019s Day.

Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs so we'll call you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her he Working Class. Now your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.\"  So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him, he finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to is parent's room and finds his mother fast asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed.  The next morning, the little boy says to to his father \" I think I understand Politics now.\" The father replies, \"Good son, tell me in your own words what you think it is.\" The boy promptly answers, \"Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is asleep, the People are being ignored, and the Future is in deep trouble.\"",

When Hillary got the parrot back to the White House, she uncovered his cage and admired the bird.

Soon, Chelsea and a friend came in and began admiring the bird. \"New house, new whores,\" the parrot observed. Hillary explained the bird's history to Chelsea and her friend, so they too, laughed. Later, the President entered the living quarters. The parrot took one look at him and said, \"Hi, Bill!\"",

A little old barefoot man wearing overalls answered the knock on the door, only to be confronted by the very well dressed and dignified CEO in a $2,000 navy blue pin-striped business suit, a Hermes silk tie, a starched white shirt with monogrammed cufflinks, $700 shoes polished like black mirrors, and carrying a vacuum cleaner.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said the well-dressed and impeccably groomed CEO. \"If I could take a couple minutes of your time, I would like to demonstrate the very latest in high-powered vacuum cleaners.\"\n\n\"Get lost, Mister fancy suit!\" said the old man. \"I haven't got any money\" and he proceeded to close the door.\n\nQuick as a flash, the CEO wedged his polished shoe in the door and pushed it wide open.\n\n\"Don't be too hasty!\" he said. \"Not until you have at least seen my demonstration.\"\n\nThe old man again told him to get lost. And with that, the CEO emptied a bucket of mud all over his hallway carpet.\n\n\"If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this mess from your carpet, sir, I will personally eat the remainder. I am the CEO! You have my GUARANTEE!\"\n\n\"I got a better idea\" said the old man, \"If you don't clean it all up, I'll swap those fancy clothes of yours fer my overalls. Your nice suit, your tie, your shoes, everything!\"\n\n\"Fine, sir!\" said the CEO confidently. \"I'll give you my clothes!\"\n\n\"Lemme ask you somethin', pal...Where are you goin' when you leave here?\"\n\nThe CEO answered very confidently: \"To a VERY important conference! WHY?\"\n\n\"Will they let you in if yer barefoot?\" said the old man.\n\n\"Of course not!\" said the CEO.\n\n\"How much did you pay for those socks you'v got on?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"Fifty dollars\" said the bewildered CEO.\n\n\"I ain't never worn fifty dollar socks before!\" said the old man. \"It will be kinda hard for you to wear overalls to work, I guess!\" said the old man.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" said the confused CEO.\n\n\"And will you show how me to tie a necktie?\" said the old man...\n\nOne hour later, the door of the apartment opened, and the CEO carefully looked out. Seeing that no one was around, his foot appeared.\n\nA bare foot.\n\nHe stepped out into the hallway - dressed only in overalls and bare feet. His expensive executive suit and tie had vanished, along with his confidence and dignity.\n\nThe old man watched him run away to his car with a grin, admiring the expensive pinstriped suit and silk tie he had just acquired. He then sat down and pulled on the CEO's fifty dollar socks and gleaming shoes.\n\n\"Now I gotta see about payin' that electric bill...\"",

If it's okay, give me the okay sign.\" So Jasper goes to look it up, comes back, and gives Leroy the big okay sign.\n\nThree weeks later Leroy is laid up in the infirmary with a terrible case of gonorrhea. \"Jasper,\" he says, \"why did you give me the okay sign?\"\n\n\"Well, Leroy, in the dictionary, it says gonorrhea affects only the privates.\" He points to his stripes. \"But we's sergeants now!\"",

        "joke": "My uncle was in the fertilized egg business when I was young. He had several hundred young layers, called pullets, and 8 or 10 roosters whose job was to fertilize the eggs.My uncle kept records and any rooster or pullet that didn't perform well went into the pot and was replaced. Now this took an awful lot of time. So when my uncle saw a set of eight tiny bells that each rang a different tone he promptly bought them.He glued a piece of foam rubber to each clapper shaft so the bell wouldn't ring except when violently shaken. He hung a bell on each rooster's neck and went and mixed a Mint Julep. Now he could sit on the porch and sip while filling out an efficiency report on the roosters by listening to the different tones of the bells and marking down each encounter. My uncle's favorite rooster was old Brewster. Brewster was a fine specimen, but his bell didn't ring all morning. Uncle went to investigate.Several roosters were chasing pullets, bells a-ringing. Brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. Chagrined at first, Uncle was soon so proud of Brewster he entered him in the county fair.Brewster was an overnight sensation. They not only awarded him the No Bell prize but also the Pullet Surprise.",

He got as far as Black Canyon City before the mountains just became to much and he could go no farther.He stuck his thumb out but after 3 hours, hadn't gotten a single person to stop. Finally a guy in a Corvette pulled over and offered him a ride. Of course, the bike wouldn't fit in the car.

He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he got to going to fast, to honk the horn on his bike and that he would slow down.Everything went fine for the first 30 miles. Suddenly, another Corvette blew past them. Not to be outdone, the Corvette pulling the bike immediately took off after the other. A short distance down the road, the Corvettes, both going well over 90 mph, blew through a speed trap. The police officer noted the speeds from his radar gun and radiod to the other officer that he had 2 Corvettes headed his way at over 90 mph. He then relayed, \"And you're not going to believe this -- but there's this *really* amazing guy on a 10 speed bike honking to pass!!\".",

No problems for the first few stops, a few people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well.At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on. Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the driver and said, \"Big John doesn't pay!\" and sat down at the back.The next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth. This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said, \"Big John doesn't pay!,\" the driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, \"And why not?\"With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, \"Big John has a bus pass.\"",

I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed! I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, \"Jesus Christ!\" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, \"GO JESUS CHRIST, GO!\" Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, \"Mother trucker,\" or \"Mother's from there.\" Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.",

Again he prodded the frog and shouted, \"Jump frog!\" The frog jumped 10 feet, and on instruction Sophie wrote it down.Again the frog was brought back, and the left front leg was removed, and again said, \"Jump frog!\" It jumped 6 feet and Sophie wrote it down.Again Sidney tried, this time removing the large right back leg. \"Jump frog! Jump frog!\" he shouted and prodded the frog. The frog jumped 8 inches. \"Write it down, Sophie.\"Finally Sidney removed the frog's remaining back left leg, put it down and prodded the frog with the twig, shouting \"Jump frog! Jump Frog! JUMP FROG! JUMP, JUMP FROG!\"The frog didn't jump. Sophie looked at Sidney, and said, \"So what should I write down?\"Sidney thought a moment, and told Sophie to write, \"When you remove all the legs from a frog, it turns deaf.\"",

They agreed to give each other5 years to breed the two most powerful fighting dogs ever.The winning dog's country would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing side would have to submit and lay down its arms.The Russians searched their vast country to find the meanest, most vicious Doberman and Rottweiler breeds and crossed them with the biggest, most dangerous Siberian wolves.They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter and fed it a diet of steroids and trained them to be lethal attack dogs. After five years of fierce breeding, Russiahad managed to create the biggest, most vicious dog the world had ever seen.Finally Russia and America met in Switzerland to let their dogs fight for world domination. Although its cage had 4-inch-thick reinforced steel-bars, everyone was afraid to even go near the Russian monster-dog. When the Russians saw the American dog, they burst into laughter. America had sent a weird looking 9-foot-long Dachshund! The Russian breeders felt a little sorry for the Dachshund, because they knew it didn't have the slightest chance to last even 10 seconds against Russia's killer.When the bell announced the beginning of the fight, the Russian dog leaped out of its cage, snarled, and charged the American Dachshund.The Dachshund slowly waddled out of its cage towards the Russian dog. But just when the Russian champion looked like it was going to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened its mouth and swallowed the Russian dog with one bite. The Russian monster was gone!The Russian politicians, shaking their heads in disbelief, walked over to the cheering Americans and said: \"We don\u0091t understand how this could have happened.

Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a Rabbi to help them with the ogre.The Rabbi arrived and led a delegation of Trids up the mountain.The ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain.The Rabbi, having been told of the previous expeditions, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the ogre.The ogre laughed and replied:\"Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!\"",

Each day I try to enjoy something from each of the four food groups the bonbon group, the salty-snack group, the caffeine group and the Whatever group.8. Into every life some rain must fall.Usually when your car windows are down.9. When you find yourself getting irritated with someone, try to remember that all men are brothers and just give them a noogie or an Indian burn.

The tower radioed back that it was more than long enough. In a few minutes the pilot again radioed about the runway length, only to receive the same reply. On final approach, the pilot radioed again that he thought the runway was too short, only to receive an exasperated reply that the runway was long enough and to go ahead and land. Sure enough, the plane touched down and ran into the passenger terminal, resulting in major damage and great loss of life. After the plane came to a halt, the pilot turned to the co-pilot said, \"See, I told them the runway was too short\". To which the co-pilot replied, \"Yeah, but did you see how wide it is?\"",

After college they didn't have the skill for professional ball so they learned to be umpires in order to stay around the game. They started in the minors and being very good umpires soon moved on to the majors where they umpired for many years. After they retired, they continued to umpire for youth ball like little league.However, as they grew older and older, they started to worry about what it would be like after they died. Would there be baseball after death?Finaly they made a pact. The first one to die would, if at all possible, come back immediately and tell the other about baseball after death.Finaly Joe died and went to Heaven. After much argument he convinced St. Peter to let him return in a dream to his friend Fred and this conversation ensued:Joe: \"Fred, I made it to heaven and I have both good news and bad news\"Fred: \"Well, what is the good news\"Joe: \"We don't have to worry about baseball any more. There is all kinds up here. We can umpire from sand lot ball to the major leagues. In fact I have 3rd base tomorrow night\"Fred: \"THAT'S GREAT!! What could possibly be bad news after that?\"Joe: \"You have the plate!\"",

On the first day of every month, all staff will be issued 20 toilet trip credits which may be accumulated.The doors to all toilets will be equipped with computer-linked voice recognition devices. Staff must immediately provide management with two voiceprints, one normal and one under stress. Once the employee's toilet trip bank reaches zero, the doors of the toilet will not unlock for the employee's voice until the first of the month.In addition, all cubicles are to be equipped with timed paper-roll extractors. If the toilet is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty seconds later, the roll of toilet paper will retract into the dispenser, the toilet will flush and the door will open automatically. If the toilet remains occupied, your photograph will be taken by a security camera and will appear on the Toilet Offenders Board. Anyone appearing three times will forfeit three months' toilet trip credits. Anyone caught smiling when the photograph is taken will undergo counseling by a clinical psychologist.Be advised that workmen's compensation insurance does not cover any injuries incurred while trying to stop the toilet paper retracting into the dispenser.MANAGEMENT",

        "joke": "Letter from Camp...\nDear Mom & Dad:We are having a great time here at Lake Typhoid. Scoutmaster Webb is making us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search & rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.Scoutmster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if its hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver.In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our firstaid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.Love,ColeP.S. How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?",

        "joke": "The answer to the eternal question \"Is it better to be a jock or a nerd?Michael Jordan made over $300,000 a game. That equals $10,000 a minute, at an average of 30 minutes per game. With $40 million in endorsements, hemade $178,100 a day, working or not. If he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head. If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there. If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it. He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage. He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends. If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours. If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second. He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be reimbursed $33,390 for that round. Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into a tax deferred account (401k), he will hit the federal cap of $9500 at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st. If you were given a penny for every 10 dollars he made, you 'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year. He'll make about $19.60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics. He'll make about $15,600 during the Boston Marathon. While the common person is spending about $20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600. In his last year, he made more than twice as much as all U.S. past presidents for all of their terms combined. Amazing isn't it? Keep reading!BUT...If Jordan saves 100% of his income for the next 250 years, he'll still have less than Bill Gates has today. Game over. Nerd wins.",

He stepped on the gas but at 50 miles per hr. the chicken was still keeping up. After about a mile of running the chicken ran up a farm lane and into a barn behind an old farm house. The salesman had some time to kill so he turned around and drove up the farm lane. He knocked at the door and when the farmer answered he told him what he had just seen. The farmer said that he knew about the chicken, as a matter of fact the farmer said that his son was a geneticist and he had developed this breed of chicken because the three of them each like a drumstick when they have chicken and this way they only have to kill one chicken. The salesman said: \n'That's the most fantastic story I have ever heard. How do they taste?' The farmer said: \n'I don't know. We can't catch 'em.'",

He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. \nThe wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and a little kiss here, a little kiss there and sometimes a little bit more. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive woman herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the neighbouring rooms and did something which she would only allow her husband to do. She was quite upset afterwards because her husband could not know that she was his wife. She slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behaviour. She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, \"Oh, you know I never have a good time when you are not there.\" Then she asked, \"Did you dance much?\" He replied, \"I did not dance at all. When I got there I met Pete, Bill, John and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But the chap I lent my costume told me that he had a glorious evening.\"",

Since Hamburg is very known for having many whorehouses, the Scotsman decided he should pay one a visit.\nHe finally arrived at one of the local pleasure houses, the Scotsman started arguing about the price for a good lay. The Scots are as you probably know, not known as big spenders. Finally the madame got tired of arguing and told the Scotsman to go down in the basement where a girl would be lying. For this he only had to pay 5 DM. The Scotsman, of course, became very happy and went down in the basement which was very dark, but he found his lay in the end.After about twenty minutes the Scotsman came up from the basement and the madame asked him about his experience. The Scotsman replied that girl was okay, but she spat in his face every time he was jumping her bones.The Madame then turned and shouted: \"Janitor, the corpse in the basement is full.\"",

At the end of the day he feels good about his new hobby and starts to look for all the ducks that he shot down. \n\nAfter collecting all the ducks the man heads back to his car and out of nowhere a park ranger appears and says to the man \"hello sir, how are you doing today?\" The man says proudly, with his chest sticking out \"I'm doing great!! It's my first time duck hunting and if you don't mind me saying it was a real challenge, I was even able to bag quite a few ducks today!\" \n\nThe ranger pauses and asks the man if he could see his duck hunting license. \"Sure no problem\" the man says. \"May I take a look at those ducks?\" the ranger says politely \"Sure, they're real beauties....help yourself\" replied the man. So the ranger puts on some gloves and takes out the first duck... he then proceeds to put his finger up the ducks butt. He looks at the man and says \"Hmmmm... this duck is from Montana\". The man is confused and thinks to himself that this ranger is weird. \n\n\nThe ranger asks the man if he has a tag for hunting ducks in Montana on his license. \"No\" the man says nervously. So the ranger says \"I'm sorry but I'm gonna have too give you a $1000 citation\". Upset and confused the man doesn't say anything, he's shocked.

The ranger finally takes the last duck out of the bag and puts his finger up the ducks butt. \"Hmmm... this duck is from Colorado, I suppose you don't have a tag for that either?\" the ranger says to the man. \n\"NOOOO\", shouts the man. \"Well I guess I'm gonna have to give you three citations today sir.\" replies the ranger.

Somebody get me a priest!\" the man gasps. A policeman checks the crowd----no priest, no minister, no man of God of any kind. \"A PRIEST, PLEASE!\" the dying man says again. Then out of the crowd steps a little old man dressed shabbily and of at least eighty years of age. \"Mr. Policeman,\" says the man, \"I'm not a priest. I'm not even a Catholic. But for fifty years now I've been living behind St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church on First Avenue, and every night I'm listening to the Catholic litany. Maybe I can be of some comfort to this man.\" The policeman agrees and brings the octogenarian over to where the dying man lay. He kneels down, leans over the injured man and says slowly in a solemn voice:\"B-4. I-19. N-38. G-54. O-72...\"",

They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying \"you-did-not-see-a-base\" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.\n\nThe day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane...only this time there were two people in the plane.\n\nThe same pilot jumped out and said, \"Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!\"",

She comes up on this trucker who is carrying a double-wide home and is taking up both lanes. To her disliking, he is only going about 45. To get the point across that she wants to get past, she decides to tailgate him. So, she gets to within a foot of his rear bumper. The trucker looks back and sees her on his ass, and motions for her to get off of it, but to her it looks like a wave and she waves back. Since her first attempt was futile, she decided to get a little closer and begin flashing her headlights, hopefully making herself more visible in the process. Once again the trucker sees her on his ass, and this time motions for her to pull over to the side of the road. The trucker steps out of his vehicle with a chunk of chalk and draws a circle three feet in diameter in the middle of the road. He instructs her not to move until he tells her to. Naive as she was, she agrees to it and steps inside it. The trucker goes back to his truck and pulls out a 50-ounce Louisville Slugger. He walks over to the Lamborghini and beats it, and beats it, and beats it again. When he is done, all that is left is a brand new, candy-apple red, $125,000 pile of metal. Satisfied, he throws the bat in his truck and walks over to the blonde. When he gets there, to his astonishment, she is rolling around on the street laughing hysterically. He asks her, \"Why are you laughing? I just beat the crap out of your car!!\" She is laughing too hard to respond, but between giggles he can make out, \"While you weren't looking I stepped out of the circle twice!\"",

In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash. The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt. The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.",

She replied, \"$165,000!\" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk.The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, \"Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. \"Where did you get all of this money?\"The old lady replied, \"I make bets.\"The president then asked, \"Bets? What kind of bets?\"The old woman said, \"Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.\"\"Ha!\" laughed the president, \"That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!\"The old lady challenged, \"So, would you like to take my bet?\"\"Sure,\" said the president, \"I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!\"The little old lady then said, \"Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 AM as a witness?\"\"Sure!\" replied the confident president.That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: \"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!\"The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president did. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. \"Well, Okay,\" said the president, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\"Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\"She replied, \"Nothing, except that I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 AM today, I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.\"",

Whatever went wrong in the neighborhood, it turned out they had had a hand in it. Their parents were at their wit's end trying to control them. Hearing about a priest nearby who worked with delinquent boys, the mother suggested to the father that they ask the priest to talk with the boys. The father replied, \"Sure, do that before I kill them!\" The mother went to the priest and made her request. He agreed, but said he wanted to see the younger boy first and alone. So the mother sent him to the priest. The priest sat the boy down across a huge, impressive desk he sat behind. For about five minutes they just sat and stared at each other. Finally, the priest pointed his forefinger at the boy and asked, \"Where is God?\" The boy looked under the desk, in the corners of the room, all around, but said nothing. Again, louder, the priest pointed at the boy and asked \"Where is God?\" Again the boy looked all around but said nothing. A third time, in a louder, firmer voice, the priest leaned far across the desk and put his forefinger almost to boy's nose, and asked, \"Where is God? The boy panicked and ran all the way home. Finding his older brother, he dragged him upstairs to their room and into the closet, where they usually plotted their mischief. He finally said, \"We are in BIIIIG trouble.\" The older boy asked, \"What do you mean, BIIIIG trouble?\" his brother replied, \"God is missing and they think we did it.\"",

        "joke": "Every night, after dinner, a man took off for the local tavern. He spent the whole evening there, and arrived home very drunk around midnight each night.\n\nHe always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole and getting the door opened. His wife, waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out, and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine.\n\nOne day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior, and was particularly distraught by it all.\n\nThe friend listened to her, and then said, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently, when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways.\"\n\nThe wife thought that might be a good idea.\n\nThat night, Harry took off again, after dinner. And, about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition.\n\nHis wife heard him at the door, and quickly went to it, and opened the door, and let Harry in.\n\nThis time, instead of berating him, as she had always done, she took his arm, and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him, and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to him, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed, now, don't you think?\"\n\nAt that, Harry replied, in his inebriated state, \"I guess we might as well. I'll be getting in trouble with the stupid wife when I get home anyway!\"",

        "joke": "A truck driver, hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers, stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door that says, \"COMPUTER NERDS NOT ALLOWED - ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!\" He enters and sits down.\n\nThe bartender comes over to him, sniffs, and says that he smells kind of nerdy. He then asks him what he does for a living. The truck driver explains to him that he drives a truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is hauling. The bartender serves him a beer and says, \"OK, truck drivers aren't nerds.\"\n\nAs he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in wearing a pair of glasses with tape around the middle, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt that is at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver asks him why he did that.\n\nThe bartender replied, \"Don't worry. The computer nerds are in season because they are overpopulating Silicon Valley. You don't even need a license.\"\n\nSo the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads for the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the road. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, snatching up all of the computers. The scavengers are comprised of engineers, accountants and programmers - computer geeks. Each of them wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.\n\nHe can't let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, killing several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.\n\nThe truck driver said, \"What's wrong? I thought computer nerds were in season.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" says the patrolman, \"But you can't bait 'em!\"",

        "joke": "How to Determine if Technology has Taken Over Your Life\n\n1. Your stationery is more cluttered than Warren Beatty's address book. The letterhead lists a fax number, e-mail addresses for two on-line services, and your Internet address, which spreads across the breadth of the letterhead and continues to the back. In essence, you have conceded that the first page of any letter you write *is* letterhead.\n\n2. You can no longer sit through an entire movie without having at least one device on your body beep or buzz.\n\n3. You need to fill out a form that must be typewritten, but you can't because there isn't one typewriter in your house only computers with laser printers.\n\n4. You think of the gadgets in your office as \"friends,\" but you forget to send your father a birthday card.\n\n5. You disdain people who use low Baud rates.\n\n6. When you go into a computer store, you eavesdrop on a salesperson talking with customers and you butt in to correct him and spend the next twenty minutes answering the customers' questions, while the salesperson stands by silently, nodding his head.\n\n7. You use the phrase \"digital compression\" in a conversation without thinking how strange your mouth feels when you say it.\n\n8. You constantly find yourself in groups of people to whom you say the phrase \"digital compression.\" Everyone understands what you mean, and you are not surprised or disappointed that you don't have to explain it.\n\n9. You know bill Gates' e-mail address, but you have to look up your own social security number.\n\n10. You stop saying \"phone number\" and replace it with \"voice number,\" since we all know the majority of phone lines in any house are plugged into contraptions that talk to other contraptions.\n\n11. You sign Christmas cards by putting :) next to your signature.\n\n12. Off the top of your head, you can think of nineteen keystroke symbols that are far more clever than :).\n\n13. You back up your data every day.\n\n14. Your wife asks you to pick up some minipads for her at the store and you return with a wrist-rest for her mouse.\n\n15. You think jokes about being unable to program a VCR are stupid.\n\n16. On vacation, you are reading a computer manual and turning the pages faster than everyone else who is reading John Grisham novels.\n\n17. The thought that a CD could refer to finance or music rarely enters your mind.\n\n18. You are able to argue persuasively that Ross Perot's phrase \"electronic town hall\" makes more sense than the term \"information superhighway,\" but you don't because, after all, the man still uses hand drawn pie charts.\n\n19. You go to computer trade shows and map out your path of the exhibit hall in advance. But you cannot give someone directions to your house without looking up the street names.\n\n20. You would rather get more dots per inch than miles per gallon.\n\n21. You become upset when a person calls you on the phone to sell you something, but you think it's okay for a computer to call and demand that you start pushing buttons on your telephone to receive more information about the product it is selling.\n\n22. You know without a doubt that disks come in five and a quarter and three and a half inch sizes.\n\n23. Al Gore strikes you as an \"intriguing\" fellow.\n\n24. You own a set of itty bitty screwdrivers and you actually know where they are.\n\n25. While contemporaries swap stories about their recent hernia surgeries, you compare mouse induced index finger strain with a nine year old.\n\n26. You are so knowledgeable about technology that you feel secure enough to say \"I don't know\" when someone asks you a technology question instead of feeling compelled to make something up.\n\n27. You rotate your screen savers more frequently than your automobile tires.\n\n28. You have a functioning home copier machine, but every toaster you own turns bread into charcoal.\n\n29. You have ended friendships because of irreconcilably different opinions about which is better the track ball or the track *pad*.\n\n30. You understand all the above jokes. If so, my friend, technology has taken over your life. We suggest, for your own good, that you go lie under a tree and write a haiku. And don't use a laptop.\n\n31. You email these jokes to your friends over the net. You'd never get around to showing it to them in person or reading it to them on the phone. In fact, you have probably never met most of these people face to face.",

Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener. Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.\n\nSomehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food.

        "joke": "Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show.\n\nRecently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a east coast resident, which was posted on the Internet.\n\nDear Dr. Laura:\n\nThank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law.\n\nI have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.\n\nI do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:\n\nWhen I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?\n\nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n\nI know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual unseemliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n\nLev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n\nI have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n\nA friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n\nLev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\nMost of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?\n\nI know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n\nMy uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n\nI know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n\nYour devoted fan,\n\n\"East Coast Resident\"",

The gates are closed, however, and Forrest approaches the gatekeeper.\n\nSaint Peter says, \"Well, Forrest, it's certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you.\n\nI must inform you that the place is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance exam for everyone. The tests are fairly short, but you need to pass before you can get into Heaven.\"\n\nForrest responds, \"It shore is good to be here, Saint Peter. I was looking forward to this. Nobody ever told me about any entrance exams Shore hope the test ain't too hard; life was a big enough test as it was.\"\n\nSaint Peter goes on, \"Yes, I know Forrest. But, the test I have has only three questions. Here is the first: What days of the week begin with the letter 'T'? Second, how many seconds are there in a year? Third, what is God's first name?\"\n\nForrest goes away to think the questions over. Forrest returns the next day and goes up to Saint Peter to try to answer the exam questions.\n\nSaint Peter waves him up and asks, \"Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.\"\nForrest says, \"Well, the first one, how many days of the week begin with the letter 'T? Shucks, that one's easy; that'd be Today and Tomorrow.\"\n\nThe saint's eyes opened wide and he exclaims, \"Forrest! That's not what I was thinking, but...you do have a point though, and I guess I didn't specify, so I give you credit for that answer. How about the next one?\" says Saint Peter. \"How many seconds in a year?\"\n\n\"Now that one's harder,\" says Forrest. \"But, I thunk and thunk about that, and I guess the only answer can be twelve.\"\n\nAstounded, Saint Peter says, \"Twelve! Twelve! Forrest, how could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?\"\n\nForrest says, \"Shucks, there gotta be twelve: January second, February second, March second.......\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" interrupts Saint Peter. \"I see where you're going with it. And I guess I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind. I'll give you credit for that one too.\"\n\n\"Let's go on with the next and final question,\" says Saint Peter. \"Can you tell me God's first name?\"\n\nForrest says, \"Well, shore, I know God's first name. Everybody knows it. It's Howard.\"\n\n\"Howard?!\" asks Saint Peter. \"What makes you think it's Howard?!\"\n\nForrest answers, \"It's in the prayer.\"\n\n\"The prayer?\" asks Saint Peter, \"Which prayer?\"\n\n\"You know, The Lord's Prayer,\" responds Forrest.......\n\n\"Our Father, which art in Heaven, Howard be thy name......\"",

While rummaging through the boat's provisions, one of the men stumbled across an old lamp. Secretly hoping that a Genie would appear, he rubbed the lamp vigorously. To the amazement of the castaways, a Genie did appear!\n\nThis particular Genie, however, stated that she could only deliver one wish, not the standard three. Without giving much thought to the matter the man blurted out, \"Make the entire ocean into beer!\"\n\nImmediately the Genie clapped her hands with a deafening crash, and the entire sea turned to the finest brew ever sampled by mortals. Simultaneously, the Genie vanished to her freedom. Only the gentle lapping of beer on the hull broke the sudden stillness as the the two men considered their circumstances.\n\nThe other man looked disgustedly at the one who's wish had been granted. After a long, tension-filled moment, he spoke: \"Nice going! Now we're going to have to pee in the boat!!\"",

        "joke": "Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because\nno matter how legitimate my illness, because I always sense my boss thinks I am\nlying.\n\nOn one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway\nbecause the truth was to humiliating to reveal. I simply mentioned that\nI had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in\nthe next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage\non my crown.\n\nIn this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in\nthe place men feel the most pain. The accident occurred mainly because\nI conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty\n\nAs the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower\nafter breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.\n\"Ed!\" she harkened. \"The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it.\" \"You\nknow where the button is.\" I protested through the shower (pitter-patter).\n\n\"Reset it yourself!\"\n\n\"I am scared!\" She pleaded. \"What if it starts going and\nsucks me in?\"\n\nPause. \"C'mon, it'll only take a second.\" No logical assurance\nabout how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person\nwho suffers from \"Big-ol-scary-machine-phobia,\" a condition brought on\nby watching too many Stephen King movies.\n\nIt is futile to argue or explain, kind of like telling\nLloyd Bentsen Americans are over-taxed. And if a poltergeist did, in fact,\npossess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with\nthat the rest of my life.\n\nSo out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to\nmake a statement about how her cowardly behavior was, not without consequence,\nbut it was I who would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under\nthe sink to find the button.\n\nIt is the last action I remember performing. It struck\nwithout warning, without respect to my circumstances. Nay, it wasn't a\nhexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new\nkitty, clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs.\nShe (\"Buttons\" aka \"the Grater\") had been poised around the corner and\nstalked me as I took the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I\nwas most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged\nthem with her needle-like claws.\n\nNow when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close\nto their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly\nbodily movements. Instinctively, their nerves compel the body to contort\ninwardly, while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a\nwell trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full\nweight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure.\nWild animals are sometimes faced with a \"fight or flight\" syndrome; men,\nin this predicament, choose only the \"flight\" option.\n\nFleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels\nwhen it is alarmed. It was a dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great\nheights to escape, I never made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly\nimpeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold.\n\nWhen I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me.\nHaving been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they tried\nto conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical laughter. My wife\ntold me I should be flattered.\n\nAt the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation\nout of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. \"What's\nthe matter, cat got your tongue?\"\n\nIf they had only known.",

        "joke": "Cat fitness really can be fun. However, it is important to start any fitness program only when you feel like it. Don't let a few extra pounds intimidate you into becoming more active. The most important aspect of fitness is: when to start the program. The best time is at about 2 a.m. The house is quiet; there are no distractions. The warm-up is critical. Cats are experts at stretching, so this won't be a problem. Start with a few\nwind sprints, full speed, toenails clicking on the tile or linoleum floors. A few low but loud growls will help you feel charged up.\n\nNow it is time to add some eye-paw coordination work. Find a marble (the big steelies work even better) and roll that down the floor as the sprints continue. See how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before it disappears under the fridge. Finally, work on that upper body strength. Climbing is a great exercise. Use draperies, macram\u00e9 plant hangers, or clothing on hangers. You can even find some carpeting on some basement walls. Backs of chairs work well, too.\n\nNow put it all together. A speed sprint to the end of the hall! A race around the living room! Leap to the back of the rocking chair! Let the rebound launch you to the top of the swinging planter! Rock that baby! Feel those muscles work. Just as the hook pulls loose from the ceiling, dash to the bedroom and dive under the covers.

They would then continue as if nothing had happened.\n\n\nA special audience member would find a headless bird in his/her seat\nafter the intermission.\n\n\nSnack bar employees would constantly be reprimanding cast members for walking on the counter.\n\n\nOpen the stall door and guess who is drinking from the toilet.\n\n\nPart of the performance would include the cast climbing and shredding the theater curtains.\n\n\nThe stage would be stained from someone coughing up a hairball and\nthen eating it.\n\n\nPerformers would find sand in the lobby ashtrays and -- well, we\ndon't have to draw a picture here, do we?\n\n\nThe show would need to be stopped several times to allow cast members to \"bathe\" themselves.\n\n\nMost of the final act would consist of the cast just staring at the audience.\n\n\nThe big finale would feature a giant ball of yarn, feathers on a\npole, and stray strands of dental floss.\n\n\nTheater patrons waiting outside the stage door after performances\nwould get their legs rubbed, if they were lucky.\n\n\nCast members would never cash their paychecks, just play with them.",

        "joke": "** DOORS:\n\nDo not allow closed doors in any room. To get door opened, stand on\nhind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary\nto use it. After you have ordered an \"outside\" door opened, stand halfway\nin and out and think about several things. This is particularly important\nduring very cold weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors\nare to be avoided at all costs.\n\n** CHAIRS and RUGS:\n\nIf you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage\nin time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good.\nWhen throwing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as\nlong as the human's bare foot.\n\n** BATHROOMS:\n\nAlways accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything\n-- just sit and stare.\n\n** HAMPERING:\n\nIf one of your humans is engaged in some close activity and the other\nis idle, stay with the busy one. This is called \"helping\", otherwise known\nas \"hampering.\" Following are the rules for \"hampering\":\n\na) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook.\nYou cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on\nand then picked up and comforted.\n\nb) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book,\nunless you can lie across the book itself.\n\nc) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate\nmanner so as to obscure as much of the work or at least the most important\npart. Pretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil\nor knitting needles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember,\nthe aim is to hamper work.\n\nEmbroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of\nwhat the humans may tell you.\n\nd) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes\nor Christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim -- to hamper!\nFirst, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from\nthe side of the table. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the\npapers, scattering them to the best of your ability. After being removed\nfor the second time, push pens, pencils, and erasers off the table, one\nat a time.\n\ne) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure\nto jump on the back of the paper. They love to jump.\n\n** WALKING:\n\nAs often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front\nof the human, especially: on stairs, when they have something in their\narms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the morning. This will\nhelp their coordination skills.\n\n** BEDTIME:\n\nAlways sleep on the human at night so s/he cannot move round.\n\n** PLAY:\n\nThis is an important part of your life. Get enough sleep in the daytime\nso you are fresh for your nocturnal games. Below are listed several favorite\ncat games that you can play. It is important though to maintain one's Dignity\nat all times. If you should have an accident during play, such as falling\noff a chair, immediately wash a part of your body as if to say \"I MEANT\nto do that!\" It fools those humans every time.\n\nCAT GAMES:\n\n\"Catch Mouse\":\n\nThe humans would have you believe that those lumps under the covers\nare their feet and hands. They are lying. They are actually Bed Mice, rumored\nto be the most delicious of all the mice in the world, though no cat has\never been able to catch one. Rumor also has it that only the most ferocious\nattack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get\nthem. Maybe YOU can be the first to taste the Bed Mouse!\n\n\"King of the Hill\":\n\nThis game must be played with at least one other cat. The more, the\nmerrier! One or both of the sleeping humans is Hill 303 which must be defended\nat all costs from the other cat(s). Anything goes. This game allows for\nthe development of unusual tactics as one must take the unstable playing\ntheater into account.\n\nWARNING:\n\nPlaying either of these games to excess will result in expulsion from\nthe bed and possibly from the bedroom. Should the humans grow restless,\nimmediately begin purring and cuddle up to them.\n\nThis should buy you some time until they fall asleep again. If one happens\nto be on a human when this occurs, this cat wins the round of King of the\nHill.\n\n** TOYS:\n\nAny small item is a potential toy. If a human tries to confiscate it,\nthis means that it is a Good Toy. Run with it under the bed. Look suitably\noutraged when the human grabs you and takes it away.\n\nAlways watch where it is put so you can steal it later. Two reliable\nsources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets. There are several types\nof cat toys.\n\nBright shiny things like keys, brooches, or coins should be hidden so\nthat the other cat(s) or humans can't play with them. They are generally\ngood for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors.\n\nDangly and/or string-like things such as shoelaces, cords, gold chains,\nand dental floss also make excellent toys. They are favorites of humans\nwho like to drag them across the floor for us to pounce on. When a string\nis dragged under a newspaper or throw rug, it magically becomes the Paper/Rug\nMouse and should be killed at all costs. Take care, though. Humans are\nsneaky and will try to make you lose your Dignity.\n\n** PAPER BAGS:\n\nWithin paper bags dwell the Bag Mice. They are small and camouflaged\nto be the same color as the bag, so they are hard to see. But you can easily\nhear the crinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag. Anything,\nup to and including shredding the bag, can be done to kill them. Note:\nany other cat you may find in a bag hunting for Bag Mice is fair game for\na Sneak Attack, which will usually result in a great Tag match.\n\n** FOOD:\n\nIn order to get the energy to sleep, play, and hamper, a cat must eat.\nEating, however, is only half the fun. The other half is getting the food.\nCats have two ways to obtain food: convincing a human you are starving\nto death and must be fed *NOW*; and hunting for it oneself.\n\nThe following are guidelines for getting fed.\n\na) When the humans are eating, make sure you leave the tip of your tail\nin their dishes when they are not looking.\n\nb) Never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the\ntable.\n\nc) Never drink from your own water bowl if a human's glass is full enough\nto drink from.\n\nd) Should you catch something of your own outside, it is only polite\nto attempt to get to know it. Be insistent -- your food will usually not\nbe so polite and try to leave.\n\ne) Table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately\nunwilling to readily part. It is beneath the Dignity of a cat to beg outright\nfor food as lower forms of life such as dogs will, but several techniques\nexist for ensuring that the humans don't forget you exist. These include,\nbut are not limited to: jumping onto the lap of the \"softest\" human and\npurring loudly; lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the\nkitchen, the Direct Stare, and twining around people's legs as they sit\nand eat while meowing plaintively.\n\n** SLEEPING:\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to have enough energy for playing, a cat\nmust get plenty of sleep. It is generally not difficult to find comfortable\nplace to curl up. Any place a human likes to sit is good, especially if\nit contrasts with your fur color. If it's in a sunbeam or near a heating\nduct or radiator, so much the better. Of course, good places also exist\noutdoors, but have the disadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on\ncurrent and previous weather conditions such as rain. Open windows are\na good compromise.\n\n** SCRATCHING POSTS:\n\nIt is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide.\nThey are very protective of what they think is their property and will\nobject strongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it. Being sneaky\nand doing it when they aren't around won't help, as they are very observant.\nIf you are an outdoor kitty, trees are good. Sharpening your claws on a\nhuman is a definite no-no!\n\n** HUMANS:\n\nHumans have three primary functions: to feed us, to play with and give\nattention to us, and to clean the litter box. It is important to maintain\none's Dignity when around humans so that they will not forget who is the\nmaster of the house. Humans need to know basic rules. They can be taught\nif you start early and are consistent.\n\nYou will then have a smooth-running household.",

        "joke": "Having conquered cat flu, triumphed over tapeworm and braved behavioural quirks, it is time to focus attention on some oft-observed, but little-documented, afflictions of cats. \n\n\nCollapsible Legs\nSymptoms:   The affected cat places one side of its head on the ground as though cheek-marking the concrete, carpet etc.  After several such maneuvres, the legs on that side of the cat suddenly collapse, leaving the cat waggling its feet in the air. \nTreatment:   This involves placing the palm of one hand on the exposed belly and rubbing gently.  There are side-effects though - some feline sufferers attack the rubbing hand while others recover spontaneously, often after prolonged treatment.  This condition is probably incurable and any cat which requires prolonged treatment after an attack will most likely suffer repeated attacks of collapsible legs throughout its lifetime. \n\nSnudging\nSymptoms:  The affected cat repeatedly headbutts any available part of a readily available human and turns its head slightly so that the lips and cheek are rubbed against legs, arms, clothing etc.  This condition gets its name from a contraction of the phrase \"soggy nudging\".  Snudging may well be a form of excessive scent-marking.  A bad attack can result in soggy clothing. \nTreatment:  Give the sufferer lavish affection.  Most attacks subside between 10 minutes to 1 hour after onset of symptoms.  You may need to dry off snudged clothing or skin.  Attacks recur frequently, usually when the most readily available human is engrossed in a TV program, book or telephone call. \n\nBed-Hogging\nSymptoms:   The cat spreads to take up all available free bed space at night.  It then expands a bit more until any human occupants occupy the smallest possible area of bed.  It may do this on top or underneath the covers or on the pillow.  It is highly contagious - any other cats on the bed will also develop symptoms of bed-hogging. \nTreatment:   The most obvious solution is to evict the cat from the bed.  If this is morally unfeasible, train yourself not to give way as the cat expands.  Buying a bigger bed is probably pointless as most affected cats can easily expand to fill standard, queen-sized and king-sized beds.  Otherwise, simply train yourself to sleep while hanging precariously off the side of the bed. Attacks of bed-hogging have been known to last up to 23 hours (in one case a 3-day attack was noted by a cat-owner who was confined to bed with flu; the cat thoughtfully kept her company during this time). \n\nNon-Specific Insect Infestation\n(also Non-Speficic Spider Infestation) \nSymptoms:  A disorder more prevalent among outdoor-going cats and cats with access to conservatories and garden rooms.  Symptoms range from minor (the odd greenfly in tail, money-spider on fur) to severe (entire ecosystems of insects living on cat, spider webs spun between ears/whiskers, cat so weighed down with spider webs that it has difficulty walking). \nTreatment:  Minor symptoms can be treated by simply removing the infesting agent (aphid, ladybug, spider etc) and combing webs out of fur.  If the cat suffers recurrent or severe symptoms an exercise regime is highly recommended since highly mobile cats appear to attract fewer greenfly (research into this factor continues). \n\nFuffling\nSymptoms:  The cat lowers its nose into water and exhales.  This is followed by whiffling, spluttering, sneezing, snorting, head-shaking and a generally confused expression.  Bath-foam appears to trigger attacks of fuffling in some cats.  It may also be linked to interesting items seen in the water e.g. goldfish, food-crumbs, greeblingz.  Fuffling is most common during kittenhood although even quite elderly may suffer an occasional bout. \nTreatment:  None.  Snorkelling apparatus or scuba suits are possibilities, but cats do not readily accept such treatment.  Kittenhood fuffling generally subsides as the cat grows older, possibly due to some acquired immunity (or greater common sense). \n\nIrritable Lap Syndrome\nSymptoms:  The cat appears unable to settle comfortably on laps, instead treading, kneading, rearranging itself, fidgeting, vocalising, getting up and turning around, falling off lap and getting back on again, attacking magazines, needlework, computer keyboard, telephone etc. \nTreatment:  Immediate treatment is essential.  Drop whatever you are doing (literally if need be) and give 100% attention to the sufferer otherwise symptoms may escalate and become quite distressing to the lap-owner.  Only prolonged attention will cure an attack of Irritable Lap Syndrome.  Like Collapsible Legs this syndrome is incurable, although attacks may be effectively treated as and when they occur. \n\nLap Fungus Disorder\nSymptoms:  Having taken over a human lap, the cat proceeds to spread in all planes. This may be accompanied by secondary symptoms such as high volume purring, dribbling, kneading and snoring.  The condition is highly contagious and several fungoid cats may infest a lap simultaneously. \nTreatment:  Topical treatment with proprietary anti-fungals is ineffective.  Prompt treatment (as per Irritable Lap Syndrome) is required to alleviate the worst symptoms although in a number of cats, such treatment actually aggravates the condition.  This disorder manifests itself periodically through the affected cat's life and there is no long-term cure. \n\nSmurgling\nSymptoms:  Varied:- sucking at clothing, owners earlobes/nose/fingers/skin, drooling, glazed expression.  Often accompanied by kneading and high volume purring. \nTreatment:  Ultimately incurable.  It is possible to remove smurglable items from around the cat.  The ailment may be transmitted to humans in the form of large laundry bills, mis-shapen clothing and chapped skin. \n\nGreeblingz\nSymptoms:  Random dashes through to helter-skelter running through house in pursuit of unseen prey.  Greeblingz are believed to be non-visible entities and some authorities have linked them to UFO sightings or feel that they may be diminutive other-dimensional beings.  Cats suffering from greeblingz typically have wild-eyed expressions.  There is a minor danger of greeblingz attaching themselves to humans; if a cat tackles such greeblingz, injury to humans may result.  A very few cats are naturally immune. \nTreatment:  None known.  Anti-epileptics are ineffective as the condition appears unrelated to other forms of seizure.  Avoid getting in the way of a cat engaged in greebling hunting.  Attacks usually subside spontaneously, perhaps as greeblingz return to their own dimension.  These irritating creatures are not visible to human eyes, but no doubt the superior sight and hearing of cats enables them to see them.",

The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks him, \"How are things since you got here?\"\n\nThe cat stretches and yawns and replies, \"It is wonderful here. Better than I could have ever expected.

Attempts to get humans to lick themselves clean have proven interesting, if unproductive.\n\n\nCommunication  \nHumans are unable to speak a proper language.

Unfortunately, humans tend to get easily spooked by prolonged study of courtship rituals, and resort to shoe-throwing behavior.\n\n\nToilet Training\nA human's natural tendency is to not change your litter box.  Although experts in human behavior believe it can be attributed to the \"laziness reflex,\" this can be easily corrected through what is called \"shoe therapy.\"  Just remember that a human shoe looks a lot like a human toilet, and you should be fine.\n\nFollowing these simple tips is the first step towards a long and\nproductive cat/human relationship.",

The catalogue that came in the mail offers a kit\nthat includes a cat toothbrush, cat toothpaste, cat breath spray and a\njar of something called \"gauze dental pads.\"\n\nI don't know what that last item is but my guess is that gauze dental\npads are what you put on your wounds after trying to brush the teeth of\na cat.\n\nOr maybe it is for the cat's wounds. You spend a few minutes trying to\nram a toothbrush into the face of a struggling cat and it isn't going to\ndo the cat any good either.\n\nIt may be that after each morning's brushing both you and the cat have\nto sit around dabbing at the surprising new openings all over your\nbodies.\n\nCats are not as enthusiastic about their dental hygiene as are the people\ntrying to sell you the products for that purpose. And some of those\nproducts are bizarre:\n\nThe cat toothpaste, for instance. It is flavored. Maybe that's not so odd\nby itself. A cat might be a little more willing to listen to reason on\nits dental hygiene if the toothpaste is mouse flavored or fish flavored or\nsomething like that. If they can sell people bourbon-flavored\ntoothpaste, they should be able to sell cats bird-flavored toothpaste.\nBirds are the bourbon of cats. You may stop by after work for a\nbourbon and water. But a cat prefers a couple of birds after a hard day\nof doing what cats do all day absolutely nothing.\n\nActually, I have never understood bourbon toothpaste, even for people\nwho love bourbon. Most people who love bourbon are not nearly so\nkeen on it first thing in the morning. People who use bourbon tooth\npaste are the same people who have a quick pull on the bottle when\nthey awaken just to get their blood moving. That's pretty hardcore.\n\nThe only people in deeper trouble are those who rinse with a stiff,\nhigh-alcohol mouthwash but don't spit. There are people who will tell\nyou they quit drinking years ago but who have started using mouth\nwash five times a day.\n\nThe cat toothpaste isn't bourbon-flavored but it is a long way from the\nflavor you would expect just the same: Malt. The toothpaste they are\nselling for cats is malt-flavored.\n\nI was unaware that cats like malt. But who am I to question? For all I\nknow, they may not stop by after a hard day of doing nothing for a\nbourbon and water, but maybe cats do like some sort of\nsparrow-and-malt blender drink a malted bird shake. (If anybody would\ngo for blender drinks it is those hairy sissies who call themselves\ncats.)\n\nI have no idea why cat toothpaste is malt flavored. My first guess was\nthat it had something to do with bad breath. But the catalogue specifies\nmalt \"flavored.\" And the tooth kit includes a separate container of\nbreath spray for the way a cat's breath smells.\n\nThe breath spray must be for the benefit of people who let cats breathe\nin their faces at close range. I don't even let people breathe in my face\nat close range.\n\nBut some cat owners are into that sort of thing and I'll concede I would\nuse a breath spray on the cat if I were in the habit of sharing air with\na creature that has just finished drinking a sparrow-and-malt blender\ndrink.\n\nOf course, cat products aren't the only silly part of a pampered pet\ncatalogue. They also have toothpaste for dogs. And they specify that it\nis \"no-rinse\" toothpaste. It is no-rinse toothpaste because dogs don't\nknow how to spit. And they don't want to learn. Dogs specialize in\nputting things into their mouths, not in expelling them.\n\nIn other words, they swallow their toothpaste.

Now we do not see you anymore.  We are lonesome here and it is difficult for us to remember how much you love us.\"\n\nAnd God said, \"No problem!

And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his tail.\n\nAnd Adam said, \"Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.\"\n\nAnd God said, \"No problem.  Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG.\"\n\nAnd Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and loved them. And they were comforted. And God was pleased. And dog was content and wagged his tail. After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said, \"Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride.

        "joke": "5:30am:  Started the day as a hero!  When the sound of the newspaper hitting the driveway roused me from my deep slumber -- the impact indicating the paper was much heavier than normal -- I realized that no one in the house was yet awake!  I roused my master by licking him in the face.  He appeared very angry with himself for having overslept, shouting and waving his arms. His ill temper even seemed directed at me a bit, which is silly since it is I who saved him from being fired.  Funny thing though:  He didn't go into work, but spent the morning leafing through the large newspaper and drinking coffee. He seems to do this once a week, and I don't know why.\n\n7:30am:  Invaders!  The people who live next door came out into their yard, obviously getting ready to lay siege to our house.  Snarling and barking, I let them know in no uncertain terms that I was prepared to tear them from limb to limb it they came any closer, and was able to repel the invasion. This is an almost daily occurrence; you'd think they'd learn.  My master added his voice to the fray as well, yelling angrily.  I am sure the people couldn't hear him, but it was nice of him to lend his support.\n\n10:00am:  I was forced to move, as the patch of sun in which I was lying had, for some reason, slid over a few feet.  It's not easy being a dog.\n\n1:00pm:  I have the most thoughtful master in the world!  While it's true he left me alone in the house for several hours, he did set out a treat for me on the kitchen counter.  It was even gift-wrapped, a courtesy I wish he'd skipped, since it led to me having a lot of plastic in my teeth.  The roast was delicious, though frozen in the center.  I don't want to seem ungrateful, but crunching through two inches of rock-hard beef is hardly my idea of a delicacy.\n\n2:00pm:  Most unpleasant experience when my master returned home and was furious that I had not eaten the plastic wrap which had been covering my present.  He kept pointing at the small pieces of Styrofoam and other debris and raving in a most irrational fashion.  I'm sorry, but he should know that I can't eat that stuff; it makes my stomach upset.  When he began rolling up a newspaper I realized he'd lost all reason and bolted for the front door, which was fortunately open just a crack.\n\n4:00pm:  Spent the afternoon with the girls.  A most productive day; I was able to mark territory for two blocks.  \"Drip 'til you drop\" is our motto. We had a small snack at an outdoor cafe we like, with meat scraps and bread served out of circular containers with easily displaced lids.  Ran into that rogue Sebastian, who lifted his leg with irritating nonchalance -- does he think I don't know about his obsession with Muffy, that snotty schnauzer from down the road?  Last month there wasn't a male in the neighborhood who\ncouldn't be found outside her fence, and Sebastian was at the head of the pack.  I let him know I want nothing more to do with him.\n\n5:00pm:  What a treat!  On the way home a flock of ravens drew my attention to a squirrel that had been flattened by an automobile.  After several days in the sun, the aroma was so delicious it made my nose quiver.  I rolled in the wondrous fragrance for several minutes, and when I stood up I positively radiated eau de roadkill.  Let Sebastian drool over Muffy -- he doesn't know what he's missing.\n\n6:00pm:  Of all the times to get a bath!  My master, still in a foul mood, made me stand outside in the chill air while he shampooed and rinsed me several times.  Every time I shook the water from my fur he, too, became drenched, and in the end he was shivering.  Why in the world does he do stuff like this?\n\n9:00pm:  Time to sleep, though I am not allowed on the bed whenever anyone's home.  Ah, the life of a dog.",

        "joke": "Dear Sir,\n\nI've been having some conflicts between programs lately. I've been running\nthe original version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 as my primary application and\nall the GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.\nI hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background\nmode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find\nthe switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately and it works\nokay. GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf\nprogram, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility.\n\nI probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might\nsee better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and\nother problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend\n2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0,\nand eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right\n- as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself. Shortly after that,\nI installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone\nbut the first time I used it, it gave me a virus. I had to clean out my\nwhole system and shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend\n4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection\nprogram. It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend\n1.0 was still in my system. I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend\n4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about\nthat automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend\nand communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal\nof both versions. The version I have now works pretty well, but there are\nstill some problems.\n\nLike all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language\nI can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly, I think there is too\nmuch attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality.\nAlso, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have\nto use gold-plated contacts. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally\nobject-oriented.\n\nA year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus\n1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered\nthat GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't upgrade to Fianc\u00e9\n1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which\nhe describes as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space so he\ncan't load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with\nWife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out\nthat the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access\nto FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. On top\nof that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he\ncan do anything.\n\nAlthough he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 also came with MotherInLaw\n1.0 which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off. I told him\nto try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he'd heard that if you try\nto run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney\nfiles before doing the uninstall itself. Then, Mistress 1.0 won't install\nanyway because of insufficient resources.",

All of our technicians are currently busy helping people who are even less competent than you, so please hold for the next available technician. The waiting time is now estimated at between fifteen minutes and eternity.\n\nIn order to expedite your call, please punch your 58-digit product identification number on to your telephone, followed by your product serial number, which can be found in a secret compartment inside your computer where, for security purposes, it is printed in the smallest typeface possible to prevent being seen.\n\nPlease note that you made need a size 11 3/4 torx screwdriver which may only be available from your original equipment manufaturer.\n\nDo that NOW!\n\nThank you again for calling Technical Support. We recommend that you sit at your computer, preferably turning it on at some point, and have at hand all your floppy disks, CD-ROM disks, computer manuals and original packing materials in order to allow the technician to aid you in the unlikely event that he ever gets to your call.\n\nIf you were an inconsiderate jerk -- we mean forgetful customer -- and threw away your original packing materials, please call the company that sent you the computer and ask them to resend you the empty box with the plastic bubbles, fake popcorn and the wasted paper advertising that they recycle. We will hold your place in line on the phone while you wait for your boxes to be delivered. (yeah right !)\n\nIt would also be helpful for you to refrain from sobbing while explaining your problem to the technician. Shouting obscene threats will cause you to be immediately disconnected and blackballed from further communication with Technical Support, not only from ours but that of every other electronics-related firm in the industrialized world. (we all talk you know)\n\nThank you once again for calling Technical Support. In order to enable us to better assist you, it would be helpful to know more about you and your equipment. Have you called Technical Support before? If you have, please press the numeral \"one\" on your telephone touch pad.\n\nIf not, press the numeral \"two.\" If you are not sure, using the letters on your touch pad, spell out the phrase: \"I am confused and despondent and quickly losing the will to live.\"\n\nOnce you have finished, hang up your phone and make arrangements to sell your computer because by the time the technician takes your call, it will be obsolete, and you will be too senile to use it anyway.\n\nThank you for calling Technical Support. Unfortunately, all of our technicians just went out for lunch. This means that to the estimated waiting time we gave you earlier, you may now add at least another two hours.\n\nThank you for calling Technical Support. Before talking to the technician about your problem and risking the possibility that you may be wasting his valuable time, please ask yourself the following questions:\n\n\nIf my monitor screen is dark, is it possible I have forgotten to plug in my computer?\n\nHave I exhausted every possible means of help before utilizing the sacred, last-resort-only telephone option?\n\nHave I sent a fax to Fast Fax Technical Support?\n\nHave I consulted my manual?\n\nHave I read the Read-Me notice on the floppy disk?\n\nHave I called up my know-it-all geek cousin who I can't stand but who can probably fix this thing for me in under five minutes?\n\nHave I given the central processing unit of my computer a good, solid whack?\n\nIf you can not honestly answer \"yes\" to all these questions, please get off the line immediately so that our overworked technicians can help those truly desperate customers whose suffering is so much greater than yours. You must be really be so bored that you have to call Technical Support just to have someone to speak to about geek stuff.\n\nThank you for calling Technical Support. You may not be aware that this week we are featuring a discount on a number of popular CD-ROM titles you may wish to purchase, If you would like to hear all 26,000 titles read to you, shout \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" into the telephone now. \n\nThis will not cause you to lose your place in line for Technical Support; in fact it may jump you ahead of several other callers.\n\nThank you for calling Technical Support. Our System has been overloaded, and unfortunately you have lost your place in line.  Please push \"one\" if you would like to be connected again to Technical Support.\n\nThank you for calling Technical Support. Our electronic sensors indicate that you are about to slump over and die from a massive frustration attack combined with severe dehydration from lack of food and water. Before doing so, please take a moment to place your telephone receiver back in its base and switch off your computer so as not to wear down its internal battery.\n\nAs a non-living person, you will have no further need of Technical Support and so we regretfully must remove you from our list of registered product users.\n\nRemember, we valued your patronage and were happy to serve your needs.

You have purchased an extremely fine device that would normally give you thousands of years of trouble-free service, except for the fact that you undoubtedly will destroy it via some typical bonehead consumer maneuver. Which is why we ask you to:\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\nRead This Before Using Your New Device\n\nPLEASE, FOR GOD'S SAKE, READ THIS OWNER'S MANUAL CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU UNPACK THE DEVICE.  YOU ALREADY UNPACKED IT, DIDN'T YOU?  YOU UNPACKED IT\nAND PLUGGED IT IN AND TURNED IT ON AND FIDDLED WITH THE KNOBS, AND NOW YOUR\nCHILD, THE SAME CHILD WHO ONCE SHOVED A POLISH SAUSAGE INTO YOUR VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDER AND SET IT ON \"FAST FORWARD\", THIS CHILD ALSO IS FIDDLING WITH THE KNOBS, RIGHT?  WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK THESE DEVICES\nRIGHT AT THE FACTORY BEFORE WE SHIP THEM OUT, YOU KNOW THAT?!?\n\nWe're sorry.  We just get a little crazy sometimes because we're always getting back \"defective\" merchandise where it turns out that the consumer\ninadvertently bathed the device in acid for six days.  So, in writing these instructions, we naturally tend to assume that your skull is filled with dead insects, but we mean nothing by it.  OK?  Now let's talk about:\n\n\nUNPACKING THE DEVICE\n\nThe device is encased in foam to protect it from the Shipping People, who like nothing more than to jab spears into outgoing boxes.\n\nPLEASE INSPECT THE CONTENTS CAREFULLY FOR GASHES OR IDA MAE BARKER'S\nENGAGEMENT RING, WHICH SHE LOST LAST WEEK, AND SHE THINKS MAYBE IT WAS\nWHILE SHE WAS PACKING DEVICES.\n\nIda Mae really wants that ring back, because it is her only proof of engagement, and her fiancee, Stuart, is now seriously considering backing out on the whole thing in as much as he had consumed most of a bottle of Jim Beam in Quality Control when he decided to pop the question.  It is not without irony that Ida Mae's last name is \"Barker\", if you get our drift.\n\nWARNING: DO NOT EVER AS LONG AS YOU LIVE THROW AWAY THE BOX OR ANY OF THE PIECES OF STYROFOAM, EVEN THE LITTLE ONES SHAPED LIKE PEANUTS.\n\nIf you attempt to return  device to the store, and you are missing one\nsingle peanut, the store personnel will laugh at you in the chilling\nmanner exhibited by Joseph Stalin just after he enslaved Eastern Europe.\n\nBesides the device, the box should contain:\n\nEight little rectangular snippets of paper that say \"WARNING\"\nA little plastic packet containing four 5/17 inch pilfer grommets and two club-ended 6/93 inch boxcar prawns.\n\nYOU WILL NEED TO SUPPLY: a matrix wrench and 60,000 feet of tram cable.\n\nIF ANYTHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING:  You IMMEDIATELY should turn to your spouse and say \"Margaret, you know why this country can't make a car that\ncan get all the way through the drive-through at Burger King without a major transmission overhaul?  Because nobody cares, that's why.\"\n\nWARNING:\nThis is assuming your spouse's name is Margaret, and not Harvey.\n\nPLUGGING IN THE DEVICE\n\nThe plug on this device represents the latest thinking of the electrical industry's Plug Mutation Group, which, in a continuing effort to prevent consumers from causing hazardous electrical current to flow through their appliances, developed the Three-Pronged Plug, then the Plug Where One Prong\nis Bigger Than the Other.  Your device is equipped with the revolutionary\nnew Plug Whose Prongs Consist of Six Small Religious Figurines Made of Chocolate. Connecting this device should only be attempted by a qualified electrician.  Lay the power cord gently on the floor near an outlet, but out of direct sunlight, and clean it weekly with a damp handkerchief.\n\nWARNING: WHEN YOU ARE LAYING THE PLUG ON THE FLOOR, DO NOT\nHOLD A SHARP OBJECT IN YOUR OTHER HAND AND TRIP OVER THE CORD\nAND POKE YOUR EYE OUT, AS THIS COULD VOID THE WARRANTY.\n\nOPERATION OF THE DEVICE\n\nWARNING: WE MANUFACTURE ONLY THE ATTRACTIVE DESIGNER CASE. THE ACTUAL\nWORKING CENTRAL PARTS OF THE DEVICE ARE MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN. THE\nINSTRUCTIONS WERE TRANSLATED BY MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER OF ACCOUNTS\nRECEIVABLE, WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO JAPAN BUT DOES HAVE MOST OF\n\"SHOGUN\" ON TAPE.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:  For results that can be the finest, it is our advising that: NEVER to hold  these buttons two times!!  Except the battery. Next taking the (something) earth section may cause a large occurrence!  However.  If this is not a trouble, such rotation is a very maintenance action, as a kindly (something) viewpoint from Figure B.\n\nFigure B\n\n\nWARRANTY\n\nBe it hereby known that this device, together with but not excluding all those certain parts thereunto, shall be warrantied against all defects, failures and malfunctions as shall occur between now and Thursday afternoon shortly before 2, during which time the Manufacturer will, at no charge to\nthe Owner, send the device to our Service People, who will emerge from their caves and engage in rituals designed to cleanse it of evil spirits.

Sensitivity is settable anywhere from\n\"merely inane\" to \"gut-wrenching anal explosion\" and can be set on\na per-user basis.\n\nFiles that crapd has decided meets the above criteria are held in\n/usr/stool for a user-settable period of time, and then flushed to\n/dev/dump.  Anything crapd decides is true stinking diarrhea will\nbe sent directly to /dev/dump with no questions asked.\n\nCrapd is especially useful for cleaning out mail spool directories,\nas this has been proven to be one of the most prolific accumulators\nof crap in the history of interactive computing.\n\nThere is, of course, a list of exceptions for crap you are\nrequired, against your better judgement, to have on the system. \nHowever, if Crapd decides the list is full of crap, it will be\nmigrated to /usr/stool.\n\nIn scientific lab test, Crapd has been shown to virtually eliminate\nuser distractions, increase system performance by 50% and reduce\nbackup volume by an order of magnitude.  Our customers report that\ncapital equipment expenditures have been reduced significantly now\nthat they don't have to keep disks spun up just to keep the crap\nwarm. \n\nAs an added bonus, Crapd will search through your process table and kill off any processes that anyone who could grab their butt with both hands wouldn't have launched during a billion year drinking binge.  \n\nNext year, a stealth option to the crap detector daemon will be\navailable. This option adds a new \"virtual crap\" feature to your\nfile systems, which causes files that have been flushed by Crapd to\nappear to still be there. \n\nIn carefully controlled lab tests, we have found that users will\nhappily continue to append Dan Quayle jokes to a file for years\nwithout ever realizing that the directory entry has been faked and\nthe file no longer exists.\n\nSo, be productive, be pure, get the Crap Detector!\n\nWarning:  Be sure to put Usenet News in the exceptions list, or\ncrapd is sure to unlink the news spool directory, shoot nntpd, and\nset fire to your incoming news link.\n\n\nBrought to you by Waste Products, Inc.\n\n\"If it's a Waste Product, you'll know it!\"",

And God separated the One from the Zero; and he saw it was good.\n\nAnd God said - Let the Data be; And so it happened. And God said - Let the Data go to their proper places. And he created floppy disks and hard disks and compact disks.\n\nAnd God said - Let the computers be, so there would be a place to put floppy disks and hard disks and compact disks. Thus God created computers and called them hardware.\n\nAnd there was no Software yet. But God created programs; small and big... And told them - Go and multiply yourselves and fill all the Memory.\n\nAnd God said - I will create the Programmer; And the Programmer will make new programs and govern over the computers and programs and Data.\n\nAnd God created the Programmer; and put him at Data Center; And God showed the Programmer the Catalog Tree and said You can use all the volumes and subvolumes but DO NOT USE Windows.\n\nAnd God said - It is not Good for the programmer to be alone. He took a bone from the Programmer's body and created a creature that would look up at the Programmer; and admire the Programmer; and love the things the Programmer does; And God called the creature: the User.\n\nAnd the Programmer and the User were left under the naked DOS and it was Good.\n\nBut Bill was smarter than all the other creatures of God. And Bill said to the User - Did God really tell you not to run any programs?\n\nAnd the User answered - God told us that we can use every program and every piece of Data but told us not to run Windows or we will die.\n\nAnd Bill said to the User - How can you talk about something you did not even try. The moment you run Windows you will become equal to God. You will be able to create anything you like by a simple click of your mouse.\n\nAnd the User saw that the fruits of the Windows were nicer and easier to use. And the User saw that any knowledge was useless - since Windows could replace it.\n\nSo the User installed the Windows on his computer; and said to the Programmer that it was good.\n\nAnd the Programmer immediately started to look for new drivers. And God asked him - What are you looking for? And the Programmer answered - I am looking for new drivers because I can not find them in the DOS. And God said - Who told you need drivers? Did you run Windows? And the Programmer said - It was Bill who told us to!\n\nAnd God said to Bill - Because of what you did you will be hated by all the creatures. And the User will always be unhappy with you. And you will always sell Windows.\n\nAnd God said to the User - Because of what you did, the Windows will disappoint you and eat up all your Resources; and you will have to use lousy programs; and you will always rely on the Programmers help.\n\nAnd God said to the Programmer - Because you listened to the User you will never be happy. All your programs will have errors and you will have to fix them and fix them to the end of time.\n\nAnd God threw them out of the Data Center and locked the door and secured it with a password.\n\nGENERAL PROTECTION FAULT",

Thus passed the Beginning and the\nend of the first day.\n\nOn the second day, the Lord summoned IBM unto His presence. \"There is\nchaos out there, and the Universe is without form and void. I must correct\nthis and I can use your help. Is there anything you can do for me?\"\n\n\"I can take care of form,\" IBM replied. \"Put me in charge of computers\nand I will take care of form for you.\"\n\nThe Lord thought that this was good and said \"Let there be computers.\nLet IBM have my powers of creation that pertain to computers and form.\"\nThus saying, the Lord went off to His second day's work while IBM created\nthe 1401.\n\nOn the third day, while the Lord was out, IBM decided to subdivide the\nassgined task. \"Let there be systems that make the computer work and let\nthem be called Operating Systems.

The Lord and IBM took the day off to go fishing. IBM hung a sign\non the door to help programmers in his absence.\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED,\n\nTRY, TRY AGAIN -\n\nAND HAVE THE FOLLOWING READY\n\nBEFORE CALLING IBM.\n\n\nOn the start of the second week the programmers went over IBM's cathode\nray tube directly to God. \"We have a horrible problem,\" they complained.\n\"Our users want systems that perform according to their expectations.\"\n\n\"USERS!\" the Lord bellowed. \"Who said that you should have users! Users\nare the difference between good and bad applications, a function I have\nreserved unto myself! Who authorized you to have users?\"\n\n\"Well, IBM...\"\n\n\"IBM!! You!! You did this to my programmers! You gave them the knowledge\nof good and evil. For that you shall suffer through eternity! Let there\nbe competition. Let it be called Anacom, and Burroughs, and CDC.\" The Lord\nwent through the alphabet several times. \"With all this competition you\nshall still suffer the pain of antitrust legislation all the days of your\nexistence.\"\n\nThis was the start of the second week, and it seems an appropriate place\nto conclude our report. In case you missed something, a summary of key\npoints follows.\n\u00a0\n\n\nUsers and their needs are and always have been a subject of dispute.\n\n\nNobody can learn English because it is cursed by God. IBM manuals are doubly\ncursed and therefore twice as hard to understand.\n\n\nOf the programming languages, only COBOL can claim divine origin.\n\n\nPeople are people, but programmers are something else.\n\n\nComputers may be a gift from heaven, but there's no divine help in getting\nthem to work.\n\n\nBecause of IBM's initial assignment, there are more forms than anyone knows\nwhat to do with.\n\n\nFinally, chaos was part of the original state of the Universe and not a\nproduct of the data processing industry.",

        "joke": "Like every other techie, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the just released, state-of-the-art, 64-bit, 128 mega-RAM, 48x, 24/7, in your face, out of your control Microself Windows 2001. Yes, that was me at the front of the line in our local Get-a-Life Software store, waiting, waiting, for the moment when the future went on sale. And now that the future is installed in my computer, there's no looking back.\n\nTo be truthful, I don't use computers. They use me. They use me as a portal between the glittering new world of information and the mundane world where ordinary people have to eat and talk and sometimes be sad. Computers use my nimble fingers to unlock their codes, releasing raw information into the ether. Taking my mission as seriously as I do, I wanted the most up-to-the-second tool on the market. And that's why, the day after I installed Windows 2001, I was back at Get-a-Life buying the upgrade, Windows 2001, version 2.0.\n\nWith Windows 2001 2.0, I don't process information. I download it into my body. Using Windows' revolutionary US-ME serial port installed in my navel, I plug myself into my computer. Like the umbilical cord that fed me when I was mere flesh, the US-ME cable feeds raw data straight into my bloodstream. There it flows until it reaches the central processing unit I used to call my brain. And there, Windows' revolutionary Brain Bot - a tiny microchip embedded in my cerebrum -- turns that raw data into wisdom that makes me smarter, richer, and so much wiser than the rest of you.\n\nDid you know that the capital of Uganda is Kampala? That Soupy Sales had a lion puppet named Pookie? That the square root of 3 is 1.732? And that today's kids will spend 23 years of their lives on the Internet swimming through vital data like this? O, it's a changing world, my friend. When you leave your Silicon Valley job for two weeks of R & R, take a cruise to Antarctica, step onto an ice floe and see penguins crowded around a laptop checking out The Weather Channel, get worried!\n\nBut I'm not worried, I'm wired. Wired to the upgraded upgrade I bought last weekend. Windows 2001 3.0 is the one with HandPrint, the printer driver that drives my digital age. Using HandPrint, I don't need an ordinary printer. I just click a button on my wrist and my hand begins scrolling across a blank page printing my raw data in any of 1,257 perfect fonts. The moving hand writes, and having writ, gives way to ear-mail.\n\nI know, I know. You all have e-mail accounts. You can e-mail Bill Gates if you want. The Pope. Your dog if you're on vacation in Antarctica. But only Windows 2001 4.0, which I bought yesterday, has ear-mail.\n\nWhen I hear a voice from the ether saying \"You've got mail!\" I run to the nearest phone. Then I run my ear-mail cord from the phone to an input implanted below my left ear. Within seconds, I'm hearing the mail read by a soothing voice that sounds a little like James Earl Jones on Prozac. To reply, I simply speak my answer, press the same button on my wrist, and presto. I unplug and go back to my daily duty of becoming richer,\nsmarter, and wiser. There's also a wireless version of e-mail but that won't come out until version 5.0 is released tomorrow. I plan to get in line at Get-a-Life sometime before midnight.\n\nBut where, you ask, is this wireless world headed? To be truthful, I'm not sure, but it sure is fun. Perhaps when I'm even richer, smarter, and wiser than I am now, thanks to\nWindows 2001 6.0 due out this weekend, I'll have an answer. Until then, you'll have to excuse me. I have mail.",

And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\n\nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, Dear?\" And Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)\".\n\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.\n\nThey were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. And lo the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would only work if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.\n\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others\". And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known, \"eBay,\" he said, \"we need a name of a service that reflects what we are,\" and Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\" \"Whoopee!\", said Abraham. \"No, YAHOO!\", said Dot Com.",

It just has \"4X\" on it.\"\n\nAt this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it.  He was laughing too hard.  The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and  snapped it off in the drive.\n\n\nAnother IBM customer had trouble installing software and rang for support.  \"I put in the first disk, and that was OK.  It said to\nput in the second disk, and I had some problems with the disk.

The instructions said to remove the disk from its cover and insert it into the drive.  The user had physically removed the casing of the disk and wondered why there were problems.  Say no more...",

        "joke": "A peek into the thoughts of computer techs worldwide ...an end user's guide to technical services.\n\nWhen a tech says he's coming right over, log out\nand go for coffee. It's no problem for us to remember 2700 network passwords.\n\nWhen you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby pictures, stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies and Popsicle art. We don't have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch a fleeting glimpse of yours.\n\nWhen tech support sends you an e-mail with high importance, delete it at once. We're probably just testing out the public groups.\n\nWhen a tech is eating lunch at his desk, walk right in and spill your guts out and expect him to respond immediately. We exist only to serve and are always ready to think about fixing computers.\n\nWhen a tech is at the water cooler or outside having a smoke, ask him a computer question. The only reason why we drink water or smoke at all is to ferret out all those users who don't have eMail or a telephone line.\n\nSend urgent eMail ALL IN UPPERCASE. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.\n\nWhen you call a tech's direct line, press 5 to skip the bilingual greeting that says he's out of town for a week, record your message, and wait exactly 24 hours before you send an eMail straight to the director because no one ever returned your call. You're entitled to common courtesy.\n\nWhen the photocopier doesn't work, call computer\nsupport.  There's electronics in it, right?\n\nWhen you're getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call computer support. We can even fix telephone problems from here.\n\nWhen something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on a tech's chair with no name, no phone number, and no description of the problem. We love a good mystery.\n\nWhen you have a tech on the phone walking you through changing a setting; read the paper. We don't actually mean for you to DO anyhing; we just love to hear ourselves talk.\n\nWhen we offer training on the upcoming OS upgrade, don't bother. We'll be there to hold your hand after it is done. \n\nWhen the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20 times. Print jobs frequently just disappear into the cosmos for no reason.\n\nWhen the printer still won't print after 20 tries, send the job to all 68 printers in the office. One of them is bound to work.\n\nDon't use online help. Online help is for wimps.\n\nIf you're taking night classes in computer science, feel free to go around and update the network drivers for you and all your coworkers.  We're grateful for the overtime when we have to stay until 2:30am fixing them.\n\nWhen you have a tech fixing your computer at a quarter past one, eat your lunch in his face. We function better when slightly dizzy.\n\nDon't ever thank us. We love this AND we get paid for it!\n\nWhen a tech asks you whether you've installed any new software on this computer, lie. It's nobody's business what you've got on your computer.\n\nIf the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse cables were designed to have 45 lbs. of computer sitting on top of them.\n\nIf the space bar on your keyboard doesn't work, blame it on the mail upgrade. Keyboards work much better with half a pound of muffin crumbs, nail clippings, and big sticky drops of Coke under the keys.\n\nWhen you get the message saying \"Are you sure?\", click on that Yes button as fast as you can.  Hell, if you weren't sure, you wouldn't be doing it, would you?\n\nFeel perfectly free to say things like \"I don't know nothing about that computer crap\".  It never bothers us to hear our area of professional expertise referred to as crap.\n\nWhen you need to change the toner cartridge, call tech support. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only by a professional engineer with a Master's degree in nuclear physics.\n\nWhen something's the matter with your computer, ask your secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of having to deal with a third party who doesn't know anything about the problem.\n\nWhen you receive a 30-meg movie file, send it to everyone as a high-priority mail attachment. We've got plenty of disk space and processor capacity on that mail server.\n\nDon't even think of breaking large print jobs down into smaller chunks.  God forbid somebody else might get a chance to squeeze into the queue.\n\nWhen you bump into a tech in the grocery store on a Saturday, ask a computer question. We work 24/7, even while at the grocery store on weekends.\n\nIf your son is a student in computer science, have him come in on the weekends and do his projects on your office computer. We'll be there for you when his illegal copy of Visual Basic 6.0 makes your Access database flip out.\n\nWhen you bring us your own no-brand home PC to repair for free at the office, tell us how urgently we need to fix it so your son can get back to playing DOOM.  We'll get right on it because we have so much free time at the office.  Everybody knows all we do is surf the Internet all day anyway.",

        "joke": "New York -- People for Ethical Treatment of Software (PETS) announced today that seven more software companies have been added to the group's \"watch list\" of companies that regularly practice software testing.\n\n\"There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so that companies like these can market new products,\" said Ken Grandola, spokesperson for PETS. \"Alternative methods of testing these products are available.\"\n\nAccording to PETS, these companies force software to undergo lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest, for hours or days at a time. Employees are assigned to \"break\" the software by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they often joke\nabout \"torturing\" the software.\n\n\"It's no joke,\" said Grandola. \"Innocent programs, from the day they are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and \"crashed\" for hours on end. They spend their whole lives on dirty, ill-maintained computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when they're not needed anymore.\"\n\nGrandola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs.\n\n\"We know that alternatives to this horror exist,\" he said, citing industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has become successful without resorting to software testing.",

        "joke": "Q. My shift keys have little arrows on them. Does that mean the *real* shift keys are located above them, and these keys are just little signs to point them out?\n\nA. Nope, they're the Real McCoy. The little arrows mean \"up\", as in \"look up at the screen\". Your keyboard is telling you to learn to touch type and quit staring at your fingers.\n\nQ. What happens if I press both shift keys?\n\nA. Even bigger letters may show up on your screen. You should not use this feature, however, because these letters are also brighter, and may cause Screen Burn-In, which would be particularly embarrassing if you were typing something naughty at the time. You might consider obtaining the author's Shift Key Burn-In Protector program for only $139.95. Or you might not, it's your computer, but don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nQ. my religion prohibits the use of shift keys. how can i type capital letters and punctuation\n\nA. Discuss alternatives to the shift key with your spiritual advisor. Perhaps your deity would not be angered by repeated use of the Caps Lock key, or maybe you can retain a consultant to depress the shift for you.\n\nYou might also consider replacing punctuation marks that require the use of shift keys with lower case expressions; replace ? with \"huh\" and ! with \"zowie\".\n\nQ> I PRESSED SHIFT AND IT\"S STUCK DOWN NOW>\n\nA. Do small children with a fondness for peanut butter use your keyboard frequently? If so, you may want to clean it off for more reliable operation. First, disconnect your keyboard by gripping each of its ends firmly and pulling as hard as you can. Next, immerse the keyboard in warm water and scrub thoroughly with your favorite lemon-scented detergent and lots of steel wool. Finally, you need to dry the keyboard. Either dry it to touch with a handheld blowdryer, or place it in the dryer for not less than 60 minutes. Be sure to clean the lint screen when you are finished.\n\nQ. Why are there are no \"shift\" keys on my keyboard, but there are two keys labelled \"hif\"?\n\nA. Again, you may want to consider cleaning your keyboard, and washing your hands more frequently for that matter.\n\nQ. Are there shift keys on my Macintosh?\n\nA. Yes, although instead of the notation \"shift\", the key may be labelled with an excited Mac face, something like :O . Press this key to use shift, and be thankful you're using a friendly Mac instead of a mean old PC with all them confusin' words 'n stuff on it.\n\nQ. I'm sick of pushing the shift key every single time I want big letters. Is there any other way to do this?\n\nA. This is the Modern Age of Convenience, and you may be able to activate the shift key merely with the power of your voice! Check to see whether your computer is equipped with speech-recognition equipment by saying the word \"shift\" very clearly and slowly into its speaker. Then watch the keyboard closely to see if the Shift key moves down. Note that you may have to repeat this action several times to \"train\" the computer to recognise your voice before the feature works reliably.\n\nQ. There are two shift keys, which should I use?\n\nA. Avoid unnecessary wear on either shift key by alternating between the two. Keep track of your usage of each key so that you press them in equal amounts. Your keyboard may be equipped with a small notepad; you should use this to make little tally marks in two columns for each time you shift. Remember, it's better to go to a little trouble than wind up with a broken shift key.\n\nQ. Why are the shift keys bigger than the other keys?\n\nA. They aren't. This is simply an optical illusion. Just as the moon appears much larger when it is close to the horizon, your shift keys look larger because of their proximity to other keys. To verify this, go out in a large field at night with your keyboard, place it in an upright position, and view it from a distance of 200 yards. Sure enough, the keys all look the same size!\n\nQ. If I press the shift key at the wrong time, or too many times, will my computer explode?\n\nA. No. Well, generally no. Not unless you are using a NEC laptop. Or vt100 terminal emulation. But even then, hardly ever. Really, don't worry about it. Forget I mentioned it. Just type softly. Move along, next question.\n\nQ. No matter what I do, the shift key just doesn't seem to work. What's wrong?\n\nA. Have you ever considered that the problem may not be your keyboard, the problem may be YOU? Perhaps God Himself has suspended the operation of these keys to send you a Message that you have strayed from the path of righteousness. Use this as an opportunity to reflect on your life. Before rushing blindly ahead with a lot of shifting, consult the spiritual advisor of your choice for help in dealing with any unresolved issues in your relationship with the Almighty.",

As a\npublic service, we present the following list of \"I Love You\"\nvariations and how to recognize them:\n\nThe \"I Love You, Too\" virus: Responds with an appropriate letter\nstating that the user loves you as well.  Spreads peace and harmony\nthroughout the corporate workplace, causing lost productivity and\nchaos on Wall Street as no one tries to screw anyone else out of\na deal.\n\nThe \"I Love You, But I'm Shy\" virus never actually invades your\ncomputer but collects data about it worshipfully from afar.\n\nThe \"Unrequited Love\" virus causes your computer to be so obsessed with a virus-a virus that it can never have-that it can no longer function.\n\nThe \"Love The One You're With\" virus hangs around your computer, but the whole thing is just temporary until it can find the computer that it really wants to invade.\n\nThe \"Can't We Just Be Friends\" virus makes your computer think it's interested in invading. Then, just when your computer is getting excited about the invasion, it breaks off the connection with your computer, dashing its hard drive against the rocks.\n\nThe \"I'm looking for more of a commitment\" virus - Receives the \"I love you\" virus email and immediately schedules a recurring event called \"hold for my sweetie\" for Friday and Saturdays into your calendar and the calendar of the person who sent the mail, registers you for a year of pre-paid videos at Blockbuster.com, and deletes any appointments called \"Golf with the guys\" or \"Night out with the Girls.\"  It also erases the phone number from the contact card for your 'ex', and puts in a monthly reminder for the anniversary of your first date.\n\nThe \"One Night Stand\" virus invades your computer, turns its hard drive upside down, then disappears after promising to come back sometime. But it leaves a twenty in your online bank account.\n\nThe \"Happily Married\" virus invades only one computer and stays with it for life.\n\nThe \"Unhappily Married\" virus spends a long time negotiating with a computer, finally invades it, and then strays to other computers from time to time.\n\nThe \"I Can't Commit\" virus hangs around a computer for a long time and frequently sends messages that it intends to invade, but is really just interested in playing with your computer's data.\n\nThe \"It's Just A Physical Thing\" virus invades your computer on a regular basis, but no meaningful data is ever exchanged.\n\nThe \"I Want A Divorce\" virus sends repeated, hard-to-read messages that your computer is never turned on, then finally leaves. But it returns some time later and takes half of your computer's best data in an ugly network session.\n\nThe \"Little Virus Of The Evening\" virus will do anything to your computer--if you're willing to pay the right price.\n\nThe \"Stalker\" virus spends unnatural amounts of time monitoring your computer, collecting data your computer has thrown away and trying to record its most intimate functions.\n\nThe \"Forever Single\" virus causes your computer to focus solely on other computers that are totally incompatible with it.\n\nThe \"Deadbeat Dad\" virus invades your computer, spawns an entirely new database, then refuses to help update it as it grows.\n\nThe \"Married Too Long\" virus splits your PC into two partitions that never interface-one that does too much online shopping and one that never does anything except monitor espn.com. -- This message is done on 100% recycled electrons.\n\nThe \"Let's just be friends\" virus - Immediately deletes the \"I\nlove you\" virus, sends a \"Let's Just be friends\" response, and\nbooks you for a discount weekend at Hedonism at an online travel\nsite.\n\nThe \"Unsafe Sex\" virus - Spreads unprotected files to every other hard disk on the net.\n\nThe \"Safe Sex\" virus - Wraps the \"I Love You letter\" in a container that keeps it from spreading 99.45% of the time.\n\nThe \"Sexual Harassment Lawsuit\" virus - Forwards a copy of the \"I Love You\" virus to Human Resources and to your lawyer with threatening legal language attached.

        "joke": "Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned \ntwo of his advisors for a test.  He showed them both a shiny metal \nbox with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever.  \"What \ndo you think this is?\"\n     \nOne advisor, an engineer, answered first. \"It is a toaster,\" he \nsaid. The king asked, \"How would you design an embedded computer \nfor it?\" The engineer replied, \"Using a four-bit microcontroller,\nI would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and \nquantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow \nwhite to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as \nthe index to a 16-element table of initial timer values.  Then it \nwould turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the \ninitial value selected from the table.  At the end of the time \ndelay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back \nnext week, and I'll show you a working prototype.\"\n     \nThe second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized \nthe danger of such short-sighted thinking.  He said, \"Toasters \ndon't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen \nwaffles.  What you see before you is really a breakfast food \ncooker.  As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, \nthey will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food\ncooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled \neggs.  A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete.  If \nwe don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign \nthe toaster in just a few years.\"\n     \n\"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem.  First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses:  grains, pork, and poultry.  The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, \nhard-boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet \nclasses.\"\n     \n\"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance.  At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.'  The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.\"\n     \n\"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has \nrevealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of \nbreakfast food.  In the design phase, we have discovered some \nderived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented \nlanguage with multiple inheritance.  Of course, users don't want \nthe eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent \nprocessing is required, too.\"\n     \n\"We must not forget the user interface.  The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing.  Users  won't buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface.  When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen.  Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v. 8.3' appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 \nshould be out by the time the product gets to the market.)  Users \ncan pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook.\"\n     \n\"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase.  An Intel Pentium with 16MB of memory, a 160MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be \nsufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language\nthat supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing \nthe program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have \nhad if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to\nlock us into a four-bit microcontroller!).\"\n     \nThe king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all \nlived happily ever after.",

She became very embarrassed over the phone and pleaded that she could never reveal her secret.  I of course replied that I would not give her system access until she did.  After negotiating for several minutes she finally acquiesced but made me promise to never reveal her password meaning to any of her colleagues to which I gladly agreed.\n\n\"Well,  what does it mean?\", I asked.\n\nShe hesitated and then replied, \"It's two words.\"\n\nThere was pregnant pause.

        "joke": "QUESTION: Where do the characters go when I use my backspace or delete them on my computer?\n\nANSWER: The characters go to different places, depending on whom you ask:\n\nThe Catholic Church's approach to characters: The nice characters go to Heaven, where they are bathed in the light of happiness. The naughty characters are punished for their sins. Naughty characters are those involved in the creation of naughty words, such as \"breast,\" \"sex\" and \"contraception.\"\n\nThe Buddhist explanation: If a character has lived rightly, and its karma is good, then after it has been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character. Those funny characters above the numbers on your keyboard will become numbers, numbers will become letters, and lower-case letters will become upper-case.\n\nThe 20th-century bitter cynical nihilist explanation: Who cares? It doesn't really matter if they're on the page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same.\n\nThe Mac user's explanation: All the characters written on a PC and then deleted go to straight to PC hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters, because you're in PC hell also.\n\nStephen King's explanation: Every time you hit the (Del) key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor, who tears the poor unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all. Hah, hah, hah!\n\nDave Barry's explanation: The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so flammable, while cheap imitations are not flammable. I'm not making this up.\n\nIBM's explanation: The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them. Get a life. \n\nPETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) explanation: You've been DELETING them??? Can't you hear them SCREAMING??? Why don't you go CLUB some BABY SEALS while wearing a MINK, you pig!!!!\n\n- Joel Garreau ([email\u00a0protected]), as reported in his Cybersurfing column in the Washington Post",

        "joke": "I had run across the term cyber sex a few times lately, so I\ndecided to try to figure out what it meant.  I figured it had\nsomething to do with the computer, so I started trying to find\nthe sex drive on mine.  I looked everywhere, in all the folders\non the My Computer section, the add/uninstall software,\ninstall hardware part of the control panel, then I got out all the\nmanuals and went through them.  I finally came to the conclusion\nthat my computer is not equipped with one.\n\nSo, I decided to go to the computer store and see if  I could buy\none.  I wanted to look intelligent and scholarly, so I wore my math\nhat.  Well, the salesperson in the first store was a rather stern\nlooking woman.  I gave her the make and model of my computer\nand asked her  if she had any sex drives in stock.  She kinda\nscowled at me and asked me if I was trying to get smart with her.\nFiguring she had been impressed with my math hat, I replied that\nI tried to be smart with everyone. She said, rather rudely I thought, that she couldn't help me and walked away......huh, must not have had any in stock.\n\nIn the second store, I gave the salesperson the make and model of\nmy computer and asked it they had any sex drives in stock.  He kind\nof snickered and asked if I meant a hard drive. I thought about it for a minute and told him yeah, maybe that, but I think I should already have one installed. He started laughing at me - said something about me trying to kill him.  You're killing me!  something like that, and walked away.  Hmmmm, must be out here too. Must be hard to keep in stock.  I wasn't trying to kill him. I wasn't even hurting him. \n\nThe guy in the third store laughed and asked me if I'd just fallen off the turnip truck.  I assured him I'd never been on a turnip truck, but I'd fallen off the manure wagon a few times.  He mumbled something about that explaining it.  She's fallen off the wagon, that explains it.... like that and walked away laughing.\n\nThe guy in the fourth store said something like 'Whatta boob' under his breath and walked away.  Wonder why he only noticed one?  Anyway I figured they must not carry them in stores....maybe have to order from a catalog or something.\n\nSo that's where I am now.  If any of you have some computer skills and could help me locate my sex drive, I would appreciate it, then all I'd have to do is figure out what to do with it.",

Each charge  nurse will be issued a .38 caliber revolver and 12 rounds  of ammunition.  An additional 12 rounds will be stored in pharmacy.\n\nIn addition to routine nursing duties, charge nurses will  rotate the\npatrolling of the hospital grounds.  A bicycle  and helmet will be\nprovided for patrolling the parking  areas.  In light of the\nsimilarity of monitoring equipment,  ICU will now take over the\nsecurity surveillance duties.   The ward clerk will be responsible for\nwatching cardiac  monitors and security monitors as well as regular\nduties.\n\nFood service will be discontinued.  Patients wishing to be  fed will\nneed to let their families know to bring something  or may make\narrangements with Subway or Pizza Hut to  deliver.  Coin operated\ntelephones will be available in  patient rooms for this purpose as\nwell as for other calls  the patient may wish to make.\n\nHousekeeping and Physical Therapy will be combined.  Mops  will be\nissued to those patients who are ambulatory, thus  providing range of\nmotion exercises as well as a clean  environment.  Families and\nambulatory patients may also  sign up to clean the rooms of non-\nambulatory patients for  special discounts on their final bill.  Time\ncards will be  provided.\n\nAs you can see on the \"from\" line above, hospital administration is\nassuming the grounds keeping duties.   If an administrator cannot be\nreached by calling his/her  office, it is suggested that you walk\noutside and listen  for the sound of a lawnmower, weed-whacker, etc.\n\nMaintenance is being eliminated.  The hospital has  subscribed to the\nTime-Life \"How to...\" series of maintenance books.  These can be\nchecked out from  administration, and a toolbox will be standard\nequipment on  all nursing units.  We will be receiving the series at a\nrate of one volume every other month.  We already have the  volume on\n\"Basic Wiring\", but if a non-electrical problem  occurs, please try to\nhandle it as best you can until the  appropriate volume arrives.\n\nCutbacks in phlebotomy staff will be accommodated by only  performing\nblood-related tests on patients who are already  bleeding.\n\nPhysicians will be informed that they may order no more than two X-\nrays per patient stay.  This is due to the turn-around time required\nby Photomat.  Two prints will be provided for the price of one, and\nphysicians are being advised to clip coupons from the Sunday paper if\nthey want extra sets.\n\nPhotomat will also honor competitors coupons for one-hour  processing\nin emergency situations so if you come across any extra coupons please\nclip out and send these to ER.\n\nIn view of the hot summer temperatures, the Utilities Dept. has been\nasked to install individual meters in each patient  room, office,\netc., so that electrical consumption can be  monitored and\nappropriately billed.  Fans will be available  for sale or lease in\nthe hospital gift shop.\n\nIn addition to the current recycling programs, a bin for  collection\nof unused fruit and bread will soon be provided  on each floor.\nFamilies, patients, and the few remaining  employees are asked to\ncontribute discarded produce.   Pharmacy will utilize this for\nantibiotic production.   These will be available for purchase and,\ncoincidentally,  will soon be the only antibiotics on our HMO's\nformulary.",

        "joke": "For Christmas this year my wife purchased me a week of private lessons at the local health club. Though still in great shape from when I was on the varsity chess team in high school, I decided it was a good idea to go ahead and try it.\n\nI called and made reservations with someone named Tanya, who said she is a 26-year-old aerobics instructor and athletic clothing model. My wife seemed very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get started.\n\nDay 1\nThey suggest I keep this \"exercise diary\" to chart my progress this\nweek.\n\nStarted the morning at 6:00 AM. Tough to get up, but worth it when I arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me. She's something of a goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile. She showed  me the machines and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She seemed a little alarmed that it\nwas so high, but I think just standing next to her in that outfit of hers added ten points.\n\nEnjoyed watching the aerobics class. Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though my gut was already aching a little from holding it in the whole time I was talking to her. This is going to be GREAT!\n\nDay 2\nTook a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it. Tanya had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the air. Then she put weights on it, for heaven's sake! Legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made it the full mile. Her smile made it all worth it. Muscles\nfeel GREAT!!\n\nDay 3\nThe only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the tooth brush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I am certain that I have developed a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was okay as long as I didn't try to steer. I parked on top of a Volkswagen.\nTanya was a little impatient with me and said my screaming was bothering the other club members. The treadmill hurt my chest so I did the stair monster. Why would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by the invention of elevators? Tanya told me regular exercise would make me\nlive longer. I can't imagine anything worse.\n\nDay 4\nTanya was waiting for me with her vampire teeth in a full snarl. I can't help it if I was half an hour late, it took me that long just to tie my shoes. She wanted me to lift dumbbells. Not a chance, Tanya. The word \"dumb\" must be in there for a reason. I hid in the men's room until she sent Lars looking\nfor me. As punishment she made me try the rowing machine. It sank.\n\nDay 5\nI hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. If there was any part of my body not in extreme pain I would hit her with it. She thought it would be a good idea to work on my triceps. Well I have news for you Tanya, I don't have triceps. And if\nyou don't want dents in the floor don't hand me any barbells.\n\nI refuse to accept responsibility for the damage, YOU went to sadist school, YOU are to blame. The treadmill flung me back into a science teacher, which hurt like crazy. Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like a music teacher, or social studies?\n\nDay 6\nGot Tanya's message on my answering machine, wondering where I am. I lacked the strength to use the TV remote so I watched eleven straight hours of the weather channel\n\nDay 7\nWell, that's the week. Thank God that's over. Maybe next time my wife will give me something a little more fun, like a free upper-colon exam or gum surgery.",

For those us who have never had any success dieting, well, now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet!\n \nExcept for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). The Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you'll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what constitutes food.  Good Luck!\n \nDAY ONE\n \nBreakfast:  Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more the .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room.\nLunch:  Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house.\nDinner:  Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.\nBedtime snack:  Steal one green bean from your spouse's or partner's plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning.\n \nDAY TWO\n \nBreakfast:  Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it.\nLunch:  Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf.\nAfternoon snack:  Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed.\nDinner:  Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room.\n \nDAY THREE\n \nBreakfast:  Drink part of the milk from your spouse's or partner's cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find.\nLunch:  Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with.\nDinner:  Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own.  Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor.\n \nFINAL DAY\n \nBreakfast:  Eat 6 bugs, any type, being sure to leave a collection of legs, wings, antennae on the bathroom floor. Drink lots of water. Throw the bugs and all of the water up on your spouse's or partner's pillow.\nLunch:  Remove the chicken skin from last night's chicken-to-go leftovers your spouse or partner placed in the trash can. Drag the skin across the floor several times. Chew it in a corner and then abandon.\nDinner:  Open another can of expensive gourmet cat food. Select a flavor that is especially runny, like Chicken and Giblets in Gravy. Lick off all the gravy and leave the actual meat to dry and get hard.",

Luckily, none of us got drowned\nbecause we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it\nhappened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK.\nHe can't write because of the cast.  I got to ride in one of the\nsearch & rescue jeeps. It was neat.  We never would have found him in\nthe dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.\n\nScoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without\ntelling anyone.  Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the\nfire so he probably didn't hear him.  Did you know that if you put\ngas on a fire, the gas can will blow up?  The wet wood still didn't\nburn, but one of our tents did.  Also some of our clothes. John is\ngoing to look weird until his hair grows back.\n\nWe will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed.\nIt wasn't his fault about the wreck.  The brakes worked OK when we\nleft. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect\nsomething to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance\non it.  We think it's a neat car.  He doesn't care if we get it\ndirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate.\nIt gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car.  He let us take turns\nriding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked\nto us.\n\nScoutmaster Webb is a neat guy.  Don't worry, he is a good driver.\nIn fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive.  But he only lets him\ndrive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic.  All we\never see up there are logging trucks.\n\nThis morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming\nout in the lake.  Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't\nswim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let\nus take the canoe across the lake.  It was great.  You can still see\nsome of the trees under the water from the flood.  Scoutmaster Webb\nisn't crabby like some scoutmasters.  He didn't even get mad about\nthe life jackets.\n\nHe has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not\nto cause him any trouble.  Guess what?  We have all passed our first\naid merit badges.  When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got\nto see how a tourniquet works.  Also Wade and I threw up.\nScoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the\nleftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they\nate in prison.  I'm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster.\nHe said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he\nwas doing his time.\n\nI have to go now.

        "joke": "There was a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and elegant, especially in language.  She and her husband were planning a week's vacation  in Florida, so she wrote to a campground and asked for a reservation. She wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped, but didn't know how to ask about the toilet facilities.  She just could not bring herself to write the word \"toilet\" in her letter. After much deliberation, she finally came up with the term \"bathroom commode\". But after writing that down, she still thought she was being too forward, so  she rewrote the entire letter and referred to the \"bathroom commode\" merely as the \"BC\". \"Does the campground have its own BC?\" is what she actually wrote. Well, the campground owner wasn't\nold-fashioned at all and when he got the letter, he just couldn't figure what the woman was talking about. That \"BC\" business really stumped him.  He showed the letter to several people, but they couldn't imagine what the lady meant either. So the campground owner finally came to the conclusion that the lady must be asking about the location\nof the nearest Baptist Church, sat down and wrote the following reply:\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI regret the delay in answering your letter, but I now take the pleasure of informing you that a BC is located 9 miles north of the campground and is capable of seating 250 people at one time.  It is located in a beautiful pine grove and is open only on Sundays and Wednesdays. I admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly, but no doubt you will be pleased to know that many people take their lunch along and make a day of it. They usually arrive early and stay late. My daughter met her husband in the BC.\n\nSometimes it is so crowded there are five to a seat. It may interest you to know that right now there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more seats. They are going to hold it in the basement of the BC. It pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly, but it is surely not due to a lack of desire on my part.  As we grow older, it\nseems to be more of an effort, particularly in cold weather. If you decide to come to our campground, perhaps I could go with you the first time you go and sit with you and introduce you to all the other folks. We will be sure to get a seat up front where you can be seen by everyone. Remember, we are a friendly community.\n\nSincerely, the Campground Owner.",

        "joke": "Even if you aren't a skier, you'll be able to appreciate the humor of the\nslopes as written in this account by a New Orleans paper.\n\n\nA friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Utah with the kind of story\nthat warms the cockles of anybody's heart. Conditions were perfect, 12 below,\nno feeling in the toes, basic numbness all over, the \"tell me when we're\nhaving fun\" kind of day.\n\nOne of the women in the group complained to her husband that she was in dire\nneed of a restroom. He told her not to worry that he was sure there was relief\nwaiting at the top of the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers\nin distress. He was wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away.\n\nIf you've ever had nature hit its panic button in you, then you know that\na temperature of 12 below zero doesn't help matters. So, with time running\nout, the woman weighed her options.\n\nHer husband, picking up on the intensity of her pain, suggested that since\nshe was wearing an all white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods.\nNo one would even notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than\nadequate camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and\nproceeded to do her thing. If you've ever parked on the side of a slope,\nthen you know there is a right way and a wrong way to set your skis so you\ndon't move. Yup, you got it. She had them positioned the wrong way.\n\n\nSteep slopes are not forgiving, even during embarrassing moments. Without\nwarning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out of control, racing\nthrough the trees, somehow missing all of them and onto another slope. Her\nderriere and her reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her\nknees, and she was picking up speed all the while.\n\nShe continued on backwards, totally out of control, creating an unusual vista\nfor the other skiers.\n\nThe woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back under the lift, and\nfinally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was that she broke\nher arm and was unable to pull up her ski pants. At long last her husband\narrived, putting an end to her nudie show, then went to the base of the mountain\nand summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital.\n\nIn the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with an obviously broken\nleg was put in the bed next to hers.\n\n\"So how'd you break your leg?\" she asked, making small talk.\n\n\"It was the damnedest thing you ever saw,\" he said, \"I was riding up this ski\nlift, and suddenly I couldn't believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman\nskiing backward out of control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging\nout of her clothes and her pants down around her knees. I leaned over to\nget a better look and I guess I didn't realize how far I'd moved. I fell\nout of the lift.\"\n\n\"So how'd you break your arm?\"",

Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:\n\n\"There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane...\"\n\n\"We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to the wing of the airplane.\n\n\"Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately.\"\n\nPilot - \"Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.\"\n\nAnd, after landing: \"Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.\"\n\nAs we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross in\nfront of us, some of the passengers were beginning to retrieve luggage from the overhead bins. The head attendant announced on the intercom, \"This aircraft is equipped with a video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during taxiing. Any passengers not remaining in their seats until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be strip-searched as they leave the aircraft.\"\n\nAs the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: \"Whoa, big fella. WHOA!\"\n\nAfter a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: \"Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.\"\n\nFrom a Southwest Airlines employee.... \"Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more.\n\n\"Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines.\"\n\n\"Your seat cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.\"\n\nOnce on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, \"We've reached our cruising altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign. I'm switching to autopilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest of the flight.\"\n\n\"Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose\nbefore assisting children or adults acting like children.\"\n\n\"As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.\"\n\n\"Last one off the plane must clean it.\"\n\nAnd from the pilot during his welcome message: \"We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry... Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!\n\nHeard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, \"That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants' fault.....it was the asphalt!\"\n\nOverheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!\"\n\nAnother flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: \"We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.\"\n\nAn airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a \"Thanks for flying XYZ airline.\" He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, \"Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?\" \"Why no Ma'am,\" said the pilot, \"what is it?\" The little old lady said, \"Did we land or were we shot down?\"\n\nAfter a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant\ncame on with, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.\n\nPart of a Flight Attendant's arrival announcement: \"We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.\"",

How many gallons would you like?\n\nCustomer: Five gallons of regular quality, please.\n\nClerk: Great. That will be $60 plus tax.\n\nBUYING PAINT FROM AN AIRLINE\n\nCustomer: Hi, how much is your paint?\n\nClerk: Well, sir, that all depends.\n\nCustomer: Depends on what?\n\nClerk: Actually, a lot of things.\n\nCustomer: How about giving me an average price?\n\nClerk: Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon, and we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon.\n\nCustomer: What's the difference in the paint?\n\nClerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.\n\nCustomer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint.\n\nClerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you intend to use it?\n\nCustomer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off.\n\nClerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.\n\nCustomer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 version?\n\nClerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday.\n\nCustomer: You've got to be kidding!\n\nClerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to check to see if we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to you.\n\nCustomer: What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to me? You have shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there.\n\nClerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It may be the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.\n\nCustomer: You mean the price went up while we were talking!\n\nClerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to happen again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons do you want?\n\nCustomer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy six gallons just to make sure I have enough.\n\nClerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then don't use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have.\n\nCustomer: What?\n\nClerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will be in violation of our tariffs.\n\nCustomer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it!\n\nClerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it is. We make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, and when you don't, it just causes us all sorts of problems.\n\nCustomer: This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!\n\nClerk: Yes, sir, it will.\n\nCustomer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint.\n\nClerk: That won't do you any good, sir. We all have the same rules. Thanks for painting with our airline.",

In that micro-second, Sara climbed onto\nthe table, poked her paw into the delightfully kneady mixture and, suddenly\noff-balance, fell into the cookie dough.  Net loss?  Six cups of flour, four\ncups of sugar, three sticks of butter.  Of course, it would have been cheaper\nto remove the feline ingredient, pick out the hairs, and just rename the\nrecipe Paw Print Cookies.\n\nOn the second day of Christmas, my kitten accompanied me...\nOn a trip to the vet clinic.  Who knew that skinny curling ribbon has feline\ntaste appeal?  I didn't.  Damages:  $28 for the office visit, $36 for\nanesthesia so the veterinarian could take $55 X-rays in case Sara had\ntaste-tested any other Christmas decorations, and a heck of a lot of\nembarrassment when the vet removed the 3\" curly tail in slightly less than\ntwo seconds by tugging at it with a pair of tweezers.\n\nOn the third day of Christmas, my kitten wrecked for me...\n13 ornaments on my Christmas tree.  My mistake was forgetting to chain the\ndecorations to the branches.  My other error was leaving the room to go to\nthe bathroom while Sara feigned sleeping under the tree.  How was I to know\nshe was actually measuring its climbing potential?  Value of broken bulbs?\n$7.50 plus tax. \n\nOn the fourth day of Christmas, my kitten broke for me...\nA statue in my Lenox Nativity.

It was an accident. She\nmerely wanted to reach out and touch someone.  Unfortunately, she used an\nunsheathed claw to do so.  I settled out-of-court for the cost of a jacket to\nreplace the boy's blood stained one and a hefty donation to the charity of\ntheir choice.  Although the amount must remain secret according to our\nsettlement, let me put it this way.  You haven't seen many soldiers for the\nSalvation Army this year, have you?

While\ndoing some early shopping at a discount store, I purchased a catnip mouse for\nSara's stocking.  Apparently, anything in the same bag as catnip takes on its\npotent aroma for a very long time.  Replacement costs:  $3.99 for another\nroll of Christmas wrapping paper, $4.50 for two empty boxes, $1 each for the\nkind of bows Sara can't unravel.\n\nOn the seventh day of Christmas, my kitten lost for me...\nThe earrings I bought for my sister Mary.  Actually, it was one earring but\nsince Mary doesn't have a hole in her nose or navel, a pair of matching\nearrings does make a more appealing gift.  Sale price:  $29.95 plus tax.\n\nOn the eighth day of Christmas, my kitten helped me...\nReplace my E and G guitar strings.  Would you believe a kitten could fit into\nthe itty-bitty hole in the middle of my Yamaha guitar?  Neither could I,but\nSara thought so.  And she succeeded once she got those rascally strings out\nof the way.  Unfortunately, her little rear end couldn't get out the way it\nwent in.  After paying through the whiskers for her previous escapades,I\nwould have been willing to leave her in the guitar for the duration ofthe\nholiday season, except that she chose to get stuck two hours before I was due\nat the nursing home for our annual Christmas carol sing-a-long.  Set of steel\nguitar strings:  $12.95; jar of petroleum jelly:  79 cents.\n\nOn the ninth day of Christmas, my kitten destroyed for me...\nMy Christmas card list when she walked across my computer's delete key. Cost\nfor call to Computer Country's 900/help line:  $17.50.  And I still don't\nknow what happened to the listings of B through H.\n\nOn the tenth day of Christmas, my kitten hid from me.....\nThe remote control from my 13-inch TV.  This wouldn't be such a disaster if\nshe hadn't previously stolen the power knob.  I missed a week's worth of\nChristmas specials, including my all-time favorite, \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\nRental of \"It's a Wonderful Life\":  $2; purchase of book, \"Good Owners, Great\nCats\":  $24.95.  Unfortunately, it never mentions the psychological profile\nof kittens with kleptomania.\n\nOn the eleventh day of Christmas, my kitten ate for me.....\nThe drumsticks off my 19-pound turkey.  OK, OK, So this one time it was my\nfault.  I knew I never should have uttered those now infamous words: \"Your\nfirst turkey, Sara.  Want to try just a little piece?\"  Cost:  Christmas Dinner.\n\nOn the 12th day of Christmas........\nSara rested.  And so, thank goodness, did my VISA card.",

I hate to break it to ya', Santa, but it's payback time. There had better be some changes around here, or I'm gonna call for a nationwide meltdown, and trust me, you don't wanna be around to smell it. \n\nThese are my demands for Christmas:\n\nSweat pants and an oversized sweatshirt.  I'm sick of looking like a hooker in hot pink bikinis. Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and Velcro weggies? I don't suppose you do.\n\nReal underwear that can be pulled on and off. That cheap-o molded underwear some genius at Mattel came up with looks like cellulite!\n\nA REAL man... I don't care if you have to go to Hasbro to get him, but BRING ME GI JOE. I'd take Tickle-Me-Elmo over that pathetic bump of a boy toy, Ken. And what was up with that earring anyway? HULLO!?!\n\nIt's about time you made us all anatomically correct. Give me arms that  actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away.\n\nBreast reduction surgery. 'Nuff said.\n\nA sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery.\n\nA new career. Pet doctor and school teacher make real money.\n\nA new, more 90s persona. Maybe \"PMS Barbie,\" complete with a pint of cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips.\n\nNo more McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl complexion.\n\nMattel stock options. It's been 40 years - I think I deserve a piece of the action.\n\nConsidering my valuable contribution to society and Mattel, I think these demands are reasonable. If you don't like it, you can find yourself a new bimbo for next Christmas. It's that simple.\n\nAs ever,\n\nBarbie",

        "joke": "Cat-mas season is here.  This is a wonderful time of year when the humans decorate the home for us cats in anticipation of the visit from Santa Claws. The tree went up yesterday, and so did I.  Made it to the fourth branch within the first five minutes before the Big Owner chased me out of the tree.\n\nSo, as I do every year, I waited and watched the humans decorate the \nCat-mas tree with all sorts of what the humans call \"ornaments.\"  I call them \"cat toys.\"\n\nOrnaments are invitations to a cat, bright and shiny spheres just daring a cat to knock them off.  Every year the humans hang the ornaments a little higher out of my range, forcing me to elevate my game to knock them off. Humans \"ohhh and ahhh\" as they decorate the Cat-mas tree.  I salivate in anticipation of the night's activities.\n\nThe humans retire to bed, as is custom during Cat-mas season, leaving me to play with my tree.  Tonight is a challenge, the ornaments are at an all time high.  I crept under the tree and began to scale branches.  This is great!  A tree in my own home, why don't they do this year-round?  Five, six, seven branches, I climb like a pro.  Ten, twelve, I am half way to the top, and there is the first ornament!  This is easy as Cat-mas fruitcake.\n\nI make my way down the branch approaching the first ornament.  It lightly jiggles as my weight causes the bough to bend.  Almost there!  One paw away and I feel a shudder.  Something is not right, I begin to lose my balance.  The room is tilting!  No, the room is not tilting, the Cat-mas tree is falling!  It seemed like forever as the tree leaned, then pitched, and finally crashed to the floor in a resounding bang of exploding bulbs, ornaments, and broken limbs.  I quickly extricated myself from the splintered tree just as the Big\nOwner game bursting in snapping on the lights.  There I was, sitting\nnext to the tree, as innocent a look on my face as any other in the household.\n\n\"What happened?\" he growled.  Not a peep from me, I turned and looked at the tree.  \"I guess we hung too many ornaments on one side of the tree,\" I heard him say later as he hoisted the mangled Cat-mas tree back into place.\n\n\"Good answer,\" I thought.  The Big Owner staggered off to bed, and I\nretreated to the living room.  Maybe I'll tear down those stockings that were hung by the chimney with care.\n\nIt was good day.\n\n\nFrom the Cat Diary\nTo Subscribe, email to [email\u00a0protected]\nCopyright 1999 Mark Mason All Rights Reserved",

A beautiful parrot named Chet that sings Christmas carols.\n\nHe brings the husband over to a colorful but quiet bird. The man agrees that Chet certainly is pretty, but he doesn't seem to be much for singing.\n\nThe manager tells him to watch as he reaches into his pocket and pulls\nout a lighter. The manager then clicks the lighter and holds it under\nChet's left foot. Immediately, Chet starts singing; \"Silent Night, Holy\nNight.\"\n\nThe husband is very impressed with Chet's singing abilities and watches as the manager moves the lighter underneath Chet's right foot. Chet now starts to sing \"Jingle Bells, Jingle All the Way.\" \nThe husband says Chet is perfect and that he'll take him. The husband rushes home to his wife and insists upon giving her this wonderful gift immediately. \n\nHe presents Chet and starts to explain the parrot's special talent. Demonstrating, he holds a lighter under Chet's left foot and the bird sings \"Silent Night.\"  He then moves the lighter under the right foot and Chet lets loose a round of \"Jingle Bells.\" The wife is absolutely impressed, and with a mischievous grin asks her husband what happens if he holds the lighter between Chet's legs instead.   Curious, the husband moves the lighter between the bird's legs, and the bird begins to sing...\"Chet's Nuts Roasting on an Open Fire!\"",

        "joke": "Dear Santa,\n\nI rarely ask for much. This year is no exception. I don't\nneed diamond earrings, handy slicer-dicers, or comfy\nslippers. I only want one little thing, and I want it deeply.\nI want to slap Martha Stewart.\n\nNow, hear me out, Santa. I won't scar her or draw blood or\nanything. Just one good smack, right across her smug little\ncheek. I get all cozy inside just thinking about it.\nDon't grant this wish just for me, do it for thousands of\nwomen across the country.\nThrough sheer vicarious satisfaction, you'll be giving a gift to us all.\nThose of us leading average, garden variety lives aren't\nconcerned with gracious living. We feel pretty good about\nourselves if our paper plates match when we stack them on the\ncounter, buffet-style for dinner.\n\nWe're tired of Martha showing us how to make centerpieces\nfrom hollyhock dipped in 18 carat gold. We're plumb out of\nliquid gold. Unless it's of the furniture polish variety.\nWe can't whip up Martha's creamy holiday sauce, spiced with\nturmeric. Most of us can't even say turmeric, let alone\nfigure out what to do with it.\nOK, Santa, maybe you think I'm being a little harsh. But I'll\nbet with all the holiday rush you didn't catch that interview\nwith Martha in USA Weekend. I'm surprised there was enough\nroom on the page for her ego.\n\nWe discovered that not only does Martha avoid take-out pizza\n(she's only ordered it once), she refuses to eat it cold. (No\ncold pizza? Is Martha Stewart Living?) When it was pointed\nout that she could microwave it, she replied, \"I don't have a microwave.\"\nThe reporter, Jeffrey Zaslow, noted that she said this \"in a\ntone that suggests you shouldn't either.\" Well lah-dee-dah. Imagine that, Santa!\n\nThat lovely microwave you brought me years ago, in which I've\nlearned to make complicated dishes like popcorn and hot\nchocolate, has been declared undesirable by Queen Martha.\nWhat next? The coffee maker?\n\nIn the article, we learned that Martha has 40 sets of dishes\nadorning an entire wall in her home. Forty sets. Can you\nspell \"overkill\"? And neatly put away, no less. If my dishes\nmake it to the dishwasher, that qualifies as \"put away\" in my house!\nMartha tells us she's already making homemade holiday gifts\nfor friends. \"Last year, I made amazing silk-lined scarves\nfor everyone,\" she boasts. Not just scarves, mind you.\nAmazing scarves. Martha's obviously not shy about giving\nherself a little pat on the back. In fact, she does so with\nsuch frequency that one has to wonder if her back is black and blue.\n\nShe goes on to tell us that \"homemaking is glamour for the\n'90s\", and says her most glamorous friends are \"interested in\nstain removal, how to iron a monogram, and how to fold a\ntowel.\" I have one piece of advice, Martha: \"Get new friends.\"\nGlamorous friends fly to Paris on a whim. They drift past the\nGreek Islands on yachts, sipping champagne from crystal\ngoblets. They step out for the evening in shimmering satin\ngowns, whisked away by tuxedoed chauffeurs. They do not spend\ntheir days pondering the finer art of toilet bowl sanitation.\n\nZaslow notes that Martha was named one of America's 25 most\ninfluential people by Time magazine (nosing out Mother\nTheresa, Madeline Albright and Maya Angelou, no doubt).\nThe proof of Martha's influence: After she bought\nwhite-fleshed peaches in the supermarket, Martha says,\n\"People saw me buy them. In an instant, they were all gone.\"\nI hope Martha never decides to jump off a bridge.\n\nA guest in Martha's home told Zaslow how Martha gets up early\nto rollerblade with her dogs to pick fresh wild blackberries\nfor breakfast. This confirms what I've suspected about Martha\nall along: She's obviously got too much time on her hands.\nTeaching the dogs to rollerblade. What a show off.\n\nIf you think the dogs are spoiled, listen to how Martha\ntreats her friends: She gave one friend all 272 books from\nthe Knopf Everyman Library. It didn't cost much. Pocket\nchange, really. Just $5,000. But what price friendship, right?\nWhen asked if others should envy her, Martha replies, \"Don't\nenvy me. I'm doing this because I'm a natural teacher. You\nshouldn't envy teachers. You should listen to them.\" Zaslow\nmust have slit a seam in Martha's ego at this point, because\nonce the hot air came hissing out, it couldn't be held back.\n\"Being an overachiever is nothing despicable. It is only\nadmirable. Never lower your standards,\" says Martha. And of\nher Web Page on the Internet, Martha declares herself an\n\"important presence\" as she graciously helps people organize\ntheir sad, tacky little lives.\n\nThere you have it, Santa. If there was ever someone who\ndeserved a good smack, it's Martha Stewart. But I bet I won't\nget my gift this year. You probably want to smack her yourself.\tLove,",

        "joke": "Never give a woman any kind of household appliance or something that is going to make \"housework\" easier.  A few examples: a blender, a toaster, a new vacuum, one of those mops they advertise on TV that does everything but suck the life out of you, anything in a informercial.  The only appliance allowed is a variable-speed vibrator, adjustable to Slow, Medium, and Who Needs A Man.  Another wise choice is a new washing machine with a turbo spin cycle.  Makes laundry day go by pretty fast when you can at least sit on it during spin-dry and end up smiling throughout the evening. In other words, if you must buy her something that plugs in, make sure it gives her the kind of pleasure you never have.\n\nAny bulk cleaning supplies (e.g., \"Honey, I got you that large box of Tide you've been wanting!\" ... \"This Windex should last you a while\" ... \"I got a good deal on the industrial-strength toilet bowl cleaner.\"  All I can say is, be prepared to run (or die a painful death). One more thing: A Chia Pet is NOT a romantic gift.\n\nAny sharp objects made by Ronco which slices or dices, or a set of Ginsu knives.  These may one day be used as a weapon against you when you come home with lipstick on your collar after a \"night out with the boys.\"\n\nDo not buy gifts for yourself and pretend they are for her. \"Honey, I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of the new drill  I bought you.\"  By then she will have put it to good use by drilling a quarter-inch hole into the side of your skull for even thinking she would accept such a lame gift...unless, of course, she's into tools -- in which case, buy the damn drill SHE wants, not the drill YOU want.\n\nAny lingerie made of flannel, such as a pair of feet pajamas with a trap door in back, or a Little Mermaid or Barney cartoon-character nightgown. It gives her the idea that you do not consider her the sexy woman that she is. Take out that wallet and buy her something sexy from Victoria Secret (just like you did for your girlfriend).\n\nNo-name perfume which costs you $1.99, such as Eu de Toilet, which actually smells like the bathroom, a ten-dollar whore or your dirty socks. If you are going to buy her perfume, spring for the brand names.\n\nAny type of cubic zirconia jewelry you see on the Home Shopping Network. It will be quite embarrassing when she is showing off that fabulous diamond to her friends and tries to cut glass with it.  (We do test them, you know.)\n\nDo not buy her clothes because you think for one minute you have good taste in woman's clothing.  Well, perhaps you might if you're a transvestite, but all in all, believe me, she'll smile and say it's beautiful while choking back tears and mumbling under her breath, \"Where the hell would I ever wear this outfit without being arrested for bad\ntaste?\" An additional hint: plaids do not go with stripes (even though you think your golfing outfit looks just fine).  It's a known fact to the rest of the world that that is a taboo.\n\nDo not give her a gift certificate to Jenny Craig or Weight  Watchers. Most men would know better, especially the ones who have learned the correct response to \"Do these pants make me look fat?\"  A better alternative would be to hire a Chippendale dancer as a personal trainer to get her motivated into getting fit.  She'll certainly get a workout\nstretching to the oldies while stuffing dollar bills into his G-string. I'm not sure, but I think that alone burns up 3,500 calories.\n\nLast but not least, never buy a woman anti-wrinkle cream, or \"funny\" novelty books like \"How Not to Be a Bitch Sunday Through Saturday.\" These are not considered gifts, but reasons for seriously injuring the person who bought it --  and just may stand up in court of law as grounds for justifiable homicide.",

I personally have only 3 outfits  which I am forced to mix and match at great length. \n\nMy decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice.\n\nI too would like a change in my career.  Have you ever considered \"Decorator Ken\", \"Beauty Salon Ken\", or \"Out Of Work Actor Ken\"?  In addition, there are several other avenues which could be considered such as:  \"S&M Ken\" , \"Green Lantern Ken\",  \"Circuit  Ken\", \"Bear Ken\", \"Master Ken\".\n\nThese would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open up new markets.\n\nAnd as for Barbie  needing bendable arms so she can \"push me away,\" I need bendable knees so I can kick the bitch to the curb.  Bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations - we've talked about this issue before. \n\nIn closing, I would like to point out that any further concessions to the blond bimbo from hell will result in action being  taken by myself and others.  And Barbie can forget about having Joe - he's  mine... at least that's what he said last night.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKen",

        "joke": "As a joke, my brother used to hang a pair of panty hose over his fireplace before Christmas. He said all he wanted was for Santa to fill them.\n\nWhat they say about Santa checking the list twice must be true because every Christmas morning, although Jay's kids' stockings were overflowed, his poor panty hose hung sadly empty and grew increasingly threadbare.\n\nOne year I decided to make his dream come true. I put on sunglasses and a fake beard and went in search of an inflatable love doll.\n\nOf course, they don't sell those things at Wal-Mart. I had to go to an adult bookstore downtown. If you've never been in an X-rated store, don't go. You'll only confuse yourself.\n\nI was there almost three hours saying things like, \"What does this do?\" \"You're kidding me!\" \"Who owns that?\" \"Do you have their phone number?\"\n\nFinally, I made it to the inflatable doll section.\n\nI wanted to buy a standard, uncomplicated doll suitable for a night of  romance that could also substitute as a passenger in my car so I could use the car pool lane during rush hour.\n\nI'm not sure what a complicated doll is. Perhaps one that is subject to wild mood shifts and using a French accent for no reason at all. (That also describes a few ex-boyfriends.)\n\nFinding what I wanted was difficult. Love dolls come in many different models.\n\nThe top of the line, according to the side of the box, could do things I'd only seen in a book on animal husbandry. I figured the \"vibro-motion\" was a feature Jay could live without, so I settled for Lovable Louise. She was at the bottom of the price scale. To call Louise a \"doll\" took a huge leap of imagination.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, with the help of an old bicycle pump, Louise came to life. My sister-in-law was in on the plan and cleverly left the front door key hidden under the mat. \n\nIn the wee morning hours, long after Santa had come and gone, I snuck into the house and filled the dangling panty hose with Louise's pliant legs and bottom. I also ate some cookies and drank what remained of a glass\nof milk on a nearby tray.\n\nThen I let myself out, went home, and giggled for a couple of hours.\n\nThe next morning my brother called to say that Santa had been to his house and left a present that had made him VERY happy but had left the dog confused. He would bark, start to walk away, then come back and bark some more. I suggested he purchase an inflatable Lassie to set Rover straight.\n\nWe also agreed that Louise should remain in her panty hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came over for the traditional Christmas dinner.\n\nIt seemed like a great idea, except that we forgot that Grandma and Grandpa would be there. My grandmother noticed Louise the moment she walked in the door.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" she asked. My brother quickly explained.  \"It's a doll.\"\n\n\"Who would play with something like that?\" Granny snapped. I had several candidates in mind, but kept my mouth shut. \"Where are her clothes?\" Granny continued. I hadn't seen any in the box, but I kept this information to myself.\n\n\"Boy, that turkey sure smells nice, Gran,\" Jay said, trying to steer her into the dining room.\n\nBut Granny was relentless. \"Why doesn't she have any teeth?\" Again, I could have answered, but why would I? It was Christmas and no one wanted to ride in the back of the ambulance saying, \"Hang on Granny, Hang on!\"\n\nThe dinner went well.\n\nWe made the usual small talk about who had died, who was dying, and who should be killed, when suddenly Louise made a noise that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the morning. Then she lurched from the panty hose, flew around the room twice, and fell in a heap in front of the sofa.\n\nThe cat screamed, I passed cranberry sauce through my nose, and Grandpa ran across the room, fell to his knees, and began administering mouth to mouth resuscitation.\n\nMy brother wet his pants and Granny threw down her napkin, stomped out of the room, and sat in the car.\n\nIt was indeed a Christmas to treasure and remember.",

        "joke": "Hi Erma,\n\nThis perfectly delightful note is being sent on paper I made myself to tell you what I have been up to. Since it snowed last night, I got up early and made a sled with old barn wood and a glue gun. I hand painted it in gold leaf, got out my loom, and made a blanket in peaches and mauves. Then to make the sled complete, I made a white horse to pull it, from DNA that I had just sitting around in my craft room.\n\nBy then, it was time to start making the place mats and napkins for my 20 breakfast guests. I'm serving the old standard Stewart twelve-course breakfast, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I didn't have time to make the tables and chairs this morning, so I used the ones I had on hand.\n\nBefore I moved the table into the dining room, I decided to add just a touch of the holidays. So I repainted the room in pinks and stenciled gold stars on the ceiling. Then, while the homemade bread was rising, I took antique candle molds and made the dishes (exactly the same shade of pink) to use for breakfast. These were made from Hungarian\nclay, which you can get at almost any Hungarian craft store.\n\nWell, I must run. I need to finish the buttonholes on the dress I'm wearing for breakfast. I'll get out the sled and drive this note to the post office as soon as the glue dries on the envelope I'll be making.\n\nHope my breakfast guests don't stay too long, I have 40,000 cranberries to string with bay leaves before my speaking engagement at noon. It's a good thing.\n\nLove,\nMartha Stewart\n\nP.S. When I made the ribbon for this typewriter, I used 1/8-inch gold gauze. I soaked the gauze in a mixture of white grapes and blackberries which I grew, picked, and crushed last week just for fun.\n\n\nResponse from Erma Bombeck:\n\nDear Martha,\n\nI'm writing this on the back of an old shopping list, pay no attention to the coffee and jelly stains. I'm 20 minutes late getting my daughter up for school, packing a lunch with one hand, on the phone with the dog pound, seems old Ruff needs bailing out again. Burnt my arm on the curling iron when I was trying to make those cute\ncurly fries, how DO they do that? Still can't find the scissors to cut out some snowflakes, tried using an old disposable razor ... trashed the tablecloth. Tried that cranberry thing, frozen cranberries mushed up after I defrosted them in the microwave. Oh, and don't use Fruity Pebbles as a substitute in that Rice Krispie snowball recipe, unless you happen to like a disgusting shade that resembles puke! The smoke alarm is going off, talk to ya later. \n\nLove,\nErma",

        "joke": "People often think of 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' as the days preceding the festival. Actually, Christmas is a season of the Christian \nYear that lasts for the twelve days beginning December 25 and lasting until January 6 - the Day of Epiphany, when the church celebrates the revelation of Christ as the Light of the world and recalls the journey of the magi. \n\nFrom 1558 until 1829 Roman Catholics in England were not allowed to practice their faith openly. During that era someone wrote 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' as a kind of secret catechism that could be sung in public without the risk of persecution. \n\n'The 12 Days of Christmas' is, in essence, an allegory.  The song has two levels of interpretation: the surface meaning plus a hidden meaning known only to members of the church. \n\nEach element in the carol is a code word for a religious reality.  The \"true love\" represents God and the \"me\" who receives these presents is the Christian (a Catholic in this case). \n\nThe hidden meanings are: \n\nThe partridge in a pear tree is Jesus Christ a tree as a gift from God. \n\nThe two turtledoves are the Old and New Testaments, another gift from God. \n\nThree French hens stand for faith, hope and love - the three gifts of the Spirit that abide (I Corinthians 13). \n\nThe four calling birds are the four Gospels, which sing the song of salvation through Jesus Christ. \n\nThe five gold rings recall the Torah (Law) the first five books of the Old Testament, also called the \"Books of Moses.\" \n\nThe six geese a-laying stand for the six days of creation. \n\nSeven swans a-swimming represent the sevenfold gifts of the Spirit (I Corinthians 12:8-11, Romans 12, Ephesians 4, 1 Peter 4:10-11). \n\nThe eight maids a-milking are the eight beatitudes. \n\nNine ladies dancing? These are the nine fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). \n\nThe ten lords a-leaping are the Ten Commandments. \n\nEleven pipers piping stand for the eleven faithful disciples. (Excludes Judas.) \n\nTwelve drummers drumming symbolize the 12 points of belief in the Apostles' Creed. \n\nSo the next time you hear \"The 12 Days of Christmas,\" consider how this otherwise non-religious-sounding song had its origins in the Christian faith.",

It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head.\n\nI'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you're saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out they'll close the X-files.\n\nScully, listen to me: It knows when you're sleeping.

        "joke": "Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes:\n\nOur sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.\n\nOnce inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make. Instead, I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn leaves from the front yard. The mud was their idea.\n\nThe dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork.\n\nSince this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.\n\nOur centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it is a turkey.\n\nWe will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline.  Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds.\n\nAs accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously \nlike a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them. They are lying.\n\nWe toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.  We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.\n\nIn the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table.  In a separate room.  Next door.\n\nNow, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at our dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.  I stress \"private\" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that \"passing the rolls\" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.\n\nOh, and one reminder for the adults: For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its lesser-known name: Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance. Cheese Sauce stains.\n\nBefore I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints.  You will still have a choice; take it or leave it.\n\nMartha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably won't come next year either.\n\nI am thankful.",

        "joke": "If you are a man, chances are you have forgotten that Valentine's Day or that all-important anniversary is coming up soon. Now that you know, this seems a good time to pause for a large hysterical fit.\n\nThe angst you are feeling right now stems from a complete lack of understanding about what makes a woman feel romantic. I don't know either, but I did look it up on the Internet.\n\nNot counting about 5,000 Web sites that seem to correlate the word \"romance\" with \"hot mamas,\" here's what I found out.\n\nHOW TO ROMANCE A WOMAN: Call her. Hug her. Compliment her. Smile at her. Laugh with her. Cry with her. Cuddle with her. Shop with her. Give her jewelry and flowers. Hold her hand. Write love letters to her. Go to the end of the Earth and back again for\nher.\n\nConversely, if a woman wants to romance a man, she would only need to show up wearing anything remotely revealing, including a hazardous material suit.\n\nThis may sound like an oversimplification of gender romance differences, but it isn't far from reality. It's always Valentine's Day for men, if you get my drift. Women need a\nspecial day.\n\nBecause it involves a woman's feelings, Valentine's Day is something of a mystery to men. So is the top of a box of Cheeze Doodles, but we'll save that for another column.\n\nThe following is a basic guide to Valentine's Day survival for men, which was faxed to me by the nice ladies down at \"Romance Anonymous,\" formerly known as \"Men Are Pigs But We Can't Kill Them.\"\n\nSTEP ONE: The minimum requirement is to let the woman know that you care. The least expensive way is to look at her -- preferably somewhere on her face -- and say, \"I love you, [her name here].\"  If you forget her name, don't bother with the rest of the steps. You're dead.\n\nSTEP TWO: A Valentine card is an acceptable nonverbal token of appreciation. Best of all, it's cheap. Good Valentines are pink with lots of lace and have cute words such as \"I'll love my sugar bunny forever and ever and ever and ... \"  Bad Valentine cards say, \"Good for one free quart of motor oil.\"\n\nSTEP THREE: Candy.  For some scientific reason that makes no sense, women regard chocolate the same way men view beer.  While a handful of M&Ms is OK, women tend to expect something a bit nicer. Wrapped for starters. By the way, since the candy is supposed to be for her, she's going to notice any test bites. Stay out of it.\n\nSTEP FOUR: Jewelry. A bit pricier, especially if you didn't bother with steps 1-3. If you did, you might get by with a small but hideously expensive ring, necklace, or tiara. Keep in mind that most women, even in Utah, do not consider aluminum, tin or a Mylar balloon to be a precious metal.\n\nSTEP FIVE: Lingerie. Be careful. Few men are smart enough about women to figure out their underwear. Not only does it have to be the right size and caliber, it must also match any of the approximately 8 billion feelings she currently has about herself. To be safe, tell the clerk that you're looking for something that can't be used to strangle you in your sleep.\n\nSTEP SIX: Romantic getaways are good for couples with more than 0.002 kids. Studies prove that not even bacteria can reproduce when a toddler is beating on the bedroom door with a Fisher-Price toy. Depending on the size of your family, the romantic getaway may have to cross at least three international boundaries.\n\nSTEP SEVEN: Unlike men, women give points for trying. So do something. Anything is better than nothing. If you don't believe me, I can show you last year's knot on the back of my head.",

        "joke": "Good afternoon.  I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.  I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.  I was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands.  I taught myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.\n\nMy mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for \"Huckleberry Finn\".\n\nBack then, black folks in the South were second-class citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an impression. You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nMy father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.\"\n\nBut life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.  Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae\".\n\nWhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.\n\nBut there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.\n\nWhen I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.  I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.  And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing: \"Al, we need you in Washington.\"\n\nI knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other business -- building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field's chocolate chip cookies.\n\nFinally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for no particular\nreason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.\n\nSince then, I've been part of the most successful administration in American history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do.  And when I would give him\nmy thoughts, he would invariable say, \"Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?\" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away from that dark-haired intern.\n\nSo after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.  And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, \"Al, just tell the truth, it's always worked for me.\"",

        "joke": "Dateline Wash D.C Dec. 30, 2004\n\nDecember 30, 2004 / Washington, D.C.  (Associated Press)\n\nAfter four years of legal wrangling, George W.  Bush was finally declared the winner of the 2000 presidential election yesterday.\n\nBush, a Republican, will take the oath of office at noon today and serves until Jan. 20, 2005, a term of about three weeks.  Then he gives way to the winner of the 2004 presidential election, New York\nSen. Hillary Rodham Greenspan (formerly Clinton).\n\nFacing a drastically shortened presidency, Bush attempted to strike an optimistic tone last night.  \"We have a lot to accomplish in the next three weeks,\" Bush said.  \"Reforming Social Security alone is probably going to eat up four or five hours.  Let's get to work!\"\n \nAides yesterday were calling temporary employment agencies in a frantic effort to fill Cabinet posts.  Bush's victory ends a four-year court battle between him and Democratic candidate Al Gore over the\nresults of the 2000 election.\n\nWhile the dispute raged on, the nation installed an interim president - New York Yankees Manager Joe Torre.  Torre admitted that running a country and a baseball team simultaneously has been a strain.  \"At\ntimes, it's been difficult to keep the two things straight.  Although, in retrospect,trading Jesse Helms to the Red Sox turned out OK.\"\n\nTorre's four years in office were marked by continued prosperity at home and relative calm abroad.  His most controversial move was appointing Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer to the Supreme Court. Critics charged that Zimmer lacked experience.  He also spit tobacco juice on Antonin Scalia's shoes, angering conservatives.  Torre's boldest foreign policy initiative was making Cuba the 51st state in an\neffort to improve U.S. pitching.\n\nTorre was planning to vacate the White House by midnight tonight, with Bush moving in immediately.\n\nEager to give an aura of permanency to his three-week administration, Bush rebuffed suggestions that he sleep on a bare mattress on the floor and live out of suitcases.\n\nGore, meanwhile, has yet to concede defeat.  The former vice president issued a statement today saying, \"It would be improper and disrespectful to the democratic process to act hastily before all the facts are known.\" The legal tangle over the 2000 election began with a Gore lawsuit over the confusing design of ballots in Florida.  When the courts sided with Gore, Bush filed suit, arguing that the Oregon results were invalid because some ballots were yellow and others pink. Gore countersued, charging that the West Virginia results should be thrown out because some people failed to receive \"I Voted Today\"\nstickers.\n\nThrough the years, various officials proposed compromises to resolve the impasse.  All were rejected, including:\n\nEstablishing a co-presidency, with the two men sharing duties and splitting the White House.  Although never implemented, the idea gave rise to a hit TV show, East Wing, West Wing.\n\nEstablishing temporarily separate nations, with each candidate ruling the states he won in the 2000 election.  Gore, who failed to carry his native Tennessee, balked at the idea because it would mean\nshowing a passport every time he went home.\n\nObservers said the biggest challenge for the Bush administration will be working with Congress, which adjourns tomorrow and isn't expected back until after Bush's term ends.  \"One day may not be quite enough\ntime to overhaul the tax system,\" a Bush aide admitted.  \"But maybe we can get started and then finish it later with a big conference call or something.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bush also must work on his legacy and prepare to transfer power to President-elect Greenspan.  She yesterday wished Bush well and asked if she could start moving some boxes into the White House basement.",

Maybe you could still get your\nmoney back.\n\nThis is embarrassing, I know, but we have to ask because it\ndoes, after all, affect your ability to pay: Any problems in\nyour marriage? No? Fine.  Let's look at your assets: $1.5\nmillion. Not bad. Yes, yes, Mr. Clinton, we're not forgetting\nyour Mustang back in Little Rock. But--oh!-those liabilities.\nYou owe $5.5 million. That means you're $4 million in the hole.\n\nHow do you expect to pay that off? You're hoping people will\ndonate to a special fund? So basically you're relying on the\ncharity of strangers.\n\nYou also have some serious expenses. A kid at Stanford has\ngot to be setting you back $30,000 to $35,000 a year,\nprobably more with the air fares. And she wants to go to\nmedical school? Ouch!\n\nAnd Mr. Clinton, there's a little matter of a $90,000 fine\nfor lying in court. I guess that rules out putting your law\ndegree to work. Say, how do we know you're not lying on you\nloan application? Good point. It would look a lot better if\nyou were lying. Are there any other legal matters we should\nknow about?\n\nYou say you're in the clear, Mr. Clinton, and the first lady\nis pretty much in the clear, indictment- wise. What does that\nmean? You don't think--don't think--she's going to get hit\nwith a perjury or obstruction of justice rap.  But we're not\ntotally sure, right? That means there's a remote possibility\n--note that I say \"remote\"--that you could be trying to pay\noff a $1.76 million mortgage while making 12 cents an hour\nstitching mailbags for the feds, and he is trying to make a\ngo of a library in Little Rock.\n\nLet's review the situation. One of you is now unemployed and\nthe other one soon will be. You have these whopping great\ndebts that you're hoping someone is going to come along and\npay. You have a financial history that can only be described\nas \"checkered\", plus a bunch of serious financial demands and\nongoing legal problems. Your tangible assets seem to consist\nof an old Ford.\n\nSo, Congratulations! Welcome to the EZBreeZee family of\nhomeowners!  You've got your mortgage!",

        "joke": "In new documents just revealed by the Justice Department, in addition to the controversial pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, former President Clinton also pardoned Adolph Hitler and Satan. With minutes to go before his term expired, Clinton signed an order to pardon himself.\n\nClinton's press liaison defended the pardons.  \"President Clinton reasoned it's time to put this whole 'World War' thing behind us.\n\n\"While Hitler did indeed have a few bad years, he's been a model of civility for the last 56 years.  We think he deserves a second chance.\"\n\nClinton seemed to identify with Hitler.  \"There were forces constantly at work against him.  I'm not condoning what he did, mind you, but I feel his pain.  I know exactly what it's like to have the media of the world against you.\"\n\nClinton's pardon of Satan drew some right-wing Republican protests.  Representative Dan Burton called upon Clinton to appear before Congress and explain the action.  Burton\nbelieves there was a deal between the Prince of Darkness and Clinton to help build Clinton's Presidential Library in exchange for the pardon and Clinton's soul.\n\nDemocrats were quick to dismiss the charges.  Senator Tom Daschle said, \"These charges are bogus because President Clinton sold his soul to Satan years ago.\"\n\nJust before he posed for pictures on Inauguration Day with the new president, Clinton signed a pardon forgiving himself \"for any goddamned thing anyone wants to pin on me, for\nall eternity -- even things they've not found out about yet!\"",

        "joke": "One of the fringe benefits of being an English or History teacher\nis receiving the occasional jewel of a student blooper in an essay. I have\npasted together the following \"history\" of the world from certifiably genuine\nstudent bloopers collected by teachers throughout the United States, from\neighth grade through college level. Read carefully, and you will learn\na lot.\n\n\n\nThe inhabitants of Egypt were called mummies. They lived in the Sarah\nDessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that\nthe inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the dessert\nare cultivated by irritation. The Egyptians built the Pyramids in the\nshape of a huge triangular cube. The Pramids are a range of mountains between\nFrance and Spain.\n\nThe Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the\nBible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of\ntheir children, Cain, asked \"Am I my brother's son?\" God asked Abraham\nto sacrifice Issac on Mount Montezuma. Jacob, son of Issac, stole his brother's\nbirthmark. Jacob was a partiarch who brought up his twelve sons to be partiarchs,\nbut they did not take to it. One of Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse to\nthe Israelites.\n\nPharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw. Moses\nled them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread\nmade without any ingredients. Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide\nto get the ten commandments. David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing\nthe liar. He fougth with the Philatelists, a race of people who lived in\nBiblical times. Solomon, one of David's sons, had 500 wives and 500 porcupines.\n\nWithout the Greeks, we wouldn't have history. The Greeks invented three\nkinds of columns - Corinthian, Doric and Ironic. They also had myths. A\nmyth is a female moth. One myth says that the mother of Achilles dipped\nhim in the River Stynx until he became intolerable. Achilles appears in\n\"The Illiad\", by Homer. Homer also wrote the \"Oddity\", in which Penelope\nwas the last hardship that Ulysses endured on his journey. Actually, Homer\nwas not written by Homer but by another man of that name.\n\nSocrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice.\nThey killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.\n\nIn the Olympic Games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits,\nand threw the java. The reward to the victor was a coral wreath. The government\nof Athen was democratic because the people took the law into their own\nhands. There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so high that\nthey couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were doing. When they\nfought the Parisians, the Greeks were outnumbered because the Persians\nhad more men.\n\nEventually, the Ramons conquered the Geeks. History call people Romans\nbecause they never stayed in one place for very long. At Roman banquets,\nthe guests wore garlic in their hair. Julius Caesar extinguished himself\non the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March killed him because they\nthought he was going to be made king. Nero was a cruel tyrany who would\ntorture his poor subjects by playing the fiddle to them.\n\nThen came the Middle Ages. King Alfred conquered the Dames, King Arthur\nlived in the Age of Shivery, King Harlod mustarded his troops before the\nBattle of Hastings, Joan of Arc was cannonized by George Bernard Shaw,\nand the victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. Finally,\nthe Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the\nsame offense.\n\nIn midevil times most of the people were alliterate. The greatest writer\nof the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verse and also wrote\nliterature. Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow through\nan apple while standing on his son's head.\n\nThe Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value\nof their human being. Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at Wittenberg\nfor selling papal indulgences. He died a horrible death, being excommunicated\nby a bull. It was the painter Donatello's interest in the female nude that\nmade him the father of the Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions\nand discoveries. Gutenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a\nhistorical figure because he invented cigarettes. Another important invention\nwas the circulation of blood. Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with\na 100-foot clipper.\n\nThe government of England was a limited mockery. Henry VIII found walking\ndifficult because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth was the\n\"Virgin Queen.\" As a queen she was a success. When Elizabeth exposed\nherself before her troops, they all shouted \"hurrah.\" Then her navy went\nout and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.\n\nThe greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespear. Shakespear\nnever made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He lived\nin Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies and errors.\nIn one of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by\nrelieving himself in a long soliloquy. In another, Lady Macbeth tries to\nconvince Mac- beth to kill the King by attacking his manhood. Romeo and\nJuliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Writing at the same time as\nShakespear was Miquel Cervantes. He wrote \"Donkey Hote\". The next great\nauthor was John Milton. Milton wrote \"Paradise Lost.\" Then his wife dies\nand he wrote \"Paradise Regained.\"\n\nDuring the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great\nnavigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His\nships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe. Later the Pilgrims\ncrossed the Ocean, and the was called the Pilgrim's Progress. When they\nlanded at Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by Indians, who came down the\nhill rolling their was hoops before them. The Indian squabs carried porposies\non their back. Many of the Indian heroes were killed, along with their\ncabooses, which proved very fatal to them. The winter of 1620 was a hard\none for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain\nJohn Smith was responsible for all this.\n\nOne of the causes of the Revolutionary Wars was the English put tacks\nin their tea. Also, the colonists would send their pacels through the post\nwith- out stamps. During the War, Red Coats and Paul Revere was throwing\nballs over stone walls. The dogs were barking and the peacocks crowing.\nFinally, the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.\n\nDelegates from the original thirteen states formed the Contented Congress.\nThomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the\nDeclaration of Independence. Franklin had gone to Boston carrying all his\nclothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm. He invented electricity by rubbing cats backwards and declared \"a horse divided against\nitself cannot stand.\" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.\n\nGeorge Washington married Matha Curtis and in due time became the Father\nof Our Country. Them the Constitution of the United States was adopted\nto secure domestic hostility. Under the Constitution the people enjoyed\nthe right to keep bare arms.\n\nAbraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother\ndied in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his\nown hands. When Lincoln was President, he wore only a tall silk hat. He\nsaid, \"In onion there is strength.\" Abraham Lincoln write the Gettysburg\naddress while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an\nenvelope. He also signed the Emasculation Proclamation, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment gave the ex-Negroes citizenship. But the Clue Clux Clan would\ntorcher and lynch the ex-Negroes and other innocent victims. On the night\nof April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat\nby one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was\nJohn Wilkes Booth, a sup- posedl insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.\n\nMeanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare\ninvented electricity and also wrote a book called \"Candy\". Gravity was\ninvented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the Autumn, when\nthe apples are flaling off the trees.\n\nBach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel. Handel\nwas half German, half Italian and half English. He was very large. Bach\ndied from 1750 to the present. Beethoven wrote music even though he was\ndeaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest\neven when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later\ndied for this.\n\nFrance was in a very serious state. The French Revolution was accomplished\nbefore it happened. The Marseillaise was the theme song of the French Revolu-\ntion, and it catapulted into Napoleon. During the Napoleonic Wars, the\ncrowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes. Then the Spanish\ngorrilas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon's flanks. Napoleon\nbecame ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained. He\nwanted an heir to inheret his power, but since Josephine was a baroness,\nshe couldn't bear him any children.\n\nThe sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is\nin the East and the sun sets in the West. Queen Victoria was the longest\nqueen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years. He reclining years and finally\nthe end of her life were exemplatory of a great personality. Her death\nwas the final event which ended her reign.\n\nThe nineteenth century was a time of many great inventions and thoughts.\nThe invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up.\nCyrus McCormick invented the McCormick Raper, which did the work of a hundred\nmen. Samuel Morse invented a code for telepathy. Louis Pastuer discovered\na cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturailst who wrote the \"Organ\nof the Species\". Madman Curie discovered radium. And Karl Marx became one\nof the Marx Brothers.\n\nThe First World War, cause by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by a\nsurf, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.",

        "joke": "HEADQUARTERS\nLAST U.S. ARMY\nAPO 001. U.S. ARMY\n\nAG 4110.99 (DEBCA)20 September 1944\n\nSUBJECT:  Indoctrination for Return to U.S.\n\nTO:  All Units.\n\nIn compliance with current policies for rotation of armed forces overseas it is directed that in order to maintain the high standard of character of the American Soldier and to prevent any dishonor to reflect on the uniform all individuals eligible for return to the U.S. under current directives will undergo an indoctrination course of demilitarisation prior to approval of his application for return.\n\nThe following points will be emphasized in the subject indoctrination course:\n\nIn America there is a remarkable number of beautiful girls. These young ladies have not been liberated and many are gainfully employed as stenographers, sales girls, beauty operators or welders.  Contrary to current practice they should not be approached with \"How much?\".  A proper greeting is \"Isn't it a lovely day?\" or \"Have you ever been to Chicago?\".  Then say \"How much?\".\n\nA guest in a private home is usually awakened in the morning by a light tapping on his door, and an invitation to join the host at breakfast. It is proper to say \"I'll be there shortly\". DO NOT say \"Blow it out your _____\".\n\nA typical American breakfast consists of such strange foods as cantalopes, fresh eggs, milk, ham, etc. These are highly palatable and though strange in appearance are extremely tasty.  Butter, made from cream, is often served. If you wish some butter, you turn to the person nearest it and say quietly \"Please pass the butter\". DO NOT say \"Threw me the god damn grease\".\n\nVery natural urges are apt to occur when in a crowd. If it is found necessary to defecate, one does NOT grab a shovel in one hand and paper in the other and run for the garden. At least 90% of American homes have one room called the \"Bathroom\", i.e.  a room that, in most cases, contains a bathtub, wash basin, medicine cabinet, and a toilet.  It is the latter that you will use in this case. (Instructors should make sure that all personnel understand the operation of toilet, particularly the lever or button arrangement that serves to prepare the device for reuse).\n\nIn the event the helmet is retained by the individual, he will refrain from using it as a chair, wash bowl, foot bath or bathtub.  All these devices are furnished in the average American Home.  It is not considered good practice to squat Indian fashion in a corner in the event all chairs are occupied.  The host usually will provide suitable seats.\n\nBelching or passing wind in company is strictly frowned upon. If you should forget about it, however, and belch in the presence of others, a proper remark is \"Excuse me\". DO NOT say \"It must be that lousy chow we've been getting\".\n\nAmerican dinners, in most cases, consist of several items, each served in a separate dish.  The common practice of mixing various items, such as corn-beef and pudding, or lima beans and peaches, to make it more palatable will be refrained from.  In time the \"Separate Dish\" system will become enjoyable.\n\nAmericans have a strange taste for stimulants.  The drinks in common usage on the Continent, such as underripe wine, alcohol and grapefruit juice, or gasoline bitters and water (commonly known by the French as \"Cognac\") are not usually acceptable in civilian circles.  A suitable use for such drinks is for serving one's landlord in order to break an undesirable lease.\n\nThe returning soldier is apt to find often that his opinions differ from those of his civilian associates.  One should call upon his reserve etiquette and correct his acquaintance with such remarks as \"I believe you have made a mistake\", or \"I am afraid you are in error on that\".  DO NOT say \"Brother, you're really f----d up\".  This is considered impolite.\n\nUpon leaving a friend's home after a visit, one may find his hat misplaced.  Frequently it has been placed in a closet.  One should turn to one's host and say \"I don't seem to have my hat.  Could you help me find it?\". DO NOT say \"Don't anybody leave this room, some S.O.B. has stolen my hat\".\n\nIn traveling in the U.S., particularly in a strange city, it is often necessary to spend the night.  Hotels are provided for this purpose and almost anyone can give directions to the hearest hotel.  Here, for a small sum, you can register and be shown to a room where you can sleep for the night. The present practice of entering the\nnearest house, throwing the occupants into the yard and\ntaking over the premises will cease.\n\nWhiskey, a common American drink, may be offered to the soldier on social occasions.  It is considered a bad reflection on the uniform to snatch the bottle from the  hostess and drain the bottle, cork and all.  All individuals are cautioned to exercise extreme control in these circumstances.\n\nIn motion picture theaters seats are provided.  Helmets are not required. In is NOT considered good form to whistle every time a female over 8 and under 80 crosses the screen. If vision is impaired by the person in the seat in front, there are plenty of other seats which can be occupied.  DO NOT hit him across the back of the head and say \"Move your head, jerk, I can't see a damn thing\".\n\nIt is not proper to go around hitting everyone of draft age in civilian clothes.  He might have been released from the service for medical reasons.  Ask for his credentials, and if he can't show any THEN go ahead and slug him.\n\nUpon retiring, one will often find a pair of pajamas laid out on the bed. (Pajamas, it should be explained, are two-piece garments which are donned after all clothing has been removed.) The soldier, confronted by these garments, should assume an air of familiarity and not act as though he were not used to them. A casual remark such as \"My, what a delicate shade of blue\" will usually suffice. Under NO circumstances say \"How in hell do you expect me to sleep in a get-up like that?\".\n\nNatural functions will continue. It may frequently be necessary to urinate.  DO NOT walk behind the nearest tree or automobile you find to accomplish this. Toilets (see 2d above) are provided in all public buildings for this purpose.\n\nBeer is sometimes served in bottles.  A cap remover is usually available, and it is not good form to open the bottle by the use of one's teeth.\n\nAlways tip your hat before striking a lady.\n\nAir raids and enemy patrols are not encountered in America. Therefore it is not necessary to wear the helmet in church or at social gatherings, or to hold the weapon at ready, loaded and cocked, when talking to civilians in the street.\n\nEvery American home and all hotels are equipped with bathing facilities. When it is desired to take a bath, it is not considered good form to find the nearest pool or stream, strip down, and indulge in a bath. This is particularly true in heavily populated areas.\n\nAll individuals returning to the U.S. will make every effort to conform to the customs and habits of the regions visited, and to make themselves as inconspicuous as possible. Any actions which reflect upon the honor of the uniform will be promptly dealt with.",

        "joke": "When I came into the office this morning, I noticed a sort of general feeling of unfriendliness, and since several of you have called me a \"dirty son of a bitch\" to my face, I knew I must have done something wrong at the office New Years Party.\n\nThe Office Manager called me from the hospital today and as this is my last day, I'd like to take this way of apologizing to all of you. I would prefer speaking to everyone personally, but all of you seem to go deaf and dumb whenever I try to talk to you.\n\nFirst, to our dear and beloved boss, I am sorry for all the things I called you Friday afternoon. I'm very much aware that your father is not a baboon, nor your mother a Chinese whore. Your wife is a delightful woman, and my story of you buying her for 50 cents in Tijuana was strictly a figment of my imagination. Your children are undoubtedly yours too. About the water cooler incident, you'll never know how badly I feel about it, and I hope you didn't hurt your head when they were trying to get the glass jug off.\n\nTo Mary, I express my deepest regrets. In my own defense, I must remind you that you seemed to enjoy our little escapade on the stairway as much as  I did until the bannister broke and we fell eight feet to the second floor  landing.  In spite of the rupture you incurred when I landed on top of you, I am sure\nyou will admit that when we landed it was one of the biggest thrills you have ever had.\n\nSam, you old cuss, you've just got to forgive me for that little prank I played on you.  If I had known you were goosey, I'd have never done it. It would have been a lot worse if that fat lady hadn't been standing right under the window you jumped through. She really broke your fall a lot. People have been killed falling three stories.\n\nGene, I regret telling the fireman it was you who turned in the false alarm.  But, of course, I had no way of know they would make such a bad report of it.  Those fire hoses sure have a lot of pressure don't they? And the water is cold!!\n\nDon, I know how you must feel about me.  Opening the door to the broom closet suddenly must have startled you and Millie quite badly, and to think how hard you bumped your chin on the sink when you bent over to pull up your pants, it makes me sick.  We'll have to get together for dinner some night after the dentist finishes your plates.\n\nNancy, the only excuse I can offer for stealing all your clothes and hiding them when I found you passed out in the ladies room, is that I was drunk.  Also, I want you to know I was very embarrassed  when I couldn't remember where I hid them and you had to go home in that old sofa cover. Running your falsies\nup the flag pole was a bit too much, but like I said, I was a little drunk.\n\nTo all of you, I am sorry.  Setting Jan's panties on fire seemed funny at the time, and it makes me sad to hear that her husband is divorcing her because of it.\n\nUrinating in everyone's drink was in bad taste, and not telling them about it until all the drinks were gone was even worse. \n\nNow that I have apologized to all of you and know that I am forgiven, I will do my darndest to come to the picnic......",

This is commonly referred to outside the industry as 'being sucked up to'.  This practice is typically performed by a person of low or irrelevant technical standing wishing to distinguish themselves by their presence and input at meetings for which they have a minimal or no understanding.  Complimenting and Agreeing with senior staff and their poorly thought-out plans is the typical implementation of this position.  The position is typically advertised under a job-pseudonym and regraded without notification by other members of staff, usually at a departmental social function to which the applicant is not invited.\n\nPosition Requirments\n\nApplicants are to be familiar with the following phrases:\n\nReally?  That's a great idea!\n\nOh, I agree wholeheartedly!\n\nThat's such a good plan, it's surprising that no-one thought of it before!\n\nYou know, without you this place would fall apart!\n\nOf course, he's bound to say that because he's not as aware of the full ramifications of the problem as we are.\n\nIs this far enough up?\n\nApplicants should have relevant experience in:\n\nWork Avoidance\n\nEvading Real Issues\n\nVocalising the word \"Yes\"\n\nApplicants should NOT possess any of the following:\n\nSocial Skills\n\nTechnical Competance, except in remembering irrelevant facts\n\nConscience\n\nThe sense god gave the common doormat\n\nApplicants MUST possess the following:\n\nA \"gushy\" affirmative manner\n\nThe \"Chameleon Factor\" -- the ability to assume the characteristics and mannerisms of senior staff\n\nAn immunity to RSI of the jaw and ear (due to the large amount of talking and listening in place of working and producing)\n\nA diehard loyal attitude which cannot be swayed, except by other senior staff, absence of senior staff, public opinion, office-bribery, an unfavourable comment at the office party, an invite to the office party or invite to clean up after an office party.\n\nExceptionally high morals which will not be swayed except by public opinion, office-bribery, senior staff, office party comments & invites or the possibility of getting their photo or name in some technical journal.\n\nHoming skills allowing the applicant to orbit senior staff and thereby avoid the unlikely event of having to produce work output.\n\nA working knowledge of Anal Interfacing would be beneficial.\n\nPosition Future\n\nThe future of the position is similar in an least one respect to the\nsenior staff member reported to, in that it is 'open-ended'.

No-host bar, but plenty of eggnog! We'll have a small band playing  traditional carols -- feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus!\n\n\n\nFROM: Pat Smith, Human Resources Director\nDATE: December 2 RE: Christmas Party\n\nIn no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees.  We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now on we're calling it our \"Holiday Party.\" The same policy applies to employees who are celebrating Kwanzaa at this time.

I had no idea that December 20 begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating, drinking and intimacy during daylight hours.  There goes the party!  Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees' beliefs. Perhaps Luigi's can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party-the days are so short this time of year-or else package everything for take-home in little foil swans. Will that work?  Meanwhile, I've arranged for members of Overeaters Anonymous to sit farthest from the dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms.  Did I miss anything?\n\n\n\nFROM: Pat Smith, Human Resources Director\nDATE: December 8  RE: Holiday Party\n\nSo December 22 marks the Winter Solstice...what do you expect me to do, a tap-dance on your heads? Fire regulations at Luigi's prohibit the burning of sage by our \"earth-based\nGoddess-worshipping\" employees, but we'll try to accommodate your shamanic drumming circle during the band's breaks. Okay???\n\n\n\nFROM: Pat Smith, Human Resources Director\nDate: December 9  RE: Holiday Party\n\nPeople, people, nothing sinister was intended by having our CEO dress up like Santa Claus! Even if the anagram of \"Santa\" does happen to be \"Satan,\" there is no evil connotation to our own \"little man in a red suit.\"  It's a tradition, folks, like sugar \nshock at Halloween or family feuds over the Thanksgiving turkey or broken hearts on Valentine's Day.  Could we lighten up?\n\n\n\nFROM: Pat Smith, Human Resources Director\nDATE: December 10  RE: Holiday Party\n\nVegetarians!?!?!? I've had it with you people!!! We're going to keep this party at Luigi's Open Pit Barbecue whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table  furthest from the \"grill of death,\" as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your #$%^&*! salad bar, including hydroponic tomatoes...but you know, they have feelings, too.

        "joke": "To really succeed in a business or organization, it is sometimes helpful to know what your job is, and whether it involves any duties. Ask among your coworkers. \"Hi,\" you should say. \"I'm a new employee. What is the name of my job?\" If they answer \"long-range planner\" or \"lieutenant governor,\" you are pretty much free to lounge around and do crossword puzzles until retirement. Most jobs, however, will require some work.\n\n\nThere are two major kinds of work in modern organizations:\n\n\n1. Taking phone messages for people who are in meetings, and, 2. Going to meetings.\n\n\nYour ultimate career strategy will be to get a job involving primarily No. 2, going to meetings, as soon as possible, because that's where the real prestige is. It is all very well and good to be able to take phone messages, but you are never going to get a position of power, a position where you can cost thousands of people their jobs with a single bonehead decision, unless you learn how to attend meetings.\n\n\nThe first meeting ever was held back in the Mezzanine Era. In those days, Man's job was to slay his prey and bring it home for Woman, who had to figure out how to cook it. The problem was, Man was slow and basically naked, whereas the prey had warm fur and could run like an antelope. (In fact it was an antelope, only nobody knew this).\n\n\nAt last someone said, \"Maybe if we just sat down and did some brainstorming, we could come up with a better way to hunt our prey!\" It went extremely well, plus it was much warmer sitting in a circle, so they agreed to meet again the next day, and the next.\n\n\nBut the women pointed out that, prey-wise, the men had not produced anything, and the human race was pretty much starving. \n\n\nThe men agreed that was serious and said they would put it right near the top of their \"agenda\". At this point, the women, who were primitive but not stupid, started eating plants, and thus modern agriculture was born. It never would have happened without meetings.\n\n\nThe modern business meeting, however, might better be compared with a funeral, in the sense that you have a gathering of people who are wearing uncomfortable clothing and would rather be somewhere else. The major difference is that most funerals have a definite purpose. Also, nothing is really ever buried in a meeting.\n\n\nAn idea may look dead, but it will always reappear at another meeting later on. If you have ever seen the movie, \"Night of the Living Dead,\" you have a rough idea of how modern meetings operate, with projects and proposals that everyone thought were killed rising up constantly from their graves to stagger back into meetings and eat the brains of the living.\n\n\nThere are two major kinds of meetings:\n\n\nMeetings that are held for basically the same reason that Arbor Day is observed - namely, tradition. For example, a lot of managerial people like to meet on Monday, because it's Monday. You'll get used to it. You'd better, because this kind account for 83% of all meetings (based on a study in which I wrote down numbers until one of them looked about right). This type of meeting operates the way \"Show and Tell\" does in nursery school, with everyone getting to say something, the difference being that in nursery school, the kids actually have something to say.\n\n\nWhen it's your turn, you should say that you're still working on whatever it is you're supposed to be working on. This may seem pretty dumb, since obviously you'd be working on whatever you're supposed to be working on, and even if you weren't, you'd claim you were, but that's the traditional thing for everyone to say. It would be a lot faster if the person running the meeting would just say, \"Everyone who is still working on what he or she is supposed to be working on, raise your hand.\" You'd be out of there in five minutes, even allowing for jokes. But this is not how we do it in America. My guess is, it's how they do it in Japan.\n\n\nMeetings where there is some alleged purpose. These are trickier, because what you do depends on what the purpose is. Sometimes the purpose is harmless, like someone wants to show slides of pie charts and give everyone a big, fat report. All you have to do in this kind of meeting is sit there and have elaborate fantasies, then take the report back to your office and throw it away, unless, of course, you're a vice president, in which case you write the name of a subordinate in the upper right hand corner, followed be a question mark, like this: \"Norm?\" \n\n\nThen you send it to Norm and forget all about it (although it will plague Norm for the rest of his career).\n\n\nBut sometimes you go to meetings where the purpose is to get your \"input\" on something. This is very serious because what it means is, they want to make sure that in case whatever it is turns out to be stupid or fatal, you'll get some of the blame, so you have to escape from the meeting before they get around to asking you anything. One way is to set fire to your tie.\n\n\nAnother is to have an accomplice interrupt the meeting and announce that you have a phone call from someone very important, such as the president of the company or the Pope. It should be one or the other. It would a sound fishy if the accomplice said, \"You have a call from the president of the company, or the Pope.\"\n\n\nYou should know how to take notes at a meeting. Use a yellow legal pad. At the top, write the date and underline it twice. \n\n\nNow wait until an important person, such as your boss, starts talking; when he does, look at him with an expression of enraptured interest, as though he is revealing the secrets of life itself. Then write interlocking rectangles like this: \n\n\n(picture of doodled rectangles).\n\n\nIf it is an especially lengthy meeting, you can try something like this (Picture of more elaborate doodles and a caricature of the boss).\n\n\nIf somebody falls asleep in a meeting, have everyone else leave the room. Then collect a group of total strangers, right off the street, and have them sit around the sleeping person until he wakes up. Then have one of them say to him, \"Bob, your plan is very, very risky. However, you've given us no choice but to try it. I only hope, for your sake, that you know what you're getting yourself into.\" Then they should file quietly out of the room.",

        "joke": "AMES, IA--The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by materials researchers at IPRT/ISU. The new element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. However, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.\n\nSince it has no electrons, Administratium is totally inert. However, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. According to its discovers, a tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.\n\nAdministratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.\n\nResearch at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. It is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.\n\nScientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.",

        "joke": "Managing by Walking Faster than the Employees\nThese kind of managers you will always see in the corridor, ten steps away. \"We'll have to talk\" you can hear them say, just as they have disappeared around the corner.\n\nManaging by Staring out of the Window\nThese managers you usually meet with their backside faced to you with their hands in their pockets. When you talk to them, their thoughts keep staring out of the windows.\n\nManaging by Post-It's\nSome managers forget everything. They want to impress you with their 'busy'ness by continuously writing on Post-it's while you are talking.\n\nManaging by Delegation to the Secretary\nThese managers just delegate everything to the secretary. If he is good, He knows what she must do.\n\nManaging by Knowing Nothing\nThese managers don't really know anything at all. They let YOU give answers. Meanwhile they fill the time with nice anecdotes of irrelevant cases.\n\nManaging by Conceptual Thinking\nThese people try to explain the present from a theoretical view of the far future. The idea that this never will work, completely satisfies them: They will always have something to talk about.\n\nManaging by Hiding Information\nInformation hiders are aware of the market value of strictly secret kept information. You must be very thankful to get any information at all. Beware of simulants from the Know Nothings!\n\nManaging by Doing Exactly What the Boss Says\nThese managers prevent their bosses from creative thinking. Else they got more work to do.\n\nManaging by Walking One Foot Behind the Boss\nIn hierarchical organizations you can watch those groups walking in the corridor. The more equal managers are directly followed by the lesser equal managers, and so on.\n\nManaging by Smiling and Wearing Nice Suits\nIf you drink beer with them, lunch with them, smile to them and also wear nice suits, nothing can stop your career anymore.\n\nManaging by Studying\nDespite their continual attendances of all kind of studies and congresses, they still belong to the Know Nothings. The longer they learn, the further they get from the practice.\n\nManaging by Creating Vague Overhead Sheets\nDo you know them? Those sheets with some big arrows, boxes or circles? These sheets provide the ultimate proof of their overall brilliance.\n\nManaging by Open Door and Empty Room\nThis is a major improvement of the older 'Open Door' management style. Now you can really walk in and out anytime you want. Nobody ever knows where these managers are.\n\nManaging by Speaking with Other Managers\nThis kind of managing is very popular. It will give them within a few hours the same information as an employee can tell them in 15 minutes.\n\nManaging by Having a Non-Supporting Infrastructure\nIn an organization with a hopeless infrastructure, managers are really necessary. These managers will naturally prevent the organization from having a better infrastructure.\n\nBUA Management (By Using Abbreviations)\nThis management style is ATRASACWOC. (Adopted To Reach A Shorter And Clearer Way Of Communication).\n\nManaging by Using Buzz Words\nThese managers like to bluff your head off with hip, nearly undefined, terms.\n\nManaging by Reorganization\nIf they think there is nothing more to organize, they reorganize.\n\nManaging by Believing\nThese managers must be spiritual educated, because they have no clues at all.\n\nManaging by Forgetting Promises\nIf you remind them to one of their promises, the priority of that promise is to low to remember.",

        "joke": "The president of a large managed care company was also  chairman of the board of his community's symphony orchestra. Finding he could not go to one of his concerts, he gave the  tickets to the company's director of health care containment.\n\nThe next morning, the president asked the director how he  enjoyed the performances. Instead of the expected usual  polite remarks, the director handed him a memorandum which  read as follows:\n\nThe attendance of the orchestra conductor is unnecessary  for public performances. The orchestra has obviously practiced and has received prior authorization from the conductor to play the symphony at a predetermined level of quality. Considerable money could have been saved merely by having the conductor critique the orchestra's performance during a retrospective peer review meeting.\n\nFor considerable periods, the four oboe players had nothing to do. Their numbers should be reduced and their work spread over the whole orchestra, thus eliminating peaks and valleys of activity.\n\nAll twelve violins were playing identical notes with identical motions. This is unnecessary duplication: the staff of this section should be drastically cut with consequent savings. If a larger volume of sound is required, this could be obtained through electric amplification, which has reached very high levels of reproductive quality.\n\nMuch effort was expended playing 16th notes or semi-quavers. This seems excessive refinement as most of the listeners are unable to distinguish such rapid playing. It is recommended that all notes be rounded up to the nearest eighth. If this is done, it would be possible to use trainees and lower grade operators with no loss of quality.\n\nNo useful purpose would appear to be served by repeating  with horns the same passage that has already been handled  by the strings. If all such redundant passages were eliminated, as determined by the utilization review committee, the concert could have been reduced from two hours to twenty minutes, with greater savings in salaries and overhead. In fact, if Schubert had attended to these matters on a cost containment basis, he probably would have been able to finish his symphony.",

        "joke": "In our complex technical environment there are many opportunities for a competent technical individual to be the subject of technical harassment. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. Worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.\n\nFollowing are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.\n\nIf you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  Untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.\n\nIf you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  Most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.\n\nIf you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  One note of caution, competent technical people have been known to\ninadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like PC Week or LAN Times.  If the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as \"stuff\" and \"things\", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.\n\nIf during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term \"trick\".  For example \"maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated\". This is a sure sign of technical harassment.\n\nIf a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. If you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you\nhave only been technically annoyed.\n\nIf when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  It is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have\npurchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  The dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.",

        "joke": "It was the accepted practice in Babylonia 4,000 years ago that for a\nmonth after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer, and\nbecause their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the\n\"honey month\" or what we know today as the \"honeymoon\".

When you were drunk on this grog, you were \"groggy\", a word\nstill in use today.\nMany years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle baked into\nthe rim or handle of their ceramic cups. When they needed a refill,\nthey used the whistle to get some service. \"Wet your whistle\", is the\nphrase inspired by this practice.",

        "joke": "TOKYO (AP) - The recent craze for hydrogen beer is at the heart of a three way lawsuit between unemployed stockbroker Toshira Otoma, the Tike-Take karaoke bar and the Asaka Beer Corporation. Mr. Otoma is suing the bar and the brewery for selling toxic substances and is claiming damages for grievous bodily harm leading to the loss of his job. The bar is counter suing for defamation and loss of customers.\n\nThe Asaka Beer Corporation brews \"Suiso\" brand beer, where the carbon dioxide normally used to add fizz has been replaced by the more environmentally friendly hydrogen gas. A side effect of this has made the beer extremely popular at karaoke sing-along bars and discotheques. Hydrogen, like helium, is a gas lighter than air. Because hydrogen molecules are lighter than air, sound waves are transmitted more rapidly; individuals whose lungs are filled with the nontoxic gas can speak with an uncharacteristically high voice. Exploiting this quirk of physics, chic urbanites can now sing soprano parts on karaoke sing-along machines after consuming a big gulp of Suiso beer. The flammable nature of hydrogen has also become another selling point, even though Asaka has not acknowledged that this was a deliberate marketing ploy. It has inspired a new fashion of blowing flames from one's mouth using a cigarette as an ignition source. Many new karaoke videos feature singers shooting blue flames in slow motion, while flame contests take place in pubs everywhere.\n\n\n\"Mr. Otoma has no-one to blame but himself. If he had not become drunk and disorderly, none of this would have happened. Our security guards undergo the most careful screening and training before they are allowed to deal with customers\" said Mr. Takashi Nomura, Manager of the Tike-Take Bar. \"Mr. Otoma drank fifteen bottles of hydrogen beer in order to maximize the size of the flames he could belch during the contest. He catapulted balls of fire across the room that Gojira would be proud of, but this was not enough to win him first prize since the judgement is made on the quality of the flames and that of the singing, and after fifteen bottles of lager he was badly out of tune.\"\n\n\n\"He took exception to the result and hurled blue fireballs at the judge, singeing the front of Mrs. Mifune's hair, entirely removing her eyebrows and lashes, and ruining the clothes of two nearby customers. None of these people have returned to my bar. When our security staff approached he turned his attentions to them, making it almost impossible to approach him. Our head bouncer had no choice but to hurl himself at Mr. Otoma's knees, knocking his legs from under him. The laws of physics are not to be disobeyed, and the force that propelled Mr. Otoma's legs backwards also pivoted around his center of gravity and moved his upper body forward with equal velocity. It was his own fault he had his mouth open for the next belch, his own fault he held a lighted cigarette in front of it and it is own fault he swallowed that cigarette.\"\n\n\n\"The Tike-Take bar takes no responsibility for the subsequent internal combustion, rupture of his stomach lining, nor the third degree burns to his esophagus, larynx and sinuses as the exploding gases forced their way out of his body. His consequential muteness and loss of employment are his own fault.\" Mr. Otoma was unavailable for comment.",

The drug is generally found in liquid form, and is available almost anywhere. \"Beer\" is sometimes used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to convince their male victims to go home and have sex with them.\n\nTypically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of \"beer\" and then simply ask him home for no-strings attached sex. Men are helpless against this approach: After several \"beers\" men often  succumb to desires to perform sexual acts with women to whom they would usually not be attracted. Men often awaken after being given \"beer\" with only hazy memories of exactly what happened the night before, just a vague feeling something bad occurred.\nSome unfortunate men report having been trapped in a familiar scam known as \"a relationship.\" Apparently men are easy victims for this scam after \"beer\" is administered and they've been sexually approached previously.\nPlease! Forward this warning to every male you know. If you should fall  victim to this insidious \"beer\" and the predatory women plying it, there are male Support groups in most towns where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly-affected, like-minded guys.",

Be glad that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. You are craving a steak bomber and a side of gravy fries.\n\n2 star hangover (**)\n\nNo pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only irritating your rumbling gut, which is craving a Rootie Tootie Fresh and Fruity pancake breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.\n\n3 star hangover (***)\n\nSlight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd you at 1 :45 a.m.  Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of\ndiet coke -- yet you haven't peed once.\n\n4 star hangover (drinking)\n\nLife sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars).

Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger still sleeping in your bed at your house.\n\n6 star hangover (drinking**) otherwise known as the \"Infinite Nutsmacker\"\n\nYou wake up on your bathroom floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your puke from 5 hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate was as drunk as you, but somehow manages to get up before you the next morning....You try to lift your head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to smell the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize you were smoking, but not ultra lights...some jackass handed you Marlboro reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look in the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp \"Ready to Rock\" faintly atop your forehead...that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think of wearing is your \"Hello Kitty\" pajamas and your slippers.",

Because he had no money, he wanted the\nstate to pay the $5 million.\n\nA convicted New York rapist sued the state, claiming he lost sleep and\nsuffered headaches and chest pains after being given a \"defective\nhaircut\" by an unqualified barber.\n\nA Nevada inmate sued when he ordered two jars of chunky peanut butter\nat the Nevada State Prison canteen and received one chunky and one\ncreamy.\n\nA San Quentin death row inmate sued California, claiming his civil\nrights were violated because his packages were sent via UPS rather\nthan the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nAn Oklahoma inmate alleged his religious freedoms were violated but\ncould not say just how, because the main tenet of his faith was that\nall its practices were secret.\n\nAn Arizona inmate sued when he was not invited to a pizza party that\nprison employees held for a guard leaving his job.\n\nAn Indiana prisoner sued because he wanted to obtain Rogain for his\nbaldness.\n\nAn Ohio inmate sued for being denied possession of soap on a rope.\n\nAn Oklahoma inmate sued because he was forced to listen to country\nmusic.\n\nA Colorado con sued for early release because \"everyone knows a con\nonly serves about three years of a 10-year sentence.\"",

        "joke": "According to the FBI, most modern-day bank robberies are \"unsophisticated and unprofessional crimes,\" committed by young male repeat offenders who apparently don't know the first thing about their business. This information was included in an interesting, amusing article titled \"How Not to Rob a Bank,\" by Tim Clark, which appeared in the 1987 edition of The Old Farmers Almanac. Clark reported that in spite of the widespread use of surveillance cameras, 76 percent of bank robbers use no disguise, 86 percent never study the bank before robbing it, and 95 percent make no long-range plans for concealing the loot. Thus, he offered this advice to would-be bank robbers, along with examples of what can happen if the rules aren't followed:\n\nPick the right bank. Clark advises that you don't follow the lead of the fellow in Anaheim, Cal., who tried to hold up a bank that was no longer in business and had no money. On the other hand, you don't want to be too familiar with the bank. A California robber ran into his mother while making his getaway. She turned him in.\n\nApproach the right teller. Granted, Clark says, this is harder to plan. One teller in Springfield, Mass., followed the holdup man out of the bank and down the street until she saw him go into a restaurant. She hailed a passing police car, and the police picked him up. Another teller was given a holdup note by a robber, and her father, who was next in line, wrestled the man to the ground and sat on him until authorities arrived.\n\nDon't sign your demand note. Demand notes have been written on the back of a subpoena issued in the name of a bank robber in Pittsburgh, on an envelope  bearing the name and address of another in Detroit, and in East Hartford, Conn., on the back of a withdrawal slip giving the robber's signature and account number.\n\nBeware of dangerous vegetables. A man in White Plains, N.Y., tried to hold up a bank with a zucchini. The police captured him at his house, where he showed them his \"weapon.\"\n\nAvoid being fussy. A robber in Panorama City, Cal., gave a teller a note saying, \"I have a gun.  Give me all your twenties in this envelope.\" The teller said, \"All  I've got is two twenties.\" The robber took them and left.\n\nDon't advertise. A holdup man thought that if he smeared mercury ointment on his face, it would make him invisible to the cameras. Actually, it accentuated his features, giving authorities a much clearer picture. Bank robbers in Minnesota and California tried to create a diversion by throwing stolen money out of the windows of their cars. They succeeded only in drawing attention to themselves.\n\nTake right turns only. Avoid the sad fate of the thieves in Florida who took a wrong turn and ended up on the Homestead Air Force Base. They drove up to a military police guardhouse and, thinking it was a tollbooth, offered the security men money.\n\nProvide your own transportation. It is not clever to borrow the teller's car, which she carefully described to police. This resulted in the most quickly solved bank robbery in the history of Pittsfield, Mass.\n\nDon't be too sensitive. In these days of exploding dye packs, stuffing the cash into your pants can lead to embarrassing stains, Clark points out, not to mention severe burns in sensitive places -- as bandits in San Diego and Boston painfully discovered.\n\nConsider another line of work. One nervous Newport, R.I., robber, while trying to stuff his ill-gotten gains into his shirt pocket, shot himself in the head and died instantly. Then there was the case of the hopeful criminal in Swansea, Mass., who, when the teller told him she had no money, fainted. He was still unconscious when the police arrived.\n\n\nIn view of such ineptitude, it is not surprising that in 1978 and 1979,\nfor example, federal and state officers made arrests in 69 percent of\nthe bank holdups reported.",

Well, what about the guy who said I was\nscamming him?\"\n\"I think that is spamming, Moses.\"\n\"Oh, yeah. I e-mailed him back and told him I don't even eat that stuff,\nand I have no idea how you can send it to someone through a computer.\"\n\"And what he did say?\"\n\"You know what he said. He used Your name in vain. You don't think\nhe might have sent me one of those plagues, and that's the reason I\nlost those ten things, do you?\"\n\"They're called viruses, Moses.\"\n\"Whatever! This computer stuff is just too much for me. Can we just\ngo back to those stone tablets? It was hard on my back taking them\nout and reading them each day, but I never lost them.\"\n\"We'll do it the new way, Moses.\"\n\"I was afraid you would say that, sir.\"\n\"Moses, what did I tell you to do if you messed up?\"\n\"You told me to hold up this rat and stretch it out toward the computer.\"\n\"It's a mouse, Moses. Mouse! Mouse! And did you do that?\"\n\"No, I decided to try the technical support first. After all, who knows\nmore about this stuff than you, and I really like your hours. By the\nway, sir, did Noah have two of these mice on the ark?\"\n\"No, Moses.\"\n\"One other thing. Why didn't you name them frogs instead of mice,\nbecause didn't you tell me the thing they sit on is a pad?\"\n\"I didn't name them, Moses. Man did, and you can call yours a frog\nif you want to.\"\n\"Oh, that explains it. Kind of like Adam, huh, sir? I bet some woman\ntold him to call it a mouse. After all, wasn't it a woman who named\none of the computers Apple?\"\n\"Say good night, Moses.\"\n\"Wait a minute, sir. I am stretching out the mouse, and it seems to be\nworking. Yes, a couple of the ten things have come back.\"\n\"Which ones are they, Moses?\"\n\"Let's see. 'Thou shalt not steal from any grave an image and 'Thou shalt\nnot uncover thy neighbor's wife.'\n\"Turn the computer off, Moses. I'm sending you another set of stone\ntablets. How does 'Same Day Air' sound?\"",

Of the candidates investigated by the committee, only one was found to have the necessary qualities. The list contains the names of the candidates and comments on\neach, should you be interested in investigating them further for future pastoral placements.\n\nNoah: He has 120 years of preaching experience, but no converts.\n\nMoses: He stutters; and his former congregation says he loses his temper over trivial things.\n\nAbraham: He took off to Egypt during hard times. We heard that he got into trouble with the authorities and then tried to lie his way out.\n\nDavid: He is an unacceptable moral character. He might have been considered for minister of music had he not 'fallen.'\n\nSolomon: He has a reputation for wisdom but fails to practice what he preaches.\n\nElijah: He proved to be inconsistent, and is known to fold under pressure.\n\nHosea: His family life is in a shambles. Divorced, and remarried to a prostitute.\n\nJeremiah: He is too emotional, alarmist; some say a real 'pain in the neck.'\n\nAmos: Comes from a farming background. Better off picking figs.\n\nJohn: He says he is a Baptist but lacks tact and dresses like a hippie. Would not feel comfortable at a church potluck supper.\n\nPeter: Has a bad temper, and was heard to have even denied Christ publicly.\n\nPaul: We found him to lack tact. He is too harsh, His appearance is contemptible, and he preaches far too long.\n\nTimothy: He has potential, but is much too young for the position.\n\nJesus: He tends to offend church members with his preaching, especially Bible scholars. He is also too controversial.  He even offended the search committee with his pointed questions.\n\nAnd, our choice is:\n\nJudas: He seemed to be very practical, co-operative, good with money, cares for the poor, and dresses well. We all agreed that he is just the man we are looking for to fill the vacancy as our Senior Pastor.\n\nThank you for all you have done in assisting us with our pastoral search. \n\nSincerely,\nThe Pastoral Search Committee.",

        "joke": "To find out your car's astrological sign - look for a sticker on the inside of the driver's side door that gives you the exact month and year the car was manufactured. Car horoscopes are based month to month because they are created and assembled over a period of weeks and not just on one day.\n\nAries (April)\nThese cars are among the most reliable you can buy, but they do have aggravating characteristics. They commonly have squealing brakes and may be slow to start in the winter. Paint durability is not the best.\n\nTaurus (May)\nTaurean cars are strong, but cooling and electrical systems are troublesome. Engines are more durable than most and withstand considerable abuse. Heaters and air-conditioners are tip-top.\n\nGemini (June)\nCars manufactured under the sign of the twins tend to lead a dual life, running flawlessly one day and sputtering the next. They are extremely durable however and with a little elbow grease and mechanical know-how, you can keep them on the road forever.\n\nCancer (July)\nCancer cars tend to be well-crafted and rarely develop squeaks, leaks or rattles. On a low note, performance is middle of the pack and power options are fickle.\n\nLeo (August)\nThese cars tend to be unreliable and have engine, brake and suspension woes. But they can be a good buy if the price is right and you do very little driving.\n\nVirgo (September)\nCars built under the sign of Virgo are excellent highway cruisers but perform poorly in stop and go traffic. Clutch problems are a real nuisance. Best purchased with an automatic transmission.\n\nLibra (October)\nLibran cars are born to run and are top choices for hard-driving teens and hot-rodders. Excellent paint, but leaks and rattles are a given for autos made under the sign of the scales.\n\nScorpio (November)\nThese cars combine reliability, performance and durability to rate among the best of all autos. They tend to guzzle more gas than other cars. But they are still considered the \"best-bet\" for any driver.\n\nSagitarrius (December)\nSagittarian cars are timid performers regardless of engine size and are slightly less reliable than average. The good news is these autos love long trips, so they are best-suited for people who like to travel. But beware, they tend to be sluggish in city driving.\n\nCapricorn (January)\nLook out! Shoddy interiors and premature tire wear mar these otherwise strong performers. Reliable and responsive, Capricorn cars are a good choice if you can afford to keep them in rubber.\n\nAquarius (February)\nAquarian cars are slick performers and are extremely reliable in the short run. Rust can be a problem and dashboard readouts tend to be inaccurate. These cars are a great buy for people who plan to trade in for a new one every couple of years.\n\nPisces (March)\nPiscean cars are the cream of the cop but require more maintenance than most. Engines and transmissions are always strong performers and brakes are flawless. These cars are an excellent choice for motorists who like to tinker, visit auto parts stores and change their own oil.",

I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why:\n\n\nI drive 48 miles each way every day to work, that's 96 miles each day. Of these, 16 miles each way is bumper-to-bumper. Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway so if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car\nevery 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars.\n\nEven though the rest of the 32 miles is not bumper to bumper, I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day.\n\nStatistically, half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000.\n\nIn any given group of females, 1 in 28 has PMS. That's 642.\n\nAccording to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding.

That's 33.\n\nAccording to the National Rifle Association 5% of all females carry weapons and this number is increasing.\n\nThat means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, has PMS, and is armed.\n\nFlip one off?.......

        "joke": "August 1998 - Montevideo, Uruguay - Paolo Esperanza, bass-trombonist with the Simphonica Mayor de Uruguay, in a misplaced moment of inspiration, decided to make his own contribution to the cannon shots fired as part of the orchestra's performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture at an outdoorchildren's concert.\n\nIn complete seriousness he placed a large, ignited firecracker, supposedly equivalent in strength to a quarter stick of dynamite, into his aluminum straight mute and then stuck the mute into the bell of his quite new Yamaha in-line double-valve bass trombone. \n\nLater, from his hospital bed he explained to a reporter through bandages on his mouth, \"I thought that the bell of my trombone would shield me from the explosion and instead, would focus the energy of the blast outwards and away from me, propelling the mute\nhigh above the orchestra, like a rocket.\"\n\nHowever, Paolo was not up on his propulsion physics nor qualified to use high-powered artillery. In his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off, he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra.\n\nWhat actually happened should serve as a lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration. First, because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn, the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra, missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor, driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience.\n\nFortunately, the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury, for the chairs collapsed under them, passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them, who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on, like a row of dominos. The sound  of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically, adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the Overture.\n\nMeanwhile, all of this unplanned choreography notwithstanding, back on stage Paolo's Waterloo was still unfolding. According to Paolo, \"Just as I heard the sound of the blast, time seemed to stand still. Everything moved in slow motion. Just before I felt\nsearing pain to my mouth, I could swear I heard a voice with an Austrian accent say, 'Fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul unopposeet reakshon!'\" \n\nWell, this should come as no surprise, for Paolo had set himself up for a textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics. Having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone, he allowed the energy of the blast to send a superheated jet of gas backwards through the tubing of the trombone, through the mouthpiece, burning his lips and face.\n\nThe pyrotechnic ballet wasn't over yet. The force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny Yamaha right down the middle, turning it inside out, while at the same time propelling Paolo backwards off the riser. And for the grand finale, as Paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone, allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone's slide like a double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist, knocking him unconscious.\n\nThe moral of the story? Beware the next time you hear someone in the horn section yell out \"Hey, everyone, watch this!\"",

        "joke": "People who work in the fields of science and technology are not like other people.  This can be frustrating to the nontechnical people who have to deal with them.  The secret to coping with technology-oriented people is to understand their motivations.  This chapter will teach you everything you need to know.  I learned their customs and mannerisms by observing them, much the way Jane Goodall learned about the great apes, but without the hassle of grooming.\n\nEngineering is so trendy these days that everybody wants to be one. The word \"engineer\" is greatly overused.  If there's somebody in your life who you think is trying to pass as an engineer, give him this test to discern the truth.\n\nEngineer Indentification Test\n\nYou walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging crooked.\nYou...\n\n\nStraighten it.\nIgnore it.\nBuy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a solar-powered, self-adjusting picture frame while often stating aloud your belief that the inventor of the nail was a total moron.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C\" but partial credit can be given to anybody who writes \"It depends\" in the margin of the test or simply blames the whole stupid thing on \"Marketing.\"\n\nSocial Skills\nEngineers have different objectives when it comes to social interaction.\n\n\"Normal\" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from social interaction:\n\nStimulating and thought-provoking conversation\nImportant social contacts\nA feeling of connectedness with other humans\n\nIn contrast to \"normal\" people, engineers have rational objectives for social interactions:\n\nGet it over with as soon as possible.\nAvoid getting invited to something unpleasant.\nDemonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects.\n\n\nFascination with Gadgets\n\nTo the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of two categories: (1)things that need to be fixed, and (2)things that will need to be fixed after you've had a few minutes to play with them. Engineers like to solve problems.  If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.  Normal people don't understand this concept; they believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet.\n\nNo engineer looks at a television remote control without wondering what it would take to turn it into a stun gun.  No engineer can take a shower without wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering unnecessary. To the engineer, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and feature-poor toys.\n\nFashion and Appearance\n\nClothes are the lowest priority for a engineer, assuming the basic thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied.  If no appendages are freezing or sticking together, and if no genitalia or mammary glands are swinging around in plain view, then the objective of clothing has been met. Anything else is a waste.\n\nLove of Star Trek\n\nEngineers love all of the \"Star Trek\" television shows and movies.  It's a small wonder, since the engineers on the starship Enterprise are portrayed as heroes, occasionally even having sex with aliens.  This is much more glamorous than the real life of an engineer, which consists of hiding from the universe and having sex without the participation of other life forms.\n\n\nDating and Social Life\n\nDating is never easy for engineers.  A normal person will employ various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression of attractiveness. Engineers are incapable of placing appearance above function.\n\nFortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole.  They are widely recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable, employed, honest, and handy around the house.  While it's true that many normal people would prefer not to date an engineer, most normal people harbor an intense desire to mate with them, thus producing engineer-like children who will have high-paying jobs long before losing their\nvirginity.\n\nMale engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos in their mid thirties to late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistible\nmen in technical professions: \n\nBill Gates.\nMacGyver.\nEt cetera.\n\nFemale engineers become irresistible at the age of consent and remain that way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death.  Longer if it's a warm day.\n\nHonesty\n\nEngineers are always honest in matters of technology and human relationships. That's why it's a good idea to keep engineers away from customers, romantic interests, and other people who can't handle the truth. \n\nEngineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work.  They say things that sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could be expected to believe them. The complete list of engineer lies is listed below.\n\n\"I won't change anything without asking you first.\"\n\"I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow.\"\n\"I have to have new equipment to do my job.\"\n\"I'm not jealous of your new computer.\"\n\nFrugality\n\nEngineers are notoriously frugal.  This is not because of cheapness or mean spirit; it is simply because every spending situation is simply a problem in optimization, that is, \"How can I escape this situation while retaining the greatest amount of cash?\"\n\nPowers of Concentration\n\nIf there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything else in the environment.  This sometimes causes engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely.  Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have started checking resumes before processing the bodies.  Anybody with a degree in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he or she snaps out of it.\n\nRisk\n\nEngineers hate risk.  They try to eliminate it whenever they can.  This\nis understandable, given that when an engineer makes one little mistake,\nthe media will treat it like it's a big deal or something.\n\nExamples of Bad Press for Engineers\n\nHindenberg.\nSpace Shuttle Challenger.\nSPANet(tm)\nHubble space telescope.\nApollo 13.\nTitanic.\nFord Pinto.\nCorvair.\n\nThe risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this:\n\nRISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people.\nREWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.\n\nBeing practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks and\nrewards and decide that risk is not a good thing.  The best way to avoid\nrisk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for\nreasons that are far too complicated to explain.\n\nIf that approach is not sufficient to halt a project, then the engineer\nwill fall back to a second line of defense: \"It's technically possible\nbut it will cost too much.\"\n\n\nEgo\n\nEgo-wise, two things are important to engineers:\nHow smart they are.\nHow many cool devices they own.\n\nThe fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to declare that\nthe problem is unsolvable.  No engineer can walk away from an unsolvable\nproblem until it's solved.  No illness or distraction is sufficient to\nget the engineer off the case.  These types of challenges quickly become\npersonal -- a battle between the engineer and the laws of nature.\n\nEngineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem.\n(Other times just because they forgot.)  And when they succeed in\nsolving the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than\nsex--and I'm including the kind of sex where other people are involved.\n\nNothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion that\nsomebody has more technical skill.  Normal people sometimes use that\nknowledge as a lever to extract more work from the engineer.  When an\nengineer says that something can't be done (a code phrase that means\nit's not fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance at\nthe engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say something along\nthese lines:  \"I'll ask Bob to figure it out.  He knows how to solve\ndifficult technical problems.\"\n\nAt that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand\nbetween the engineer and the problem.  The engineer will set upon the\nproblem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.",

The next morning Mrs. Brown receives a phone call from the church secretary.\n\n\"Mrs. Brown,\" she says, \"Um, I loved your beans as always, but did you perhaps add\nanything, or change your recipe?\"\n\nMrs. Brown replied, \"Why No, it was the same recipe as I always prepare, Why?\"\n\nThe secretary says, \"Well, um, I bent over to feed my cat this morning, and I shot the Canary!\"",

I am a very sick little boy.\n\nMy mother is typing this for me, because I can't. She is crying. The reason she is so sad is because I'm so sick. I was born without a body.\n\nIt doesn't hurt, except when I try to breathe. The doctors gave me an artificial body. It is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us having no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money.\n\nMommy doesn't work because she said nobody hires crying people. I said, \"Don't cry, Mommy,\" and she hugged my burlap bag. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap and it makes her sneeze and chafes her real bad.\n\nI hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this email to everyone you know. Forward it to people you don't know, too. Dr. Johansen said that for every person you forward this email to, Bill Gates will team up with AOL and send a nickel to NASA. With that funding, NASA will collect prayers from school children all over America and have the astronauts take them up into space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will come back to earth and go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send all the money to the doctors. The doctors could help me get better then.\n\nMaybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Right now I can only be third base.\n\nEvery time you forward this letter, the astronauts can take more prayers to the angels and my dream will be closer to coming true.\n\nPlease help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn ten. If you don't forward this email, that's okay. Mommy says you're a mean and heartless nasty person who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long slow horrible death and then burn forever in hell.\n\nWhat kind of cruel person are you that you can't take five minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame about ignoring a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?\n\nPlease help me. I try to be happy, but it's hard.\n\nI wish I had a kitty.\n\nI wish I could hold a kitty.\n\nI wish I could hold a kitty that wouldn't chew on me and try to bury its poo in the leaves of my burlap body.

        "joke": "Hey Buddy,\n\nThere was a little \"incident\" at your house today while you were gone. Please allow me to explain:\n\nI was watching T.V. and I heard this beeping going off in the kitchen. The first thing I thought of was the smoke detector going off so I ran into the kitchen and checked everything out.  By the time I got to the kitchen, the beeping had stopped and I couldn't smell any smoke.\n\nI went back to watching my movie and I kept hearing a beep every minute. I knew that the type of smoke detector that you have is the  type that took a few minutes to reset itself. I kept watching my movie, and about 10 minutes later I was really getting my self in a bunchy twitch cause that beeping continued.\n\nI paused the movie, ran out to the kitchen, unhooked the detector, and went back to the movie.\n\nThe beeping continued.\n\nHaving a college degree in electronics, I knew that the capacitors could hold a charge after the batteries were removed.  About 20 minutes later, I was really getting heat stroke because I could still hear the beeping.  And I got so mad, I went out and grabbed a pair of wire cutters and cut the measly spud pocket speaker off the smoke detector and left it sitting on the counter.\n\nI sat back down and heard \"beep\".\n\nNow I was steamed. Just dang fuming.  I listened to that \"beep\" about three more times, then I finally got a hammer and pounded the ever loving life out of your smoke detector on the counter (while I was pounding I heard \"beep\").\n\nIt was really getting me mad.  I sat back down and resumed the movie and sure enough \"beep\".   I had the wire cutters in my hand and I went out (curious to see what the heck could still be running it) and cut  all the little parts into teeny tiny weenie pieces, and put  half into a little plastic  container and left half on the counter.  I took half the parts over to the living room thinking if it beeps I know it's these, and half the parts I left on the counter knowing it would be them.\n\nIn moments I heard the parts in the kitchen beep.  So I took them into the living room and spread them on the table, staring at them, saying to myself \"the part that beeps, will get smashed\"  Not three seconds later, the parts I just had, now on the counter in the kitchen beeped.  I was  furious.  I thought to myself, (his smoke detector is possessed).  I brought all the parts into the living room and laid them out on the coffee table.  I was staring at them,  just waiting for one of them to beep so I could smash the snot out of it.\n\nAll of a sudden, I hear \"beep\", but it was coming from the kitchen.  I walked out there, all freaked out.  I just waited.. and waited.. it seemed like hours but was only 30 seconds later, I heard the mystifying \"beep\" coming from your jacket.  I looked in the jacket and it was your beeper that you had left at home by accident.  All I could do was take my hammer and beat the ever loving snot out of your beeper because I was the one who paged you.",

        "joke": "In an effort to clarify questions about the purported durability and unusual\nphysical characteristics of Twinkies, I subjected the Hostess snack logs\nto the following experiments:\n\nExposure\nA Twinkie was left on a window ledge for 4 days, during which time an inch\nand a half of rain fell. Many flies were observed crawling across the Twinkie's\nsurface, but contrary to hypothesis, birds -- even pigeons -- avoided this\npotential source of substance.\n\nDespite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun, the Twinkie retained\nits original color and form. When removed, the Twinkie was found to be\nsubstantially dehydrated. Cracked open, it was observed to have taken on\nthe consistency of industrial foam insulation; the filling however, retained\nits advertised \"creaminess\"\n\nRadiation\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven, which was set for\nprecisely 4 minutes -- the approximate cooking time of bacon. After 20\nseconds, the oven began to emit the Twinkie's rich, characteristic aroma\nof artificial butter. After one minute, this aroma began to resemble the\nacrid smell of burning rubber. The experiment was aborted after 2 minutes\n10 seconds when thick, foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven.\nA second Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment; this Twinkie leaked\nmolten white filling. When cooled, this now epoxylike filling bonded the\nTwinkie to its plate, defying gravity: it was removed only upon application\nof a butter knife.\n\nExtreme Force\nA Twinkie was dropped from a ninth-floor window, a fall of approximately\n120 feet. It landed right side up, then bounced onto its back. The expected\n\"splatter\" effect was not observed. Indeed, the only discernible damage\nto the Twinkie was a narrow fissure on its underside; otherwise, the Twinkie\nremained structurally intact.\n\nExtreme Cold\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours. Upon removal,\nthe Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid, but its physical properties\nhad noticeably \"slowed\". The filling was found to be the approximate consistency\nof acrylic paint, while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering\nto practically any surface. It was noticed the Twinkie had generously absorbed\nthe freezer odors.\n\nExtreme Heat\nA Twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes. While the Twinkie smoked\nand blackened and the filling in one of its \"cream holes\" boiled, the Twinkie\ndid not catch fire. It did, however produce the same \"burning rubber\" aroma\nnoticed in the irradiation experiment.\n\nImmersion\nA Twinkie was dropped into a large bucket filled with water, the Twinkie\nfloated momentarily, then began to list and sink. Viscous yellow tendrils\nran off its lower half, possibly consisting of a water-soluble artificial\ncoloring. After 2 hours, the Twinkie bloated substantially. Its coloring\nwas now a very pale tan -- in contrast to the yellow, urine-like water\nthat surrounded it. The Twinkie bobbed when touched, and had a gelatinous\ntexture. After 72 hours the Twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of\nits original size. The water had turned opaque, and a small, fan-shaped\nspray of filling had leaked from one of the \"cream holes\". Unfortunately,\nefforts to remove the Twinkie for further analysis were abandoned when,\nunder light pressure the Twinkie disintegrated into an amorphous cloud\nof debris. A distinctly sour odor was noted.\n\nSummary of Results\nThe Twinkie's survival of a 120-foot drop, along with some of the unusual\nphenomena associated with the \"creamy filling\" and artificial coloring,\nshould give pause to those observers who would unequivocally categorize\nthe Twinkie as \"food\". Further clinical inquiry is required before any\ndefinite conclusions can be drawn.\n\nGreg Ricker\nWestinghouse Security Electronics",

        "joke": "Letter to Xerox and the Reply\n\nDear Kings of Kopiers:(feel free to use that) I just started a new job as an exterminator's assistant, and part of my job is mailing out invoices to our clients.  Today, while printing all the invoices, I ran out of printer paper, so I ran down to the local office supply store and picked up several boxes of Xerox MultiUse Paper.\n\nWhile the invoices were printing, I noticed something on the package of paper that concerned me, and I thought I'd better check with you about it. On the box, there is a little thing that says 99.99% jam free.  I know that sometimes wood finds its way into paper, but jam? I was always taught to keep all food and drinks away from\ncomputer equipment, especially something as sticky as jam.\n\nNow, I realize that it is a very small amount of jam in each piece of paper, but we use an awful LOT of paper, my friends, and all that jam is sure to add up.  Won't that adversely affect the life of our printer?  I mean, I'm sure you know what you're doing when it comes to paper, but we use more than the average consumer, so maybe we would be better off with a \"Jam-free\" paper, if you offer such a product.  I will look for it next time I am shopping, which will be soon, as I don't want to use any more of this paper until I find out if it's really safe.\n\nIf it is safe, why not say \"Contains .01% jam, but it's perfectly safe\" in big letters, since I'm sure that I am not the only one who has this concern.  You may end up selling a lot more paper that way.\n\nBy the way, I'm curious as to why you would even put jam in paper. Does it help bond everything together so it doesn't look like confettii? Just curious.  Also, I'd appreciate a Xerox keychain.\n\nThanks,\n\nDave Cilluffo\nPO Box 731\nEdinboro Pa 16412-0731\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your message.\nWe greatly appreciate your taking the time to send us your feedback regarding our 99.99% jam free paper.  We have restricted the manufacture of paper to the morning because we have so many folks who eat jam for lunch.  Nevertheless, it has been our experience that small amounts of jam have found its way into the paper via morning bagels and jam-filled\ndonuts.\n\nOur tests have shown that the .01% jam isn't harmful to machinery and you may continue to use it.  In fact the jam has improved the overall quality of the finished print.  However, you may have to keep a can of ant spray around.  You may wish to enhance paper\nperformance by using the 99.99% jam free paper with our new line of 99.99% peanut butter free paper.  They absolutely work best when used together.  Or if you prefer you can save time by using the 99.99% PB & J free paper.  Whatever you choose we are sure you will be pleased with the results. \n\nIn appreciation of your e-mail, we will be sending you a Xerox T- shirt. If we can be of other help in the future, please let us know.",
