The cruise ship swimming pools, a workout room, free washers and dryers, and shows every night. 4.  They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap and shampoo. 5.  They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient.  An extra $5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. 6.  I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days. 7.
