They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.\n The old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"",

        "joke": "Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.\n The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.\n However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.\n On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other\n The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.\n The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.\n Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.\n The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.\n The Rabbi pulled out an apple.\n With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!\n Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'\n Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'",

        "joke": "Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile... In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.\n One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher\u2019s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.\n Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! \u201cThank you, young men\u201d said the fairy, \u201cYour hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?\u201d\n \u201cThis is my friend Set, and you can call me \u2018Ep\u2019\u201d, said Amenhotep.\n \u201cVery well, Ep\u201d said the fairy \u201cWhat is the desire of your heart?\u201d\n \u201cI wish I was the strongest man in the world!\u201d Amenhotep wished. \n \u201cVery well\u201d, said the fairy, \u201cbut you must always use your strength to help others.\u201d Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. \n The fairy turned to Set \u201cAnd what is your wish, Set?\u201d\n Set responded \u201cI never want to be poor again! I wish for money!\u201d\n \u201cVery well,\u201d said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. \u201cGreetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!\u201d\n \u201cElmon is an expert in all things money,\u201d said the fairy, \u201cHe will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.\u201d\n Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname \u201cImp\u201d. With Elmon\u2019s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  \n Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. \n Ep and Set\u2019s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. \n As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.\n Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.\n Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature\u2019s effect on Set\u2019s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.\n Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.\n Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.\n Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set\u2019s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. \u201cCome, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let\u2019s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.\u201d\n Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon\u2019s murder.\n The case was brought before the court, but Set\u2019s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.\n Obviously, Ep\u2019s teen didn\u2019t kill Imp\u2019s elf.",

        "joke": "There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n Coincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n \"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n \"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n \"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n \"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n \"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n \"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n \"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n \"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n \"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n \"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n \"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n \"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n \"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n \"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n 3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n \"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n \"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n ... and what a dive...!\n Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n \"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n \"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n \"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n \"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n Then one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n \"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n \"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n up and up...\n below him the ship grew smaller...\n on and on...\n past a solitary albatross...\n and still higher...\n till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n and on still further...\n / till the ocean grew dim...\n and the earth itself...\n began to shrink...\n past our moon...\n and on...\n and Mars...\n and on...\n higher, and higher...\n through the asteroid belt...\n and on and on towards the diving board...\n past the outer planets, until...\n on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n he reached the board.\n He climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n and then...\n .'

That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n The tramp blushed.\n The captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n \"For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95\"\n The captain outrageously asked why.\n The tramp said ",

For instance, the priest never said, \"You may now kiss the bride\", but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.\n Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.\n As we passed, they all said in unison, \"You may now kiss the bride!\" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.\n As we walked away I asked, \"Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?\"\n My wife answered,\n \"In Soviet Russia, the punchline tells you!\"",

        "joke": "4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it. There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  \n   \n About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  \n   \n The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  \n   \n The grim reaper swears. \"Oh no! This always happens with identical twins\".  \n   \n \"What do you mean?\" asks the dentist.  \n   \n \"Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.\"  \n   \n The dentist is noticeably upset. He says \"Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.\"  \n   \n The grim reaper asks \"What do you have in mind?\"  \n   \n The dentist thinks. \"How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.\"  \n   \n The grim reaper laughs. \"I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?\"  \n   \n The dentist smiles. \"I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.\"  \n   \n \"Very well\" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  \n   \n Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. \"You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.\"  \n   \n The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  \n   \n It's unbelievable.  \n   \n The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  \n   \n The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. \"You win, human. This time. Your brother will live.\" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. \"Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.\"  \n   \n The dentist smiles on the phone and says. \"That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.\"",

None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.\n Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.\n But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.\n Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, \"Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.\"\n Curious, Attila did as he asked.\n Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.\n \"Now hold these in both hands,\" he instructed.\n Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.\n To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,\n \"Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.\"",

        "joke": "Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n \"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n \"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n The beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n \"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n The beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n ",

From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.

You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?\"\n The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.\n Again, the soldier asked, \"Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.\"\n The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, \"You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!\"\n The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.\n The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.\n An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, \"You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window!.\"\n ",

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.\n The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.\n However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.\n On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.\n The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.\n The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.\n Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.\n The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.\n The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.\n The Rabbi pulled out an apple.\n With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever.\n The Jews could stay in Italy!\n Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.\n The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!\"\n Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won.\n \"I don't have a clue!!!\" the Rabbi said.\n \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.\"\n \"And then what?\" asked a woman.\n \"Who knows!!\" said the Rabbi. \"He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!\"",
