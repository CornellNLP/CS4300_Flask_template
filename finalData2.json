Since 1950, Legal has been serving fresh seafood. It started out as a fish market in Cambridge next to Legal Cash Market. In 1968, the first Legal Seafood restaurant opened by the fish market. Through the years, Legal Seafood developed a good reputation resulting in a chain of restaurants beside the East Coast. One of them is this very location along the Boston Waterfront close to the New England Aquarium and The Long Wharf. It was at this very location, that I experienced a Boston seafood dinner. \n\n  This Legal Eagle is a large restaurant. Regardless that it was busy, we did not have to wait. As soon as we walked inside on a weekday afternoon, the hostess led us to the right to a table just beyond the humongous fish tank. The fish tank was pail in comparison to  Boston Harbor in front of the restaurant. From the time of being seated to the check, the service was satisfactory. Before we ordered, the server placed a bowl of warm dinner rolls with butter on the table. \n\n   I am a fan of Clam chowder soup and would feel bad if I spent a week in Boston without sampling authentic New England Clam Chowder soup. For the appetizer, I ordered a cup  of New England Clam Chowder soup ($6.75). The soup did not disappoint. \n\n  Deciding what to order was a challenge. There were quite a few choices. Knowing that this could possibly be the only time in my life eating seafood by the Boston Waterfront, I scrupulously looked at the choices. Owing to the fact that this is a seafood restaurant near the water in a major city, the prices were moderately high. The Legal's signature crab cake combo that I decided on was $30.95. For that price, I would have appreciated a larger portion comparable to seafood restaurant chains in the likes of Bubba Gump. I enjoyed every bite of the entr\u00e9e made up of garlic shrimp and scallops in mustard sauce, the Legal's signature crab cake, and rice (in place of salad).\n\n  Going back to Legal Seafood's motto: \"If it isn't fresh, it isn't legal;\" I am writing: \" it was fresh, so it is legal. It is legal for me to state my final thoughts on Legal Seafood. And my final thoughts are that Legal Seafood is good yet nothing to knock my socks off. I believe that psychologically the food tastes better because it is on the Boston Waterfront and the restaurant has a lot of history. If I was blindfolded in a landlocked city participating in a taste test with Legal Eagle verse Bubba Gump or Joe's Crab Shack; I think it would be a close call."}]}, "Espresso Minute": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "text": "Very good coffee and solid crepes.

It's not of the same quality and caliber as the other two but definitely much easier on the pocket. It is deceivingly small when you walk in through the door since it shares space with a Starbucks. There is a quick grab and go selection of Regina's pizza, hot subs, a few sushi items and poke bowl, snacks and drinks on the first floor. Then there is an escalator leading down to the larger even grander store below. You have a whole underground supermarket. There is a hot entree buffet, salad bar, sushi stand, hot pizzas, Asian foods, flower section, bakery, seafood, poultry, dairy, fruits and vegetables, home items, alcohol section, everything you could think of. There is a pharmacy as well. \n\nThe salad and soup bar has some basics items. Not that huge of a selection but decent enough. It does gets busy around lunch time however there is cashier strategically placed with two cashier running to help with the line just for four. There is also a small seating area if you want to eat quickly in store. I was able make my own custom salad with a little of everything for approximately $5. This is probably a better option than the pre-made salad. \n\nThere is also a hot entree buffet with mashed potato, macaroni and cheese, sweet potato \n, chicken ziti, pulled pork, chicken, and more. I have tried and liked the Italian flavored fried chicken from the hot entree buffet. My husband thought the bbq chicken wings was too sweet but my son liked it as well as the chicken tenders. I found the chicken to be a bit dried out. This was also true with their original flavor rotisserie chicken. I think this was because the chicken hung out beneath heated lights to stay warm but for too long?\n\nThe bakery section is also significant in size. There are muffins and danish for breakfast. There was also cupcakes frosted like a unicorn, sunflowers, and other autumn themed designs. The is perfect for office parties and not bad at $1.29 each. You can also get different sized cakes, unicorn design also available again. \n\nI have to say that the market sushi here is more affordable and probably better tasting than the ones at Wholes food. I haven't tried the poke bowl but have also heard positive reviews from my coworkers. You get a lot of options for $10 and under.

Rich folk, hookers, the Irish, Eastern European Jews, and eventually, people from Italy top-to-bottom, have all taken a turn at occupying the blocks running from today's Central Artery to the waterfront.\n\nBy 1930, the neighborhood was entirely Italian. But, over time, the housing stock deteriorated, while the City pursued a plan to improve Boston's transportation infrastructure, no matter the affect on its citizens, and the majority of Italians left the North End for the suburbs. \n\nMore recent preservation and investment have revitalized the old neighborhood, but, notwithstanding local efforts to hold onto the North End's Italian heritage, there are fewer Italian families living there now than at any time in the past 100 years, they having been replaced by gentrifying, white-collar singles.\n\nToday's North End resembles an Italian-American theme park, where more Italian restaurants operate now than did so 90 years ago, and where the occasional feast or procession will draw as many as a quarter-million visitors to a neighborhood of 10,000 residents. \n\nBut the restaurants serve good food, and the festivals are promoted by local Italian-Americans, so there's a thread of authenticity running through this scaled-up, 21st-century iteration of the North End as an ethnic haven.\n\nOne wonders what the rising population of Millennial renters will offer the community, when responsibility for its care falls to them."}]}, "Blue Wave": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 5, "text": "I am a tad bit biased in my review as I have met one of the owners through a former coworker, and he is ridiculously good-looking.

After pre-ordering our prix fixe dinner at reservation time, we arrived on a Saturday evening.  Our server then reconfirmed our orders for the evening, and took our salad dressing order as well.  We started off with the shrimp cocktail and the calamari, which was slightly over fried.  Next, our salad came out with the wrong dressing for both salads, and both salads had rotted lettuce and spinach in them.  At that point, we didn't say anything, but were a little upset.  \n\nThe real kicker was when the server came out with a salmon entree and a lamb entree instead of steak as we ordered.  We sent the lamb back because we had ordered the steak.  About 5 minutes later, the server came back with the lamb dish, and we were told the kitchen misunderstood, and there were no more steak entrees so they couldn't give us steak.  About 5 minutes later, the table next to us got a steak entree served to them.  The lamb dish at that time was cold and rubbery, and the brussels sprouts were under cooked, leaving that entire entree inedible.  Throughout the night, the service was slow, with about a 15-20 minute wait between each course.  With only about 10 tables total and 3 servers, the lack of timely courses was a little unexpected.\n\nAfter dessert, we requested that the server bring us a manager's name and contact information.  He didn't bring us a business card or any information written down, but stood there awkwardly waiting for us to get our phones out to input the information in our phones.  After that, he reminded us that gratuity wasn't included and that we would be expected to pay that.  Even though we had a very subpar experience, we wanted to leave the tip, but he stood there waiting for us to pull out some cash.  When we asked if we could leave the tip on a credit card, he asked us to follow him to the concession stand counter to pay, instead of taking our card himself.  When we got to the counter, they didn't have any way of taking payment for gratuity, so the girl at the counter had to charge us $1 for an employee drink, then have us leave a tip on top of that.  In addition, the receipt printer was not working, so we were not even able to get a receipt for the transaction.  \n\nAt the end of the night, because we were extremely unsatisfied with the dining experience, we decided to contact the management of the restaurant.  It took a very long time for him to respond, and he responded with a \"thanks for letting us know\".  There was not any resolution provided to our detailed account of the evening.

I found the pasta in the bread to be a bit heavy, the cheese was lost a bit in the chorizo flavor, and there were no onions to be found in the sandwich anywhere. Really, the cheese should always be the star in a grilled cheese, right?\n\nThe Green Muenster was better: the guacamole was solid and fresh, the muenster was melted nicely, and the bacon was crisp. The peppery-ness of the guac played nicely with the slightly sweet maple bacon. The only downside was that the bread was a bit overdone and tough in spots. I'd come back for this.\n\nThe onion rings were a mess. My girlfriend commented, and rightfully so, that the deep fryer must have been too cool as the rings weren't crispy but the onions were absolutely mushy inside; no flavor to the rings either. A lot of it went right to the trash. \n\nThe soups that came with the sandwiches were quite nice. Basil and tomato that would rival most bistro soups served in a \"shooter\" cup. A great accompaniment to the mac n cheese but not so much to the guac/muenster. Multiple soup offerings would be fantastic. \n\nSome suggestions: \n\n1) The prices are fairly high. $7 for a grilled cheese and a tiny cup of soup is going to turn a lot of people off. If you can work it out to bring this down to $5.50 you'll see more turnover and sustained college business, I think. Having a lunch special or late night special (sandwich, soup, and drink) for $7-7.50 would make more financial sense to most buyers.\n\n2) You need to be prepared for people to do take away business. Plastic/paper bags, napkins, lids for the soups, etc. \n\n3) A more efficient line-cooking method. It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes for a sandwich to be out of the window. 3-4 minutes would be efficient, based on other successful trucks I've visited in other cities. Low melting point cheeses, prepped bins for each sandwich, etc. \n\n4) Having the ability to order a large soup would be useful as it was quite nice and could be a high margin sales source for you. \n\n5) Don't push anything out of the window that you aren't satisfied with. The missing onions on the Mac and Cheese and the mushy onion rings should never have made it to us. Quality control is super important to repeat business; varying quality is one of the major reasons restaurants go out of business.\n\n6) Continue to interact and take comments from customers seriously, be it in person or through Twitter/Facebook. You have a quality concept and fill a need in the area. Gourmet food at a reasonable price in an area filled with college foodies bereft of quality food options.\n\nI recommend other Yelpers give these guys a shot."}]}, "Oppa Sushi": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 11, "text": "Oppa Sushi's Chef's special is it's stand out factor. \n\nIt's a great option for celebrating birthdays or a special occasion because you will be wowed by the presentation and number of dishes included. \nThey will adjust the portion according to the size of your party, but for the most part to comfortably finish everything-you should have at least 3-4 people to your party. \n\nThe Chef's special is fish/seafood themed that is comprised of 2 courses.

That, by the way, is absolutely zero excuse for the behavior I witnessed.\n\nWe ordered delivery from Lilli's through Foodler.Com, as we often order delivery through the same site and generally have no issues.

I said it was no big deal, and he countered with 'It is a big deal' and he outright refused to cancel my order.  This was after the order was 45 minutes AFTER it was supposed to arrive.\n\nHe argued with me saying that I shouldn't listen to Foodler's delivery estimates (that are generally accurate) and that it was raining and all these other things, and I just kept telling him that I wanted to cancel the order.  He continued to refuse and insisted that the food would be there in 4-5 minutes.  I gave up.\n\nThe food arrived 10 minutes later.  In hindsight, I should have simply refused the delivery.  The food was not hot.  They didn't even bother to include the marinara with the lukewarm garlic bread (as stated on the menu).

I approach the manager, and tell her we need 5 taxis. Again, she does not apologize or offer any suggestions. I had to rush the whole dinner process - 20 women eating a \"3 course meal\" in one hour.  As part of our SET meal, we were supposed to have a dessert. Since we did not have time for this dessert, the manager offers us complimentary italian ices, \"because they made us wait.\"  We were already PAYING for a dessert, so I was extremely offended that she tried to offer these as as complimentary.

Their sandwiches are WAY overpriced. I bought a breakfast sandwhich and bagel w/cream cheese the other day and the total was over $9. That means the breakfast sandwich is about $7. Nothing is made fresh there. Bagels are store brought and I can assume their other ingredients are frozen that they just heat up since they don't really have a kitchen. \n\nThere's tvs \nthere that usually display their menu, but it's not on anymore for some reason. So you have to order off a little postcard that doesn't have the price of anything.\n\nOnly thing worth it here is their coffee because of all the different flavors they have (cinnamon toast crunch, samoa, thin mint, etc.) But if you want breakfast foods, save your money and go across the street to Dunkin Donuts. Same quality for half the price. And you know they'll get your order right there."}]}, "Brew": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 4, "text": "I was falling asleep at my desk when my boss casually mentioned a new coffeeshop that had opened up near our office.

First of all, it's unmarked from the street if you're walking along Seaport Boulevard, and once you get to the District Hall building none of the doors are marked with a logo, either. If you can find the door marked 75 Northern Ave, though, and step through, Gather restaurant will be to your left with Brew to the right.\n\nBrew offers typical fare like bagels, fruit, sandwiches and coffee, and not-so-typical things like nutella crepes, bags of cracker jacks, a huevos rancheros burrito and a frozen cappuccino. To my surprise, they also carry four beers on tap -- the ones available this afternoon were Sam Adams Lager and a seasonal, Whale's Tale Pale Ale and Notch Session. The prices are reasonable for the neighborhood, and they accept LevelUp so I got $2 off my first purchase (not beer, I swear). \n\nThe cafe is pretty small, though there's a huge meeting space right in front of it with a bunch of chairs and tables. The furniture is minimalist, but a staff member told me they have an order in for more comfortable seating -- I can picture this place being a very cozy spot in the winter for local businesses holding informal meetings, especially with the free WifFi and idea paint walls. I was also told you can order takeout from Gather during the day if you'd like additional lunch options. \n\nThe staff was attentive and happy to answer questions; you can tell they're proud of working in District Hall.

The boba were a bit on the smaller side, and less gelatinous and more chewy, and just a tad sweet -- all in all, very yummy. The tea itself was also quite good, although light on the tea flavor and heavy on the molasses. I actually loved the smokey, spicy bite of the molasses but I could see it being a little bit much for people who are more used to traditional milk tea.\n\nWe also couldn't resist the flaming hot Cheetos crinkle cut fries.

Finally a sit down, casual Indian place that's reasonably priced and doesn't require half an hour each way on the T to get to!  Even on their first day open, their food is better than several of the Indian restaurants in the Boston area that I've eaten at.  \n\nTucked away across from the Sutherland Road T stop, you can follow your nose to the doorstep of the restaurant.  The interior tastefully restrained, bright colors and some simple paintings above the booths.  The space is small, but not cramped and the booth seating at least was very comfortable.\n\nThe three gentlemen who own/run the front of the house are eager to please.  We were seated right away and given water and menus.   The menu is comprehensive without being too large and confusing.  The vegetarian, and meat sections are both equally sized, so there's plenty of options for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  \n\nMy wife and I started out with the vegetable pakoras.  These little fritters of batter and veggies were served hot, with a little bit of salty spice powder and dipping sauces.  The crunchy shell pairs nicely with the soft veggies inside and tastes amazing when you put a bit of the red onion chutney on it.  \n\nFor our main course we ordered the saag paneer and the dal makhani, two of our favorite vegetarian dishes in Indian cuisine.  The dal makhani was subtle, not overly spiced and not overly rich like many I've had.  The lentils weren't rock hard or cooked into mush.  The star of the show was definitely the saag paneer though.  The saag was so wonderfully rich and smooth and spiced perfectly, and the paneer was the perfect texture, not too soft and mushy and now dry and crumbly.  \n\nWe decided to leave room for some desert and tried both the gulab jamun and the kheer.  The kheer was a bit under seasoned for my taste, not enough rose water or cardamom and a bit on this thin side, but it served as a nice palate cleanser.  The gulab jamun was excellent, the syrup not too sweet or floral and the balls had a nice subtle flavor to them as well.\n\nI'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Vaisakhi, but I would gladly travel a lot further for this food."}]}, "Cultivar": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 7, "text": "I went to cultivar tonight with a co-worker and was so excited to check it out.

The interior of the restaurant was perfect - modern but comfortable, awesome decor all around the restaurant and great atmosphere all in all. By 8:30, it was pretty bustling inside with the late dinner crowd, but not overwhelmingly loud, which made conversing with my company, waiters, etc. much easier than other places.\n\nFood:\nWater chestnuts: I don't know what water chestnuts are, and had to google what it looked like, but the slightly sweet chestnut with the salty bacon wrapped around it was a great start & a surprisingly addicting plate -- highly recommended\n\nSpicy wings:\nA spicier, saucier version of some of the Korean wing chains in boston. I personally never order spicy wings, but these were delicious! The meat was soft and moist, the sauce was abundant but not overwhelming, and gochujang sauce was peculiar in a way that made it more flavorful than the common spicy wings out there.\n\nCheese steak dumplings:\nThese were gone within 5 minutes of it arriving. That's how delicious it was. The fried dumplings were especially crispy on the outside to the point where you could hear the \"crunch\", but then hot and warm in the inside. The cheese was what I really loved though - it was perfectly creamy and slightly salty enough to season and compliment the dumplings. -- highly recommended\n\nHot stone bibimbap:\nThe hot stone makes ALL the difference when it comes to bibimbap. And trust me, I know my rice dishes lol. That crunchy layer of rice you get when the rice is sitting in the hot stone for a few minutes is THE BOMB. Make sure to mix up those veggies well and have a bite into heaven -- highly recommended\n\nShort Rib Stew (galbi jjim):\nI loooooove galbi jjim. And my mom makes a mean one. And this was almost as good, and that means a lot. It was slightly on the sweeter side, which my friend actually preferred. We ate all the short rib, and put the left over rice into the stew, and the result was heavenly - sweet, savory, and hearty.\n\nPepper Octopus Leg (MUST GET):\nMan, the visual of this dish is 5 stars in the first place. That long perfectly braised octopus on top of red pepper salad and delicious chili mayonnaise. I've had a lot of octopus dishes (it seems to be quite a popular ingredient recently) and I've never seen it come out like this! At first I was worried that it would be hard to cut the leg, but man, the soft octopus leg just breaks and melts into the knife. So soft, yet chewy and delicious. Make sure to grab that red pepper to add a crunch to the bite! -- HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nDessert: French Toast\nSweet brioche, topped with ice cream, dark chocolate, and coffee-boiled peanuts? How could this NOT be amazing? I was the perfect finish to a great meal.\n\nDrinks:\nSoju Sangria:\nIf you're into sweeter, fruitier drinks, go with this. Even if you're not a fan of soju. The lychee, aloe, lemon makes the drinks SO DELICIOUS. I was slurping this down and could not believe it was alcoholic! -- highly recommended\n\nBlackberry ginger smash:\nThis drink is also fruity, but taste slightly stronger than the soju sangria. But the subtle ginger scent and the bits and pieces of blackberry was a good combination.\n\nThe classy drunk:\nThis was my favorite drink, and my friend also said it was the best one. If you like whiskey, this is the drink to get. Sometimes I'm put off by that sting that whiskey has sometimes, but this drinks was perfect. It was a good cocktail that you weren't slurping down, but could enjoy each sip slowly in a conversation. My friend got it over ice, and it was just as good actually. -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nService:\nService was exceptional. I was carrying a big bag, and immediately the girl at the front opened the door for me, which was so nice. When I was seated, the service was fast and very courteous, and very helpful with the menu too actually. The waiter and owners stopped by numerous times to make sure the food was to our likings, and we really appreciated their meticulous care.\n\nOne of the best I've had in boston so far, and would definitely love to come again."}]}, "Prudential Center": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 150, "text": "The Prudential Center is a major office and mall complex in Boston's renowned Back Bay.

The food, wine, service, and view were all excellent. So when my friend suggested hitting it up for this year's restaurant week, I was immediately on-board. We made our reservations three weeks in advance - even though 9 pm on a Tuesday was the earliest they could take us. Seemed a bit late, but I figured we'd get seated and hopefully finish by 10:30. Not the worst thing. We got dressed up, braved a storm, and made it about 10 minutes before our reservation. \n\nThe host told my friend they were running 20 minutes late, so we sat quietly in the waiting area. After 35 minutes, my friend checked in again. The host was visibly annoyed and didn't have an update for her. My friend politely asked if we could have some drink menus. I was already over it at this point. I didn't really feel like drinking, I'd rather just sit down and eat but that apparently wasn't possible, even though we had a reservation. He brought us some menus but no one ever came back to take our drink order. So we sat there until 9:50, when one of us finally made the executive decision to leave. I was really glad she did. I had no desire to drop $60 on a meal that starts some time after 10 on a Tuesday night in a place where there was zero customer service.

She hadn't heard from the manager by the time this review was written. \n\nIn the end, we went through the Wendy's drive through. Our food was hot and fresh, and the service was about 1,000 times better than it was at Meritage.\n\nHere's the thing: I understand when restaurants have scheduling snafus.

I can't remember if I'd ever had a banh mi that had fish sauce in it, but it was a little runny and drippy for me in addition to making my fingers smell fishy. The cuts of meat were pretty thin, so thin that it was hard to tell they were pork. We also had some pieces of beef, which weren't all that great.

They never will.\n\n3) The waiter will give you a menu.  Please, for the love god, don't open it.  It's a trick to spot amateurs.  Just order a lamb appetizer, a sausage appetizer, a garlic and sausage pizza, and a garlic and cheese pizza, and a round of Labatts or Molsens.\n\n4) Don't ask for anything dainty.  My friend brought his prissy girlfriend here once, and she asked for coffee, and the waiter said, \"honey, we don't got coffee.\"  And then she said, \"what about tea?\"  And he said \"no tea either.\"  And then she asked, \"do you have anything hot?\"  And he pointed to himself and said \"you're looking at it\" and walked away.\n\n5) Finish everything.  Leftovers are for wimps.\n\n6) Bring cash.  No credit cards accepted.\n\n7) If you come here with me, and you don't rave about the pizza in between every bite, then you suck, and you can consider it the end of our friendship.

By the time I got there they were all wrapping things up and getting ready to leave, so I decided to wait to start drinking until the next stop. The group seemed to have had a good time (but not an overly good time). When they got the bill they noticed they had been charged for 6 beers a piece instead of the 4 they had actually drunken. Like any normal person would they flagged down their waitress and pointed out that she had made a mistake. Rather than apologize and fix her error she insisted that this was 'impossible', that they must have had 6 beers each. I can tell you from the conversations I was having with these ladies that they had not had 6 beers a piece and I know from working in the industry that it is entirely possible to make this mistake.\n\nAnyways the waitress involved a manager (good going), and we thought ahh yes, a manager will take care of this (as that is what managers are supposed to do). Well the manager said he would take one round off but that he absolutely could not take two off. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! And he proceeded to refuse, so my friends told him that they were only willing to pay for what they drank, so he told us that he would call the cops. AND HE DID! At this time it was a little before 11pm, and he couldn't manage the bar in which he is the manager and felt the need to call the cops. The waitress had mentioned that he has a temper, so I guess he just lost it, not a great quality in a manager. However we did wait patiently to explain to the police officers the details of the dispute, the manager refused to even talk to us at this point, insisting only on talking to the officers.

Two that he felt the need to waste tax dollars to have the police come to try to scare women into paying for 8 beers that they did not drink. And three, it is illegal to over serve someone, which is what would have been the case if these ladies had actually consumed the amount of alcohol that Dillon's was claiming.\n\nMy only hope is that these managers continue to run the bar like this because that at rate they'll run it right into the ground (maybe like the sister restaurant Purple Shamrock?).

Myself (caucasian) and my two friends (one caucasian one 1/2 black 1/2 caucasian but looks more black) walk up to the bouncers to see about going inside. There is no line. My male friend (the mixed race individual) walks first, myself and my female friend hang back. The bouncer tells him that he can't come in because he's wearing sneakers. Ok, totally cool and understandable.... that's your deal, that's the dress code... no biggie. It's understandable that if you have a specific dress code, a guy wearing sneakers, baggy jeans, leather jacket, and sock hat wouldn't be let in. Fine... we were prepared for this and assumed it might happen. What we weren't prepared for is as follows...\n\nA young man and woman approach (both caucasian). I see that the guy is wearing sneakers, baggy jeans, a hoodie sweatshirt, and a RedSox ball cap. The girl is not dressed up either. I say to them as they approach when I see his sneakers \"They didn't let him in because of his shoes, so I don't know if they'll let you in.\" They state their disappointment - and the guy even makes a joke about a visible hole in one of his shoes calling it a \"designer hole\". The girl says \"I wonder if we can talk to them, let's try.\"\n\nWe hang around to wait and see if they let them in. At first, the bouncer tells them the same thing they told my friend, but with a slight head tilt from the girl, they let them in! I pause for a moment and I think \"did that really just happen?\" I'm in total shock. The following exchange occurs:\n\nMe:You're going to let them in and you just told my friend he couldn't come in because of his shoes? Seriously?\nBouncer:We have a dress code, your friend had on sneakers.\nMe: That's fine, but so did that guy, AND his shoes had a hole in them, that's not cool.\nBouncer: Your friend was also wearing baggy jeans and a hat.\nMe: Seriously? That guy has on sneakers with a hole in them, baggy jeans, a hoodie sweat shirt, and a ball cap - there is no difference man.\nBouncer: I'm sorry - that's just how it goes.\nMe: That's not cool, that's all I'm saying... if you have a dress code, fine, but don't let one person in who is wearing nearly the same outfit and not the other guy, that's just wrong.\n\nI walk away appalled at what just occurred. Maybe I should consider myself fortunate that I have never experienced something like that in my life... but it really made me sick to my stomach.\n\nFelt, if you have a dress code - make sure your bouncers apply the same restrictions to EVERYONE - regardless of gender, class, race, etc etc etc. What happened tonight was extremely wrong, and I think it will be a long time coming before I set foot in your establishment again. In fact, I'm so outraged by this that it's not only my Yelp review that is giving you a 1 star review - my word of mouth is going to give you one as well.... and I have a big mouth. To go from 4 stars to 1 in a single moment... crazy.... but I wish I could go one step further and give you negative stars. Bad move Felt, bad move."}]}, "Cottonwood Cafe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 7, "text": "Frankly, I was disappointed with the Cottonwood Cafe. One downside to reading fellow Yelpers' reviews of a restaurant prior to dining there - if the place got mult. 5-star ratings, it's immediately held to higher standards by me. So *maybe* I would have given Cottonwood Cafe 4 stars had I not seen all the great reviews beforehand. Or maybe not.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, a quick recap: Spinach & Artichoke Dip earned positive remarks by all, as did the Crab Cakes. Potstickers were fairly nasty (but duh, should have known not to order that from a Southwestern joint). My main dish, the Enchilada Verdes, was unremarkable at best. Very little Verdes sauce. Dry chicken. Bleh. Margaritas were also just so-so, though I was coerced into ordering the super-sweet frozen strawberry pitcher when I should have gotten the traditional standby on the rocks.

I've seen four shows there, and they have run the gamut from best concert experience I've ever had to hands-down worst.\n\nI'm going to assume you're not going to pay good money to see a shitty band or artist that you absolutely hate, so I'll skip that part. The acoustics of the venue are great so whoever you see, they will sound amazing. The atmosphere of the place is kind of like seeing a really intimate bar show...except in a really big bar with an awesome lighting and sound system. So really...how much fun you have comes down entirely to where you sit.\n\nIf you're seeing your favorite band, get a general admission ticket and get there EARLY. For most concerts, if you eat dinner beforehand in the restaurant and spend at least $10, you can show your receipt at the door and skip the line. Any time you get a GA ticket, you need to find out whether you can do this and if you can, DO THIS. The food is okay (not the best thing I've ever eaten but it's really not bad either...typical American fare done decent), and it's worth it for the chance to be right next to the stage. If you're stuck somewhere in the middle of the sea of GA bodies and you're not at least six feet tall, you will see nothing and you will get stepped on. And I don't care how early you get there. It will not be early enough to guarantee you that spot. Because there will always be a hundred someones who are even more of a fanatic than you are about this particular band. Just...trust me on this.\n\nDon't do the mezzanine, ever. Just don't. Even if it's your favorite band and they're the only tickets available. There's no point. It will only be a disappointment. The view is shitty from every angle. You're high up and far away from the stage, there's nowhere to sit, and unless you're in the first wave of people to arrive up there and get right by the rails, you're not going to be able to see even the shitty view that's available. The acoustics up there aren't as good, either. The crowd noise from below and around you blends in with the band noise, and occasionally drowns it out. You will find yourself wanting to strangle people. The only advantage to being in the mezzanine is being right next to the bar, so that you can drink to forget the awful concert experience you're currently putting yourself through.\n\nIf you're going to see a band/artist you like, but not enough to spend two to three hours being touched by tons of sweaty strangers (who are all taller than you) and fallen into repeatedly by loud, overly-affectionate and friendly drunk people--it happens, there's always at least one--I'd recommend the seated areas up top. You're far from the stage, but at least you're not stuck in the back on the floor, standing, unable to see anything. Or God forbid, in the mezzanine...still standing, still unable to see anything. The view is great from up high, you still get good access to the bar, and hey...not every show is a stand-up-and-mosh show, you know?"}]}, "300 Saratoga Cafe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 15, "text": "Absolutely the rudest places I've been in Boston.

Perhaps you are pissed that you have lost a place where popping your collar is considered the norm. Perhaps you miss the 5 or 6 early morning drunkards that take up the bar the entire day. Or maybe you miss the filth and scum that was never cleaned in the old place. Gee, that's just too bad, I guess you will have to find another spot where it is acceptable to bath in cologne, pop a collared paisly shirt, and try and mac dude's girlfriends when the gentlemen steps out to use the restroom. \n\nThe new Ave is a welcome change to the area. I, for one, do miss the cheap prices of beer of the old Ave, but are you seriously going to gripe about a 1$ change in price for Budweiser? If you are that kind of person, perhaps you should stay at home and drink PBR's. No one is going to miss you. \n\nI stopped in here today to try some of their new food items and take a look at the place. WOW, this place is actually clean now! OK, I can admit, perhaps their paint job of the bar was a bad idea, but everything else seems to be looking up. I no longer have to sit at the bar wondering if the smell coming from behind it was cleaning products that didn't work as they were intended to, or dead rats festering under sinks.\n\nI ordered a Bud, some wings, and one of their burgers with bacon and cheddar. Their beer prices are now clearly marked on a big board to eliminate the guess work for money minded folks. Guess what, Bud is 3$. That isn't bad if you are going to sip some beers while watching a game. The burger was a 4 ounce handmade patty, with thick apple wood smoked bacon, and equally thick cheddar, served on a toasted roll. The fries, which costs 1$ to add them, were crispy, and well seasoned. I think the burger and french fry combo sets you back about 5 bucks. This wasn't too bad, I felt great after finishing it, and I didn't miss the lethargic feeling that you often get after eating too much. If you go to Sunset, you have to pay to add fries to your burger too, and in the end, it ends up costing you around 9$. So stop your belly whining people!\n\nThe wings were in a class of their own in my opinion. I gave the \"Mind Eraser\" wings a shot, being that they were supposed to be the hottest they had. Well, my mind wasn't erased, but that is perfectly acceptable. The flavor was great, a perfect amount of bite, with a cooling sweetness, and of course a great crisp. The wings were plentiful and meaty. I have no complaints there. \n\nSo why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, it was 12 in the afternoon and I have yet to see what happenings go on at night. I didn't see any of the table taps that they used to have, but in reality, those were a novelty more than anything else. Our bartender was spot on, and noticed immediately when my beer needed to be refilled. This is a welcome change from the last crew that they had, where they would stand on the end of the bar talking to the trashiest drunk Allston girls all night, conveniently forgetting about the people sitting at their bar who were going to actually buy stuff and end up tipping them. \n\nSo to all you nay-sayers out there, I say deal with it. Most of the people complaining are the exact type of people that I would not like to sit next to while watching a game anyway.

It is a cozy little taqueria-style restaurant with a Bolivian side-menu. We went on a Sunday and the weekend specials were Pozole (a meaty stew with beef, pork, chicken, and hominy), and lechon (roasted pig). We tried one Beef and one Chicken saltena (Bolivian breakfast/brunch pastry) each, and some of the lechon on a tostada (the owner was nice enough to let us sub this meat onto the more traditional beef/chicken tostada). Let me first say that making saltenas is an art form that takes years to perfect, since you're basically baking beef or chicken soup into a sweet pastry without having any of the juices leak out. Not easy (trust me, I've tried - and failed- many times). The beef saltena was the tastier of the two, with great spices that had probably marinated with the beef for quite a few hours before being put into the pastry. However, the beef saltena was also a bit drier. The chicken saltena was a bit milder in taste, but FULL to the brim with soup liquid! It was fantastic, just like being in Bolivia again :) The lechon tostada was also delicious. I made sure to try some lechon on its own, and the taste, once again, is the authentic homestyle lechon I am used to having around the table for my family dinners. Hard to describe, you just have to try it yourself.\n\nOverall, a gem of a restaurant. The owner spent quite a bit of time in Bolivia perfecting these recipes, and his mother's (I think) side of the family is native of Bolivia. Note that the Bolivian dishes are only available on weekends (sat/sun) because, as the owner explained, the weekends are the only times his mom is available to help him cook :).

The Point is along the Boston Freedom Trail between Faneuil Hall and Haymarket in the shadow of the Rose Kennedy Greenway and North End off a gray cobblestone alleyway named Marshall Street. The Point is incorporated in a pointed section of a historical building that can be traced to 1795 when the attached Bell In Hand Tavern opened that year. In the heart of this historical district it is also a few cobblestone steps from the Ebenezer House built in 1767. The Point is so rich in history that it seemed more realistic that I could run into Sam Adams instead of drinking a Sam Adams. But it would drink a Sam Adams and picture him in this neighborhood hundreds of years ago. \n\n   It is fitting that I would have a Sam Adams in the Point. Boston is Sam Adams Country! Additionally, the historical district that is home to the Point is also home to bars that create a happening night-time scene. On the Saturday night we ended up at the Point, the nearby bars and restaurants were packed making it laborious to find a place to sit for dinner and a beer. We just happened to find a vacant table in the Point. And so I was one of hundreds of people enjoying the Boston bar scene on Saturday night. If I didn't chose to enjoy it with a Sam Adams their beer menu features nine other drafts. \n\n Leading into my recollection of my dining adventure here, I will pass on the tip that pubs usually serve premium hamburgers. The Point does justice to this tip. I ordered the Haymarket burger with fries and a sliced pickle. This premium hamburger was loaded with lettuce, tomato, cheese, mushrooms, and red onions. It was four stars worthy delicious. With the hamburger, I ate my brother's salad that came with his meal (he does not care for salad). This was a generous sized portion. \n\n  The menu is more than burgers. It includes sandwiches, pizza, and numerous pub entrees. The menu is a fun read because the categories and some of the food is named after nearby Boston points of interest. Two examples are the salad section is the Rose Kennedy Greenway and the appetizers are the Haymarket starters. \n\n   We took in the food and beer from a table near the door leading to the cobblestone alleyway. The room, which by the way is the lower of the two floors, was an interesting place to spend time in. The pointed layout is near the bar and across from an area where a band was setting up. From the point the tables also converge. \n\n  I got the impression that only two people were running the show. They were a young man and woman. They would transition between server,  busses, and bartender. Considering how busy it was on a Saturday night, I was impressed by their work ethic. \n\n  At this point in the Review it is time to stop talking about the Point and get to the point.

This is my first one star review and hopefully my last one.\n\nThe beginning of the night was going fine. We had a group of 7 people playing 1 game. 2 people had to leave by the end of the 1st game, so the receptionist was told that we'd like to start a 2nd game- but only for 5 people. It was repeated TWICE to her that we'd only have 5 people playing to the second game. \nWe paid our dues, and she said we were set. Never were we told we had to physically remove the 2 people on the list. The ones that were sitting down by the screen never saw any notification we had to remove 2 people before the new game started either. \n\nWe did find it strange that there were still 7 names on the list when a new game was set, but we passed it off since there were no prompts for us to remove anyone and she already knew about our 5 people deal. We just treated those 2 pseudo players as practice throws. \n\nNeedless to say we were surprised the screen froze and said it's time to start a new game when we were on our 7th frame. 2 of us went up to her and asked for an explanation. She said she ended the game prematurely because we only paid for 5 people as opposed to 7, and it was our responsibility to remove the 2 names. A point was made that she never told us to remove any players and neither did we see any prompt to do so. We thought since she essentially is the controller of the system, it was her job to do it herself or more importantly tell us. Not wanting to argue further about something so petty, the 2 returned to us breaking the news and most of us were ready to leave.\n\nAnother guy in our group, appalled by her explanation, went up to her in a last attempt for justice. No vulgarity was passed by him, no fingers were pointed, he repeatedly said he didn't want to upset or ruin her night. He insisted politely that she should at least let us finish the last 3 frames. That's all we're asking after the failure in her part in communicating to us what we should've done.  At this point, she said we'd have to pay for 2 FULL GAMES if we wanted to finish those 3 frames which was just ludicrous. Her excuse was she was too busy in charge of looking after 15 games going on to be someone telling us what we needed to do. \n\nHaving failed, him and another friend went looking for the manager because fighting with her was futile. The manager in the end allowed us to finish the 3 games. During the middle, however, the manager came up to us and asked to speak to the 2 fellows privately. \n\nThe manager said the receptionist felt uncomfortable the way she was treated even though the whole confrontation was civil on my friend's part and basically reprimanded my 2 friends for that. From a distance, I could tell she was the one getting emotional and hyped up by her body language. I believe if you didn't make a mistake, there's no need to get all emotional. Even the manager supports her excuse that she was too busy tending to the the rest of the games that the slip up was acceptable. The manager ended by saying he wanted us to leave after we finished the game. Is that the way to treat 5 customers?\n\nThe adamant friend of justice wanted to file a formal complaint regarding the way he was treated and customer service in general. As we were were returning our shoes, he offered to apologize and wanted to get her name. She did not accept his apology and refused to give her name after the way she was treated (? she was never treated badly). \n----\nCustomer service? The whole idea of 'the customer is always right' in the retail/service industry is not practiced here. I appreciate how the manager eventually let us finish the game but telling us we had to leave after that and siding with the receptionist who didn't want to fess up to her mistake is unacceptable. The 2 friends who sought the manager felt reprimanded for a mistake they did not commit. I absolutely hate such injustice.\n\nWe are not the type of people who want to cause a scene. We've all had experience in the retail/service world so we know how potentially ugly confrontations can get. We absolutely understand what it means to be respectful and we don't want to make any situation unpleasant for anyone. \n\nI appreciate the boldness exemplified by all my friends who confronted the receptionist respectfully. As a yelper, I think this is the least I can do for my friends in sharing this experience publicly. I am not great in confrontational situations, but I can definitely pen down my thoughts into words.\n\nThere's not much redemption Jilian's Lucky Strike can do for us now, and we doubt any action will be taken. All we know is they have lost the respect of 7 customers over some lady's mistake she didn't want to own up to and will probably never return again.

This place may be a pretty good choice, especially for food from the Sichuan province of China. \n\nIf you are looking for Shanghainese food, this place may not provide the Shanghainese dishes you are looking for, despite the English name of this place. The Mandarin Chinese name of this place, Jing Chuan Jiu Jia does not actually translate to the English name of this place and indicates that they serve Beijing and Sichuan Chinese food. \n\nIf you are looking for possibly the spiciest Beef Noodle Soup in Boston's Chinatown, this place may be a good choice. I ordered Chuan Wei Niu Rou Mian, which roughly translates to Sichuan Taste Beef Noodle Soup in Mandarin Chinese. I actually asked for it to be a little spicy. After a few bites, I started to feel the heat, and my tongue felt some numbness from the spice. Meat portions are moderate, and the noodle portions are good. This dish is a pretty good choice when the temperature outside is less than 18 degrees Celsius. \n\nI came here recently for a Zhong Qiu Jie (Mid-Autumn Festival) dinner. I was able to eat some Ma Po Tofu, and it had a powerful effect on my tongue and mouth. I felt the oily spice, and I felt some numbness as sweat began to slowly flow from my forehead. Mixing a generous portion of rice with the Ma Po Tofu's sauce makes the dish a little bearable and tastier to eat. This place probably has the spiciest Ma Po Tofu in Boston's Chinatown, and some Ma Po Tofu and a good amount of rice is a pretty good choice when the temperature outside is less than 18 degrees Celsius. \n\nThe Dan Dan Noodles were not bad, one bowl should be enough for a light dinner and it also had a pretty good spiced kick. The noodles were fairly thick. The Sichuan Hui Guo Rou, also known as the Szechuan Twice Cooked Pork Belly was pretty good. The pork strips were thin and a little tender. The flavor of the meat and the vegetables had a nice spice. A couple pieces of the pork with some rice also made it a tasty dinner. \n\nInterior is not bad, the wooden tables and chairs are really shiny and smooth. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a spiced Sichuan Chinese alternative to Cantonese Chinese food in Boston's Chinatown, this is actually a good choice.

I called and ordered a steak and cheese with peppers and onions, and specified that I wanted mayonnaise and hot peppers on the sandwich.  I went downstairs a half-hour later.  I met the sous-chef, paid my $11.50 (yes, eleven dollars and fifty cents for a sandwich), and returned home.  I unwrapped the sandwich and found . . . \n\nA bunch of greasy waxed paper.  Two cheap, thin halves of a bun, overflowing with very hot, flavorless, overcooked, undersalted beef.  So much of it, in fact, that I had to eat the first half standing over the sink, as tiny, rock-hard pellets of blisteringly overcooked beef fell out of the sandwich and into the sink.  Was there mayonnaise?  Maybe the spirit of some, ethereally dabbed onto the sad excuse for a bun.  Were there hot peppers?  No, not really.  Not so much as you could taste.  Mostly, there was a pile of inedible hot meat that spilled out of the confines of the \"sandwich\" into my sink.  I gathered this stuff up and tried to eat it, because maybe it would be good, freed from the bread?  No.  Overcooked, more like blisteringly hot pieces of cow-body, and spilling.  Impossible to eat.  \n\nI've been taken to steak-and-cheese places in Philadelphia, and those sandwiches, aside from being wonderful, were *sandwiches*--they were edible and juicy and stayed on the bread they were packed into.  They were savory and flavorful.  This experience was IN NO WAY like that.  This was searingly hot, dry, dry, overcooked beef, unadulterated with any juice, savor, cheese, or mayonnaise, and raining out of the bun.  Whether it was eaten out of the confines of the \"sandwich\" or out of my sink, the meat was terrible.

Beer and cheese good; Man Code reconsidered.\n\nThe savory part nailed, I ventured in to the realm of my recent obsession: Liege waffles. For those unkissed by this monument to groovy iron, Liege waffles are not the leggo-my-dry-scratchy-round type, nor are they the Belgian-under-your-fried-chicken-or-gobs-of-syrup type. They have a sticky dough base, not batter, and are sweetened with the sugar all sugars aspire to be: pearl sugar. You may recognize it sitting atop your Danish butter cookies. Wanna know why the pretzel shaped ones are always the first to disappear? Pearl sugar. The stuff stays crystalline when baked and because of higher surface temps in waffle irons, caramelizes the outside of the bread while staying crunchy and candy-like within.\n\nOh god, just writing about it makes me want another one. Totes BRB.\n\nEasy to attempt, tough to get right and Saus does it. Underpriced at $3.50 (don't change it!), the perfectly sized treat stands extremely well on its own. Matter of fact, try your first naked (the waffle, perv) and then look at some of their 75c accompaniments: namely the berry compote or the raging power profile of the moment, salted burnt caramel.\n\nYes, I licked the plastic ramekin clean.

The mentioned green peppers seemed MIA, however, everything else was accounted for.  The concoction as a whole was pleasing, but much lighter than either of my past rum tum dittys, perhaps because it was not cheesy.  I had lifted the top half of the skillet popover and found that it had been slathered with some kind of glistening spread - the house sauce, I was informed, which included olive oil and hollandaise.  Well, I thought that a nice touch, and ate nearly half alongside the filled base.\n\nFor things such as water, don't bother asking the dark haired lady who may deliver your food.

It was nice, but perhaps a more tender vehicle would have made for a more pleasant consumption.  So between this and their Sugar Cinnamon Popover $5.50, I prefer the second.\n\n***\n\nThe chicken strips $6.50 at Popover King were a pleasant surprise - 3 thin sliced chicken tenders, marinated and skillet fried.  I realized when I saw them that I had imagined chicken fingers, possibly with a dipping sauce.\n\nThey were well flavored, but ranged from cooked well to a bit overcooked on the thickest piece (likely due to the kitchen trying hard to avoid salmonella).\n\nTheir banana bread $3.25 was good sized, sliced about an inch and a half thick, and smelled great!  But it was rather oily, as evidenced by how the oil had soaked through the paper and box after a while.\n\nTheir sweet popover Royal (ricotta filled with maple berry compote and fresh berries) was nice and not overly sweet, but very berryful.  The ricotta was light, not dense and rich and dairyful as in a cannoli.\n\n***\n\nI ordered up one of their Peachy Keen $8.50 (peach-maple filling topped with mango cream and pomegranate) sweet popovers to go.  They packed the cream separately, which was nice, so I decided to ask them how to care for this treat if it wasn't going to be consumed for a few hours.\n\nShe worried about a loss of moisture, so instead of keeping the popover at room temperature, she suggested freezing the popover, while refrigerating the cream), then microwaving it a minute, followed by baking for 2 at 400 degrees.\n\nAfter all that, it was still pretty good.\n\n***\n\nThe Friar Tuck Popover (cheese, pesto bacon) $8.25 is rich and creamy a concoction.

The waitress was nice, friendly, and attentive - maybe a little too attentive - but I'd rather deal with a nosy server than one who is smokin' butts behind the dumpster.\n\nBut after we ordered from what looked like a fantastic menu - the less than pleasant experience began to unfold.\n\nCocktails were ordered immediately (natch). My choice was a raspberry blend that was absolutely delicious! My companion ordered herself one of her personal favorites - Sazerac. I had never heard of the drink before and was eager to taste it. The look on her face would change that. Experienced in her sazeracs, she knew the color was off and the presentation in a martini glass was unusual. Upon her sipping, the cringe revealed the taste was too. Never having sampled the drink before I tried it - it tasted like a giant shot of Whiskey - blech! The waitress was apologetic and took the drink back to the bartender in exchange for a different cocktail. What happened next was offensive and jaw dropping - the bartender had the audacity to send the waitress back to our table and verify if my companion realized the ingredients in her next order and if she had ever had absinthe before. Because clearly the bartender could never make a mistake in his cocktail making - it had to be the customer who was wrong. Even if the customer WAS wrong - who would EVER put a waitress in a situation of belittling a customer. Poor form! \n\nOur food order was placed and what looked delicious on paper would fall short in our mouths. \n\nFirst we ordered the Fall Verrine, a slow cooked quail egg with tarragon gele, foie gras mousse and nutmeg. This was a great dish - although very small. \n\nNext came the Assiette de Charcuterie for two (a sampling of house-cured meats, pickles, mustards, vegetables) and the Mac n' Cheese (fontinella, romadur, vermont chevre, tempura crumb, truffles). The meats were bland and the pasta was overcooked - way too chewy. The mustard served with the meats made the plate tolerable but the cheese on our mac was way too watery and the truffles seemed nonexistent. \n\nWe ended with the Artichoke Agnolotti (fall vegetables, hazelnuts, brown butter, lemon-thyme air). This was a great dish like the first but it was also small in portion.\n\nIt's unfortunate the two favorite plates were the smallest in size but the food that talked the talk but never walked the walk was plentiful. \n\nThe food was not the only thing falling short at Circle. Once seated we noticed the overwhelming number of elements decorating the space - the red and yellow lighting in some areas reminded me of McDonald's and the yellow reflection on the exposed brick made me think of their drive thru. In other areas of the restaurant were cool looking light fixtures but fell out of place when combined with all the other elements. \n\nBefore departing the restaurant I decided to venture into the restroom where I experienced what I like to call, \"a lost child in a grocery store\" feeling. Attempting to exit, the doorknob ripped off the door and I thought I was going to die alone in a restaurant bathroom.

Just have patience and do what I do; point to what you need.  \n\n-Don't expect it to be like Shabu-Zen.  You would be lost for the first 20 minutes going into the meal.  I was game to check out the place instead of going down the street because I wanted to try something different... and different it was.  Unlike Shabu-zen (and I promise this will be the only time I would do any comparison) Hot Pot Buffet is totally erratic.  There's no garlic, chili peppers, scallions, and bbq sauce to swirl into your soy sauce base.  There's just a jar of soy sauce and a bowl.  You'll have to ask for the hot chili oil and bbq sauce.\n\n-Expect to eat in abundant.  They will provide you with a paper menu to check off the things you want.  I desire a tom yum base but no cigars so I settled for the half Mala (spicy) soup and half Chinese herbal soup.  We then ordered the usual squid, scallops, clams, crab leg and fish paste from the seafood section (they now have lobster for an additional $7.95); prime rib eye (as they have no short ribs), beef tongue, tripes from the meat section; then watercress, spinach, bok choy, black mushroom, king oyster mushroom, tong ho, soft tofu and some daikon from the Veggies.\n\n-Expect the food to arrive sporadically with no rhymes or reason.  Quality of meat is good and all the veggies were fresh, the seafood was kinda frozen and only ok.  We were huge veggie fans so we went crazy with the greens.\n\n-Expect some missing items from your plate since it might get lost in translation.\n\nHere are some pointers, make sure you put the clams (they were huge quahogs) and crab legs last as they tend to make the broth REALLY salty.  So salty that we didn't really enjoy as much.\n\nNo alcohol yet and you can't bring your own (bummer) so all you got is soda, tea and water..... not to mention the salty broth.\n\nNow go and enjoy.

Pure gilded age oppulence.  It amazes me that, for generations, this place is has been there with only minor changes, and that it's possible to belly-up to the same bar that many of the people responsible for creating Boston as we know it once did.\n\nThe above-referenced review doubts that Locke-Ober will remain successful for much longer thanks to its policy on shorts.

The clam Chowder is ALWAYS watery, and youre lucky if you server can fish out a clam or two for your bowl, just dont expect more than 12 onces, the managers forbid that you treat your customer to a little extra creamy juice! \nEven though is so close to the Childrens Museum, I saw one of the many managers pretending to work, set a couples stroller out in the rain only for it to get completely soaked!

The spark begins with the downward climb that leads you to a subterranean entrance, only to be welcomed by the beautiful, fashionably dressed hostesses just beyond the heavy wooden door. As the restaurant and bar sprawl out just to your right, a few notches below the entrance, you survey the scene and ask yourself, \"Are we still in Boston?\" That's not to say this fine city is barren of any chicly modern style, but the finishings here are reminiscent of sultry nights in Miami. Creamy whites and satin blacks, a private dining room and a long bar lined with buttery leather chairs. The only clue that you haven't jet-setted out of Boston after all? Two intrusive, obnoxiously large flat-screen televisions positioned in the dark wood above the bar, splashing patrons with sports scenes. Out of place like The Beverly Hillbillies at The Ritz Carlton.\n\nThe cocktails and cuisine here, unlike the TVs, match the decor and make for a lovely evening out. The Tuna Tartar is a fair portion size for the price ($15) mixed with tobiko and dotted with takuan for a little crunch. The shrimp, while well-cooked, was overpowered by the over use of the spicy mayo reduction that it sat upon. The Crab Cakes are perfectly seasoned and not a bit dry. What the Stuffed Jalapenos lack for in presentation, they make up for in flavor. A high-end take on the old bar classic, Jalapeno Poppers, these peppers are halved and stuffed with creamy goat cheese, topped with chorizo. Though some were very spicy and others had no heat at all, I'd definitely order them again. The Churrasco Skewers were very tender and juicy.\n\nDinner options beyond appetizers are varied and simply stated on the menu: chicken, sirloin, salmon, pork, pasta, with accompaniments listed below. Though it might seem pricy, the portion sizes are generous, especially the pork dish which I have not ordered, but marveled at its size when it arrived at a table next to me. The Se Bass and the Scallops are both great dishes; the massive scallops are cooked to perfection, while the Sea Bass remains tender and bright, a nice contrast from the earthy mushrooms. The not-to-miss side dish: Manchego whipped potatoes. Light and fluffy, yet dense with the taste and aroma of Manchego.\n\nThe cocktail list has a few winners, including the Cucumber Gimlet and The Appleton Fizz, but they sit beside The Espresso Martini and The Peanut Butter Cup, which is stuff you'd expect to see at a TGIFridays, not a chic city establishment.\n\nOverall, Noche is a South End hot spot serving really good food and decent drinks in an atmosphere that is not easily duplicated in Boston.

Okay that might sound gross, but pantyhose is used to describe how silky the milktea is, like pantyhose. Sadly didn't see that on the menu. The next two are breakfast items.

Spectacular. They were not frugal with their beef, which was super tender. For those who are afraid of oil, here's a caveat, you will see the noodles shine, but it is nowhere near \"disgustingly-oily\". Trust me, I'm the type that dap fried foods with napkins at least thrice, and I ate the noodles today without any dapping. It's part of the package, just embrace it. And most importantly, this dish exuded the most essential element to HongKonganese cooking -- Wok Hei, or wok \"qi\". This is the reason why Chinese food, and Hong konganese food in particular cannot be cooked using an electric stove; it must be cooked with a gas stove so the wok can be blasted with high fire, giving the dish the unique flavor and perfect texture.

Not by our waitress or the runner, but by who I presume was the owner.  \n\nThe problem came with the meat course.  Since we know we don't care for broth cooking, we got the oil.  Unfortunately, the meat hadn't been patted down enough to remove the water, so when we put our meat into the pot, the oil began to sputter and pop wildly.  One of the splashes caused hot oil to land on my face, just under my eye, and then another large pop sent more oil flying.  My boyfriend shut off the flame quickly, while I sat there, mildly stunned from the oil.\n\nSuddenly, the owner appeared at our tableside and said, in a rather hostile tone, \"What's the matter?\"  We explained what had happened, and instead of saying, \"Oh, I'm sorry that happened to you\" (which would have seemed the natural reaction), he said, \"That's what the oil does.  It always happens with the first piece.  Try putting another one in.\"  When my boyfriend explained that he had turned the flame off, the owner said, \"It's not going to cook if you do that.\"  We tried to explain that we'd done it because we were concerned that it was up too high and causing the splashing, but he continued to talk to us in an unfriendly and condescending manner.  Then he walked off to the other side of the restaurant, folded his arms, and stood glaring in our direction.  \n\nAt this point, I was upset, more about the nasty treatment then anything.  We sat there another couple of minutes, and then the owner came back over and began harping on us again, saying \"What do you want ME to do?\" in a way that implied that he couldn't possibly do anything to help the situation.  I told him that it wasn't even the oil splash that I was upset about at this point; it was the way in which we were being treated.  For some reason, he was unable to listen to and process this statement, and he continued to insist that \"the oil does that.\"  Finally, after he again repeated, \"What do you want ME to do?\" in that mean tone, I said, \"I don't want to discuss this with you anymore.\"  He stalked back to the other side of the restaurant and glared at us once again.\n\nMy boyfriend decided that we'd pay the waitress for what we'd eaten so far (cheese and two glasses of wine) and leave.

Based on the quality of food alone? This would be in the 4-5 star range. No question about that. I'll start there, I guess. I went here with a girlfriend for a great Monday night dinner. We shared the poivre and the \"la complete\" crepe. Holy crap deliciousness. The poivre had this incredible jalapeno relish and the meat was tender and perfectly cooked. The crepes were light and thin, but sturdy enough to hold all their awesome contents.\nThen we shared a chocolate bananas foster and a tatin crepe. Tatin was like pie a la mode in a crepe. So. Good. Bananas foster was stellar. Bittersweet cocoa infused crepes with perfectly flambeed bananas and an awesome chocolate ice cream. Wow.\nOk, now the not so great.\nI would NOT recommend this place for a date. The ambiance is freakin' weird. I felt like I was in a college dining hall. The lights are unnecessarily bright. The table set up feels very cafeteria-y. My friend and I sat at the bar and thank god we did. \nService was non existent. \nWhen we walked in, there was an abandoned hostess station with a handmade sign posted to it saying \"Please seat yourselves.\" Understandable.. it's a small place. No need to be ushered into a seat. So I sit at the bar and am faced with the woman behind the bar who seems completely overwhelmed/confused/maybe she just snapped? She doesn't acknowledge my friend or I for a good 5 minutes. She doesn't acknowledge anyone, for that matter. She was maniacally labeling bottles behind the counter while mumbling to herself. I looked around the dining hall to see 2 different tables looking rather bored and unfed; they had been there longer than me and still seemed to not have received any attention from the ONLY server in the place.\nShe finally seemed to notice us sitting there, quickly gave us water and a plate of bread, and ran off into the kitchen, without asking us whether we wanted a drink or an appetizer. \nAfter a quick run around the entire cafe, she came back and continued to talk to herself behind the counter until I finally interrupted her to place our order. She was incredibly nice, but seemed to be functioning on a completely different level. Our food was served by the cooks, who were attentive and friendly. Again, delicious food. While we were eating, I noticed a couple come into the cafe and stand there (I dont think they saw the seat yourself sign) for about 5 minutes. There was also a table waiting for a check. And two tables waiting to order. Lady behind the bar looked up, mumbled something, and kept unloading the dishwasher. Oblivious. The couple ended up leaving. A girl from one of the waiting tables came up to the bar, but the woman didn't seem to notice, ran off into the kitchen, and came back with ice water for the tables. \nDinner and dessert were done in less than 40 minutes. When we walked out of there, there were still several tables that hadn't been attended to and they had been there longer than we had. \nSummary: awesome food. weird vibes. horrible service."}]}, "Legal Crossing": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 50, "text": "While walking up Washington Street, I came across Legal Crossing.

While it has items in common with the regular Legal Seafoods, there were some different items.  \n\nA couple of days later with my husband in tow, we stopped by in the late afternoon and asked if we would need a reservation if we wanted to eat there that night (a weekend night).  We were told that, yes, a reservation was necessary and the only times available would be 4:30 p.m. or a few hours later.  We asked for a 4:30 reservation, which at the time, was an hour away.  \n\nWe returned at the appointed time and were seated at a 2 top in the bar area.  The tables are close together.  Our server, Nancy, was friendly, prompt, efficient and had good knowledge of the menu.  For starters, I got the lobster bisque and my husband got a shrimp cocktail.  With the shrimp cocktail, you choose as to how many shrimp you want as you pay individually per shrimp.  My husband chose to have four of them.\n\nThe lobster bisque, quite frankly, was terrible.  While lobster bisque has some sherry in it, Legal Crossing went extremely heavy handed with it to the point where the sherry was all I tasted.  There was a small biscuit that was placed in the bisque.  It had some shredded lobster in it.  The biscuit was tough and just about impossible to eat.\n\nMy husband enjoyed his shrimp cocktail saying that they shrimp were delicious and he liked the cocktail sauce as the horseradish gave it just enough kick.\n\nTo drink, I had a \"raspberry beret\".  I don't remember the exact ingredients but I had asked Nancy to recommend a sweet drink and she recommended this one.  I did like it.  My husband had a Heineken beer.\n\nFor my main course, I had \"everything tuna\", a dish I've enjoyed in the past at other Legal Seafoods restaurants.  This dish comes with:  \"tzatziki, roasted red pepper sauce, \"cauliflower risotto style\".  The tuna was properly prepared as it was rare.  The cauliflower risotto was forgettable.  I also didn't care for the 2 sauces.  One sauce would have been sufficient  as I didn't think those 2 sauces went well together.\n\nMy husband had \"sea scallops with sweet potato 2 ways\" which consists of: \"sweet potato pur\u00e9e, purple potato hash, boudin noir, tomato chutney\".  While he found the scallops to be properly prepared, he didn't care for any of the accompaniments.\n\nWe were too full to consider any dessert.  This was a pricey meal and we were expecting better.

Yeah, I'm a white rice bigot.  So what?  At least I admit it.  Sure brown rice is supposed to be better for you, but it's not like white rice is toxic to begin with.

In that case, the texture is a great complement to the thick and rich sauces of all those curries.\n\nThe fish is still fresh and the pieces are still tiny.

This review is about the service.  \n\nHaving heard good things around the neighborhood, we decided to try Ilona. We did not have a res and decided to give it a try at 830pm on a Saturday (it was a long shot).  When we go to the door and spoke to the hostess, she informed us that there were no tables available and that she was not taking anymore standbys.  She informed us we could wait at the bar as it was first-come, first-serve.  After chatting with her for a bit, she said that the tables would start to clear out soon and she would now put our names down on the standby list.  We went to the bar and ordered a drink, right behind two women that we though would be leaving soon.  After about 40 min they started to get up. As they did (my back was turned) I heard two other women (that had been standing next to us one stool down the bar) ask them if they could \"sneak in\" have their seats.  My friend whom I was with told them that we had been waiting for those seats (which we were standing right behind) for some time.  The two women at the bar were rude and said that they were saving them for the other women (which was not true). She then told us that it was her daughter (again not true). The bar tender then came over and told us that there was a wait list for bar seats and it was NOT first-come, first-serve (that the women waiting had been here longer and that \"our\" seats were for them).  Well, we felt pretty stupid and embarrassed. Fine, we wasted 40 min waiting for seats were never going to get because of the hostess and we felt like idiots in the process. For the record, we were not rude and literally the only thing we said to the women was that we were waiting for those seats.\n\nAbout five minutes later, a bearded man in a blazer came over to us very aggressively (like a bouncer) where we were standing (we assumed he was the manager) and the first words out of his mouth were \"what are you two screaming about?\"  OMFG, are you serious!? After I picked my jaw up off the floor, my friend asked if he was the manager to which he affirmed. We told him what happened (although what was the point since he already had implied we were jerks and he was not going to do anything for us) and he then tells us that he had three complaints and that we were yelling at him. Mind you I was still in disbelief about what he said a min earlier and it was super loud (we were talking the same way were had been talking in the venue the whole time). We then asked if perhaps we should speak to the owner to which his reply was \"perhaps you should finish your drinks and leave.\"  Again OMFG!!!!!!  So my friend then asked to speak to the owner. \n\nWhen the owner came over, we told him what had happened. That we were told to wait at the bar for a seat and we would not have stayed at the restaurant if we had no chance of getting a bar seat.  We told him the awful things that the manager had said to us. He was very nice and apologetic. He asked if he could buy us a drink and get us a table. My friend took him up on the offer and the owner said he would be right back.  After a few minutes I decided that I wanted to leave (regardless of how nice the owner and offer was) because I had a pit in my stomach and had honestly lost my appetite. I walked over to the owner and thanked him for the offer but told him I wanted to leave. The  staff escalated the situation so much that I felt uncomfortable being there. He asked that I stay, that we would speak after dinner about what happened. He wanted to give it some time, have a meal and then, we could discuss.  That made a lot of sense to me so I agreed.  We sat down. We ate; our waiter was great. When we finished, the bill came.  No comped drinks.  What? The owner had said he was buying us a drink.  Again for the record, I do not need a free drink but it was the principal; he told us he was buying us a drink for the issues.  We waiting a couple of minutes for the owner to come over to talk with us about what had happened.  He never came over. In fact, I saw him at the end of the bar having a good time with some other patrons.  \n\nThe fact that he never came over was what put this whole experience over the top. I was convinced to stay and spend money, for a meal I didn't want, with the expectation of discussing the miscommunication between their hostess and bar staff and especially how aggressively the manager confronted us.  So after our very uncomfortable meal, we got our bill, they took our money and had nothing resolved. I had a hard time falling asleep last night and feel worse this morning about what happened.

We read about this place opening in boston.com and were able to get a reservation on Saturday night.  This was their 6th night open.  There were a few first week issues that will undoubtedly soon be corrected, e.g. not enough water glasses for everyone.  That won't be relevant if you visit a few weeks from now.\n\nHowever, there is a serious problem with this place.  The food was lovingly prepared, you can see the skill of the chefs.  The server told us that they had only been open for 6 days, and not to expect New Orleans level of spices, as the chef/owner didn't want to overwhelm Bostoners' palates with too much intense flavor.  This was a serious mistake.  Granted, I like food to be a lot hotter than most New Englanders, many of whom consider black pepper on boiled potatoes to be too spicy.  But this was magnificently prepared food almost completely devoid of spicing.  We both had gumbo as a first course (my wife's the vegetarian option), and I had crawfish in taso ham cream sauce over linguini while she had blackened salmon.  Both were perfectly prepared, but there was truly no flavor to my linguini other than what was supplied by the crawfish, pasta and ham.  No detectable other spicing.  Abby's blackened salmon somehow managed to be blackened with no detectable heat whatsoever.  It also came with a horseradish sauce that had little detectable horseradish in it.  This place is going to fail unless the chef stops storing his tail between his legs and actually makes Cajun dishes like one might get in a place like Louisiana.  I don't demand it be authentic, I don't know what is actually authentic.  I just want there to be detectable flavor.  Who opens a Cajun restaurant with dishes that are utterly bland?\n\nThe server was intensely interested in our feedback, and was overtly appreciative that we wanted the food to taste like, well, something.

As a Boston resident for 29 years, a Boston University graduate, and big Red Sox fan, Cask historically has offered a fun option for drinks in the Fenway area. But as my friends and I have matured, we've struggled with the younger/ obnoxious crowd that oftentimes fills the bar--definitely around Sox games and big tentpole sporting events. We stopped going to Cask entirely 3 years ago--we literally shared a collective sigh when we were like \"this isn't fun anymore\" in reference to Cask--opting for nearby spots with better beer selection like Yard House. But rather than me go on about the reasons I stopped going to Cask a few years ago (there's so many), I'd like to explain why we started going back: ZACH. Yes, Zach--the bartender the impulsive management team just fired. Zach, by so many accounts, is considered one of the best bartenders to come out of Somerville/ Cambridge--he seriously has Cocktail-like skills behind the bar. That's not what makes him great, though. He's a good person. He's befriended more patrons in Boston/ Somerville/ Cambridge than I can count. I've been invited to more parties and made more friends (at and outside of Cask) due to the network of GOOD people Zach connects. He's the sort of person that makes a group of almost-30 year-olds say \"screw it, we're going to Cask again because Zach is there. He's a good dude.\" And that's what happened. When Zach got a job at Cask, the Somerville/ Cambridge community was sad to see him go, but we were happy for him. It painted Cask in a good light for hiring him. And, most importantly, it gave us all a reason to go visit Zach in the Fenway area. In a lot of ways, Zach has been an ambassador to the city of Boston, someone I've pointed friends, clients, family to time and time again. We've sent countless people visiting Boston to Cask to \"say hello to Zach.. he'll make you feel at home\"--and I have countless stories about folks from around the US and the globe who have gone to Cask and been amazed at how wonderful Zach made them feel. So, having watched quietly on the sidelines while ONE PERSON (this person happens to be a female, but I call them a \"person\" because sex is no part of this--I just want to be clear) decided to take to Yelp to bad mouth the best bartender my large crowd of affluent Bostonians have come to love, I felt compelled to stand up for Zach and let the Yelp community know that the management of Cask has no backbone whatsoever and would simply fire an employee based on a negative Yelp review. I'm a believer in community-driven content, it's just sad to see a bar believe so much in it that they'll fire an employee over unsubstantiated words. The one negative Yelp reviewer caused management to respond: \"take him off the schedule, get his shift covered.\" This happened immediately. Zach was given no benefit of the doubt, no opportunity to defend himself, nothing. And now Zach is out of a job. Where's the justice in that? I can honestly say I now have that one final reason why I never need to walk in Cask again. And with whatever happens to this Yelp review I write, rest assured it's being copied and pasted into my Facebook news feed as well as being sent out in a large email chain to the 100 or so friends Zach and I have connected through the better part of this past decade.

I was pleased to find authentic Mexican food in the Boston area, and I brought many of my friends, but in the end I resolved never to return.\n\nFirst off, Mexican cuisine is one of the most economical to prepare.  Most dishes are dominated by extremely inexpensive starch-based items : tortillas, rice, beans.  To this, you add vegetable-based sauces, a little cheese and avocado, and relatively small amounts of meat, perhaps 4 oz. in a typical portion. The typical cost of a plate of good Mexican food in areas of the world where English is spoken is around $7, a few dollars more if it is served in an upscale setting.  \n\nHerein lies the problem -- Angela's, and many other Latin American restaurants in low-rent neighborhoods like Chelsea and East Boston are charging well over $10 for a plate of this simple food.  \n\nBesides being very expensive, Angela's adds the insult of serving \"nouvelle\"-type portions!  For example, the chilaquiles. Translation : \n\"poor man's breakfast\".  Ummm...not unless the poor man is on an expense account!  $11.95 gets you a plate of tortillas with 2 eggs, sauce, and MAYBE an ounce each of cheese, avocado, and beans.  A few shreds of chicken as garnish and voila.  I guarantee you will be hungry in a little while. \n\nAt one point, they downsized their side portion of beans from approximately 2 oz. to just 1 oz.  I found myself in a position of having to beg for a proper side of beans, and was told there would be a $3 charge.  Sorry, Angela and family, but for $15 I can have a delicious lunch including at least 8 oz. of protein at a place like Legal Seafood, for heaven's sake, complete with lovely decor, attentive service, white tablecloth, rolls, butter, and ice water, in a nice urban setting.  Why would I pay $15 just to be hungry shortly afterward in East Boston?  \n\nYes, Mexican cuisine is fabulous, and Angela's is authentic Mexican.  But it's not rocket science.  I decided to learn to make my own chilaquiles at home.  All I had to do was Google \"chilaquiles\" + \"puebla\", and the recipe came right up.  Periodically I whip up a batch of the sauce in the blender, and all the ingredients can easily be found at the supermarket.  Each time I make it at home I'm happy knowing I've just saved myself over $13, while doubling the amount of cheese, avocado, beans, and chicken I get.  Guacamole is another ridiculously easy recipe.  You can whip it up in 5 minutes.  \n\nSorry Angela's, I loved you well, but you priced yourself right out of my heart."}]}, "Foodie's Urban Market": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 8, "text": "Hey you whiny people!

I always order the rolls with bulgolgi marinaded beef, but it is also available with eel, tuna, or ham.  The kimbap consists of carrots, spinach, egg, daikon radish, and the bulgolgi, all surrounded by a bed of rice, wrapped in nori (seaweed).  They give you two rolls, cut into about 9 pieces each (approximately 18 pieces total), for approximately $8.35.  A type of kimchi also accompanies the kimbap.  My take on it? DELICIOUS!  Kimbap is a great snack and very filling.\n\nTokbokki - Rice cakes sauteed in a sweet but spicey sauce, that can be ordered with ramen and comes with pieces of hot dog (sounds somewhat strange, but it works!), cabbage, and pieces of fish cake.  The sauce in this dish makes it extremely  tastey.  This is a great dish to share, and somewhat messy to eat, but very delicious.  Because there is a good ratio of the ingredients in the ttokbokki, you'll feel proud of yourself for being able to get in your serving of vegetables for the day.\n\nJap Chae - Clear noodles, that is mixed with a variety of vegetables and meat, accompanies a bed of rice and a side salad with a thousand-island-type dressing.  This dish is very tastey as well, but could come with more noodles.\n\nYang Nyum Chicken - It's like fried chicken dipped in a sweet and spicey sauce, accompanied with a side salad and a side of rice.  So good!

It wasn't only my review, they had also commented on another person's 2 star review on social media as well.\n\nALSO It's worth noting that after the first few reviews were negative on Yelp, that two 5 star reviews were posted by accounts that had no other reviews and were just created that day....hmmm.\n\nMy review is below:\n\nThere are somethings I can overlook in a new restaurant and some things that I cannot. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were meeting a group of his friends there for dinner. We were early so we grabbed the last spot at the bar, I sat and he stood next to me. He ordered a drink, the Toronto. He hated it and said it tasted like cough syrup or dark soda. I ordered a drink up and was told everything was being served in rocks glasses since they don't have enough glassware, so I stuck to water but not a major deal. The Toronto oddly enough arrived in a coupe glass so I guess they found some? \n\nAfter about 10 minutes the couple next to us left so my boyfriend took one of the seats. The host came over and asked him to stand instead because the chef's parents came in and wanted to sit....excuse me? I guess as a paying customer I'm not important as someone who work's in the kitchen's relatives. This was what really set aside the customer service at Mida from any restaurant I've ever been to. My family has owned businesses and I cannot imagine asking a paying customer to stand so a friend or non elderly relative could sit. \n\nIt's worth noting his parents were VERY loud and made it difficult to enjoy our drink and hear each other at the bar. \n\nWe were sat about 40 minutes late for our rezzie, not a problem, I understand. \n\nUpon sitting we were told that the gnocchi was a crowd favorite... but they were out tonight. Also, they changed the veal in the orechiette to pork shoulder. \n\nWe ordered some sort of fried fish appetizer, arranci balls, the bread and pickles to start. The fried fish was not good, too much batter. The arranci balls weren't bad because how can fried cheese taste bad, but they were probably the worst I've had. The bread was awful, I don't understand how you can charge for bread and make it taste bad...I don't think I've ever not liked bread. It was toasted to just the perfect point of making it taste stale. The butter like spread it came with was sour tasting, not tasty. \n\nThe orechiette was not good. The sauce was flavorless. The girl next to me had the spaghetti and barely touched it.\n\nI will say the prices were more than reasonable. Everything was super cheap and portion sizes were fine, so they have that right. However, everything else from the vibe, atmosphere, decor, and service, were true one star material. \n\nWhen you walk in one door you walk literally into the bar so you're immediately in the way of everyone, very uncomfortable. Windows overlook a check cashing business that you'd expect so far down on Tremont. \n\nI will absolutely not be back. After sharing my experiences with colleagues and friends they're disappointed as they were looking forward to trying a new South End joint but will no longer bother."}]}, "LongHorn Steakhouse": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 7, "text": "A damn tasty burger, and I must tip my hat to any place that offers bowls of peanuts to munch on while you wait.  Plus, the kitchen is pretty flexible. One person I went to lunch with wanted to order something that was no longer on the menu and they cooked it up for her no problem.  I'm not sure this rule applies during their busier hours, but it was definitely some top-notch customer service for a lunch.\r\n\r\nSo, as far as red meat goes, Longhorn will hook you up.  The vegetarian options, however, are sorely lacking.  The salads are downright farcical and tend to involve ingredients like bacon, barbecue sauce and chicken fried steak.

However this place warrants my first bad review... \n\nThe person making the crepes had absolutely no idea how to make them. I watched them try to spread the batter properly after the crepes kept breaking apart. They also only had one person making crepes with a huge line. At one point when the person making crepes finally finished mine, they tried reaching for a to go box in a cabinet but was too short to reach. The guy at the counter didn't even help and just stood there watching. So the crepe person took a different box and put mine in, then put it on the counter? I had to awkwardly go up to the cashier after a few minutes and ask if it was mine, which is was, not sure why they didn't give it to me. The crepe was savory and for some sacrilegious reason they put it on a whole wheat crepe? It was disgusting. I had to throw my crepe out it was so horrible, and I hate wasting food. Not sure that the egg in mine was even cooked all the way. I've included a photo so you can see the shape of the crepe. I've never seen a crepe shaped that way in my life. \n\nAdvice: hire more people who actually have experience with crepes, get rid of whole wheat batter, learn how to make more than one crepe at a time, have the cashier guy help with food prep etc if he has extra time, and give me a refund... \n\nSorry for the review, but I had to be honest!

I worked very late one evening and had intended to go to the pizza place next door, but it was closed. However, China Station was still open and I decided to give it a shot. \n\nI will say that the place is very bare bones. Clearly a \"take-out only\" operation as there were, maybe, two small tables. However, the space and open kitchen are very clean and well-organized.\n\nThe menu is not as extensive as many other take-out places I have gone, but pretty solid for standard fare, nonetheless. A few surprises on the menu include fried chicken wings and plantains and a fried half-chicken, which is unusual in this area.\n\nI ordered the steamed chicken and vegetables with a side of white rice from their \"Lighter Side\" menu. As advertised, these dishes are cooked without oil or seasoning. It was very fresh and flavorful and came with a ginger sauce on the side. The portion was extremely generous: enough for two people of two meals. The vegetables were bright, crisp, and fresh. The sauce was delicious!\n\nI was greatly encouraged and decided to try the vegetable egg foo young with shrimp fried rice. The eggs were fresh and fluffy. The shrimp in the rice was plump and flavorful. Overall, the food was definitely lower in sodium than most other places, which I appreciated. I could really taste and enjoy all the flavors. What I also highly appreciated was that the gravy that usually is poured over the egg foo young was served on the side. \n\nAnd that is another thing I must comment on: I was very impressed by their packaging. All the sauces I've had so far were in separate containers, then wrapped in plastic bags to prevent leaks. The food containers were never sloppy or oily. A very, very neat job with high attention to detail.\n\nI have been back to this place four times in the past two weeks, and the quality is always consistent. I would have loved a more extensive menu, but, honestly, I would rather have a limited menu where all of the food is prepared well than a mile-long menu where it is inconsistent.\n\nI gave this place 4-starts instead of 5 only because I think it could use some more atmosphere and a few extra tables.\n\nHighly, highly recommended!"}]}, "Cini\u2019s": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 3, "text": "We had Cini's pizza and Mini arancini \"cini\" catering for our department seminar! the arancini were gone within minutes and everybody loved it! it's really cheesy and flavorful!\nThe pizza was good too.

I was REALLY excited about writing a 5 star review after the nice drinks experience I had there on a quiet thursday night. I was going to talk about how much potential this place has, how well decorated it is, etc. Fat chance. \n\n Initially I went there on a thursday night around 10pm on a 'drinks' meet-up with a lady friend. I go out quite a bit in Boston and despite being somewhat retired from the 'nightlife' scene, still enjoy checking out lounges and new spots. \n\nThe potential of this place is great. Its very shiny, well done up, with a long bar, a small outdoor patio, and 2 rooms. The entire place is built like a green underwater version of Underbar, that's really the only place I can compare it to. \n\nThe bartender was a friendly asian girl with standard nightclub bartender 'dimensions'. She was peppy and served us quickly although we were the only two people at the bar for the hour that we were there. Drinks are standard high end lounge prices 12-13/pop. \n\nAs someone who enjoys going out, I have a lot of friends with disposable income who like checking out new spots. I had invited 2 lady friends to come because I got a text on my phone confirming a Svedka Tasting Event. \n\nThis was the event that ruined my desire to come here again, despite the Decor being AWESOME. \n\nThis was an absolute and complete failure as an event on so many levels its not even funny. Emerald, you cost me social clout with my female friends. As someone who goes out quite a bit, I was expecting a fairly packed night on Columbus Day weekend with free booze for an hour or two. I was expecting to leave extra tips for the bartenders to compensate them for the patrons that thought this was a 'free drinks, so no need to tip,' type of night. Instead when I walked in with my friends, I received a blank stare from the bartenders regarding the Svedka promo, and was then told \"you can have any Svedka for $10.00. That's a tasting? Grudgingly, the GM authorized 1 drink or shot per patron of a Svedka-based drink. After the first 'shot' the bartender told me that 'of course nobody is going to let us drink for free'. If this is a Svedka tasting then the Svedka vodka is supposed to be free. That's why its a 'tasting event'. Since I had already embarrassed myself by inviting 2 friends there, we stayed, and paid. After spending an hour in a dead and empty room, we left to go to the W next door, where at least there were people. I'm disappointed that I was excited to show this place to my friends.\n\nApparently there is a 'dance license' which neither Splash, nor Cure, nor this place have...and everyone knows that you go to Cure and Splash to dance. Apparently the city has been really hard on this place over dancing while the same owners are busy building a brand new nightclub next door called '57'. \n\nThe reason I know this is from both previous reviewers, and from the GM of this place. How did the GM tell me? By confronting me about telling my friends that this place doesn't have a license to dance. The GM approached me and said that some of the staff reported that there was a guy 'badmouthing' Emerald lounge. BADMOUTHING? Are you kidding me?!??!!? A GM of a place approaches a patron and asks him why the patron is telling others that the place doesn't have a license to dance. A patron that isn't saying anything negative or vulgar. A patron that is simply discussing the lack of a license. A patron that is one of 10 TOTAL at an event, that was supposed to be a 'free' tasting event, that is total bust. \n\nIf they had wanted to 'squash rumors' as the GM said, instead of confronting a patron and embarassing that person they could have approached him with his two friends, and bought them drinks, or asked how they were enjoying the venue.  They would have found out that the patrons were disappointed and this could have been an amazing opportunity to buiid rapport with people who ACTUALLY GO OUT ON A SUNDAY IN THE RAIN and tell others about the new places in town. \n\nTotal and utter disappointment.  I didn't even get a chance to try any of the food, and sadly I think this place has a lot of potential but whoever is doing the promotions and running this place needs to re-evaluate their attitude towards the guests that actually DO show up and spend money at your establishment. The W and Cure were both full of patrons and got plenty of my money that night.\n\nAlso I noticed that 2 other people mentnoned being called out or asked to leave when they criticized the establishment in any way. This makes me think it is policy that is enforced. The reviews that mention this are 'filtered' - and may not be read by most people; sadly for this establishment, my reviews are never filtered since I'm an active Yelp participant. It highly upset me that the management here made an effort to silence me."}]}, "Davide Restaurant": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 124, "text": "The GM of Davide contacted me privately to let me know he'd read my review. Apparently, he took to private messages because Yelp cautions proprietors to be nice to the people who review their restaurants on the boards.  \n\nTo summarize: he found my review personally insulting, and he took particular umbrage with my use of the word \"donkeys.\"  Which is kind of hilarious, considering the guy promotes his Gordon Ramsay menu all over the place.  But I guess it's possible he didn't see the 3000 episodes of GR shows where Gordon called someone a donkey. \n\nAccording to my new BFF, I should stick to fast food restaurants, since I don't care to wait two hours for a mediocre entree with no acknowledgment of the fact that it's taking that long in an almost empty restaurant.  Because we're clearly \"not on the same page\" about what is or is not appropriate in a restaurant experience.\n\nFinally, I am sorry to say that I am not welcome at his restaurant ever again.  You read that right: banned from the very restaurant I had no intention of visiting ever again. You really burned me, guy. I guess I'll just have to go to one of the 20 other restaurants in a 3 block radius with better food that don't treat paying customers like dirt.  Both while they're there, and when they DARE to write about their experience honestly and with humor, despite the fact that there was absolutely nothing funny about our dinner there.\n\nThe 1 star is for the food, and because Yelp doesn't let you give zero stars. -37 stars for the service and the aftermath."}]}, "Courtyard Tea Room": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 8, "text": "Located in the Boston Public Library in Copley, it's a beautiful place to spend with your close ones. I made a reservation for my friend and I for her birthday for Afternoon Tea. Upon arrival, you are able to walk through the whole Courtyard and the Library, which is full of wonders and beautiful hallways. The restaurant itself has a small cafe attached, where you can grab a drink and study. I was seated after I gave the hostess my name and they were really kind to inform me that they do birthday platters. The Courtyard Restaurant is honestly so elegant, with high ceilings and natural lighting beaming in. I love the aesthetic and the elegant feel that overall restaurant gives off. I thought it was really cute how they put their tea menu in \n\nFor $39 per person, this has been by far the best Afternoon Tea place in Boston that's worth every bang of your buck. I ordered a jasmine tea and I believe my friend ordered the chai latte. We both enjoyed our drinks, as it complimented well with what we were served. Every bite was delicious, but I enjoyed the scones and jams the most. I liked how the currant scone wasn't overpowering with the citrus flavor, as do a lot of places serve. The devonshire cream, blood orange preserves, and the lemon curd all complimented the scones in a light way which I enjoyed. I also really enjoyed the savory bites and my favorite were the shrimp salad on brioche, the cucumber on citrus cream, and the smoked salmon on pumpernickel bread. The prosciutto bite seemed a bit too salty for me. The lemon meringue tartlet was a bit sour for me, but I did like the crust. The chocolate sinclairs were devine, as for a person who loves chocolate like me. I also really enjoyed the early grey shortcake as it was light enough to drink with tea. The macarons seemed a bit sweet, but the coffee one was delicious! \n\nI would definitely come back but maybe on a colder day and on a day where I'm in no rush. The only complaints that I have is that they kicked people out past 1 o'clock to seat the next group of people. However, the restaurant was pretty empty, with about less than 10 tables filled.

The grenadine is made in-house.\n4) Blood and Sand - scotch, OJ, cherry heering, and sweet vermouth.\n \nThe sommelier came and made a presentation of each of the cocktails, and even taught us how to make our own grenadine. There was another presenter who explained where each of the cocktails was mentioned in literature and their significance.

One says \"For Adults Only\", the other says \"No cell phones\".\n\nWe were about to enter when a server at JM Curley approached us and questioned us.  We told her that we had a 5 p.m reservation.  She said she had to check to see if the waitress in there was ready to receive us.  It turned out that there was a waiter and he was ready for us.\n\nMuch to our surprise, we were the only customers during our entire meal.  Our server introduced himself to us and talked about the place and the menu.  There was background music which was apparently his personal CD that featured classically trained singers singing  songs from the last 30 years.   While it was interesting and pleasant, given the theme of the restaurant, we both thought that music from Bogie's hayday (30s and 40s) would have been more appropriate.  We, perhaps, should have pointed that out.\n\nWe both ordered drinks.  I tried one of their specials, the Shinobu which consists of: \"Bombay Sapphire Gin, Japanese Yuzu Citrus, Lychee Puree, Salted Basil Oil, Ancho Chili Oil\".  This drink had a mix of hot and sweet in it and supposedly with each sip one was supposed to experience a different taste.  It didn't quite happen like that but it was a unique drink.  My husband had a Bloody Mary which he found to be super spicy.\n\nFor our main course, we both ordered  the 8 oz filet cooked medium rare.  I forget all the toppings/sauces on it but most memorable was the red wine reduction which, to me, almost overpowered the filet.  The filet itself was cooked properly and very tender.\n\nFor our sides, we got sauteed mushrooms and grilled asparagus.  My husband ate all the mushrooms (which were button ones) which was fine with me.  The portion was rather generous.  I ate the asparagus which was grilled to perfection.\n\nFor dessert, I got a plate of four mini cannolis which had an undercurrent of cinnamon.  While I could have done without the cinnamon, they were tasty.  My husband had a small bowl of lemon sorbet.\n\nI tried to take photos.  While the waiter was making our drinks, I snapped a photo of the small dinner rolls which came with the meal.  He noticed I did this and I got slapped down (well...figuratively).  Then I got a mini lecture.  He mentioned the \"no cell phones\" sign but I didn't take them with a cell phone.   Next, I was told that they were trying to recreate the feel of an old speak easy and that if you took a photo of yourself in a speak easy, the cops could see it and come after you.  I pointed out that back then, photos had to be developed and it would be days before anyone saw them.  He admitted that I got him there.  I also pointed out that there were photos on Yelp.  He said those happened when he had to leave the room to get food.  So...I didn't take anymore photos and I won't put up the photo of the dinner rolls.\n\nAll in all, a good meal that we enjoyed.  I will say that if they don't want any photos taken,  they need to be very specific in their signage.  My guess is that some of the photos posted were done knowing that they were doing so in violation of the rules.  While others were taken while being unaware of the rules.\n\nStill, it was a unique experience with good food.  As for Bogie's --- they really need to make it crystal clear that they don't allow anyone to take photos."}]}, "Thornton's Fenway Grille": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 13, "text": "I can't wait to see this place on the tv show \"Restaurant Impossible.\"  It's about restaurants who do literally everything wrong and are going under.

Went here last night for a birthday event, something low key and casual. Since we had about 30 people of us, I , among a select few, decided to be the designated driver. Being the DD, I had coke all night, so this is not a drunk rant, rather a sober one. I noticed the people prior to me had already scoped out the drinks menu, and didn't look too impressed, so they all went with their regular drinks, drinks mind you that are served at every single bar, without question, without comment, and without an attitude. The second my friends began ordering drinks, the bartenders were clearly lost. They couldn't handle the volume, and for the life of them make a single proper mixed drink. It must've been to ridiculous shaking over the head or the pointless stirring before pouring. You'd think they would learn from their mistake because literally almost all of us had to ask them to remake their drinks. Then we began noticing these guys were taking shots, yes the bartenders were pouring shots for themselves, taking it right in front of us, and asking us what's wrong with the drinks. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!?! Now as a multiple restaurant owner in Boston, the last thing a customer wants to see is the abuse of product, attitude, and ignorance. We received all of those on a silver platter, and trust me the customers around is noticed it too. However, their friends were given the royal treatment. Midway through making our second round, they began chatting with their friends who were located right next to the bar, most likely without a tab or bill after they left. Throughout the night we continuously had to ask them to make one, just one single drink properly. Finally they did! One of us ordered a beer, in the bottle...ahhhh perfection! \n\nAfter asking for the bill and clearly having quite a few discrepancies, we had to ask them to fix it, and with attitude and a ridiculous explanation, we settled our bill. After that, Ray, yes we know your name now, the bartender with the dragon tattoo, slicked hair with the ridiculous 2-minute string if the drinks before serving, said loud enough for all 30 of us to here, \"I'm tired of serving these people\" Now, once again, as a restaurant owner, the way you bring back customers and loyalty is to create a situation where they will remember you. Ray did just that, but with the opposite reaction. After hearing that, we decided we've had enough of him, asked him for an explanation of what we clearly heard. The other bartender, yes you with the pony tail, jumped over the bar and asked us to leave, pushing us out the door. Now clearly this place shouldn't even be an establishment, let alone hired those bartenders drinking and taking shots for themselves. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, yes you the owner, I know you're reading this, you may have a great waitressing staff, but you need to let go of what's holding you down.

I seldom order Chinese food, because I always feel guilty about the amount of fried food and oil I consume.  This is NOT a problem with Chic Chick's signature poached chicken and rice. So yummy.\n\nThe Food:  Their signature dish, called The Classic, consists of poached chicken thigh (or breast) and jasmine rice, with a few slices of cucumber.   By itself, it is refreshing and healthy, albeit bland.   If you stopped right there, you'd have what I would consider a healthy meal in the take-out world of Chinese-influenced cuisine.\n\nBUT... ENTER THE SAUCES! The Sauces are the star! Chic Chick has 3 signature sauces, all nicely presented on the side.  Also, props for the hot pepper container!  The sauces vary in taste, but were all so delicious.   I could not pick a favorite.  I dipped each piece of my chicken in the sauces until it disappeared completely from my plate (err..box).  After, I poured sauce on the rice and cleaned the cardboard box enough to recycle it.  So good.\n\nI don't know that I have ever had Hainanese food, but wow.  Chicken and rice is a delicious combo in general, but the sauces here allowed me to mix just the right amount and the variation meant I could switch up sauces with each bite.  Some chicken and rice places already add the spice and sauce, so you can't control the amount or flavor. Chic Chick has you covered. Consider it almost like a meal kit, to make your own.  Mix it all together, or dip it, like you're a fancy person.  \n\nAfter I finished The Classic, I was full but felt like I had eaten healthy.  After I pile of Crab Rangoon from my local Chinese spot, I certainly can't say that.  HAHA.\n\nOVERALL:   Chic Chick in Allston is a MUST TRY spot for your chicken and rice.

It's the taste.\n\nAnd this is not only the best sushi I've had in Boston and not only the best I've had in Massachusetts but probably my fave ever. No wonder this place has great reviews - but it should have even more.

It's in the same place where the Egg Puffs are so you can't go wrong. Try those too. They were serving them up long before puffles were a thing.\n\nThis is quite simply one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. I think a lot of people are all about the decor and the experience and how upscale getting Sushi can sometimes feel. I'm not about any of those things. I want my food to be delicious and preferably I want it to be affordable and good value. So if someone is offering me $5 for a big amount of sushi that will actually semi fill me up then I'm going to give it a try. Especially when the reviews are as amazing as these. I expected it to suck - wow, was I wrong.\n\nI know that because they are in the little food court in Chinatown that they are able to keep their prices low for such a generally high price product. But oh my God that does not affect the quality whatsoever. In fact these are some of the best sushi rolls I've ever had in my life. \n\nNot just that but the people serving them are angels and some of the nicest people that I've had serve me up some sushi. I adore them and I will definitely be back here on a regular basis when I come back to Boston.\n\nNot just my favourite sushi in Boston but in the top five of the best sushi I've had in the country, possibly the best of all, and also the cheapest most affordable best value for money and some of the friendliest as well. The most unassuming, too. Talk about rewriting the rules and proving that Sushi can be a cheap street food instead of the overpriced crap that doesn't even taste as good as this that 95% of you will consume next time you eat sushi.\n\nWhen you come to Boston please try this and tell me it's not some of the best you've had. I couldn't honestly like it any more than I do. If I could give 10 Stars I would. And there's plenty of places to sit and eat even though it's in a tiny little food court.\n\nRemember to try the Egg Puffs at the back of the court - there was a time when this was your only egg puff option and what a great option it was.

They had a few that sounded decent.  The first sandwich was a fairly standard cheddar grilled cheese sandwich, which you can choose to add bacon and/or tomato too.  A little too simple for me.  They also had a sandwich with blue cheese in it, which sounded good, but there was no meat involved.  I decided on a ham and Swiss, which was called the \"Boston....\" something.  Anyway, after waiting an incredibly long amount of time I was handed a pleasantly large grilled cheese sandwich.  When I opened it the first thing that ran through my mind was, \"What? It looks like something I could make at home!\"  The ingredients appeared to be ordinary ham and Swiss, the organic bread was just an ordinary lightly grilled piece of bread, and the homemade, I think, \"apricot jalapeno spread\" was almost non-existent.  Being an optimist, I took a bite of the sandwich thinking maybe the inside tasted better.  To my dismay the sandwich tasted exactly how I thought it would...just plain ORDINARY!  Now if I'd paid around $4 for that sandwich I wouldn't complain, but the thing cost $7.44!!!  I could have easily made 3 for the same price at home!

Having been here for quite a few corporate parties and such, I do appreciate specific things that Venezia provides and are very unique to them:\n\n- Location:\nBeautiful ocean views pretty much wherever you get seated in the main restaurant. That is probably my favorite part of this restaurant. It is in a very unassuming place - quite away from the city per say, yet with enough parking spaces, next to the Boston Winery. Depends on what the occasion is, but ideal for small get togethers in their banquet room or a dinners with family / friends.\n\n- Ambiance:\nVery demure and classic old school is how I would describe the ambiance here at the Venezia. I have always been here for dinners and late evening events. Would not necessarily call it a romantic spot, but depending on the time of the year, it could very well be. Traditionally the place is quite busy during the holiday season and around the expected times of the year when everyone is out and about.  \n\n- Food:\nI must say some of the best Italian food that I have had in the Boston metro area, Venezia is up their on the list of top 10 for sure. Every thing I have tried here has been always outstanding. The price tag totally justifies what is served. From the appetizers to the main course, everything is of good quality and prepared with utmost case and dedication. The flavors are rich and absolutely satisfy your taste buds and of course your belly (expect big portions!). I do not feel like I should single out one dish from another, given I try something new every time I go to this place, but if I had to go for a repeat for some of my favs, I would easily go with the following (apps / main course etc):\n- Calamari Fritto (app)\n- Crab cake (app)\n- Veal Scallopini & Lobster Cardinale\n- Braciole\nOn a side note, if you like your Chocolate Martini to be clear, you are in for a treat! And don't feel shy to lick the chocolate crusted rim of your martini glass - I do not!\n\n- Service:\nPretty awesome. During my last visit, our table had a bunch of folks taking care of our party. A special shout out to Isaac who was always around for anything that any of us needed.\n\nIn a nutshell, I feel this place is for those who like a homey atmosphere and hence, the drive away from the madness of seaport or anything downtown Boston is really worth it. The wine selection is pretty amazing - given their affiliation with Boston Winery next door (which btw, is another beautiful space for throwing a great event).

Already from the 8:30 seating, the rice started out mushy, and only went downhill from there. The chefs kept two Japanese rice cookers behind them, and from them took out the ever deteriorating rice throughout the night. I have yet to encounter a decent sushiya that keeps their rice this way.\u00a0\nTowards the end of the meal the rice became so sticky that I had a difficult time swallowing it. This was another first.\u00a0\nThe chefs appear to have limited practice with sushi making. Sushi making is not just pressing a piece of fish on top of a pile of rice; it is an art that takes time to mature and perfect. Apprentices are not even allowed to touch fish without years of arduous rice rinsing and tamago-yaki cooking. I guess at No Relation, they learn fast. The loosely shaped rice, perfunctory piling of fish, and lackadaisical dripping of sauce illustrated their experience, or lack thereof.\u00a0\nNo Relation reminds me of why a friend of mine refuses to eat sushi made by non-Asians, and it still seems like good advice to follow, in hindsight.\u00a0\nIn the end of the day, it is not the skin color that mattered. It was arrogance and lack of respect for the craft that led to the flaws in the product. \nChef Colin, how about inviting your former O Ya colleagues over for once?

It was an enjoyable Chinese food dinner with my family over tasty Chinese food and many cups of hot tea. \n\n   Going back to being a toddler I have loved Chinese food. It is a love that will lead me into Chinatown or a Chinese restaurant when I am visiting a different city. On the second evening of our Boston vacation, we walked the streets of Chinatown looking for a Chinese restaurant that gave off a great vibe. East Ocean City ended up being that restaurant. \n\n   As soon as we walked into this decent size Chinese restaurant a short walk from the Chinatown Gate on Beach Street, the first thing I set eyes on was the live fish tank and lobster tanks. If I wanted to step out of my comfort zone, I could of ordered fresh fish from the tank. I was determined to stick to my safety zone. Off the pages of the vast menu I ordered a bowl of their wonton soup, fried rice, and shrimp lo mein. Served with hot tea.\n\n    A pet peeve that I have with some of the restaurants in Chinatown, especially Las Vegas, is when an infinitesimal amount of it is in English. This makes it a slight challenge to know what you are ordering and paying for it. Here, the menu was patron friendly. And the menu appeared to specialize in the Cantonese style of Chinese food. \n\n  A bowl of roast pork won ton soup ($4) started it off. I have never met a bowl of wonton soup that I didn't like. The four wontons and broth were very good. Next up was a bowl of shrimp fried rice ($10.75) that we shared. My main course was the shrimp lo mein ($10.75). Going against a common tradition of dining in Chinatown, we opted out of eating with chop stix. With the aid of a fork, I enjoyed the sufficient serving of shrimp lo mein. In contrast to many of the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed in Las Vegas and dined in throughout New York ; this shrimp lo mein stood out because it was more of a pad thai style. Lesson learned, you are never 100 % safe in your dining comfort zone. Overall, the food and hot tea was good. \n\n   As far as the service, there were zero issues. When we asked for a knife, more Sweet N Low, or more hot tea; the waiter would satisfy our request. The waiter never rushed us. In addition to decent service, the clean silverware and restaurant were further displays of good customer service. \n\n  I enjoyed my Boston Tea party with my family.  Subsequently to this dining experience, I have become a regular hot tea drinker. Now if I lived near Boston Chinatown, I might have become a regular at East Ocean City. They are obviously doing something right. They have been open since 1991. Since this time, the owner has expanded to five restaurants. Near the live fish and lobster tanks are a few of the awards that they were nominated. This includes a Best of Boston award. In conclusion, East Ocean City gave off a great vibe that delivered into a solid Chinese restaurant."}]}, "Dosa Factory - Boston": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 5, "text": "I usually don't like writing negative reviews but this place truly deserves it.

I decided on turkey for my protein and then went with carrots and beets for my vegetables and a white cheese for my cheese.  The lettuce here looked like a nice mixed greens and I topped it all off with a balsamic dressing.  It tasted decently enough and I think I was happier about being able to eat healthy than I was about the actual product.  Still there wasn't anything wrong with it and I think that it fills a great niche.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

Their slogan is \"An American Bistro serving elevated street food to vegans, vegetarians, meat eaters, and the gluten intolerant alike\". Great that they offer GF and Veg options! Their presentation of the food is also usually on point.

When we pulled up and valeted the car my initial impression was, \"Wow, this place looks pretty cool.\" I loved the speak-easy vibe when we were greeted at the door, carded and headed down stairs.  Once we got down, granted it was a slow Sunday there was no one there to guide us to a seat or to the bar.  The place was empty except for the bar so we just looked at each other and said, \"Okay, bar it is\". \n\nAs we sat ourselves, I noticed no TV's, which I guess is fine since I think they are going for that traditional speak-easy vibe, but still a miss in my opinion.  First things I noticed were the bar was a mess.  Having worked in this industry, I was shocked since I assumed they'd be putting their best foot forward having just opened, the bar was already very scratched up, and there were no hooks to hang my purse or umbrella (I always notice that).  Menus were tossed across the back bar, bottles littered the counters too.  We were greeted by the bartender, who was very nice, he made me an excellent Grey Hound and the bf ordered a beer.  They don't have anything on tap which my bf noticed and was disappointed about.  We decided to then order, I was pretty confused when looking at the menu, nothing is outlined as an appetizer or entr\u00e9e, so we just assumed what was what.  The menu was also small and fairly foreign to us, we both safely choose the two pasta dishes and were pleasantly surprised, they turned out great-expensive, but tasty. \n\nNow what I was so disappointed in was as we sat and ate, there were non-stop distractions going on behind the bar.  There were probably a totally of 4 or 5 people behind the bar cleaning and talking amongst each other.  As our meals were placed in front of us, I believe one of the bar backs came over and started cleaning-running continuous water, pulling up grates, moving bottles.  There were bottles everywhere. All we wanted to do at that point was finish and leave, I almost felt like I was in the way.  I noticed the couple to my right who were enjoying a few drinks, had leftover beer bottles just sitting in front of them, why all the trash?? The mess and distractions alone killed the experience, and in truth I go out and choose a place based on the food but equally important the environment and experience!

There is seriously no reason not to check this place out. I really hope it succeeds, but honest feedback is important too.\n\nI sat on a low diner stool at a long counter in the dining room. There's also a separate to-go area off the main entrance--nice idea to control the mayhem on busy weekend mornings. The menu is a single laminated page, good-looking. They were only serving the breakfast part of the menu today, not the burgers and salads and things on the lunch side. Seemed reasonable given they've only been open a few days.\n\nI asked my server what the best item on the menu was. She wouldn't give me her opinion, but another guy nearby joked that he was off-shift and could offer unbiased advice: the French toast. I said I was in more of an eggy mood, and I got a little bit of a ribbing for going in a completely different direction. I deserved it--point being the staff were happy and having a good time.\n\nI went for the \"TAB's corned beef hash\" with poached eggs, which came with some breakfast potatoes (and also toast, which I declined). At $13, plus a $1 upcharge for ordering the eggs poached, it was one of the most expensive things on the menu; weird since hash is just supposed to be fried, chopped up leftover meat and potatoes, but it's what I was in the mood for. I also got a $4.50 nitro brew coffee, which was fine but unremarkable. (There are also plenty of much cheaper options on the menu.)\n\nIt took about 20 minutes for my food to arrive, during which time I could hear the chef in the kitchen calling out orders to other staff--seemed pretty chaotic back there given it's a 60+ seat restaurant with only 12 patrons in it. Notably, the hand-wash sink was visible from my seat and there was lots of hand-washing going on. Good sign.\n\nAnd then the wheels came off. I'm not the best egg-cooker in the world, but I could tell the eggs were overcooked before the plate touched the counter in front of me; there's no way they ever should have left the kitchen. Completely solid as I cut into them, if they had been fried they would have been a firm over-medium. I showed my server, saying I didn't need to send them back but in the form of feedback they were not really what anyone would call properly poached eggs. She said to hold on a minute, went back into the kitchen, returned and said the chef thanked me for the feedback. I dug in. The hash was a uniform, very small dice of corned beef and potato, more toothsome than hash usually is--almost chewy--and tasted fine but nothing special. As I was finishing, my server came back with two more poached eggs, saying chef had tried to get it right this time. Nice gesture, but given it was a surprise I was basically done eating, and (again, I'm an amateur here) they were very obviously *undercooked* this time, with translucent raw egg white spilling onto the plate when broken into.\n\nTotal damage: $19.80 + $5 tip for unremarkable nitro brew coffee, unremarkable corned beef hash, unremarkable breakfast potatoes, toast (declined), two overcooked poached eggs which were replaced by two undercooked poached eggs, ice water and an artsy carved-up orange slice garnish. And, in all honesty, great service from a fun server.\n\nTakeaways:\n - Breakfast restaurants really shouldn't be upcharging for poached eggs, and chefs in breakfast restaurants really should know how to poach an egg. Swallow your pride and just use a timer.\n - If you can't do something well, regardless of whether you should be able to, it's better to make up an excuse than to serve a customer bad food. I would have just ordered my eggs another way, and I almost certainly would have left quite a bit happier.\n - At $13, corned beef hash in a casual restaurant several miles from downtown really needs to be out-of-this-world corned beef hash. Drop the price, change the ingredients, something.\n - The owners really need to do some better research. There is a sketchy convenience store two blocks away that serves an absolutely legendary diner-style breakfast.

Second, the only thing I can think of that remotely resembles this dish is the moo shu pancake dish at Mulan (which you should certainly try if you never have). The chapati strips, soaked in the delicious sauce of beef, peppers and onions, came out both crisp and tender. The steak tips were chewy yet soft. The dish was filling without feeling the slightest bit greasy or heavy.\n\nMovement 4: Service and Decor\n\nTawakal's owners, Yahya and his cousin Abdi, deserve a movement all their own. They are possibly the nicest restaurateurs I have ever met. Not only are they attentive, warm and friendly, but their passion for their homeland and their homeland's food is clear to anyone who speaks to them for more than 10 seconds. Oh, and they are incredibly easy on the eyes. ;) The decor is very bare bones without being dirty or sketchy. It invites a laid-back, casual vibe that few could disagree with. And there's a gorgeous corner of the restaurant that's suitable for large groups. It's covered with beautiful blankets, cushions and other paraphernalia, and groups can choose to dine there sitting on the floor for a truly authentic Somali experience.\n\nCoda: The.Tea.\n\nThe complimentary tea is a tea of magnificent, epic proportions. It is a black tea spiced with cardamon, cinnamon and cloves. It tastes sweet, slightly tart (from the clove) and soothing. It comes out piping hot and you can have as much of it as you want. Yahya explained that it was an original creation of his and now I'm kind of inspired to create teas of my own! He even offered us some extra tea for the road. If you dine here and leave without trying this tea, consider your experience a failure until you've had it. It's that good."}]}, "Uptown Espresso Caffe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 5, "text": "Whomever said their pastries were subpar has not tried their mini-cheesecakes.

You get a review like the one from Amy L. To say something looked disgusting and then that it was \"tasty\" is just ignorant. \n\nI am writing an update to my previous review because I felt it was needed. My girlfriend and I dined here twice in a few days. Our second experience was even better than the first. Once again, the service was impeccable and spot on. \n\nTo start, we ordered the ceviche, and a couple of mixed drinks. The ceviche will take about 20 minutes to be prepared properly, so don't rush it and definitely plan ahead. This was anticipated because there is a disclaimer on the menu, communication is the key to any successful relationship. Jalapenos made it clear that this would take a bit, but it was well worth the wait. I love ceviche and the Jalapenos version was no exception. You can choose between scallops, shrimp, or fish. We opted for the shrimp. The citrus from the lime juice, along with the fresh ingredients consisting of pico de gallo and hand made salsa, and the temperature of the dish made it create a wave of flavor that I can only describe as refreshing, phenomenal, and down right delicious. We were impressed to learn that all the seafood they use come straight from Gloucester as well. Nothing is frozen or from a restaurant distributor. \n\nImpressive. \n\nTo switch it up, I went with the beef quesadillas. They are served with a side of sour cream, homemade guacamole, and black beans. The portion size was great, big enough that I took a couple of pieces home. The type of meat that was used was, again, that slow cooked, mouth watering beef. One thing that I did notice was that they were a little bland. I can chalk this up to their attempt to cater to the majority of their customers rather than the few that are adventurous. This is not a problem at all, just be sure to have them add whatever ingredients that you want to kick it up a notch. I went with the habenero sauce on the side again, I just can't get enough of that stuff.\n\nI got my biggest surprise when I order a Negra Modelo  and it was served in a pint glass without the bottle. When I inquired about this, I was informed that they actually have it on tap. This is not something that you see at a lot of places, and definitely made me appreciate how hard Jalapenos has worked to provide the best overall experience with authentic Mexican cuisine. Like I had just mentioned, the service was fantastic. Poncho answered our questions, and again, we were successfully guided through the menu with some great suggestions. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, this place has all the ingredients of a great establishment. Their food is authentic and made with the finest ingredients. Their drinks are made from in-house recipes (such as the sangria being made from scratch) and well priced. The service is friendly and punctual. \n\nI am impressed, to say the least, and I am definitely looking forward to my next visit.... again."}]}, "Currito": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 37, "text": "Bangkok Chicken Burrito is that airplane snack your tastebuds desire for your plane ride anywhere.

We ended up staying for four hours, while sitting at the bar, being treated like royalty and we ate some of the best dishes we've ever eaten IN OUR LIVES!\n\nLet me set the scene for you fine readers.  Night.  November.  Very cold.  Probably the first really really really quick let's sprint from the car to the restaurant because it's freaking freezing out kinda night.  I had heard about Da Vinci Ristorante for about 2 years now.  I remember reading an article in the Boston Globe about a chef of Indian descent who goes by the name, Peppino and cooks Italian cuisine.  I also remember reading that the restaurant was co-owned by a woman named Wioletta, of Polish descent.  Well, I'm a quarter Polish, the fiance is half Italian and we love to eat.  I've always wanted to try Da Vinci, but sadly, my life has never led me to this place.  Until that fateful night.\n\nWe get a parking space about a half block away.  We walk in the beautiful restaurant and are promptly greeted.  We ask if we could sit at the bar and were kindly led to their great bar.  We met the bartender, named Cengis -- who was the GREATEST bartender I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  He made my fiance a negroni and I had a glass of Nero d'Avola.  It was a hearty pour and it was straight up comfort to my freezing bones.  I was looking around the restaurant for Peppino, but I couldn't find him.  I told Cengis that I was hoping he'd be in the restaurant that night and Cengis assured me that he would.  He did not lie.  About 10 minutes later in comes Peppino, just as I pictured.  Tall, dark, and handsome!  He has the most lovely personality and accent.  He was so genuinely happy to see people enjoying his food.  He got to work in the kitchen and came by to personally see how the food was.  It was just like Peppino, PEFECT.  I'll get to that now....\n\nI was getting hungry and we looked at their menu.  Would you believe they offer a 3 course menu for $33.09?  Well, they do!  YEAR ROUND!!  You can sit at the table, or just sit at the bar.  We have been back twice now and enjoy Da Vinci very much!\n\nWe opted for their wonderful pasta tasting as an appetizer.  It's very affordable and it comes with butternut squash agnolotti which is stuffed with Amaretto biscotti butternut squash and finished with a brown butter sage sauce.  This is what I got for my meal on our second visit.  The other pastas that come with the tasting are gnocchi pomodoro, ravioli short ribs, and fusilli bologonese.  AMAZING!!! \n\nThen, for our meal I decided to get the 3 course dinner.  I had the most  uplifting and comforting bowl of pumpkin soup with Carribean potatoes, carrots, pumpkin puree, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  I want to swim in this stuff.  DELICIOUS!  My fiance got the crab cakes the other night, but the night of our first visit he got -- okay, I don't remember as I was so happy to be eating at Da Vinci and eating some great soup.  I think he got the beef carpaccio and I'm almost positive he did.  He said it was great.  For our main courses, I got the pork shank.  I never ever ever will order meat unless I am at a steak place but this meat spoke to me as it came with a juniper berry sauce.  So delighful.  It was accompanied with saffron risotto and broccoli rabe.  The port wine apple juniper berry sauce was the icing on the cake, or the finish on the shank, if you will.  I want to bathe in it!!\n\nMy fiance chose the rack of lamb which is grilled and served with saffron risotto and sauteed asparagus and finished with veal demi glaze peppercorn sauce.\n\nAnd, for dessert I chose the crostata which takes about 15-18 minutes to bake and comes with fruit and a little ice cream.  Absolutely.  Fabulous.  My fiance got the pumpkin spiced creme brulee, which is served with a homemade pumpkin cookie.  You would think for all this food, we'd have to win the lottery to pay for it.  No.  You'd be wrong.  Da Vinci is so affordable and the food is so delicious, awe-inspiring, homemade quality that you will just feel happy and full after eating here!\n\nWhew!  Well, when we went back the other night, we were once again treated like royalty.  Wioletta was working the door and she sat us in the dining room.  She asked if we had been to Da Vinci before and when I enthusiastically answered, \"YES!!  We have!!\", she smiled and the wait staff who previously chatted with us at the bar on our last visit all came by to say hi and tell us how great it was to see us.  She sat us by their open kitchen.  I love the open kitchen, you get to see all the action!  Peppino was working and saw us and smiled and sent over an amuse bouche of mozzarella arancini.  It was perfect.\n\nPeppino is perfect.

She then went and printed a new receipt. We just sat there in total shock and disbelief. She kept pacing back and forth while staring at us. We were still sitting there processing what happened before she walked up and picked the receipt up, flattened it closer to my friend and tapped the pen on it.\n\nI felt like i was on an episode of the twilight zone.

The location thusly attracts many of the kind of pols and businessmen responsible for the very policies and avarice that undoubtedly contributed to Barbara Lynch's early impoverishment. Vengeance would be tempting, but Lynch did better: she made No. 9 Park into one of Boston's best restaurants, and herself into one of America's most revered chefs and businesswomen.\n\nDespite possessing elegance in spades, No. 9 Park is no dollhouse. Tables are minimally decorated, and unassuming chairs are provided for comfort rather than ornamentation. Brown wood paneling creates an upscale feel without necessarily being fancy. The food looks appetizing, but not in an OCD \"let's break out the tweezers\" way like at Lynch's newer, swankier, 'Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux'-listed flagship restaurant, Menton.\n\nHere, the usage of cutting-edge culinary technology is kept minimal, along with flavors and ingredients that are kept basic. Despite that, there is perhaps more than meets the eye to a lot of the dishes, such as the famed Bolognese sauce that Serious Eats' J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt revealed was buoyed by finely-chopped chicken livers as its \"secret ingredient\" during his stint in the kitchen at No. 9 Park.\n\nBarbara Lynch's restaurants love French and Italian cuisines and finding the interplay between both. The best example of this is No. 9 Park's foie gras-infused Gnocchi stuffed with prune pur\u00e9e, which has been on the menu since forever and is one of my favorite bites of food in all of Boston, if not all of anywhere. This is a complex dish, with a taste of prune that is delightful yet \"fleeting,\" chased down one's gullet by an oaky nuttiness from the almonds. Another pasta dish I recently enjoyed was No. 9 Park's ultra-rich farfalle in its delectable gravy sauce made of braised boar, with fennel caramelized to the point of being crispy. Thankfully I had this as part of a tasting, because a regular entr\u00e9e-sized bowl could stop hearts, both figuratively and literally. Similarly, the butter-poached salmon was about as rich of a salmon dish as one will eat. This is not a restaurant I'd go to while dieting.\n\nAlthough non-Bostonians may mistake any collection of regulars in the saloon as evidence of provinciality, there is no mistaking the fact that No. 9 Park is a lively restaurant with a unique social atmosphere encouraged by charismatic servers who react to your needs before you are even aware of them. In my half-dozen or so visits, I have always had fantastic service here. During my most recent meal, I casually shared with my waiter my preference for \"whole\" foie gras dishes over terrines and was surprised with a \"bonus dish\" with my tasting: a swoon-worthy plate of seared Hudson Valley foie gras over a pile of satiny duck confit and pomegranate with a pair of sweet potato agnolotti, which were beautiful little dumplings filled with nothing short of nirvana.\n\nI consider the Chef's Tasting Menu one of the best-value d\u00e9gustations in Boston, as there are always bonuses and treats added in addition to the stated six courses, which are all of decent size. During my most recent visit (February 2018), the Chef's Tasting Menu was $125, plus 7% tax, plus tip. You could spend a lot more for a lot less in Boston.\n\nNo. 9 Park is turning 20 years old in a few weeks. In many other cities, it could qualify as a \"historic\" restaurant. Yet, to me, each visit to this excellent restaurant still feels new and fresh, which is part of what makes it a special place.\n\nFood/D\u00e9cor/Service: 4.7/4.3/4.7"}]}, "Jaho Coffee & Tea": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 10, "text": "I really like this cafe and would probably hang out here if it weren't a pandemic!

Over the years, the price has only increased by a small amount in keeping with inflation- you still get a lot of food here cost-wise.\n\nI say that I \"used\" to always get the Special Dinners because I've been getting the \"Appetizer Combos\" recently.\n\nIn much the same way that the Special Dinners are overloaded with food, the Appetizer Combos also come with a good heaping of food- on several occasions- so much so that the box wouldn't even completely close and had to be stapled shut!\n\nGoing back to what I mentioned before- the food for this is also finished at the end so it's super fresh and juicy when you get it.\n\nThe people here are really nice and it's my favorite restaurant in the area. If you haven't already, you should give their iced tea a try! They come in quart containers (over the quart line actually, so a bit more than a quart!) for $2 each. Their lemonade is also really good too (both use real fruit as evidenced by the citrus inside), but personally I prefer the sweet tea. Where the lemonade is a 4.5, the sweet tea (they call it iced tea) is a solid 5/5. Marginally better in my opinion, but both are good!\n\nDespite the other reviews, I truly believe that this restaurant is a Fields Corner hidden gem- I've been to this restaurant many times over the past several years and granted- while there may have been 1 or 2 times total when I ordered and the quality wasn't at it's best- it was still really good.

There are two sections where the \"operation lines\" are to streamline the service, but it was just so poorly executed. One girl asked me what I wanted - I told her a rice bowl. She put my rice, beans, and steak in the bowl then disappeared. She had barely looked at me until she couldn't hear what I asked for. It took about another few minutes before the next person came and touched my bowl (literally moved it an inch down the line) then left. Finally, I was able to finish my order. When I paid, the girl just reached her hand out for my card, didn't tell me how much it was, and didn't give my my receipt. \n\nCan we talk about portion sizes? Barely a full scoop of rice, a solid amount of steak for my bowl and a TON of black beans (literally that was probably all I was eating).

If you get a rice bowl, they charge you an extra $1.50 for cheese, but it comes complimentary with the salad bowl - what? My boyfriend ended up paying almost $10 for his small-portion bowl and I paid $8.55 for mine. Not only are the portions tiny overall, but each part of the bowl was so unbalanced.

Beans for days.\n\nPros: the meats are the same price no matter what you get, you can get extra pico without a surcharge (it could use a little salt, but it was refreshing), there is the spicy green hot sauce that I recommend, and free water - just ask for a water cup.\n\nCons: tiny and unproportionate portions, unorganized and inattentive service, meat was honestly not that great in flavor - I much rather go to Chipotle, extra charge for a basic component like cheese.\n\nThis experience was just so disappointing.

Be prepared to pay a credit card charge for orders under $10 at half the places here.\n\nThe best part is the view through the skylights of the Prudential tower. It definitely gives a different perspective on things when you gaze up. A number of the seats allow that view to be had as well. \n\nThe seating area was a bit cleaner than I usually come across in a place like this. The table the munchkin and I were at wasnt sticky and the chairs had been wiped clean as well. The bathrooms here were fairly clean also. Definitely a good thing to me as well.\n\nHowever most of the places here are just what you expect; coffee, fake southern, fake chinese, fake mexican, clamchowder (this is New England afterall), chicken joint, fake italian and to mix it up they had a ben n jerrys, bakery and chocolate joint.

My skirt steak was probably the best choice of the bunch and ended up being two meals, it was so large. \n\nI want to call out that the presentation of the food, particularly my meal, was unappealing.

I decided to still go to the shop as soon as I could because we know how black folks are with closing etc and sitting in the shop. There were (2) girls in this hop (NOT HODJA, other place) and no one tried to give me (2) braids or help me. I was ignored. I actually had gotten box braids from this place (3) months ago and wanted to give them more business. I decided since I was waiting for my girl to get there, I would go get my nails & toes done. I came back to the shop around 6:45 /7 p.m. and still - no one could do my hair and the girl I was waiting on phone died and she was not there. I was going out of town the following morning, so I had to get my hair done THIS night. I looked on Yelp (thnak you Yelp) and found Hadja.\n\nI called, she answered, and said i could come in. I rushed to this shop and she was doing someone else hair, so I had to wait for 20 minutes. She told me she would charge (I THINK $50) for 2 braids and I said OKAY. I was desperate because I was going on vacation and needed some weave. Sisters, you know what I am saying. Hadja SLAYED my (2) braids - she even re-braided one braid because she thought it was not perfect enough. So yes, I recommend this shop because a lot of these shops close at 5 p.m. or 4 p.m. or are rude to BLACK AMERICANS. \n\nHere, at Hadja, she was professional, nice, and did a great job. My braids lasted (2) weeks and I got them wet. I will return.  I think if you have thinner or shorter hair the price would be lower. I was not happy about spending $50 bucks, but I did not want to go to summer vacation with my natural hair out - that would have ruined my vacation, so I spent $50 and didn't have to worry about my hair for weeks. When I took out the (2) braids I wore my hair wavy for a week. My hair is 4B past my shoulders - extremely thick. The shop was your standard braid shop, kind of clean, kind of dirty, in a black neighborhood.

The fried oysters, clams, fish, scallops, and shrimp are made with identical batter and cooked in the same flavorless oil as the french fries.

The cole slaw tasted as though it was purchased in mass from Costco. Their tarter sauce was a disproportionate mixture of mayonnaise and sweet relish-a sickening amount of sweet relish. The lobster roll bread was bone dry. Furthermore, the amount of lobster included was deceptively masked beneath an abundance of the mayonnaise/sweet relish concoction.

I'm a huge fan of Mario's restaurants, having been in New York and L.A. and immensely enjoying the food, atmosphere and service. I gleefully headed to Babbo, happy to have a Mario Batali restaurant in my own backyard and arrived 5 minutes early for my 9 p.m. reservation (party of 7). \n\nWe were told it would be about 15 minutes (9:10, ok I can deal) so we made our way to the bar for a glass of wine. Fifteen minutes turned into 40 and we were finally seated (mind you - we had a reservation for 9 p.m.) at 9:40. I had good company, so was not completely annoyed, but still definitely hungry at this point. We decide to order some appetizers and were informed we cannot order appetizers independently of the entrees. Not sure why this rule - I do understand they may all come out at different times in accordance with kitchen cook times, but we can't even order them? Alright, I will roll with the punches here. Finally, we order and eagerly await our food. \n\nIn the meantime, I ask for some bread. Small, paper wrapped loaves are brought out, along with packaged breadsticks. I request some butter and am met with \"We have oil. You want oil?\" Yes please. Odd they never offered bread or oil to begin with; especially since at this point we've been waiting an hour and a half - 40 minutes of which was to simply be seated. At this point, we're all super hungry and the food finally starts to roll out. However, one of the guests in our party is not served. We politely wait 5 minutes, and still his food has not arrived. We ask the waiter where it is and he says he will go check. 15 more minutes pass and most of us had nervously began eating our food before it got cold, feeling impolite for our poor comrade who still hadn't received his dish.\n\nNow, at this point I would choc it up to a bad night at Babbo. They'd messed up the reservation, messed up the bread and messed up the food. Our food was tasty, yes, but everyone had been so ravenous and kept to wait it put a damper on the evening.\n\nFrom there - it went from bad to straight up unacceptable. The manager, Caroline came over and gave an unenthusiastic apology and offered to get a glass of wine for the guest who did not get his meal. When she came back, she poured it so sloppily (almost angrily) that it spilled all over the table. She did the same thing with the second glass of wine. At this point, one of the other guests in our party went to talk to the manager privately. Watching from afar, her demeanor turned from blas\u00e9 to defensive and all I heard were her snippy, childlike sing-songy retorts of \"Oooh, no, how long HAVE you been waiting?\" She then came back to our table (the rest of us were unaware of their conversation) and proceeded to berate and lecture the rest of us on the merits of human decency, bellowing for the rest of the patrons to hear. I was shocked by her unprofessionalism and discourteousness.\n\nFeeling completely browbeaten for absolutely no reason, on top of the long wait and slow service, we quickly decided to pay and leave. The manager went so far as to tell the waiters not to box our leftovers; in an effort to get us to leave as quickly as possible (I am sure she was starting to feel embarrassed for her mad rant). \n\nWhat could have been a fun evening with delicious food and great company, quickly dissolved into something that left me so befuddled I felt like I was on a hidden camera show.

It is YOU who:\na. doesn't know what you're talking about\nb. has problems with your taste buds\nc. may have a mental issue\nd. all of the above\n\nI'm quite fond of their pizza. Boston Pizza Express was the very first place that I ever conquered eating a large cheese pizza on my own. It wasn't even a dare or anything. I was in high school and just had a fantastic appetite. There was no reward in the big picture, but realistically? I got to eat pizza and boy, it's good.\n\nAt first, I used to think that being able to wolf down large amounts of food wasn't incredibly attractive or good looking, but as I've gotten older and explored new ideas regarding food, I've come to realize that the idea of eating food, regardless of the amount, is incredibly attractive, depending on the gender! In reality, gender plays a huge role when it comes to food.\n\nFor example, if someone asks you to imagine a guy eating pizza, you'll probably imagine a huge, hungover guy with a pot belly standing in front of the fridge, naked, with a cold slice out of the fridge in one hand, a glass of milk in the other hand, all while leaning against the kitchen counter, putting down the glass once every so often to scratch his butt. However, if someone asks you to imagine a girl eating pizza, you'll probably see a good looking girl with beautiful hair that is inexplicably, somehow, blowing in nonexistent wind, taking a bite into a hot, crisp slice and seeing the cheese string out and she'll look at you seductively all while licking extra sauce off her upper lip with her tongue.\n\nI've eaten at Boston Pizza Express since I was an itty bitty child and I've always avoided writing about it because well, I couldn't write so many reviews about eating such large amounts barbarically, right? Well, not anymore. I'm not scared to tell people that I like to eat large quantities when the quality is great, especially since now, I'd like to think that people imagine I look great when I'm eating a whole pizza by myself.

I flagged down another waitress and asked her to find ours and told her I was pissed off.  \n\nMagically, our waitress appears with our appetizer (an Irish pizza - which was delicious) but her snarky attitude was less than appreciated.

I absolutely HATE when this happens.  First of all there's no room on the \"tables for two\" for all of those plates and secondly, if I wanted to eat that much food at once, I'd just go to a buffet and skip the shoddy service.  When she brought out the food, she offered a beer on the house which meant nothing to me since I wasn't the one drinking.  \n\nWhen she brought the beer she asked me, \"Are you still mad at us?\"  And I told her, honestly, \"yes\" and explained that when confronted about the service, she should have stepped up and admitted it was her fault instead of trying to push it off on whether we ordered from the bar or whatever.

Everything was going really well.  The manager was easy to work with and accommodating, we were allowed to set up our area of the bar well before our reservation, and were assured that we would have a great server to take care of all of our needs.\n\nTrue, there was a bit of a wrinkle as when we arrived, the bar was completely evacuated and the Boston Fire Department was on the scene.  Unfortunately, the food we ordered was presented to those in attendance just before the fire alarm went off.  So, when we were allowed back into the bar, the food was ice cold.  My friend (the one who made most of the arrangements) very nicely asked our server if it was possible to warm the food (not comp it, not re-fire it, just warm it).  She was promptly told NO and there was absolutely nothing the server was willing to do about it.  A discussion with management never took place.  Then, the server pretty much disappeared.  As a result, several members of our party started tabs at the bar.  As a host of the party, I elected to wait her out and start a tab with her.  BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nI do not drink a difficult drink - Stoli Oranj and soda.  I also ordered an Absolut and Tonic for my fiancee.  When the server returned, she pretty much threw two drinks at me, neither of which were the cocktails I ordered.  I tried to stop her and she turned on her heel and walked away.  This occurred several more times throughout the evening.  Once, instead of the two simple cocktails I ordered, she brought me a Cape Codder and some other brown drink.  Ridiculous.\n\nOther members of the party were equally frustrated and displayed this through their tips.  Therefore, when I asked for my tab, she returned with two check presenters, threw one of them back at me, and announced \"I am not accepting this tip.\"  Sure, it was $2 on $50 but based on her behavior, she was lucky to get that.  Also, as a former cocktail waitress and fine dining server, one of the first things you learn is when receiving tips, you sometimes just have to grin and bear it.  \n\nSo, I signed my tab and handed it back to her.

So then our main dishes came out. The lobster ravioli was warm, covered in thick white sauce,ravioli al dente filled with chunky pieces of lobster. If you are into alfredo though, the parpadelle will probably be the best dish you've ever had. It does not disappoint. And the cod, oh my goodness. I would totally go back for their cod. Those were my favorite from my first visit. Cannoli and caramel flan was a very nice ending. \n\nWe got lucky with this spot tonight. I called last minute. No reservation, just showed up, and got sat down with a party of 7. They don't seat you unless the entire party is there. Smallest little spot at the back corner with an intimate view of the back office watching servers walk pass holding fabulous Italian dishes, black curtain flying in and out. Great view of the street of Hanover on a Saturday night. Fantastic company.

I organized the event with original designs on Marliave or Fogo De Chao as our dining destination, but when I realized that the event was growing and needed to accommodate a larger group of hungry Yelpers, I swapped the venue to Davio's, which has been a Dine Out Boston favorite of mine for quite some time. The Summer 2019 edition was no exception!\n\nDavio's is a \"Northern Italian Steakhouse\", so they cast a pretty wide net of menu items. On the main dinner menu, there's everything from seafood to housemade pastas, and of course, steaks. However, we were ballin' on a budget, and here for Dine Out, so let's just chat about that instead! There were two choices for appetizers, three for entrees, and two for desserts, all for the very fair price of $38. Compared to the prices on an average non-Dine Out visit, this is downright cheap. I was worried that the portion sizes would reflect the lower price, but everything was well sized and quite filling, especially the entree. I was impressed and pleasantly surprised!\n\nWe all started out with the same appetizer, a duo of arancini rice balls stuffed with fresh crabmeat and fried to a golden brown. They were served alongside a ramekin of citrus aioli, which provided a nice contrast to the crispy goodness of the rice ball. There was also an ample amount of crabmeat, which was flavorful and filling. Along with some warm popovers, this provided an excellent start to our meal. The other option was a bruschetta with olive tapenade and heirloom tomatoes. I can't stand olives, so I made like Ariana Grande and said \"thank u, next\" to that one!\n\nThe entree was a strong point of the meal for me, even though I broke the mold of everyone else's Swordfish Spiedini order and got the Scallop Spaghetti, which was served in an olive oil based sauce with chopped tomatoes and smoky gunciale, bacon's yummier Italian cousin. The pasta is homemade, and you can definitely tell in every perfect, al dente bite. The scallops were just okay, but I am not a huge scallop fan - I was more in it for the carbs. No worries, my boyfriend was thrilled to supplement his swordfish with my castoffs. No one in our party got the third option, a crispy chicken with lemon butter sauce, but if the pasta wasn't made in house, I had my eye on that one, too.\n\nFinally, the dessert course arrived, and this was also super great. The Amaretto Cheesecake was my selection, and it came beautifully plated with fresh whipped cream and raspberry sauce. The cake wasn't too heavy or cloying, and the amaretto lent a light almond flavor to the dessert that cut through the richness of the creamy cheese layer. I also ordered a side of homemade strawberry ice cream a la carte after I was convinced by our server to do so. It was one scoop, but it was LIFE CHANGING. Seriously, if you go here, you need to get the ice cream. Trust me.\n\nDine Out Boston Summer 2019 was a success, overall. The courses were yummy, and the company was excellent. Special thanks to Joop, David, and Mark for making their way to Downtown Boston on a Friday evening to hang out and kick off Labor Day Weekend in style! We had a great time, not only for the food, but also for the fun conversation and wonderful camaraderie.

The noodles themselves were just average and I wasn't impressed. So was the broth. As the broth was decently flavorful, it had no body, like most ramen broths do. I liked the fact that there was a diversity of proteins with this offering and I liked the barbecued pork, as it resembled bacon. The chicken wasn't too dry but that's probably because the soup provided tons of support. The shrimp was tiny but decently grilled. The chikuwa and egg provided some semblance of authenticity. With the small portion of ramen, even though you get a wide-range of food on that ramen, it leaves you feeling lacking. \n\nThe dining is clean, vast but perhaps sterile for some. Service was okay.

While Lolita is like a True Blood sexy vampire set, Buttermilk & Bourbon is like a New Orleans creepy voodoo killer set. It is dark across their multiple rooms, which each have separate vibes, but I couldn't get over the \"Strange things happen below sea level\" in a red blood font next to the oyster shucker and the strange dark blue and bright green lights in their lounge areas that are very hard on the eyes.\n\nFor food, we ordered their SWEET & SPICY BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN ($9) that came with 6 wings. The wings were soggy, not quite spicy or sweet, and definitely not fried well. I was confused as to what these wings were supposed to be, because instead of ordering fried chicken, I got wings that you would get when you reheat frozen wings from the grocery store. I would recommend trying their wings with the sauce on the side, maybe that will help. We also thought the MAC & CHEESE ($13) looked interesting with aged gouda and hot cheeto crust, but in reality it really was just mac & cheese with hot cheetos on top. The worst part, though, was that the hot cheetos were so stale and tasted old on top of the mac and cheese. If you would like to attempt this dish, make it at home! Because we were still hungry, we also ordered the CAJUN GUACAMOLE, which had shrimp in it. I told the waitress I have an oyster allergy, but she seemed very concerned and had the manager come over and verify that I was okay with the shrimp, to which he said he would take care of it. Without telling us, we received our guacamole without shrimp and were still charged full price for the guac. I'm very confused as to why this happened this way? So for essentially normal guac, we paid $12. \n\nTo end our night, our bill is presented stabbed through a voodoo doll.

I don't want to get a bunch of mean emails about theorizing about the state of people's souls, but come on... occasionally you have to look at the *bigger picture* and not be so hard on the little guys. \n\nFirst of all, if you'd like a sandwich in under three minutes, you are always, always welcome to go to Al's State Street Cafe down the street. There you will find a place where it is expected that you will be treated like a $5 bill because that's what you are. A $5 bill in a long line of $5 bills (and the occasional $5 and two $1, for the thicker of the bunch...). You'll get a sandwich and you will leave. Ta da!\n\nBut this little deli is just a neighborhood deli. They changed their name from Boston Deli Deluxe to Trattoria Andiamo and yes, we all agree, it was a poor decision, but they are not marketers, they are sandwich makers. But it also doesn't matter. It's just a name. They've been there for 17 years... I'm sure a lot of people wish they could rename their children after 17 years... \n\nNow that we've established that it's a neighborhood deli, let's talk about what that means. There are real people in there making sandwiches as quickly as they can. God bless everyone, it does take forever, but you will notice that it does not take forever because they are chatting with each other and ignoring people. It takes forever because they are running around like a bunch of crazies trying to keep up with all those sandwiches. Add to that the fact that they added a panini press to enhance the customer experience and you've got a nightmare, but they are genuinely trying to make tasty lunches for you. \n\nPrices are a little steep, I agree, but again, I forgive. You can't fault a place for prices unless you feel like you're not getting something worth that. I can think of a million places that deserve a smack in the face for their prices...) Ask yourself this: are you full after you eat there? \n\nOkay. So quit your bitching. We're not talking about a $20 sandwich. \n\nLastly, I will say this. I have been going to TA for almost two years now. They know what I want and they know how to make it. They talk to me. They treat me like a person. Mike (though incredibly overwhelmed) does an excellent job making my salad for me and even takes over if he sees someone else doing it wrong. I appreciate that. I like knowing that Mike is going to make sure my salad doesn't get fubar'd. Things like that matter. \n\nSo, yes, the Trattoria Andiamo is a bit crazy. And it takes a while to get your food.

Bacon, egg & cheese bagel sandwiches, strawberry/banana/nutella crepes, and delicious tortellini dishes--all delivered straight to my college dormitory after normal dinner hours. No wonder I gained 20 pounds my first year of college.   \n\nAlso, this place has clearly changed since I was last there.  It looks about 2 to 3 times bigger now.    \n\nBut from what I saw today, it has gone downhill.  Granted, my friends and i came here on, OF ALL DAYS, the day of BU graduation.  However, the restaurant was not overflowing.  It had a manageably higher level of customers, but not overwhelming.  The number of customers present matched the number of tables available relatively well.  With this in mind, I was disappointed.\n\nBreakfast was so bland compared to what I remember.  Their bacon used to be deliciously crispy and ever-so-slightly burnt which I love.  Today it was floppy and boring.  Their egg omelets used to be amazing--today it was clear that the cheese used was the overly processed fake kind.  It tasted, well... gross.  The hash brown potato pancake thing LOOKED cool, but it was not good at all.  Half of my \"grilled\" muffin was cold, leading me to think they forgot to prepare one of the sides.   \n\nThe crepes are pretty hard to screw up, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs.  But really, the prices are relatively high for such a simple breakfast meal, and so I'd have expected something a lot better than what we got for the money.  \n\nAlso of note, I was disappointed by the service.  When we got in line, we were told that unless we had a table, he could not take our order.  We had just stood in line for 5 minutes when he told us this.  So we had to exit the line, wait for a table, and then get BACK in line and wait all over again.  It would have been nice if they had put up a sign or something, or announced this while we were standing there.  Also, he didn't even bother mentioning the possibility of take-out, which we might have been OK with.  \n\nI will come back here at some point in the future to see whether today was just a fluke, but for now I don't think this was anything close to the place I adored all those years ago."}]}, "Sheline's Snack Bazaar": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 4, "text": "I've only had the occasion to visit once or twice.

If you have some leftover ricotta (and don't want to get caught licking the bowl), wipe it up with some of the grilled shishito peppers, which are somewhat underwhelming when left alone.\n\nThe lamb meatballs were another fun play on Italian-with-a-twist, but also a great way to decide if Bel Ari's red sauce is for you (although, if you like tomatoes - like, real tomatoes, then you're good to go).  They come swimmin' in it.  Note: another bowl-lick opportunity, if you're so inclined.\n\nWe had some options for mains, and of course my renegade fork found its way onto everyone's plate (what?  It was the fork!).  The pici pasta is another stab at the red sauce, with homemade pasta, olives, and pancetta.  I'm a huge anchovy/olive/salt lover, and I loved that what could have been a one-note dish (salt) was actually given some depth (different flavors of salt).  I'm being completely sincere - it was the best kind of salty.  If that's your jam, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.  The lamb chop was a delight, and the gnocchi with shrimp and lobster was HEAVEN IN A GODDAMN BOWL.  Just order it.\n\nDessert!  They know what they're doing when it comes to Tiramisu and chocolate, so those are pretty safe bets.  But let me tell you a secret: \"crostate pignoli.\"  This was the best freaking dessert.  The most delightful, beautifully-balanced butter tart with pine nuts, incredible texture, and the best that sugar has to offer.  You see all that food up there?  Yeah, I still finished dessert.\n\nThe service was kind and efficient, and mixmaster Karen was the bomb.

I work in the building next door, where we've got nothing but a Keurig and sad old broken-coiled vending machine that traps your Cheetos and steals your buck. I often don't have time to run two plus blocks for a sandwich or re-heated slice during the day. (I could pack my lunch, I suppose, but really, who am I trying to fool with that? I can barely be relied upon to feed the cats in the morning, and they came pre-installed with super-insistent meeting alerts. The lunch packing thing's probably not going to happen.)\n\nSo it's been months, walking in to work and sighing at the renovations in progress, knowing that sweet, sweet sushi was coming soon. And. It. Took. So. Long! (I mean, I was waiting nicely, right?) But finally, this week Roka opened and a whole new form of angst set in. What if it sucked? Can you imagine having a Pan Asian restaurant/sushi bar open up right below your Cheetos-dusted office, only to discover that it blows? I wasn't sure I could cope with that level of disappointment.\n\nWell, today I sucked it up, buttoned on my big girl pants, and ordered the Sushi Special #2 for lunch. (I think I've got that name right--the menu's not online yet, and my paper copy's at work. Anyway, it's the combo with the four pieces of nigiri sushi and a spicy tuna roll.) The ordering process was amusing, I will say. A very pleasant young woman, who didn't know what nigiri sushi was, how to pronounce the menu items, what came in their combos, or whether they allow substitutions answered the phone. I didn't mind any of that in the slightest, because they'd only been open two days and one hour at the time, and (more importantly), she took the time to find the correct answers to each of my questions. She'll know how to pronounce tobiko and have the menu memorized in no time, but it's hard to teach someone diligence if that particular quality didn't come with the set. Kudos to her.\n\nSo, it turns out that the four pieces of sushi that come in the combo are salmon, and I was just fine with salmon. Salmon is super. That said, I'd have loved two pieces of unagi and two pieces of tuna instead, if they were cool with the exchange. Well, she went back and asked, and it turned out that they were, in fact, cool with it. Yay, me!\n\nI cruised downstairs ten minutes later and was greeted by the happiest-looking host this side of nitrous.\n\nMy food was already waiting (ten minutes, for shizzle) at the desk, where two neat-and-pleasant looking young women stood alongside the very happy host. And that's when my angst set in again. Please don't let this suck. Please don't let this suck. Then one of the neat-and-pleasants said \"eel and tuna, right?\" in a pleasant-and-familiar voice and I told myself to get over it.\n\nOh my God, you guys! Roka nailed it. I had that poor girl totally Kerflummoxed during the ordering process, but what I got was exactly what I'd requested, with no \"Chef's Choice\" pushback or snottiness about the substitutions. Everything was super fresh, the rice was perfectly cooked, the spicy tuna maki was full of flavor, yet light tasting and not slathered in spicy mayo. They don't skimp on the ginger and wasabi, either, which I love, and the soy sauce was sent in a disposable container, not packets. For a \"to go\" order, that's a detail I truly appreciate. I usually wind up cutting about 80% off the top of a paper cup and using the base as a dish because it's gotta be dipped, man, I can't do it any other way. None of this squirting soy sauce over the top or pooling it in the bottom of the tray. I just don't get that.\n\nPrice-wise, Roka's a little high for a girl prowling around for her lunch, so this could get to be an expensive habit. Nothing outrageous for an upscale joint. My combo was under $12.00 (no soup or other fun stuff, although you can add miso or hot and sour soup for $2.00). Most of the sushi was in the $4.50 - $4.95 vicinity, and the maki prices fluctuate (as they are wont to do). Figure about $7.95 per roll, give or take.\n\nLocation-wise, well... it's awesome for ME! For those of you who aren't in the immediate area, I concede that it's not in the most picturesque part of the South End (Mass Ave, across from BMC). But there's garage in back that few people know about and it's just down the street from Wally's Caf\u00e9 if you like good Jazz. The restaurant is slick and gorgeous looking, it's got a full bar boasting black sake and yummy-sounding fruity drinks, and you can totally have unagi and tuna sushi with your combo if you prefer that to salmon. So, please come to Roka and spend your money. It's awesome, and I need them to succeed.\n\nI am so, so sick of Cheetos.\n\n(The husband's review: I don't eat sushi, and you're discussing a place at your work.

Our \"comped\" desserts had to be eaten in the restaurant, even though we were full from our lunches and would rather have taken them home. The manager said their policy was that desserts can't be taken to go. \n4. The Nabeyaki udon was charged $1 more than the menu price. \n5. The green tea was consistently cold.

The second he realized that the table might not bring him the revenue he expected, his tone turned a 180 and instead of walking to the hostess stand to have the host re-sit the table in a different section, HE TOLD THEM TO PICK UP THEIR STUFF AND WALK BACK TO THE HOSTESS STAND. Lance, or whatever your name is, it's customary to share dishes in some cultures and more often than not, it still equates to a dish a person.\n\nSUCH A SHAME WHEN SERVICE IS HOLDING BACK THE RESTAURANT FROM BEING 5 STAR.

(yawn ... just what the world needs). I highly recommend if you read this review in the next 2 days to RUN down to Anthony's for one last shot at experiencing an American institution before it closes on August 1st.\n\nMany reviews on here from a few months/years ago dictate what Anthony's regulars knew for the last few years ... the restaurant knew it was closing due to the development deal, so they basically 'called it in' the last few years. It wasn't uncommon to find dirty tables, lukewarm or undercooked food and a lackluster attitude even towards weekly regulars. They stopped trying.\n\nI am pleased to say that over the last few weeks the restaurant did a very classy thing and stepped up the service level and quality control to the heyday of Anthony's when it seated 500, grossed $12 million per year and was the most profitable and busiest restaurant in the United States. This gave it a chance to go out with some luster and bring us regular customers back to the days Anthony Sr. himself stood at the front desk and greeted each customer making sure their experience would be perfect after standing in the same place and doing the same thing since 1963.\n\nWe've been coming to Anthony's since I was a kid. Anthony Sr. was an old school restaurantauer who refused to change with the times, catering to those of us who appreciate a classic. At 90 years old he literally sprited from table to table with the ease of clockwork weaving in and out of tables to greet his customers and to point out minute details to the staff. You always got a handshake or a slap on the back when you left and he remembered even infrequent customers by name.\n\nSo strict was Anthony about even the dress code that he was known to turn away regular guests who did not follow it. I remember showing up one time spur of the moment with my family on the way back from Cape Cod wearing shorts and polo shirts. We were semi-regulars, so Anthony let us eat outside on the deck rather be turned away from eating inside because he simply could not allow shorts in the dining room. As we walked to the deck, he snapped his fingers and someone gave my Dad the house blazer to wear with his shorts. (which was funny because my Dad was 6'4 and 230 lbs. and the blazer was clearly made for someone much smaller). The last few years, I saw guests dining in tank tops and shorts more frequently than seeing people in ties. Unbelievable how fast things change.\n\nAnthony died in 2005 and when he did, so did the immaculate service and quality control. Some of the original menu items stayed on the menu ... and the fish was brought in daily ... the waitors still  wore white jackets, the bartenders red jackets and the wine steward a black tuxedo.The family has done a LOT to help out the community, especially from what I am told the Albanian community who used Anthony's as almost an Ellis Island upon becoming American citizens in the early 1990s. Some of my friends who are Albanian said Anthony's was known as having a no questions asked policy towards hiring newly immigrated Albanians ... if they came, they would be hired and trained. I don't blame the family for the lackluster quality control of the last few years. It wasn't their fault that Anthony Sr. set a bar an olympic pole vaulter couldn't clear.\n\nLast night, I had my last meal at Anthony's and it was just as polished and excellent as it used to be in the days Anthony Sr. watched over the desk. Everything was cooked perfectly ... the service was smooth but not rushed ... the staff was excellent. It was strange ... Sunday dinner was packed. People were smiling ... sharing remembrances. Outside the restaurant people photographed the most mundane things, lest they be forgotten.\n\nFor the first time I tried the famous Lobster Hawthorne ... a baked stuffed lobster. Amazing! They gave out the famous fresh popovers and marinated mushrooms (no cheese crock, oh well) and the bread basket was fresh. They still prepared Dover Sole (and I believe Crepes Suzette) tableside on a big cart complete with flambe. It was like stepping back into the 50s or the 70s.\n\nOn the way out, we took one last look at the famous picture wall. Almost every celebrity you could imagine (and some you couldn't) dined at Anthony's Pier 4. Some of its more famous patrons were Alfred Hitchcock, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (who dined here regularly while Burton played Hamlet in Boston), Ted Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Julia Child (who called Anthony's her favorite local restaurant), Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and of course tons of actors and politicians and sports stars.\n\nThe 'go to' special occasion restaurant for Bostonians will soon be a generic glass apartment building. Thank you for all the memories and for a wonderful meal last night which reminded us how good Anthony's Pier 4 is/was."}]}, "Tasty Pot": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 21, "text": "So if you think Barbie is hot\nAnd if you like me quite a lot\nDon't message and tell us\nYour spouse will be jealous\nInstead get Boba from Tasty Pot\n\nIf you rush out and leave your wallet, don't be so Hasty Pot.

But alas im a fool for italian food. I came back last night (with reservations) at 7:30 with a friend. We got seated at 8:20. And mind you its 85 degrees outside and we're both sweatin balls. Finally we get to go in (no air conditioning...wow), continue to sweat balls, and sit, literally 3 inches away from the people next to us. Awesome. so basically the entire 2 hours that we were there i had to lean over the table so that the server (one of two) could lean over and pass dishes/etc over my back. lovely. \n\nSo we're perusing the menu, and said server comes over to ask how we're doing blah blah blah. hot, sweaty, and hungry. I bite my tongue, and being the decent human being that i am, i alert him to the fact that the couple sitting on top of us was here first, and he should probably deal with them accordingly. Stupid. stupid. stupid Lily. What pisses me off more than rudeness is a person lacking common sense. The couple next to us also have a coupon, theirs, however, is for a 3 course meal. So i end up pushing my chest into our table so that the server can communicate the restricted options and explain what a salad is for the next (i kid you not) 12 minutes. I mean, would it have killed him to be like \"hey, why dont i give you another minute to look at the menu while i get you guys a drink?\" and then proceed to get them and US drinks. negative. \n\ni was hoping that i could just stuff my face to happiness, but no such luck. we ordered the bacon wrapped scallops (the only good thing about the entire night) but there were like 6 little pieces and the plate was 14$!!!! wtf?! We also split the prosciutto/mozzarella appetizer which was just weird. So maybe i didnt read the menu right, but i expected cold crisp tomato/mozzarella and some yummy meat. Everything was hot/cooked and the prosciutto was basically canadian ham drenched in salt. Again the portion was small (which didnt really matter because we couldnt finish it due to saltiness) and cost 12-13$. Ridiculous. Oh...and they charge 60$ for a 22$ bottle of Santa Margarita pinot grisio. \n\nOk fine, give me my lasagna. Nothing out of the ordinary. Your standard cheese/carbs + meat sauce. whatever. We finally get our bill; of course they forgot to deduct the 50$, at this point its like 10pm and im too damn impatient to wait for the server to come back around, so i walk the 4 feet to the end of the restaurant to alert the only other server to the problem. I tell her i had a 25 for 50 coupon and so she takes the bill from me and proceeds to deduct 25$. I in tern say, no you need to take off 50, and she gives me some obnoxious attitude saying \"WELL YOU SAID 25.\" At this point i nearly lost my shit and grabbed the closest carafe of water to dump on this bitch. \n\ni mean these people are ALL about the service. Any other place, we would have gotten comped something JUST for having to wait nearly an hour on a reservation. Here, we were treated like second class citizens and our business clearly wasn't appreciated. (dont worry, i still tipped off the total bill amount). \n\none final thought: FUCK YOU G'VANNIS. FUCK.

Oh and on top of that,  they  have the only master sommelier in Boston, which def added to the experience. Why? Because I love a restaurant that cares enough to employ an expert.  If you think wine is food, like me, then you have at your fingertips the person who knows the wine collection well enough that they can give you good, better and best wine pairing options. Then you decide.  And they serve Brandt beef.   I love it here. \n\nI'm a Capital Grille fan for service excellence, value, quality of product. And now in Boston I have me Grill 23.  I got the Brandt beef 100 day wet aged ribeye and mushrooms to go with.  It's enough for two medium\neaters. For people with large beef appetite a steak will do you just fine.   I really was hungry and thought I could finish this outrageously succulent cut but I could not.   The steak was paired with a Grenache-Syrah (or C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne) from a reputable winery.  The wine with the nicely done steak blew my palate.    I love it here. \n\nThe steak came before the wine so when I asked about the wine, one of the managers came over almost tripping from his last table and showed care with  a fixit demeanor.  He wanted to correct the situation and presented me with truffle taters on the house. I take one and was about to say, \"This ishhhhhottt\", when the manager said, \"Just a word of warning, it's a bit hot\".  Lmao. And before I could say yes, he came back with, \"you gotta dunk those delicious taters in our cool poblano ranch\".   (Harp music plays).  Done.   And grateful for the exceptional service, Hugo Bensimon.  You've made a convert of me to Grill 23. I love it here \n\nI also ordered the forest mushrooms which were very good almost raw, interesting.  I had way too much food at this point.  So I packed up half of my dinner as I was I way  stuffed.\n\nThen for dessert, I asked for their standouts. And my server said, \"Coconut cake is super famous  but the chocolate chip cookies? Let's just say sometimes half of Boston comes in here just for these.\"  Sold.  The thick, expertly made chocolate chip cookies came with a side of vanilla milk for dunking. Wanted to pair that off with a port, then got a recommendation from my server for a Madeira.  Geesh my server was also super oeno knowledgeable. And damn if I didn't almost fall of the table.  I love it here. \n\nI'm happy I've found a best in class steakhouse in seafood centric Boston. Super impressed with the service and the flavors and a wine expert who recommends choices for pairings was quite the added value to eating here. \n\nI loved Grill 23; its my new fave steakhouse in the downtown Boston area.  Thanks to my Yelpie Wayne C for leading me here. \n\nI think you'll agree. \n\nTip:  Come Monday and Sunday for their quieter nights (from my waiter) and definitely ask for wine pairings help.  The people who work here all smile when you make eye contact, regardless if they are your server.    That, is focus!\n\nGrill 23 is a valuable find.

Knowing I was in for an evening of good food and good times, I wanted something a bit lighter for lunch, and Love Art came through just in time! \n\nTucked just steps away from the modern campus of Berklee College of Music, Love Art is a hipster enclave dedicated to Japanese-inspired poke bowls, \"Makirritos\" (a tongue in cheek riff on a burrito, with sushi ingredients instead of tortillas and beans), and bubble teas. The space is clean and well lit, with millennial friendly details like a quirky neon sign, funky avocado and sushi pillows, and plenty of seating for gossiping with pals or getting work done. I could absolutely see myself hunkering down to spend a couple hours here, and I plan to in the future! It's quite inviting, AND best of all, the tea fountain drinks have free refills! Amazing.\n\nAs for the food, Love Art follows the common fast-casual setup where customers walk down the counter and create their own bowls from a multitude of fillings, or place their order for a few house-made creations. I went with the create your own bowl, which comes in two sizes: a regular, and a mini snack one. The regular size was a filling serving for my lunch and I was quite happy with the portions. Each bowl starts with a base of sushi rice, and then you can pile on your choice of greens, veggies, raw fish, chicken, and more. I would have loved to see a bigger serving size for the sushi fish, as it was small, but I got a few different kinds to try. The spicy tuna was my favorite - I'll probably just go with a few scoops of that next time. My favorite part was the dipping sauces, though. I tried the Spicy Mayo, which was good but nothing to write home about. However, the Yuzu sauce was INCREDIBLE, and probably one of the best things I've had all year. The creamy lemony sauce was awesome on top of the sticky sushi rice, and I could not get enough! I'd go back for that sauce alone. Seriously, it's the must-get.\n\nThe Yelp Check In offer is so generous and not to be missed! For $5, you get a choice of a \"Makirrito\" and a fountain drink. We got the California Makirrito, which was basically an oversized California roll. It was yummy - I might try a more adventurous preparation next time, but I got it for my boyfriend, who isn't a sushi eater. I also LOVED the tea fountain, especially the sweet Taro Tea and the flavorful Passionfruit Tea. Add bubbles for an extra upcharge, which is totally worth it. A side note: none of the teas are unsweetened :( I was doing a #TreatYoSelf day, but normally I couldn't have the sweet teas, so if anyone from Love Art is reading this, it would be amazing if you could offer an unsweetened option or two! :)\n\nAnywhoooo, Love Art is awesome, I can't recommend it more, and I am stoked to be back soon! #TeamYuzu"}]}, "Papagayo Downtown": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 72, "text": "I wanted Mexican food, and much to everyone else's discouragement, our group of friends decided to come here for food and margaritas after the Boston Gay Pride Parade 2019 last Saturday night.\n\nI called ahead to see if there was a wait and whether I could put my name down on the wait list because we were a party of 7.

Dona Habana is well suited to accommodate large groups. The free garage parking certainly helps. \n\nAs far as food goes, I have mixed reviews. \n\nEmpanadas: traditional meat stuffed pastry which you'll find in pretty much all of Latin America, the Caribbean, and even Spain. Dona Habana makes a pretty tasty version. The meat is well seasoned, while the pastry is light and flaky \n\nEnturo frito : kudos for the eye catching presentation! Beautiful deep fried whole snapper. The fish is presented vertically with a skewer inserted through the mouth! This is the kind of fried fish I enjoyed growing up. It could not have been fried any better. Unfortunately, a little salt would have done a lot of good to elevate this dish. \n\nArroz imperial con maduros : I am in love with this dish. A casserole of chicken, sweet plantains, yellow rice, vegetables, ?sauce?, and cheese all baked to create the perfect marriage of flavor. Easily the highlight of the night. Where has this been all my life? \n\nRopa vieja : simple Cuban classic. Shredded beef with side of black beans and rice. Huge portion and good flavor on the meat but not so tender.

The burrito description read; \"fresh tortilla wrapped with rice, black beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes & sour cream\". The price was $6.29 & it was good size but lacking in guacamole & I'm pretty sure the veggies are the frozen kind already chopped up. The chicken in the burrito was \"cubed\" you' all know what I mean, yes?\n The menu has lots to choose from with lots of combos & is relatively inexpensive. TaQueria offers both hard  & soft taco shells in both corn and flour, so getting what you want isn't a problem & that's a good thing but it is definitely \"fast food\" take out. A great place to order for kids, teenagers. Delivery is $1 dollar and very quick.\nThe entire menu is numerically coded, each item has a  2 digit code which makes ordering easier with language barrier. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, maybe you should eat at Salsa's because TaQueria isn't it but it's decent for what it is- fast food Mexican..."}]}, "Troquet": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 10, "text": "My dearest darling Troquet.

Thank God.  I'll be back, often.  4.5 stars overall, but I'll kick a little extra Yelp love their way with 5 out of 5 for exceeding my expectations.\n\nAt first glance, Banq's striking interior looks like either a well-lit cave or a \"made-by-Ikea\" whale skeleton, with slices of precision cut blonde wood hanging in undulating waves from the ceiling, but it's actually supposed to be a banyan tree, with a wine room hidden inside the \"trunk\".  The zebrawood floors, tables and banquettes rise up to meet it, encapsulating diners in a cozy lagoon that is relatively quiet and private, despite the relatively large size of the dining area.\n\nA party of four, we were seated at probably the worst table in the house at first blush - right next to the bathrooms and in view of a service station - but as the dinner progressed it was actually a lot of fun to keep tabs on the still-wet-behind-the-ears but very attentive staff (and the well-heeled clientele.)  The manager seated us and gave us a little background and some delicious detail - just the sort of personal attention that any new restaurant needs to help it over the chaos of the first few weeks.\n\nOur server (can't remember his name) was excellent - spot on with the menu and though he wasn't perfect with the wine list, he ran to the bar  several times to ferret out a perfect pinot for us.  I didn't look at the wine menu personally, but Banq has some interesting coctails.\n\nThe first section of the pan-asian/french fusion menu is Asian Amuse'.  Though our waiter and the manager suggested that they're simply a single bite for our pre-dinner amusement, they were slightly more substantial (2 bites!)  We tried the beets (sweet and golden) and a few other items that were simply perfect.  \n\nThe appetizers followed promptly and were spot on.   I don't actually remember everything we had - too lost in conversation - but I remember everyone loving their selections, especially the the duck & date \"cigars\" with a \"shot\" of something absolutely delicious.  \n\nTwo of us had the tofu entree, which was an amazingly creamy blend of subtle spices - Indian-inspired comfort food - and one of us had the cod, which was cooked perfectly over a bed of greens, though a little less warm overall than we would have liked.  The only disappointment was the pork shoulder, which came out a little tough and fatty.  Our waiter took it off the bill and the manager came by to apologize, but we ended up discussing the finer points of braising various cuts of pork.  Educational as well as engaging!\n\nOf course, we had to try the desserts, but held to just two:  the creme brule and the pineapple wontons with chocolate sushi and blue cheese ice cream.  The creme brule was presented in two small cups, and though one was slightly frozen in the middle (?) they were quite good, but nothing compared to the pineapple wonton.  The blue cheese ice cream scoop was sweet and heavenly, the wasabi ice cream was sweet and spicy, and the entire dish had the four of us clashing spoons and shooting each other dirty looks as we polished off the final bits.\n\nBanq definitely rates a look-see, but you should stay for the food.  I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu, and sit at the bar for a few drinks to soak up the ambiance.

I've tried lobster rolls ALL over Boston (at least 10 restos in Boston) and my fave Boston lobster roll (in warm butter) can be found at Pauli's.   It's May and Maine lobsters are available all over Boston.  It's the perfect time to eat lobster as the warmer weather brings more lobsters to the market. \n\nI love my lobster roll, warm in butter and an untoasted bun. Why? I get to savor how fresh and sweet the meat is with no other flavor profiles like a toasted bun distracting the perfect simplicity of a Pauli's Maine lobster roll.  A cold lobster roll is good too but the mayo, seasoning, herbs, chilling the lobster in combination, mutes the freshness of the lobster meat for me.  During lobster season, a warm lobster roll with nothing but butter however, tastes like no other--soft, a combi of brine and sweet flavors framed with butter and a pillowy roll.    At Pauli's, you get just that.  It's perfect.  \n\nAnother interesting tidbit about Pauli's is,  it started as a small humble business. And today, Pauli's dedication to customer service is evident with all its employees focused and proud to share with you how special the products here are.   In Pauli's words from the website:  \n\n\"I started working in the North End in my family's food businesses when I was just eight years old. Back then, the North End was a neighborhood where everybody actually knew your name, and \"freshness, quality and value\" weren't just trendy catch phrases--they were simply expected.\n\nToday, Pauli's is based on that same philosophy. We believe you deserve food that's always served wicked fresh, that always tastes crazy good and that doesn't cost a lot of money. At Pauli's, you'll find the comfort food you crave, the healthy options you want and the variety you need, all for an excellent value.\n\nSo come on in. We'd love to get to know you by name.\"\n\nService was attentive and it is one a few places in Boston where workers here smile and they mean it.  I love home grown places like Pauli's.  Like my favorite Roma Market in Pasadena, discovering Pauli's reminds me of a family's unwavering dedication to make you smile because you know you've had the best: And it's \"Wicked Fresh and Crazy Good\"\n\nTip:  Prices are super reasonable here.  They have cold lobster rolls too and those are very good.  They have a larger lobster roll if you're feelin' the love, a 14oz  lobster roll for $35.99.

I know this isn't meant to be fine dining but I do expect a certain amount of care to be taken by those who are making any kind of food. \nThe balsamic dressing I chose, was a bit lackluster.  It needed more punch from spices and a better oil.\n\nOn another visit I tried the plain cheese pizza sold by the slice.

When I made the reservation to stay here, I emailed the manager and I let them know our story, that we would be staying there for anniversary and how the Fairmont is so special to us.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were met at the curb by their bellman and they had valet parking so We handed over the keys. Once inside, we were impressed with the continuation of the Fairmont Glamour and were pleased with how clean, stately, and well-appointed the entryway and lobby were.\n\nWe checked in at the front desk with an attendant who was friendly, and immediately congratulated us on our anniversary and welcomed us to the hotel. The attendant told us that the manager had given us a complimentary upgrade to our room from the standard king to a room facing the square with marble bathroom and upgraded amenities which was very nice of them.\n\nOur room was beautiful initially before we looked deeper into the details, but overall the aesthetics were good. The view to the square outside was lovely and we were thrilled that they are still using Rose 31 as their signature scent from Le Labo. \n\nAs we looked deeper at the room there were signs of aging. The mirror inthe bathroom was fractured and rusting and it was near impossible to open the window which resulted in the bathroom being extremely stuffy and little to no circulation which is a pet peeve of mine with steamy showers. The other big issue was the bed, which was extremely firm to the point of leaving us both with sore bodies and a fitful time trying to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, I called down to housekeeping and asked if the gift store was opened because I would like to buy some of the Rose 31 items to take home. They told me that the gift store was open so we headed down. When I arrived the gift store was closed and they couldn't figure out where the person was that was staffing the gift store. Eventually security came down and opened the gift store and they awkwardly sold me some of the items but because they didn't work in the gift store they didn't know where they were or what they were.\n\nOverall, our stay started out really good and then sort of trended downwards throughout the day. Although the signature scent and signature ambience of the Fairmont continued, I guarantee you that the bed we stayed in at the San Francisco Fairmont was significantly more comfortable and left us both without body pain or a lack of sleep. Honestly I feel like a hotel of this caliber really needs to back up their reputation with beds that match and this one definitely did not.\n\nI wonder if we had stayed in the room that we had initially booked if the bed had been better, or if all the beds were the same style of firmness. Of the times that I've stayed in the Fairmont family of hotels, this is the only time that I've ever had an issue with the beds. We definitely slept hard the night after once we got home and recovered from our night of not sleeping here.\n\nLocation for this hotel is hard to beat, in Copley square, centrally located to many things. Additionally I feel like the price overall to stay here was reasonable, however I felt like the bed situation, even given our bed sensitivity, was not reflective of what I expect from a Fairmont stay."}]}, "Bagel Plus Cafe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "text": "Hand down, this is one of the best cheap food establishments i have found since moving to Boston.

They didn't seem to have a deep fryer to make their own so I guess this isn't entirely terrible despite the first impression.  The menu itself was almost comical.  I recognized the carnival font from the early 90's when the menu must have been created.  The menu structure itself was jammed together in no specific order and no true navigation as to what was going on.  The prices. WTF???  It was a failed attempt to make the numbers come out even after the tax.  Anyone in any business industry knows that this really doesn't work once a few items are added together.  $1.17, $2.31 etc... Did you SEE this mess?  http://www.fajitasandritas.com/menus-food.php\n\nNow the actual food itself was just pitiful.  Again, small menu says it should be perfected.  The food was lazily tossed on the plates, very little flavor and if one wanted anything with the meals it was extra.  Who the heck charges for lettuce?  build it into the price for pities sake!  The crowning glory and final bit of proof that this place was a hack job dive was the frozen guacamole.  I'd know the Casa del Sol product anywhere.  How cheap and lazy can they be?

It promised me fresh peaches which I'm a sucker for, so I abandoned my original desire for bacon.  Always a bad call to forgo bacon, clearly.  It also listed fresh blueberries and strawberries (I think, really I was only thinking of tart peaches).  After walking out and seeing a different special listed outside (of course with cheese and bacon, grr), I was already second guessing my switched to-go choice, but I told myself that fruit is good too.  Had it actually been recognizable fruit instead of sickeningly sugared compote, I wouldn't be reviewing this right now.  Instead, it was swimming with gelatinous purple cubes which I can only assume at one point were poor massacred peaches.  There was definitely no third fruit, either.  Also missing from the dish was any amount of flavor, but it could have been drowned in the effing compote.  The container was leaking everywhere with the crap which has already put a thick film on my teeth.  Side note, they also put the butter in the box with the mess, it was so slimy and sticky I could hardly open it.

Fresh implies to me that you cut up the fruit minutes ago and put it in my food.  Not soaked in \"compolte\" as it clearly was- I generally think of peaches being orange in color instead of purple as you can see from my picture.  The third listed fruit was still missing and this wasn't a regular menu item that needed to be taken off, it was a special that I walked in and saw on the board.

Here is my advice:\n\nSneak a lime in, using your pocket or purse.  Bring a small knife as well.  Cut lime surreptitiously under the table.  Squeeze all over your enchiladas.  Reach into your other pocket or another compartment in your purse, pull out a bottle of Tabasco green pepper sauce.  Just two or three dots should do it now, cowboy, don't go crazy.\n\nIf you follow this advice, those enchiladas will have you praying to Mama Ninfa in no time.  If you decide to forgo bringing the aforementioned supplies, then please understand that you will be eating a decent pair of enchiladas verdes - perhaps a little on the bland side -  but a strong foundation to a potentially excellent dish nonetheless.  If you can also manage to sneak in some grilled onion slices to place on top, I can assure you that you will not only get mad style points, but also one of the better Mexican dishes you've had in a while.\n\nSo far, this place gets to wear the crown for best Mexican in Boston.

Ordered a biriyani, dal and chicken tikka at 1pm, I was told it would be ready in 20 min. Asked him if 30 minutes was ok, going by my prior experiences waiting for food here, and he said \"perfect.\" Added another 25 minutes as a safety margin and showed up at 1:55pm. The restaurant had one table occupied. Waited 5 minutes for the owner/cook to come out after he saw me from inside his kitchen - he was watching TV. Asked for my order, he looked at his order pad, and said \"it'll take another 8-10 minutes.\" When I reminded him of his own estimate he said \"some other orders came up, so yours did not get done.\" When I advised him I was a local, that this exact problem had happened 4 times, and he was about to lose my business, his response - \"it is not a big deal.\"\n\nRestaurants often have problems with staffing and time management. They are busy places. As long as they are aware of this and can apologize to customers and make up for it, they do ok. Mehak and its owner are clueless and don't value customers' time.

This was my lucky day to Ramen. \n\nThe menu is not very friendly on line and it's inconsistent because there locations can have different items. They have a great $15 deal where you pick 3 items. I decided to go for it. I wanted to go spicy and decided to order the spicy miso ramen, Cha-Shu Gohan which is Pork and Rice and Aji Tama which is a soft boiled egg marinated in soy-based sauce. The egg was cooked perfectly. The broth for the ramen was crazy good. The menu says the broth takes 18 hours to make from beef bones. The Cha-Shu Gohan was really good. I added spicy broth to it and took it back to my hotel for breakfast. I'm a lucky man. \n\nThe restaurant is tiny. It literally has 18 seats located at 2 tables and 1 bar that faces the kitchen.

Fifteen minutes later she returned with a steaming plate of fresh off the grill near rare tips. Allow me to count off the problems with this: \n\n1. Don't come back all nonchalant after fifteen minutes like we don't both know that's a brand new order and not one you merely left behind \n2. It was the sirloin as opposed to the steak so she was charging me more...yeah, that's right, she didn't even offer to take it off the bill \n3. Half of them were so undercooked they could have been rendered into tartare...I asked for medium, WTF! \n4. Easy with the one scoop of rice...I know it's a tough economy but the servings were larger at the cafe in my elementary school. Please tell me you are NOT back there with little ice cream scoops? \n5. I like the snappy, peppery pea pods but did they really need to accompany every meal. Steak tips come with onions and peppers, sometimes mushrooms, never pea pods. \n6. I also liked the marinade but a little heads up next time...it was a great flavor but not the one I was prepared for. \n\nThe last straw for me was after dinner as we hung out near the bar (10ish, maybe 1030) and the bartender had a huge why don't you guys just leave attitude. I think they close at 11 (on a Friday night?!?) and he just didn't feel like doing anything for the last hour. One of our crew ordered a martini and when he asked for a lemon twist instead of olives the bartender said he didn't have any as they were closing soon. Bullsh*t! Go in the back and the Chef will gladly give you a lemon to slice...this isn't rocket science. \n\nGranted I had a great time with some great friends but this place has gone downhill since I first went several years ago."}]}, "Brigham Circle Diner": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 3, "text": "It was an okay place to get breakfast.

For $75. Given the fact that we had 30 adults eating the full priced meals and drinking a lot of wine, you think they would have given us a bit of a break on the kids. Nope.\n \n- Their function menu includes 4 courses (apps, salad, entree, dessert). We started at 7pm. We did not leave there until after 11pm. It took them over 4 hours to serve us. That is absurd. As a result, several people had to leave early to take their kids home (they were falling asleep at the table) or relieve their babysitters. Those folks never even got to eat their dinner (although we were charged for it).\n\n- Do you know what happens when you have close to 40 people sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting for food? I'll tell you what. The staff just keeps pouring more and more wine. In fact, they apparently poured so much wine that they ran out of the initial red that we ordered and replaced it with $150 bottles of wine (without confirming it with the host of the party).\n\nWhen all was said and done Mamma Maria billed us 30 bottles of wine (we only had 23 wine drinkers!). We seriously doubt that each wine drinker had more than a bottle of wine each. But, we were there for 4 hours thanks to how painfully slow their service was, so who really knows?  We were so surprised by that number that we politely asked to see the empty bottles, but they refused. After a bit of questioning on our part, they did agree to take 5 of the $150 bottles off the bill.

I've been to the one in Saugus once, and the one by my house in Faneuil Hall a few times (including last Friday). This is a really yummy place. Let me preface this by saying I don't like fish. I know it's weird, but fish tastes too fishy for me. Once in a while I can eat it. Codfish cakes, this fish cordon bleu recipie my mother has, shrimp done in Chinese or Japanese way... but otherwise, ick. I do love sushi though. I don't know why, but if a fish is raw it tastes less fishy. So, what I get at Natked fish (which, in case you haven't gathered already, is a fish restaurant) is plantain encrusted seared tuna, rare. This is so good. Just the thinnest part of the outside is cooked, and the inside is raw, like sushi. And they put a fruit salsa on, mmm. With each cuban inspired entree, you get to choose 2 sides. The garlic mashed potatoes and the broccolini are my favorite, but the plantains and rice are also good. Last week when we went, my friend got the same as me, except for asparagus. I don't like asparagus but she did and it was good. When the bread comes, you'll see it's white or brown. Don't expect the brown to taste like Cheesecake factory bread, which is what people I'm with (including myself) always bite into it expecting. It's a sweet bread with raisins. I prefer the white plain bread. I also reccomend the Latin Love frozen drink. This is supposed to be alcholic, but it really isn't. Just drink it as a smoothie.

In a quest to prove to my wife that there are other exceptional Latin American / Caribbean cuisines other than Cuban(not sure what the Cuban obsession is) I zeroed in on El Penol. I am pretty familiar with Colombian cooking. Being from South Florida, Latin cuisine was an every week occurrence once upon a time. For what it's worth, I don't feel anyone does it better than Colombians. What I wasn't prepared for was this being the best Colombian cooking I've ever experienced! \n\nAny true Bostonian knows Easty is full of hidden gems. El Penol sits less than a 5 min ride outside Logan, just before you hit the tunnel into the city. The neighborhood itself is vibrant, full of Colombian influence, from salons to corner stores and of course a hand full of Colombian restaurants. \n\nThe menu is traditional with favorites like empanadas(Colombian style with corn flour), chicken stew, and yuca. Seafood, chicken, and even breakfast is being featured. \n\nBut as far as I'm concerned, the bandeja paisa will always be the star attraction. If it's not on a Colombian menu, gather your belongings and quietly exit the premises. The mountain of all meals: steak, pork strips, over hard egg, beans, rice, plantains. That's all on one plate...for one person. All perfectly prepared, well seasoned, technically sound. And on a plate with endless options, the pork is king! I've had these pork strips in countless other restaurants. I never even knew this could be prepared in a way that would make it tender or 'melt in your mouth'. What a revelation! \n\nEl Penol is an absolute must for, well, anyone. If you're breathing and your taste buds work as intended, it's for you....\n\nExtra credit: get the soursop juice, with milk. Soursop, what's that? Who cares, it's awesome! No but really, it's some mysterious tropical exotic fruit and I'd be willing to bet you couldn't find this in more than 3 places within a 100 mile radius.

As such, it's definitely not a dimly lit space but that didn't hold it back at all. The courtyard space has eight or ten seats and is adjacent, but there's no table service. \n\nThe highs? The food. The Sicilian pizza appetizer was incredible. The braised chicken tagliatelle was also so delicious. The wine list has great variety, as do the cocktails. The menu is still pretty small, but I imagine it'll grow as they settle in. I also love their model - they pay their staff well and tip is included in the price (similar to Juliet which is operated by the same team). It takes a mental adjustment to think about the prices but one that's definitely worthwhile. \n\nMost of the lows seemed consistent with a newly opened spot. They lost our reservation and we had to wait half an hour. Also, luckily we enjoyed each other's company because we were there for about three and a half hours. Finally, the $10 jamon serrano appetizer had a few chips of ham, but felt like a really small portion for the price.

Happened to be walking by on their opening night, so figured I'd give it a fair shake. Overall it's a solid effort that, despite the location and ownership (the decidedly non-Mexican team behind Beehive), adapts some surprisingly authentic elements of Mexican cuisine to something quite interesting and enjoyable.\n\nMy thoughts on a few dishes:\n- Esquites: Delicious. This was the star of the show for me and probably the only \"must-order.\" Corn off the cob in an insanely good broth which tasted tomato & crema-based. Could benefit from a lot more cheese on top.\n- Tuna Ceviche ($18): Pretty good flavor, and a solid portion of tuna, but not mind-blowing. The tuna had been sitting in the citrus a little too long and was basically cooked through by the time I got it.\n- Duck Carnitas ($23): A pile of meat plopped onto a plate, for better or worse. The duck itself was good but a little dry. The mole was mild but tasty, and the plantains were a nice touch but the plantain-to-meat ratio was way off (probably about 60% plantain). Pairing this with tortillas or chips is basically a necessity, and it would make a great foundation for a shared taco/nacho plate.\n- Chips & Salsa Roja ($7): The chips were thick and freshly baked. Wasn't so impressed with the salsa, which was refrigerator-cold and fairly watery.\n- Almond Salsa Macha ($2): I don't really know how to describe this. It tasted like thick, nutty chili oil. I actually liked it as an accompaniment but I don't think it has enough flavor to work completely on its own as a salsa. Worth a try though.\n- Corn tortillas ($2): Pretty good, probably a little over-steamed. I was told they're made \"by the restaurant, but not in-house\" whatever that means. Clearly re-heated so I wouldn't be surprised if they were made elsewhere, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA couple of suggestions/nitpicks/etc:\n- The watermelon agua fresca was way, way too sweet, and basically pure sugar. That's a no from me\n- No horchata is a buzzkill\n- $2 for each salsa ($8 total) is a little steep, as I didn't find either one particularly notable. Would be nice if they came with each meal, as you'll find in a lot of other Mexican restaurants\n- I was asked if I wanted to order chips after ordering the ceviche, but I wasn't told it came with chips (nor was it on the menu), so that was $5 down the drain\n- I was accidentally double charged for salsa, but that was quickly fixed\n\nThe service/management was really friendly and clearly wanted to make sure I enjoyed my meal. As for the ambiance, it's basically a loud, spacious bar, clearly meant for people to gather and chatter. Don't expect anything particularly romantic vibe-wise.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to go back and try their other options, but there is certainly a little room for improvement. Regardless, it's nice to have another option for a good meal in the area, particularly away from the absolute Bro central that is the Barcelona/Beehive block."}]}, "Wheelhouse": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 8, "text": "Inexpensive burger lunch at Wheelhouse today.

There is a hot tea dispenser if you do not want to pay extra for the drinks. The tea is really hot, as in hot enough to burn your tongue, so let it cool down a little before drinking. There is a $15 minimum if you want to pay by credit card. \n\nOne dish I ate was the # 203: Gon Chao Ngau Youk Ng Dong, which is the Dried Fried Beef with Bean Sprouts and Udon Noodles. It was pretty good although greasy. The beef strips were definitely the tastiest part of the dish. The portions were excellent and I was able to take some leftovers home. I only paid $6.15 in cash, and I got a good and hearty meal out if it. \n\nAnother dish that I ate was the #231: Ju Yim Gwat Fan, which is the Spicy Salted Pork Chop with rice. It also came with some Chinese vegetables, too, balancing out the meat in the dish. This makes it unique because sometimes other Chinese take out restaurants just give you the pork chop and the rice rather than adding the vegetables. The pork chop had plenty of a spiced kick to it, and I needed something to drink. It was also more meaty, not bony, and there were plenty of pieces that balanced out the rice. The pork chop was crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. After eating, I was really full, and flickers of a food coma began to kick in, but I was able to get up and leave with no problems. I only paid $6.45 in cash, and I personally feel that I got my money's worth. I had a really tasty dish that filled up my grumbling stomach.\n\nA third dish that I ate was the #162: Sha Te Hoi Sin Chao Ho, the Satay Seafood on Chow Foon. Although the menu indicates that it is spicy, it was not. Rather, there was more of a saucy pineapple taste on the noodles. I have not had much authentic Satay sauce before, but I had a feeling that it was not authentic based on what I had read about Satay sauce on the Internet. Even though it wasn't authentic, I enjoyed my lunch, and they gave me a lot of calamari, scallops, and small shrimp. The seafood overall was tasty, and when I carried the dish, it definitely weighed more than half a kilogram. I paid a total of $6.70 for the dish.\n\nSo far this is a pretty good choice for inexpensive Chinese take out. The portions should be good enough so that you can take leftovers home if you have somewhat of a lesser appetite or if you want to ration what you eat. Since I am going to be working near Chinatown, I am most likely going to come back here for a quick, simple and really tasty Chinese take out dish.

There was a small bone in a salmon hoso maki that I ordered once and when I brought it to the server's attention, she apologized and notified the manager who sent out a complimentary calamari salad with his apologies as well.

Moving on to entrees, my husband was very satisfied with his Venison au Poivre Noir flamed with Cognac, Burgundy, & sour cream.

You don't see too many restaurants poach their salmons, so this was a different take and I really enjoyed it.

The dinner includes rice pilaf, chicken kebab, whatever veggies you want, and pita bread and dressing on the side.

Frenchie Wine Bistro in the South End manages to juggle all three while serving up some tasty food in gorgeous surroundings. Don't be fooled by the minuscule size of this place - what Frenchie lacks in space makes up for a menu is big on flavor and creativity, prepared by Executive Chef Alex Falconer. The restaurant is filled with quirky details, like a neon sign that reads \"In Vino Veritas\", which ties in to the fact that they are a wine bar in addition to a restaurant. I visited for brunch, and was delighted with the experience! If you've ever wanted to feel like a cast member from Gossip Girl, come to Frenchie. You'll love it.\n\nFrenchie serves brunch to hungry Bostonians every Saturday and Sunday from 10 AM to 3 PM. I HIGHLY recommend booking a brunch reservation through OpenTable, because as I mentioned before, the restaurant is pretty small, and if you don't make a reservation, you'll probably have to wait. And do you really want to watch other people chowing down on Nutella crepes while you wait off in a corner? Didn't think so. Try to sit out in the Greenhouse Room, which is surrounded by glass and overlooks a few brick building facades and a small garden. \n\nI got the Smoked Salmon Toast, which arrived chilled and crisp, topped with incredibly fresh tasting salmon, creamy creme fraiche spread, and pickled shallots, which gave the dish a nice bite and kept it from feeling too heavy. I also got a side of poached eggs, which were perfectly prepared. You rarely see restaurants nowadays offering poached eggs for brunch, and it was wonderful to get them at Frenchie. They carry my favorite tea brand, Harney and Sons, here, and I was very happy to have a personal teapot full of hot French Earl Grey tea to sip on while I ate. It was a very civilized brunch, and a fun experience overall!\n\nHowever, if you want to brunch like Blair Waldorf, you have to be prepared to pay Blair Waldorf prices. The Smoked Salmon Toast, while very delicious, was a small portion for the $12 price tag, and the poached eggs had to be ordered a la carte.

I don't think my parents ever taught me \"if you don't have something nice to say don't say it at all\". Although I do think the 200 something people that know me on Yelp.. and the 1000s of people I've met on my travels around Boston for the past 6+ years (I've worked/volunteered a LOT in this town) know that I'm pretty tolerant of things/people and I'm generally jovial. Yes, I said jovial. When I do poke fun, a lot of the time it's at myself. \n\nWhat I was taught, was that if someone attacked me then I had the right to defend myself. I thought a bit about writing this update because I don't think retaliation is always the best way to approach things but you made it personal by mentioning my name.. so here goes. \n\nI'll admit.. my review of Wheeler's is a bit rough.. but I've seen worse and this is the flat out truth. Yours however is a lie. I have 3 witnesses that can say there were no people in the shop when we went in. 5 including the staff.. but for some reason I think you know the staff.. which if you read the italics as you were writing your accusatory review.. states.. \"if you know the owner or have a conflict of interests, please don't review\". \n\nI was in a celebratory mood that day. It was my last day at work and after I had celebrated/hugged/laughed with co-workers, I had been invited for frosty goodness at Wheeler's. I was even told I'd be treated because the person inviting me (not Yihwa) had had Wheeler's before. She is vegan and was/is a big fan. Since she couldn't have any ice cream that day (due to allergies).. I refused her offer to pay because I felt bad (who wouldn't?). And since I was in such a good/non-argumentative mood I made my order as quick and as painless as possible. Chocolate and peanut butter in a medium cup.. NO QUESTIONS asked. I was not told my ice cream was almost out. I was in fact told that peanut butter was one of my cashier's favorites.\n\nNOTE: If I were allergic to peanut butter.. I wouldn't have ordered it. C'mon girl, make your accusatory statements more valid by research!\n\nI'll admit I shared a laugh with the owner when he first poked fun at Yihwa while she was choosing ice cream. Looking back on it now, who says everything is experimental? The owner said everything was experimental. Where's the control in the situation? But with no real tried and true method, should he taste all of flavors to ensure quality? Not that he should personally do that himself.. but that seems somewhat off. Where's the consistency?\n\nAnd yes, I was standing RIGHT next to my friend when he threw the sandwich on the counter. It's not like he chucked it at her like a softball, but he did toss it like she was some dog that would pounce on a free biscuit. And Ms. Oranghead.. I don't know if you had your super secret binoculars on, but from my angle, I have no idea how anyone else could have seen him do it since we were leaning on the counter. There was a guy standing next to Yihwa.. but your name suggests you're female. \n\nSo no sweetheart/honeybun, my review is none of your business. Please take your time to write your own review.. much like the other 5 star reviews up there. I know some of the people who have given great reviews. They've obviously had good experiences, but just because my friends gave this place a good review, doesn't mean I have to. Again, real people.. real reviews.

Strange. \n\nI'm sorry if this is harsh, but I don't enjoy being called a liar in a public forum. Even if this is just a food review site. I don't believe my reviews are mean-spirited.. but when someone.. is out and out mean to me and my friends.. I'm going to be honest. And when something good happens to me and my friends I'm going to be honest. And when something is meh with me and my friends I'm going to be honest. REAL people, REAL reviews. \n\nOh yeah, and people (as in many) have already messaged me about your review because they believe I'm right (even people with good Wheeler's experiences), so you're the one that is actually making Wheeler's look bad by attacking me.

Note: this review is solely about the service and the way the place operates. We did not eat a meal.\n\nWe attended what was billed as their Grand Opening this past Sunday from 3-6 pm. Upon entering shortly after 4pm I there was a nice crowd in the establishment eating and chatting, buoying my hopes for a successful dining experience. Unfortunately for the 60 plus minutes that we were there not only did we not get to order but, by the time I was able to get someone's attention I was curtly told that the kitchen was closed. I found this to be confusing because when we were initially seated (limited brunch menus were on the table) and gave our drink order, the waitress returned with our drinks asked if we wanted to order then never returned to our table until we were ready to leave, frustrated by the news of the kitchen closing delivered by another waitress. Our original waitress told us that the reason we didn't get to order was our fault since we weren't ready when she asked. An untrue statement because when the waitress started to take our order she turned to me first. Since I was the last to arrive to table (only on street parking!) I nudged my daughter and told her to go first. \n\nI guess the waitress interpreted that as not being ready because she walked away from the table (I'm not even sure if she promised to come back) and we didn't see her again for another 40 minutes or so.\n\nI was able to get the attention of another waitress who told us that kitchen was closed. When I explained our dilemma, she stared at me blankly stating she would let someone know.  An older gentleman in a suit came over to our table with a large tray of empanadas. He offered them to us as I guess a peace offering. But even this gesture was sloppy because didn't have place settings or bread plates. When I pointed this out to him he told us to use the cocktail napkins on the table. Oh yeah cause if the kitchen is closed then there's no clean dishes! We hungrily accepted the cold empanadas waiting to see if further nourishment would be offered to make up for the gross oversight. I then decided to get up and let the owner know what had happened. Once again she told me the kitchen was closed but, would be reopening in 30 minutes. She said our dinner order would go to the top of the list. I declined. Not because I didn't think my meal wouldn't be good. I'd eaten there about a month ago and the food was tasty. I declined, because the service was so poor that at one point my daughter got up to refill my water glass. \n\nThe waitstaff on one of the most important days was so focused on serving the VIPs (Mayor Walsh) and taking photos, that they ignored the local, paying customers. This isn't a good way to gain community support for your business. Mayor Walsh won't be the one coming to Roxbury weekly for a Friday evening meal. Poor service without comping your customers can seriously hurt a restaurant's reputation.\n\nAs we were leaving the assistant manager (there wasn't a shortage of staff just good service) approached us to say that our original waitress wanted us to know that she thought we weren't ready to order. Huh? Why are you wasting us time making excuses for an employee who clearly is not ready to work in a restaurant? This was a bad move on his part.

Unlike the shuttering of these restaurants, the recent closure of Durgin-Park made me angry rather than merely sad.\n\nHow a 192-year-old restaurant can be allowed to close is shocking in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a state so proud of its history and hell-bent on preservation that you can't tear down a 100 year old tool-shed without approval from the state legislature.\n\nWhile people will mostly remember Durgin-Park's chowder, Indian pudding, and baked beans, my fixation was always the \"Boston Scrod,\" a dish I used to highly recommend to friends or family visiting Boston who wanted to eat in or around Faneuil Hall. The tried and true regional formula of \"ultra-fresh seafood + bread crumbs + butter + oven + fresh lemon\" represents the very best that Massachusetts has to offer in terms of cuisine, and very few restaurants will ever do that better than Durgin-Park did.\n\nPeople talk about how \"surly\" the service staff was at Durgin-Park, supposedly a gimmick put on for tourists - but perhaps as a local I never really noticed this. I do recall ultra-generous pours of liquor, one time ordering a Glenlivet and having half a bottle poured into a pint glass with a wink and a \"Merry Christmas.\" Whatever their reputation, these were good people, and I hope they've found gainful work elsewhere in the city.\n\nIn the meantime, I plead with Bostonians to support real restaurants like Durgin-Park.

Sometimes this truth applies to restaurants as well. Even though this location has the exact same menu as the South End location, the quality of both locations are miles apart from each other. \n\nAs I was approaching the restaurant, a couple of guys who reeked of being mile high walked past the spot left one of the larger spitballs right at the entrance of the establishment, with the valet in front not even bothering to look on. I suppose this would be a foreshadow of things to come. \n\nRestaurant Week isn't that much of a saving, but I came for it here anyway. If you do a cost analysis, you're just getting a free dessert for RW. I enjoyed the South End spot and thought I could come here before continuing with my evening, as this Boston Chops isn't too far from my office. \n\nThe decor seems a little tighter than the SE one but my gripes aren't concerning interior design. When I ordered the hanger steak frites, the server asked me if I wanted to do half fries and half \"their famous onion rings\", without telling me there was an additional charge. \n\nNow, kids, listen to Uncle Phil when he tells you when you assume...\n\nSince it was going to be half fries and half onion rings, I didn't think there was going to be an additional charge. I am giving up some fries, after all. I was in a bit of a hurry and I had a long work day, so I relented without further inquiry and accepted the \"generous\" offer. \n\nThe popover was okay, though nothing amazing. It's just something different from having a bread roll. The oysters tasted fine. I didn't get food poisoning afterward.\n\nThe hanger steak itself was overcooked. I asked for medium rare and got something slightly higher than medium. I should've asked for them to make me a new one but I was in a bit of a hurry, though I still kinda regret the decision.\n\nThe fries were fine but seemingly didn't match the South End's offering. They were colder and less flavorful. The bone marrow could've used a bit more work in the oven, but it was fine. The salad was seasoned and was not a liability.\n\nSo the onion rings came and I received half a tower. Admittedly, the rings were good, as they were crispy and flavorful. However, as I worked on eating those rings, I started to have a bad feeling I was going to be a victim of an up-sell. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding was half the size of the one I had in the South End. I examined pictures from both. The pudding tasted the same as the SE one, which was good. Not too sweet and the ice cream made the dessert richer. \n\nSo when the check arrived, I was charged an additional $6.00 for the onion rings. I should've complained and it's a lesson learned, though I had to be somewhere afterward. \n\nAnother thing that the server annoyed me: inattentiveness when billing. When I provided my credit card with the bill, he returned the credit card with the bill, without seemingly going through the transaction. Really? I mean, did you charge me before but forgot to give me what I needed to complete the transaction, or did you totally not do it at all, even though you have my credit card? Or did you charge me twice? Anyway, that has never happened to me before. And yes, I still left tip, though less than my usual amount.\n\nI hurried out, wanting to get to an event but also just feeling pissed.

Maverick Marketplace is very clean place with a welcoming vibe, and a nearly cemented place as the community's go-to establishment. It is in the spirit of helping Maverick Marketplace be better (read: more efficient) that I write this review.\n________\n\nProblems/ Suggestion:\n\nConfusing Line/Queue: Almost everyone that walks through the doors doesn't know whether to sit and wait for service or line up. You can tell who the locals are because they understand that they're supposed to line up near the register. Non locals look a little confused (sitting or standing).\n\n/ Suggestion: Have a signs posted indicating where the line is/starts. Alternatively, a sign that says you're supposed to seat yourself.\n________\n\nNo Order tracking: Names or orders are simply shouted out. Frequently, you either hear an order shouted out \"Large Iced Latte\" or names \"Jonathan, Jonathan\". \n\n/ Suggestion: Give customers table #s the ones attached to little stands that can easily be seen by the wait staff. It'll make the customer have to work less and puts the onus on the restaurant to find the customer. It will also make it less confusing when multiple people order the same thing or there is more than one \"Jonathan\" in the restaurant. The waitstaff will be able to quickly scan the room for the #, if he/she doesn't see it then the customer must be outside.\n\n*Combo: Names for \"to-go\" orders and #s handed out to \"for-here\" customers.\n________\n\nUnclear roles: Staff switches off between waiting, order-taking, and order-filling which creates a lot of confusion. This is evident because the staff keep asking each other questions about who has done what i.e. filled the coffee container or filled the water, etc. This is compounded by the lack of consistent order tracking.\n\n/Suggestion: Give the staff clear roles like the cook has a clear role. If you're working the register, that is your job to take orders, make sure the line is orderly, and the coffee and water are full. If you're working the bar, you don't move from the bar unless it is not busy and then you help with making sure the coffee dispensers are full. Etc ... \n________\n\nFrequent Menu changes/Un-updated Menus: For three consecutive weekends in the summer there were menu changes that caused some confusion, among the regulars mostly or anyone that had gone to the restaurant twice within that time period. Into the fall there are still some errors on some menus. For example, some menus still have \"Potato Wedges\" listed under the Traditional Omelet menu item, a menu item that has been discontinued for weeks.\n\n/Suggestion: While experimenting with new menu items post this in different places. Like the Facebook as well as the entrance, by the register, and on the menu itself. Just giving your customers a heads-up an possibly even soliciting feedback. \n\nFor the menus, simply have someone with knowledge of the latest menu proofread them for accuracy.\n________\n\nThe friendliness and overall vibe of Maverick Marketplace Cafe is wonderful. It's what keeps me coming back! The food is good too. The final piece to complete the trifecta is great service! This is only one persons opinion, of course, but half of great service is the smile. The other half is efficiency. \n\nSee you soon."}]}, "Boston House of Pizza": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 4, "text": "Ordered here yesterday 12/27/17 and it was ok.

The mussels really count on their broth to make it good, so I was a bit disappointed when the broth was too lemony and kinda made it taste like alcohol (which I'm not a fan of). However, it was a lot of mussels and for the price point, it's definitely worth it if you like mussels & their way of doing the broth. \n\nGrapefruit Juice ($4.95)-4/5 Not sure if the grapefruit juice is fresh squeezed like their orange juice.

I was instructed to choose what I like and bring it to them to weigh in as they charge by the pound. This option is ok for takeout but I went for the whole Shabang .  The all you can eat buffet for $19.99.  \n\nI started with a corn pie and a meat pie, they are tiny and definitely homemade and tasted nice. \n\nFor my first dish I opted for white rice topped with pinto beans in a nice sauce and some tomato and beet from the buffet and for my first meat choices I had a chicken wing which I found to be a bit salty but cooked perfect, along with a nice beef rib seasoned nicely and one spicy pork sausage that will knock your socks off.  I paired this with a corona with a lime, they brought me a mug the beer and a side dish with lime. Nice touch from a little neighborhood joint.\n\nOn to plate number 2 - A very sweet piece of plantain which melted in my mouth, Romain topped with a mixed chopped tomato type salad was decent, saut\u00e9ed collard greens seasoned and cook to perfection along with another tony meat pie had to get a second!

I also understand, from my local dining companions here, that Davio's is considered a very good Italian restaurant in Boston. It's obvious from the atmosphere here that they would like to bring a high-end style of dining here to Logan. So for that reason, even though I enjoyed dinner here, I'm going to be a little picky, because I'm sure they want to make a good place better.\n\nI had very few problems with my meal. My only comment is that the strip steak I ordered, medium, came out \"not all medium.\" The two pieces that were obviously from the end were well done, and the piece from the inside was closer to rare. Again, not bad, just a bit inconsistent. The Brussels Sprouts with bacon were a bit more done (and softer) than I like, but the flavor was good.  I thought, at $16, cocktails were a couple of dollars higher than they should be, but for a few dollars less, a nice pour of wine was fine.  The bread \"cubes\" that came with the meal weren't anything special, but the olive oil accompanying it was really good.\n\nService overall was very professional, but since this is a place where there will be a focus on service, I offer a couple of comments that I admit are nitpicky. I noticed when you ordered steak here, you have options for sauces and garnishes. I think my server should have asked if I wanted any. I remembered a couple of minutes after I ordered, flagged her and told her, and it still didn't come with my meal (but I got it when requested - horseradish - and it did enhance the taste). Finally, I don't know if the rules are different at an airport, but I thought that if they were going to offer you seating at the bar or in front of the kitchen area, they were supposed to ask you if that was okay.  But at least seated there, you got a coat hook and an outlet. \n\nUpdate: A couple of days after writing my review, I removed my original comment regarding a lack of a steak knife. Since this restaurant is beyond TSA, they probably can't give customers steak knives. So for that reason, I'm glad my steak was tender enough to cut with a table knife.\n\nWould I eat here again?

We looked over the menu and I decided to let my friend who suggested eating here choose the plates.  We ended up with soup and rice?? So here we go.... I tried the Wonton Noodle Soup, a bit disappointed for such an easy dish, the wontons were bland and had a tiny bit of what I believe was beef? The broth salty and very undesirable. I give this soup 1 star  The second soup I tasted was the Hot and Sour which was easily superior to the Wonton Soup. It had an authentic taste and would give this soup 4 stars. I also tried the House Rice again pretty bland with more chicken pieces than veggies or anything else you would expect when ordering House Rice in Chinatown. I'd give it a 2 star rating. Service is what you may expect late night. I will say if I ever find myself in Chinatown in the middle of the night I guess I know where a nice warm place to eat is .... \n\nI give New Golden Gate 2 1/2 Stars. Unfortunately I had to post 2 stars as 3 was not warranted."}]}, "Dot Tavern": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 9, "text": "First, let me set your expectations. This is a bar.

As we left Genki Ya the first time, a white male immediately followed us across the street and called out \"Where do you think you're going, nigger?\" and insisted we go back to the restaurant to pay for our complete meal.  When I attempted to leave his presence peacefully, he pushed my bike back by the handlebars, injuring my right knee and scraping my hand.  Finally, my friend decided this individual wouldn't leave us alone, and that we should approach the restaurant again to re-offer to pay for what we ate -- at which point they were unable to take payment.  According to the hostess that night, the restaurant's owner was aware of and directing their actions.  \n\nThe assault was traumatic.  And it is difficult to conclude anything other than that that the staff of the restaurant engaged this assailant (possibly as the dispute was occurring, instead of calling the owner as was suggested) to threaten and then assault us: there were no other customers in the restaurant for the duration of our visit to the restaurant, the man on the street approached us within about 30 seconds of my leaving the restaurant, and when we returned he came into the restaurant with us to address the staff.  It would be difficult to believe that the assailant so quickly had knowledge and motivation to pursue us otherwise.  \n\nI reached out to the restaurant owner the next day, to seek a peaceful resolution, and to allow him time to respond; he wrote back days later acknowledging the events, and suggesting that neither he nor the restaurant did anything wrong.  I'm disappointed in the assailant for his hateful, racist, violent behavior.  But I'm more so disturbed that the restaurant engaged this unstable individual (who could have done far worse to us than he did), and then denied their responsibility for the resulting assault.

According to the website, Ernest Hemingway was known to both frequent and write about the Cannes hotspot.\n\nEverything in this pretty, below street level restaurant hails from the mother country including all the furniture and the lovely zinc bar.  \nSailing photographs, pond yachts and other decorative touches add to the nautical theme. \nAll the staff we encountered were French and gave impeccable and very friendly service.\n\nI opted for the prix fixe 3-course menu for $20.00.  I was not disappointed in the least with my choices which began with moules in a shallot, white wine sauce. \n\nAlong with the crusty bread for mopping every last drop of sauce, this appetizer size portion was a delectable beginning.  \nMy entree was a perfectly cooked piece of salmon over a creamy risotto with peas. The fish was clean tasting and fresh and the risotto toothsome as it should be.\nThe dessert I chose was a raspberry mascarpone bavaroise with pistachio crumb topping.\nThis was light, airy, fruity and a perfect ending to the meal. I was sated but thankfully not stuffed and uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend had the endive and green bean salad along with an entree size portion of moules; these in a saffron curry sauce. The frites that accompanied were perfectly cooked.\n\nThe 3 house wines on the menu are a terrific bargain at 8 dollars a glass.\nThey are excellent choices that the waiter was able to describe in detail.  He offered tastes so that we could decide.   It's not often that house wines are worth it; these 3 definitely were solid choices.\n\n I had the sauvignon blanc while my dining companion had a perfect rose. \n\nFor the hour or so we spent here, we got lost in having a quite authentic Cannes-like experience.\nShort of hopping on a plane for the French Riviera, I'm happy to have this local brasserie as an option.   I can't wait to go back."}]}, "RUKA Restobar": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 30, "text": "RUKA is the new Liquid Art House, meaning that it is definitely the place you want to take your visitor friends when they come to Boston!

We tried the MORNING STAR, a strong raspberry & smokey flavor & JESUIT, a fruity concoction in a beautiful glass. Their cocktail menu is great because they describe every ingredient in the drink and even show what cup the cocktail will be served in.\n\n+ SCALLOP CEVICHE ($20): The scallops were extremely fresh and bite sized. Paired with pomegranate seeds, chili oil, and and citrus marinade, this was a refreshing starter! \n- TORO WASABI ($26): I am a huge fan of toro, so when I saw this on the menu I knew I had to have it. Wait, $26? Is there GOLD in this roll?! So when it was served, I was disappointed to see that this roll has 8 tiny pieces of spicy tuna roll wrapped in toro and sprinkled with a pinch of caviar. Not worth it!!\n- RIBEYE ($16): The ribeye sounds like a substantial dish, but really it is two pieces of ribeye on two sticks. It is topped with ginger, butter, and garnish. Once again, not worth it.\n+ OCTOPUS LOMO SALTADO ($17): Our last dish was worth it. I've never had octopus lomo saltado (usually steak), so it was cool to see this stir fry presented differently. I do with the shoe string french fries were thicker!

Little lamb def failed terribly in every possible aspect you can imagine.\nWe got there at 7:00pm. The restaurant was half full. We were sat right away. The waiter brought us the menus and left without absolutely no explanations or warning of sold out items. I was confused about several items on the menu so I had to verify with the waiter. Getting the waiter's attention was the most frustrating thing ever, he would just walk by me knowing that I was waving to him. So at this point, I started to try to get any other waiters' attention. All of them did the same thing: walking by me knowing that I was trying to get their attention. I started to wonder if little lamb hired all blind workers or i became invisible. Finally, our waiter came, I ask him what's in the veggie dumplings? He said he has no idea, but he would ask the kitchen for me. Great! I was also confused about another item on the menu, he told me it was sold out. Great! Why didn't u tell me earlier?\nThey basically give u a piece of paper which has a list of their items and you can just check it off whatever you would like to order.

I had to name each dish that hadn't been brought to us (not to mention it took me at least 10 mins of staring or waving at the waiter every time I tried to get his attention). He would only bring us 1-2 dishes every time I asked then forgot the rest again. This went on all night. We were super frustrated and starving! He would also name the dishes wrong; no idea what he was bringing to us. At the end of the meal, he still missed a few dishes but we all really just lost all our patience and just asked for the bill. How could this possibly happen!?!??!?!?! We checked everything off on a piece of paper so they should know what exactly we ordered. It's hot pot!

Extremely rude, and unjustifiably so. Bad service, takes forever to get a drink, and they openly mock their own customers.\n\nWe walked in as a group after they first opened at about 4 pm on a Saturday because we were killing time before a hockey game. We were the only ones in there, and we paid our tab and tipped well. The waitress, however, was obnoxiously rude, constantly telling us we were \"too loud\". Then they accused us of playing drinking games and gambling! If you describe arguing over who is going to win tonight's hockey game \"gambling\" then I suppose we were. What a twit!\n\nIt was not limited to just the waitress. The bartender, all tattoed up, when told by one of us \"Oh, put that on the British guy's tab!\" as a joke, because he in fact was the British guy. Given how this is a \"British\" pub, he thought that'd be amusing. Instead, the bartender (with no sense of irony) said \"yeah, I'll put it on that As$hole's tab!\" He wasn't joking. When our friend pointed out who he was, the bartender just looked at us, initially in horror, but then put on what appeared to be his best frat-boy face and said \"oh, didn't recognize the accent\". Yeah. Ok.\n\nMaybe they're used to kicking college kids out for being amateurs, and maybe they're default mode is \"asshole\". Either way, they miscalculated.

Has Guy Fieri ever tried the food this restaurant is serving?\n\nThe Good:\nThe art and ambiance by the bar is super cool! Great job, decorating team.\nOur waitress was really friendly!\nThe bathrooms are super clean (they have attendants in them).\nThe menus are super heavy -- which was kind of cool.\nThe Sparkling Basil Margarita was delicious.\n\nThe Bad:\nWent on opening night, expected things to be a bit crazy. We were told there was a 60-minute wait. That'd be cool if it were actually busy, but there were numerous empty tables during our entire wait. \n\nWe were patient and went across the way to get drinks at Studio B, which is actually still part of the Tequila Cocina somehow. They have Truly Seltzer on tap. My mind was blown. They offered multiple flavor options. I picked pineapple because I've never had a pineapple seltzer before. The tap cut out halfway through pouring my glass. They apologized and went off to fix it. A few minutes later, they were back and the tap was working again (yahoo!). They put the pineapple flavoring (syrup?) into the drink. I assumed it was going to be somehow regulated by Truly... but nope, it's just however many squirts of syrup the bartender feels is necessary. It was the most bitter drink I've had, and tasted nothing like a Truly seltzer or like pineapple. I asked if there was something we could put in it to make it less bitter, and they insisted on starting fresh. That was a nice touch! This time they were going to make a passion fruit Truly. The tap cut out *again* halfway through pouring the glass. The bartender gave me half a Truly to enjoy while fixing the tap (again). I appreciated that. This drink was definitely sweeter than the first, but still tasted nothing like a Truly in a can.\n\nWe waited 60 minutes and were seated for our meal - yay! Our waitress was incredibly friendly (good job, hiring team!). We had water poured quite quickly after being seated (yay!), but then it wasn't refilled after being empty for quite some time. We ended up asking for more water towards the end of our meal.\n\nThe Ugly:\nTheir TV stream kept freezing. It's a good thing I didn't care about the football game that was on every TV. It's ironic that in a restuarant that's connected to TD Garden, they couldn't play a sports game on the TVs without issue. \n\nEvery single beverage is served in plastic glasses. Apparently it's so people can bring their drinks into the concert venue. Couldn't you just pour drinks into a plastic cup if people are heading into the concert, versus making a $15 margarita feel super cheap in a plastic cup while dining in the restaurant?\n\nI'll admit that outside of knowing Guy Fieri is tied to the term Flavortown, I know nothing about him. Going into his restaurant, my expectations in terms of flavor were through the roof. If you're the \"Mayor of Flavortown\", shouldn't your food be flavorful? Well, it wasn't. We ordered 3 of the 6 tacos on the menu, as well as the Trash Can Nachos. I've never had such bland tacos in my entire life. They were lacking any type of flavor. Every table seemed to be ordering the Trash Can Nachos and filming the removal of the can. Yay Instagram? I'll take food that tastes good over Instagrammable food, though.  It's definitely a one-and-done for me in terms of dining at the Tequila Cocina. \n\n--\n\nOverall, some of the issues I think we can say are written off because it was their first night (TV issues, tap issues, water refilling issues)... but will the flavor of the food really improve? I do hope the food improves... but I'm guessing it won't, and I'm sure they'll be successful anyways because they're tied to a famous person, TD Garden & North Station.\n\n2 stars because the staff was nice and the ambiance was cool... would have been 1 star otherwise!"}]}, "Drydock Cafe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 21, "text": "Yep, another shining example of \"locals know best\" as a bunch of us congregated for a mini cross country reunion.

I am unsure of the countless times I have walked right past the storefront with no inkling of the establishment or it's opening date. I think it was around October or November 2018 that it opened up for business because I remember seeing signs that said taking orders for Thanksgiving. \n\nThe ordering was a fairly simple process. You completed a order sheet with what you want and the select the date and time of pick up that they have available. At the time of your pickup you present your name or receipts. \n\nFrom their seasonal menu, I highly recommend the pumpkin roulade. It's $18 for a small, maybe eight inch roll. This may seem pricey but it was worth every penny. I ended up buying two for the Thanksgiving meal but after trying a slice, I ended up keeping one whole roll for myself instead of bringing both over to my parent's for Thanksgiving dinner. I also ordered an apple pie but I don't recommend the apple pie since it was rather dry. I also made the mistake of ordering plain croissants and pretzel rolls the day before Thanksgiving. They did not do so well the next day despite being reheated. Not cheap either. \n\nFor breakfast I have tried their ham and cheese croissant. I thought the flakiness of the croissant was just right. The coffee and cappuccino were underwhelming. The price I would say is comparable to Starbucks but nowhere the same quality. \n\nThe set lunch comes with a sandwich, drink, bag of chip, and a cookie. The sandwich, and I have only tried the ham and cheese and the turkey and cheese, were decent. I wouldn't eat it daily due to the pretzel buns/baguettes that is used. My favorite part of the meal had to be their jam filled cookies which I find to be both tasty and delightful with the maple leaf cutout or smiley face cutout. Their cookies are buttery and soft. The jam is sweet and just slightly tart. \n\nOverall, customer service has been pleasant most of the times I have been there and the staff was generally helpful. The interior is very clean.

This trip we figured that it was about time we gave it a try.\n\nWe got there around 5 p.m. on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  Peach Farm, despite its name, specializes in seafood.  The restaurant is in the basement and has a fairly small dining area.  The decor is nothing to write home about but you're there for the good food so it's easy to get past the decor.\n\nOur server was prompt getting to us and brought a complimentary pot of tea, which we thought was a nice touch.  He was friendly and knew the menu very well.  We both started with soup.  I ordered wonton soup while my husband got hot and sour soup.  I really liked their wonton soup.  It had 3 good sized wontons  that were generously filled with pork.  Plus there was some pork slices in it.  My one complaint was that some of the sliced pork was on the tough side.  Otherwise, the broth was flavorful.  I tasted some of my husband's soup.  The broth was very thick with plentiful stock plus it was on the spicy side.\n\nWe had looked at the menu online and I was interested in trying one of their lobster dishes.  I looked at the Yelp photos and it appeared  that this dish wasn't difficult to eat.  So, I chose lobster with scallions and garlic.  This dish consists of a whole lobster that is cut up and left in the shell.  Instead of being cut finely, the ginger was in large slices.  The scallions were more thinly sliced.  Photos can be deceiving---the lobster wasn't that easy to eat.  You have to use your hands as it isn't easy to just pull out with a fork.  Plus, the way it was cut, I found an occasional piece of shell in with the meat.  Still, it was an enjoyable dish.  The sauce, while stingy, did impart great flavor and the lobster was properly cooked.  All  that said, if we were to go again, I would give the lobster a pass due to its being messy to eat.\n\nMy husband had shrimp with mixed veggies and enjoyed it.  The shrimp portion  was generous and there was a good variety of veggies.  This is a mild dish.  Each entree comes with a small bowl of white rice.\n\nIf you order a fish entree, the fish is really fresh.  By really fresh I mean this ---the people in the table next to us ordered barramundi and the server came to their table with a large bucket.  In the bucket was the live barramundi that was about to become their dinner!  He wanted to show them the fish before it got cooked.\n\nPeach Farm is worth a visit if you want to eat in Chinatown.

Did I also spot a small, red \"people love us on Yelp\" sticker?  I may have.   \n\n*  Yelp deal:  Pay $10 for $20 credit.  I love a deal.    \n\n*  My friend had just put our name on the wait list at another place - a very loud, crowded place which came highly recommended - and I enticed her to walk over here to see which we might prefer.  The minute she saw how relatively quiet Maurizio's was it jumped to our #1 choice.  It's a restaurant in which you can conduct a leisurely conversation without yelling.  \n\n*  Attractive, intimate, and low lit environment on the main floor.  If I had been with someone different I might even call it \"romantic\".  (They also have a downstairs/basement dining room which I'd not put in this category).  \n\n*  Zero pressure to turn our table despite a (soon) full house.  We began with a bottle of wine, moved onto burrata, then shared another couple of antipasti (Mussels $12; Eggplant $10), each item ordered one at a time.  This is my favorite way to dine and the servers graciously permitted it.  \n\n*  The collective experience (food, drink, ambiance, and value) was 100% enjoyable.  \n\n*  Maurizio's chef is the same chef who put Giacomo's and Il Panino on the North End hot map.  This is him cooking his own food; his personal vision of a restaurant and he's been at it upwards of 20 years now.     \n\nI generally call myself a (4-star) fan if I've visited a place that I'd like to return to again, as opposed to trying something new or different.

Thin crust pizzas and salads are excellent, as are pasta dishes. yesterday my friend and I shared a pizza and each got a salad--hearts of palm with arugula and arugula with pears, blue cheese, and walnuts. You can also enjoy the patio for the price of just dessert and a glass of wine.\n\nOf course, perhaps if Boston had more legitimate restaurants with patios, Armani would be less of a destination--but it doesn't. Armani has one of the nicest patios around, and, as opposed to the rest of Newbury Street (INQ, Croma, that means you), the food is actually good.\n\nPerhaps avoiding this place because some of the patrons seem fancy makes you just as much of a snob.

We had eaten a big lunch and wanted to keep dinner on the light side.  The caprese was good but not mind blowing.  The tomatoes could have been riper but the mozzarella was good quality.\n\nFor my main course, I got my favorite dish on their menu, papardelle e melanzane.  The papardelle is freshly made in-house.   While the freshness of the pasta came through clearly, the sauce seemed a little oilier than usual plus the eggplant was cut into larger pieces.\n\nMy husband got his favorite dish, Gamberi.  This dish consists of linguine plus a generous portion of shrimp.  He thought that his dish was up to par and enjoyed it.\n\nOne thing we noticed that was different on the menu --- some main course items had an asterisk next to them.  That meant that the pasta was freshly made.  The linguine in the Gamberi wasn't freshly made.\n\nI think that we should have stuck with the soup of the day.  The soup here has been wonderful with fresh homemade flavor.  However, it is almost a meal in itself.\n\nThe restaurant owner and founder, Barbara Summa Sullivan, often is the one doing the cooking.  The recipes she uses came from her grandmother, a Sicilian immigrant.  However, this time, we saw her exit the kitchen and leave before our dinner was made.

I was told I couldn't handle the hot (thanks -.-), so we got medium. The sauces were tasty, but you really needed to dunk to get enough on your seafood morsels.\n\nThe shrimp and crawfish were perfectly cooked and exactly how they were supposed to be. The quality of the crabs was the main difference though. The blue crabs arrived whole and uncleaned, and the snow crab legs were attached. Since you pay by the pound, it's a better value per pound for crab at Shaking Crab because they serve mostly just the edible parts. Additionally, my resident seafood expert spied a problem with two of our three blue crabs - mushy meat. When he brought it to our server's attention, the pound of blue crab was graciously taken off the bill.\n\nOverall, if you don't want to drive to Newton for boil then this is a perfectly good alternative, just stick with the shrimp and crawfish."}]}, "The Green Dragon Tavern": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 61, "text": "This is he oldest standing establishment in the city of Boston.

Nice touch!\n\nLater, I noticed the chips had a fresh till date of 8/25.... My delivery was the 10th of September. Oops! I asked Foodler to let them know, not expecting anything like a replacement delivery, although an apology would have been nice.\n\nHmmm... I just took a look at the take-out menu they stuffed in with my order... looks like the prices on Foodler are a touch inflated... They still charge $8.75 for the signature sandwich boxed lunch, but the individual sandwich prices differ a tad - Roast Beef $7.50, Eggplant $6.50... unless they've raised the prices but haven't had the chance to update the take-out menu yet...\n\nOh, and a note from the take-out menu: \"We use iggy's bread.\"\n\nWhen I finally got to the roast beef sandwich I found it okay, but nothing especially bad or good.  The bread was the same foccacia as the first sandwich... it is much tastier and yummier when pressed with some olive oil.\n\nPurely on the eggplant sandwich, I'd give it four stars, but the roast beef, the chips... that brings it down to three."}]}, "Taste of the Town": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 4, "text": "My office is in Faneuil Hall and thanks to my co-workers, I found a great little place to get lunch when I'm too lazy to bring my own to work. And on top of that, it's not inside Quincy Market, which for me is a wonderful thing. As most Bostonians already know, Faneuil Hall is filled with annoying tourists who not only take up space, but also refuse to move out of your way when you're hungry and trying to get back to the office before your break is over. Nothing makes my blood pressure rise as high or as fast as when I used to walk through Quincy Market to get food and I would literally trip over a clueless woman from Omaha who can't seem to look at menus and walk at the same time. I thought it was an unwritten rule that everyone walks to the right side of corridors, and if you choose to stop and look, you should move off to the side. However, Quincy Market seems to be a place where the tourists feel rules can be broken...and for that, I feel their faces should be broken.\n\nANYWAY...enough of my rant. So, TASTE OF THE TOWN. Apparently there are two other locations in addition to the one at 60 State (which is in the lobby of the tower)...they are 10 Post Office Sq & 125 Summer St. in Boston.\n\nThis little place is open for breakfast and lunch and according to their website, they also have catering. I think they have really great sandwiches which are all made fresh to order. They also have salads and other varieties of pasta available for customers, but I always stick with a nice, big, scrumptious sandwich.\n\nThey offer the usual sandwich options (with your choice of bread) like chicken salad, turkey, ham, etc...but I would trust this restaurant and order one of their \"specialty\" sandwiches because THEY KNOW HOW TO INVENT STUFF! My favorite so far has been the \"Madison\" which consists of turkey, ham, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, coleslaw, Russian dressing on light or dark rye...I get dark rye. There is a large list of specialty sandwiches to order from, so why not just rotate through until you find a favorite...ya know...like us fat kids do.\n\nMy Madison costs $6.25 which is well worth the price. I give this place 5 stars for several reasons...their sandwiches are delicious, their prices are fair for the area of the city it is in, they're quick to make your food, and it saves me the burden of having to kill a tourist who probably deserved it anyway."}]}, "La Piazza at Eataly Boston": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 5, "text": "Wicked expensive.

The food all had generally good flavor profiles, but again with the minor improvements... For instance, it was nearly impossible to eat the Korean flank steak the way it's served. Since it's flank steak, not filet, there's some texture there you need to battle through.

The museum really packs a lot in here and you could spend a long time going through everything. There's something for everybody here.

The revolving exhibits often showcase contemporary art. I won't judge you if you like Rothko. \n\nThe good thing about the museum these days is the wide array of events it holds.

I wouldn't recommend taking someone here to impress them unless they get wowed by LEDs in the ceiling of the bar area that make it look like a night sky and one of those fake waterfalls you can buy at Home Depot.\n\nComfort:\nThe seating was terrible - everyone was rammed in so tight that not even the waiters could get to certain tables without asking for customers to move themselves for a few seconds. Think of the Green Line in the morning.\n\nWaiting:\nWe were seated 35 mins after our booking and didn't receive water or any bread for an hour. 1hr 30 for apps, 2hr 30 for the main course. Even when it was 11pm and dead the desserts still took  30 mins to come, even though all were cold dishes.

Terrible dough and crust, it's flaky and synthetic-tasting with no smell to it: it actually tastes and looks like cardboard (I am not kidding, my friend actually said that after his first and only bite).  I only ate it because I paid and hate to waste food, but seriously, it's the most terrible pizza ever.  Worse than frozen pizza (even the generic Shaws brand), worse than the pizza you get from Eddie's--if you're from Brookline, you might remember Eddie, the food truck that sells various goods by the high school.  Ah, good times, good times.  \n\nAnyway, back to the pizza, it's disgusting!  The sauce, which most will agree, is the cornerstone of the pizza, here is a pasty tomato blah that makes the thing taste even worse!  The cheese is, um, just cheese.  Back to the dough, I have never ever left a crust behind and for the first time I left all the crust because well, I really could not eat it.  Oh, the horror, the horror!\n\nThis place was just about EMPTY when I came in--dinner time on a Saturday!  One guy sitting in the back on his laptop and that's it.  I waited 10 minutes for my pizzas and no one came in.  Being located across from Boston University, you'd figure they'd get more business but now I know why.  Pathetic excuse for a pizzeria.  \n\nPeople who love this place make me wonder if they lost their taste buds or something.  My review is solely based on the food quality, not the service, though the service sucked too.  The cashier guy cheated me out of 30 cents, but no big deal so I didn't make it an issue.  I called in my order of 2 regular cheese pizzas, went there to pick them up 20 minutes later and still had to wait 10 more minutes (and they weren't even busy!).  *confused*\n\nPizza is something we can eat everyday for a year, vow never to eat it again, but crave it after a month.  So it's very disappointing that Sicilia fucked it up so bad.  If you want decent to good pizza, up a few blocks is T. Anthony's (they used to be a lot better, before they started hiring students or whatever who really don't care if you like it or not).  \n\nIf  you want the BEST PIZZA in Boston, you need to try Santarpio's in East Boston!  It's the first exit out of the Sumner Tunnel, heading to Logan Airport.  You won't be disappointed!  Long standing family business and they're actually Italians who know how to make a great pizza.  Pizzeria Regina's is great too!  Probably the two best places for pizza in Boston.  But my heart is with Santarpio's.  All they have there is pizza and appetizers of lamb on skewer and sausages, that's it!  No salads, no subs, nothing.  Strictly pizza which is great, I think.

Duh, right?!    \n\nHope my review helps!  So when you walk by Siciia's, keep walking!

The police paid him a visit and remind him that harassing customers isn't how you deal with bad reviews.  So basically he used the number I called to order the pizzas to harass me.  All this over someone who didn't like the pizza.  Sad.\n\nIf you like their pizza, go ahead and enjoy it.  This is my experience with the place.

To that end, we headed on the opposite direction, hoping to wind up in some Back Bay hot spot.  Our cab dropped us off at the Four Seasons.  When we arrived, we realized that it would probably not be classy to walk into the hotel bar carrying the water bottle of red bull and vodka that we were sharing, 17-yr old style, so Crazypants (CP) got rid of that shit.  Yeah, we're cool.\n\nEntering the hotel, we scoped the downstairs bar and saw the usual array of old dudes waiting to prey on us.  Since I hadn't had dinner, we decided to pop into Aujourd'hui (which is french for \"today\" in case you dont know and in case I decide to make any jokes about that later in this review) and check out their selection.  We were promptly informed that the kitchen was closed, but they had a cheese plate available.  I'm going to have to relay the conversation:\n\nAujourd'hui host (AH): Are you joining us for dinner?\nCP: Hi, no, we would just like a cheese plate.\nAH: A cheese plate?\nCP: Yes, it's on the menu?\nAH: Yes.\nCP: Okay well we would like to sit down and have a cheese plate.\nAH: Certainly.

At this point I didn't even want the cheese plate anymore because (1) I had to say the words cheese and plate so many times and (2) the words had lost all meaning.\n\nLet's flash forward to the arrival of the much-anticipated cheese plate.  That shit had the three smallest pieces of cheese on it that I have ever seen, and some figgy jelly goo that to be honest, could have been anything.  I was pissed that a microscope didn't come with the cheese plate so I could see the damn cheese.  There is no way this wasn't the three ends of whatever cheese they had from the rest of today.  At least, I hope it was.  Because if this was their TWENTY DOLLAR cheese plate, I would hate to see their lobster dish.  It would probably be the runt lobster that ran into the honey I shrunk the kids machine and ended up slapped on a plate in Boston.  Weak.\n\nSo we eat the damn cheese plate, which frankly could have been done in three bites (one bite per stupid piece of cheese).  Now I need to move on to the waitstaff.\n\nThere were two hosts, and two waiters.  \n\n(1) Host One: This is the dude that speaks only in waitstaff catch phrases, which made the whole encounter very awkward.  \"Lovely to see you lovely ladies tonight, welcome to our fine dining establishment.\"  Uh - why are you talking like that?  \"I hope you ladies had a fine time tonight, please join us again in the near future.\"  You're awkward.  Shut up.  Seriously, don't train them to do that.  Your cheese plate is pretentious enough as it is.  Don't make things worse.\n\n(2) Host Two: this is the guy that hits on the women who are trying to enjoy a tiny tiny bit of cheese at 930 on a Friday night.  We don't want to talk to you.  You're the host at a restaurant.  Why don't you try your luck on the cougars at Clink?  Goodbye forever.\n\n(3) Waiter One:  this is the guy who couldnt grasp the fact that we wanted a cheese plate, only a cheese plate, not a full meal, just cheese.  Don't give this guy the benefit of the doubt either - he wasn't french or anything.  He was an American, like you and I.  Well, like I.  Anyway this guy was annoying and I wanted to kick him.\n\n(4) Waiter Two:  Oh. Brother.  Where do I start.  This man appeared to see how things were going and fill our water and see if we wanted more wine - I THINK.  He came up to the table and mumbled something incoherent that sounded like \"hlkfhjdsklfjslgjl;jgl;djg;dgjd\"  and it didn't get any better or more clear.  Now THIS guy may have been foreign.

We sat outdoors and enjoyed some amazing people-watching with our meal. Indoors has both bar seating and tables; if the weather hadn't been so nice, I would have enjoyed sitting at the bar, I bet.\n\nThe beer list is impressive, with probably 20 or so draft choices. The food menu, on the other hand, is streamlined. The focus is on piri piri dishes, basically grilled proteins to which you add the sauce of your choice. I ordered the 1/2 lb of shrimp, while my friends got the 1/2 chicken. \n\nSauces are on the side, and are delivered to the table in a condiment caddy. There is no need to tell the waiter which sauce you want when you order, as you will receive all of them in the caddy. I went mostly with the medium, which I found was pretty spicy. One critique: The menu mentions \"mild\" piri piri sauce, but no mild piri piri sauce is actually offered (at least not by name). However, the bottle we thought was ketchup was not conventional Hines-type, so maybe that was the mild?\n\nWe also each chose an a la carte side, not realizing the meat came with a side of really crispy, excellent French fries. With the fries, we probably did not need the sides, but they were very good!

Once we picked our beers, we had to also point to them on the menu so the waiter could confirm the choice (he didn't know, for example, that the Fuzzy Logic was the Portico). When he delivered the beers, he mixed them up and gave them to the wrong people (quickly sorted on our end). With the food, the discrepancy between the menu listing mild piri piri sauce and the lack of such sauce in the condiment caddy was never resolved (we gave up and just focused on the delicious sauces that WERE there).

Came here for the first time one night recently after working exceptionally late, and was starving. My sister said she had awesome Chinese at this restaurant, so I was pretty excited to try it out. Normally I'm wary of sitting at a restaurant with a completely empty dining room, but this particular time I was relieved (hoping that it would mean quicker service.) I should have taken it as a red flag.\n\n It still took me and my BF an hour to get out of there, and we had to flag the waitress down two or three times to get her attention. When she did remember we were there, she was nice and accommodating, but I was surprised that on such a slow night we would be totally forgotten. \n\nIt got much worse. We had just gotten our drinks and ordered dinner, and out of the corner of my eye I saw a mouse scurry across the dining room floor. I immediately went to find the waitress and her know, and she came over to check (it had left by that point.) She said it was an old building and probably the next door hotel's fault (?),  and that their kitchen was very clean and that they don't usually have this problem. She asked if we wanted to leave...and I should have said yes. I literally couldn't concentrate on anything but scanning the floor for the rest of the time. We decided to stick it out, though, for the delicious Chinese my sister promised. \n\nWhen the food came out 15 minutes later, I tried my Chicken and Mushroom entree--and it was awful. Chicken pieces, raw carrots, and mushrooms piled on top of white rice with chicken broth poured over. Maybe the most tasteless thing I've ever paid for at a restaurant. My BF said he liked his Kung Pao, but my opinion was pretty much set on this place. \n\nHonestly I was surprised to see that we were still charged the full bill after the mouse incident.

Thanks for Watching.\n\nIt was a stunning shock to the Boston Yelp Community when the restaurant called IVY abruptly closed its doors last October. Situated at 49 Temple Place in Downtown crossing and well known for an inexpensive \"small plate\" menu, IVY appeared on the surface to be doing fine. However, a Special 60 Minutes investigation shows all was not fine at IVY's. Many Yelpers reported questionable service issues ranging from rudeness to frequently mistaken orders.  Then in March 2010 one yelper wrote of becoming ill after eating here (although that may have been more a reaction to her company for the evening) Consequently on October of 2010 IVY suddenly ceased all operations, leaving a vacant store front and many unanswered questions in its wake.\n\nBut here is where the story takes a sudden turn for the better. On Tuesday May 24th A new fine dining restaurant, under new management and the new name of 49 Social has opened in its place.  Featuring New American cuisine with a distinct international influence, as well as a wide selection of wines and creative cocktails, the new fine dining restaurant is owned by Talal Zaiter and managed by his nephew, Samir Zaiter , both experienced  players in the Boston Restaurant scene. Rounding out the crack management team is bar manager Kimberly Frankson (a 5 year veteran of Radius) and top Boston chef Michael Lishchynsky.  Officially opening to the public on Thursday, patrons were universally awed by the renovation work done by the Zaiter's. \"It a nice space.\" Zamir  commented modestly. In fact what was already an elegant \"space\" has been up graded considerably to now featuring 3 floors, two bars, museum quality Chandeliers, and ornate detailing at every turn. When asked about Service issues in the old IVY, Samir firmly commented \"I am not going to put up with that!\"\n\nAs per the food served: Most patrons seemed Greatly impressed by the generous portions bought with an average of $15-$50 per person (full menu below) And everyone seemed to like the drinks.\n\nThe future on 49 Social remains to be seen.  But if the opening week was any indication: The future of the new Restaurant at 49 Temple Place seems bright indeed. \n\n\nDinner Menu of 49 Social:\n\nFIRST COURSE:\nTuna Sashimi - $17\nBroken Garlic Chili Vinaigrette, Radish Salad, Soy Pearls\nPear and Gorgonzola Salad - $13\nWatercress, Baby Arugula, Endive, Pears, Walnuts, Pinot Grigio Vinaigrette\nLobster Consomm\u00e9 - $9\nLobster Dumplings, Snap Peas, Baby Carrots, Ginger, Lemongrass\nCaprese Salad - $13\nHouse-made Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Heirloom Tomato, Prosciutto Vinaigrette\nSteamed P.E.I.

I called Gypsy and was told that vodka drinks were $10 each.

A good number of people were inside, so it didn't look too bad.\n\nOf course, as soon as we sat down, the only real diners in the place were paying the bill, leaving us as the only patrons.  The other people in the restaurant turned out to be the family that owned the place.  \n\nIt was lunchtime, but they gave us dinner menus, with entrees ranging from $13-20.  The waitress was kind enough, and I ordered the sausage cacciatore; my sister, the calamari.  Five minutes later, the waitress arrived with our rock-hard excuse for a block of bread, accompanied by a clump on butter placed on a paper napkin.  Of course, when you scoop butter off a paper napkin, the napkin comes with it.  \n\nAround this time, a young couple sat down for dinner.  But something must have scared them off - they surreptitiously ran out while the waitress and family weren't looking - which caused an uproar within the family, who began yelling at each other, throwing blame at each other for letting the couple leave.  The \"mother hen\" of the family waddled out of the restaurant into the neighborhood to find the departed couple.  A few minutes later, she waddled back and told the others she couldn't find them.  The family dispute continued throughout our dinner (we might as well not have been there).\n\nOn to the food.  We were given appetizer salads with wilted vegetables.  The tomatoes were warm and soppy, and my sister made me think twice about eating any more after she reminded me of the salmonella scare.  The sausage cacciatore was below average, and the side spaghetti was just not good.  My sister's calamari was clearly not fresh - it likely was reheated from a can - and the sauce was equally unappetizing.  \n\nBUT THE WORST...was that my sister found a fly in her food about halfway through.  We notified the waitress, who notified the mother hen, who yelled, \"What do you want me to do about it?!\"  Then the family talked about the situation as if we weren't there (\"Of course there's flies in the food, the door's been open all day.  What do they want?  It's summertime.\")  \n\nSo they took my sister's meal off the bill, but I still had to pay $25 for my meal.

The bitterness begins to sink in when we realize that our lane just so happens to be one of the two near the end. The same two that have been empty since we came in.

We decide to roll with it and start over, only to get shut down again shortly after. When I go over to report the issue, the girl tells me that our lane has been malfunctioning all night. I ask why they would give us a clearly broken lane, and she says that we were getting impatient so they had to put us somewhere. Cool.\n\nWe get moved a lane over, to the other one that had been empty all night. Lo and behold, this lane is malfunctioning too! What a shocking turn of events!\n\nSo off we go, back to the bowling desk. By this point we're all just about done with the place, so when they ask if we want to wait another 15-20 minutes for a new lane we decide to graciously decline and ask for our money back. We are informed at this point that they can't, in fact, refund us our money because of whatever arbitrary \"policy\" they decided to make up on the spot. In order to appease our increasing frustration, they offer 6 \"free game\" certificates as their final offer -- take it or leave it.\n\nFlash forward to last Sunday (03/01/12). We have friends visiting town, and decide that this might be a perfect time to cash in on our 6 bowling games at Kings. Excited about the prospect of drinking and bowling our Sunday night away, we head over. Upon entering we are greeted by the likeliest contender for Biggest Douche in the Universe, whom we'll henceforth refer to as Puka Necklace.\n\nPuka Necklace checks my ID, and informs me that he can't let me in because I have a foreign ID. Baffled, I notify him that Puerto Rico is in fact a US territory (even says so on the ID) and that I am both a) 26 years old, and b) a US citizen, not a foreign national. I even show him how my ID is fully scannable, just like any other US ID would be.\n\nHe scans my ID once, the little green \"ok\" light goes off on his scanner, and he shakes his head. He scans it again, the little green \"ok\" light goes off, and he stares blankly down at his scanner. He then looks at me and tells me, again, that he cannot let me in because I have a foreign ID. By this point I begin to get pretty frustrated, mutter something along the lines of \"this is f**king ridiculous\", and ask to see a manager.\n\nPuka Necklace ponders the proposition for a moment, then blurts out the following in the cockiest, I-am-mister-big-time-doorman manner possible. \"Tell you what, buddy. If you apologize to me for saying f**k, I'll let you in.\"\n\nI ask him if he's actually serious, to which he nods, I respond with a good laugh and ask for a manager again. At this point Puka Necklace shifts his attention from us long enough to turn away a group of 4 guys waiting to get in based on the fact that one of them was wearing light-colored sneakers. After this blistering exertion of doorman powers, he goes off and comes back with his manager.\n\nHis manager, whom we'll refer to as Button Down Shorty (Shorty, for short), tells me that he has to kick me out because I had \"threatened and gotten aggressive with his doorman\" (sic). After calmly trying to explain the situation to Shorty only to meet the same response, I decided to commend them on their A+++ customer service and leave the premises never to come back.\n\nWe ended up at Lucky Strike that night, where we got to drink and bowl happily without any of the BS."}]}, "Night Shift Brewing - Lovejoy Wharf": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 19, "text": "Super crowded when we came on a Thursday night!

The famously confusing road-atlas-themed menu assembled by maniacal Thai owners was previously thought to contain a number of possible meal options so vast that it would never be accurately determined. However, news came today that parallel calculations using a geometrically-weighted algorithm had managed to yield an exact number, albeit one that when written out on paper would be so large it would stretch from Kenmore Square all the way to the Green Monster.\n\nCommenting on the discovery, the team leader said \"between getting our massive servings of okay-ish tofu and beef udon soups and then waiting for the gorgeous fried ice cream to arrive we had to think of something to do other than look at the crazy wall of license plates amassed from around the USA.

Seeing Wrapmi featured on The Weekly Yelp I made it my business to go.\n\nTaking a quick glance of the menu outside I decided to try the beef wrap. One thing I didn't realize that these are more like crepes than wraps/burritos. I know that doesn't make a difference to some people but it does to me because I f***ing love crepes. But as I got to the window I noticed the daily special, beef, crabmeat and egg for $3.00 ($3.21 with tax). Oh hell's yeah! Its like they put all my favorite proteins together in a crepe. Experimental and unheard of on this side of the Atlantic. \n\nIt wasn't a long wait for my experimental savory crepe but since this was an impromptu stop I had to take it to go. When it was done, piping hot and ready the lady at the counter wrapped and bagged it and I was on my way. I didn't get to savor it until I reached back to my office. Letting a hot crepe go cold would be a crime so the minute I have a chance at my seat I dig in to that still warm, fresh, mouth watering aroma of a crepe. \n\nDaayum, with emphasis on the \"yum\", that was a mighty fine crepe. Every bite stuffed with crabmeat, egg, beef and onion. I was drunk off the deliciousness. They also put spicy mayo in it but I didn't mind the slight pepper. This crepe was sensational. My only regret is that it's just a daily special and not one of their regular menu items.

The staff, from the moment we walked in was friendly, lively and attentive. The managers and owners treated us like queens, filling and refilling glasses, checking on us regularly to see if we were enjoying ourselves. Also, unlike many restaurants in the North End --Eclano did restaurant week a little differently. They offered a choice of 3 items off their regular menu. They didn't offer any desert (a welcome change since pastry chefs really bomb during restaurant week). Instead my taste buds treasured my Scallop Primi with sweet corn and arugula, delighted over my parmesan risotto. I did try the special, the Sea Bass which wasn't exactly to my liking --though I'm not a fan of bass, so perhaps this was a poor choice on my part. The owner saw that I was eating off of Russ's plate mostly and offered to bring me something else. She was a sincere, sweet woman and I truly believed she wanted me to experience the best in her restaurant. I was getting full (the portions were fantastic), or I might have taken her up on the offer. \n\nDespite the sea bass being not to my taste, the polenta side was perfect. I also got my fair share of my boyfriends amazing, juicy and savory steak. Unbelievable meal, excellent service, and a warm, generous atmosphere.

Maybe the quality of food will depend on when you go and how busy they are, but last night I ordered takeout for three people.  We gave them an extra 20 minutes past the estimated ready time just to be safe and arrived, and after waiting for several minutes at the cash register without being helped, someone approached and told me it still wasn't ready.  That's fine - they're new, they're busy.  We eventually got our order and left.\n\nUpon arriving home, we found that one of the larger items was missing despite him reading the order back to me.  On top of this, three of our seven tacos were completely missing half the ingredients, including all add ons and salsas.  $4-$5 is on the pricier side for a hand taco, and is just plain unacceptable if that taco contains a chunk of meat and nothing else.  Considering you can't actually place an order without adding a salsa, I don't understand how this could happen.\n\nThe food we did receive ranged from mediocre to poor.  The flavor on the carne asada was fantastic and the queso was great, but that's where the praise ends. The carne asada steak itself was unusually tough, and the flavor of the spicy chicken, the pork, and the lime chicken were bland.  However the chips & guacamole was the worst offender of the entire meal.  The chips were so hard we at first thought they were stale, and the guacamole itself  tasted as though it had been made with unripe or poor quality avocados that had no flavor at all, with an unpalatable amount of lime and no onion/tomato or even salt added.  Hands down the worst guac I've ever had, including stuff from supermarkets and chains; I am really confused by this one.  We picked the guacamole based on a reviewer who specifically called out how great it was, so I have to wonder if that review wasn't from a real customer or if different people are responsible for seasoning every day.  Everything except the carne asada lacked in any kind of spice or flavor.  Maybe I just went on an 'off' day but for the amount we paid it's extremely not worth it if the quality can vary as wildly as the range of yelp reviews implies."}]}, "Jerry Remy's": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 99, "text": "Based on my breakfast salmon platter and service, my experience is 5 stars.

Occasionally, old Embryo Face gets a mad craving for dumplings.  Luckily, he happened to be at Boston University East last week and was able to mingle with the children without giving off that Sandusky vibe.\n\nSome people aren't so lucky.  A family friend of ours went horseshoe bald at 20 and started getting grays at 21.  He had a mustache that was only a little wider than Hitler's.  Above the mustache was a toucan's beak.  Above the nose were coke-bottle glasses.  And above the glasses were two fuzzy plantains.  It was the totem pole of 50-year old virgins.\n\nIncredibly, he had a wife and three kids.  His wife had a mustache too.  And a big nose and thick eyebrows.  Her glasses were like the InSight Lander's solar panels.  Their sons did too.  The four of them looked like they decided to show up to gatherings with Groucho glasses.  If Groucho and Bogdan from 'Breaking Bad' had kids, it would be that family.\n\nExcept for the daughter.   She had luscious mutton chops.  I bet she's marrying runaways in Vegas right now.\n\nI chuckled to myself over these memories while waiting for two orders of dumplings: The celery and pork and spicy napa cabbage and pork.  I can't emphasize enough how courteous the attractive older woman who greeted me was.  Even after taking my order and making sure my glass was full, she kept looking over, hoping I would ask for a neck massage or her daughter's hand in marriage.  This doesn't happen often and I appreciated it.\n\nThere's twelve dumplings in each order, which was just about enough to satisfy the insane craving.  I liked the pork and celery but the spicy napa and pork were probably some of the best dumplings I have ever had in my life.  \n\nFirst of all, they lived up to the bold claim of spicy.  My relationship with Boston's spicy food . . . man oh man.  Boston's \"heat\" is my allegedly recovering heroin addict son: Now and then, I'm encouraged by his progress but mostly I have to ignore the painful knowledge that there's a picture of him on Craigslist like Kate Winslet in 'Titanic.'\n\nNot so here.\n\nThe spicy napa blasted open my tear ducts and they were accompanied by a SWAT team of sichuan peppercorn.  I LOVE sichuan peppercorns.  Using them in just the right amount is a skill and when you nail it, you will get a perfect numbness that makes each taste bud hum like a little generator.  Heat by itself is nice but that little hum from the peppercorn turns the experience 3D.\n\nThe freshness of dough and the filling was evident.  I recommend eating really good dumplings like these as soon as possible after they come out of the steamer.  Their half-life is short and the freshness of the flavors threaten to get buried under sogginess.  Think a crisp Belgian autumn day that turns into a humid Vietnamese jungle in July.  Think exfoliated face vs. runner's taint.\n\nThe waitress suggested I eat them with both the soy sauce and Chinese black vinegar.  Soy sauce is standard but the vinegar is an acquired taste.  I think it might be the cilantro of the liquid ingredient world.  To some, it will taste like diesel.  If you give it a chance and use it sparingly, you will appreciate the truffle-like woodsy quality to it.  One little dip of the crimped edge of the dumpling in the vinegar is enough.\n\nI downed twenty-four dumplings and happily left a 25% tip.  I walked in fully aware of some diners' complaints of brusque service and I want to give them full points for rectifying the problem.  A lot of places simply choose not to give a virgin's fuck.\n\nI may try their other dishes at some point, just out of curiosity.  I'm not sure yet.  What I am sure of is that every dumpling on my plate the next time around will be the spicy napa and pork.

The food was, as last time, delicious. They have tweaked  the menu, ditched the small plate/big/sweet plate names that i found too cutesy, and streamlined the menu a bit. (And the light fare now is actually lighter for the most part).  \n\nI had the beet salad as a starter. It was the veggie equivalent of \"snout to tail\" .... using the whole beet in several ways - a chiffonade of beet greens, picked beet stem, and the requisite beet salad, with a very nice feta (i think) emulsion. Nice presentation, and nice flavors. A winner.\n\nMy entree was a 1/3 pound (5, i think) serving of buttery sea scallops with a couple daikons thrown in for texture and a different (less sweet) flavor. It was a clever visual trick, as the diakon and scallops all looked the same.  It was well cooked and satisfying portion.\n\nFinally bread pudding we liked so much before has been amped up with caramel sauce. The only ding on that dish is the house-made vanilla (?) ice cream which was on the grainy and flavorless side.\n\nService, the biggest reason for stars off in our first visit, was much better this time around.

Harvard Gardens also sits across the street from the Beacon Hill Wyndham, the hotel where we stayed this past week. It is fitting that Harvard Gardens would be the leading meal of our Boston vacation. \n\n   Harvard Gardens reminds me of a hybrid pub and modern restaurant. It is a combination bar and restaurant. They serve all the great Americana food that bar restaurants are known for. I'd order the Reuben with fries, a Coke, then a cup of coffee. In hindsight the Reuben and fries were decent and nothing to yelp home about. The Americana meal that I would have later in the night at the Pointe was far better. \n\n  I left with the impression that the servers need to step up the service. We would rarely see our waiter. When we waved him to the table to refill our beverages he'd refill my brother's and forget to check on my refill. When we left, it was an effort to pay for the meal. If we were dishonest, it would have been easy to walk out minus paying. When it came to the Yelp check-in offer that discounts 15% off the bill, I was temporarily separated from my phone at the time the  waiter borrowed it to check with his boss on the check-in offer.

They turned a whole wall into a chalkboard and have the menu up there in a neat way. We were seated quickly and our waiter was nice, if a bit clueless and soft-spoken. \n\nWe tried the \"jumbo\" buffalo chicken wings, short rib grilled cheese, double-stack burger, LoLa spicy fries, and regular fries. \n\n- Chicken wings: Insanely tiny but delicious. I wouldn't have been so taken aback if they didn't say \"jumbo\" on the menu. These could have starred in \"Honey I Shrunk the Chicken Wings.\"\n\n- Short rib grilled cheese: The short rib inside was amazing, overall a really tasty sandwich. \n\n- Fries: They're shoestring fries, McDonald's style, and pretty good. The LoLa spicy fries just come with a spicy aioli on top/on the side. \n\n- Burger: This is their namesake. We were looking forward to that burger when it came out. And let me tell you, it was a bit underwhelming. We ordered it with all the standard toppings (and we saw the waiter write it down), but two completely bare (slightly charred) patties on a bun came out. When we noticed, we flagged someone nearby (possibly the service manager, not sure) to mention that we ordered it with toppings and cheese. The guy apologized and brought a side of the toppings and two slices of cheese. On the surface, that seems fine. ... But... there's a lot of things my dining companion could say about this, the least of which is that building the burger yourself and then eating a burger with a piece of cold cheese on it is suboptimal. The bun-to-burger ratio was also a bit off with the double stack, as the bottom bun soaked through before he had the chance to bite in. The burger patties themselves were good, as long as you're okay with them being pretty dark on the outside.\n\nThey have beer and wine, so I also had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, which was good but served in a tiny-looking stemless wine glass. \n\nOverall, we were underwhelmed.

I was the only female in the whole restaurant, but I did not feel awkward.\n\n When I looked through the menu, I saw Italian spaghetti, Mexican quesadillas, American cheeseburgers, and meat and rice platters. In fact, most of the menu is not Somali at all. We went with the Moroccan tagine (advertised as herbed chicken with lemon and olives) along with goat soup. When we received the \"tagine\", it was nothing like tagine at all! It was actually a platter of French fries with spiced chicken and jalapenos, served with chili and garlic sauce. The goat soup was served with a WHOLE LOAF of French bread. The goat soup was just like meat broth (aka yakhni in India, and yahni in Turkey and Bulgaria). The garlic sauce was amazing with the fries and chicken, so that redeemed the fact that it was totally not the item described on the menu.\n\n We enjoyed the vibe of the place; it definitely seems to be not only a restaurant but a community center of sorts. I saw a guy sit down with his laptop and start doing his homework. Other guys were watching the football game between SC and Vanderbilt and cheering. Middle-aged dudes in plaid shirts were laughing and drinking tea. Everyone was kind of in slow motion, and that seemed to apply to the service a little bit too. We could not find our guy, and then after our plates were taken away, we were waiting for the bill for a long time. Eventually, we went to pay ourselves. The man seemed a little taken aback when we asked where to put the tip, and then he decided it could go in a donation box. It seems they have the old world style where people do not tip. This shows that the workers were nice genuinely, not because of any expectation of money.

The entrees are traditional and run the gamut from old standby to exotic speciality.  You might see chicken feet here, jellied blood, strange organ meats.  I've seen salty spicy frog legs, lotus root, and had mini octopus in hot sauce.  On one day they've had salmon two ways, skin-on tilapia fillets in garlic sauce, clams in sauce, General Gau, tofu three ways, the aforementioned octopus, and different vegetables.\n\nIf you tell them you are going to eat there, they give you a big stainless steel lunchlady tray (hence the 'Prison Food' moniker) and ladle the food right onto it.

I ended up returning to their counter three times during that morning, thinking I'd had enough with each purchase. Starting with the yummy, flaky, egg tart and red bean mini moon cake, I continued on to try their sesame balls, as a fresh tray was just brought out from the kitchen. They weren't as delicate as I'd hoped. Then I overheard a customer ordering pork and preserved egg congee and had to try a bowl. What started out as a snack stop turned into a full Chinese comfort food breakfast. Their congee, rice porridge \"jook\", was fresh, not overly salty, and had generous amounts of pork and that yummy (to me) preserved duck egg yolk. I feasted not once but made several more stops during my Boston visit, sometimes for snacks, other times for either congee or sticky rice tamales, \"joong\". Their tamales were filled with Chinese pork sausage, pork belly, a salted egg yolk, and either peanuts or mung beans. Both versions were consistently firmly crafted and nicely seasoned. I also loved their version of creamy, red bean filled mochi pillows (\"Red Bean Glutinous Rice Balls\") that were melt in the mouth tender, regardless of being at room temperature or straight out of a refridgerator. They also had a variety of moon cakes made for the recent Autumn Moon Festival that diminished in available flavors as the week progressed. (Most Chinese bakeries sold these seasonally.) The products I tried were very reasonably priced and of overall excellent quality. Service was friendly and thoughtful, though the change received was off on the first visit. Towards the end of my Boston visit, I had became a regular and they automatically heat sealed, in plastic bags, my snack purchases because of a special request made previously. I only dined in the bakery side as they would not accommodate a substitution requested during a potential dinner stop (beef chow fun had to be served with brown gravy, not dry, and yes, I was picky that evening).

I am a baker so often times I am done with work around noon or 1 pm and their Starving Artists Lunch is a deal!\nBut, given all of this...given that they have two locations and they mean well and they have a cool concept and the new location has a full bar and the people that work there are nice...given all of this, my experiences with Grass Fed, both Centre Street and now Forest Hills, have left me pretty disappointed.  It takes a lot for me to boycott a place but I have left Grass Fed completely underwhelmed and 60 bucks in the hole too many times to justify my continued patronage.  \nWhat is going on?  You guys seem to have all the right moves.  Concept is great, people are nice, you have a sister restaurant that has been in business for a while in order for the group to pull wisdom from them.  But, your service is amateur at best.  I know this location is relatively new but I have experienced similar complaints at the Centre Street location.  Honestly, I would consider it an off night if I got my chosen dish, in addition to silverware and napkins, in addition to someone regularly checking-in on my drink status.  Maybe the management of Grass Fed really just does not care about quality service?  Most restaurants I have worked emphasize first and foremost the importance of good service.  Its called the hospitality industry for a reason.  Grass Fed has started all of these promotions to get bodies in the door, (karaoke, music bingo, trivia night, etc) but I can tell you two simple things that will get bodies in the door.  And take this from someone well-versed in the ways of the restaurant industry.  \nGood food.  \nGood service.  \nGet those two fundamentals down and then whip out your trivia nights.  But, if I have to send my burger back twice within 5 minutes, watch my girlfriend prod a beef burger to see whether they actually sent beef instead of her requested veggie burger, chase down the bartender for a drink or napkins or, heaven forbid, some ketchup, no amount of weekday recreation is getting me back through that door.

She then spoke with her manager, who came to our table and made a blatant attempt to modify the conditions of the Groupon. The Groupon states that it is valid for up to $80 of tapas, plain and simple. The manager then declared that the $80 covers a $10 per person cover charge, which was not previously mentioned before we entered, nor was it mentioned in the terms of the Groupon. I also observed that others arriving to the restaurant were not being charged the same fee. So this was clearly an attempt to lower the Groupon's value.

(AKA Mr. Screamer) for more details about this memorable night.\n***\n\nRestaurant disaster of epic proportions that kept getting worse as the night went on.  ZERO STARS!!!!\n\nI think our bill was in the 4 figure range.  What a shame. \n\nTotal cluster-F.  The food was less than OK.  Not worth the $25-$30 per entree, and almost $15 per appetizer.  \n\nI ordered the short rib with marrow.  The beef was bland.  The marrow was pretty much raw.  The appetizers were just useless.  I don't know how else to describe them.  Too small.  No flavor.  No flavor at all.  Just useless.\n\nWrong drinks were the norm.\n\nThe first wave of food came, and then the second bunch of entrees came 10 minutes later.\n\nAfter dinner, I actually had to walk around the restaurant looking for our waitress so we could order damn coffee.  Why?  Because other servers in our area only said they would try to find her.  Not one of them offered to just get us the damn coffee, which we only got after we finished our desserts.\n\nWe were with a big happy group celebrating a bday, so we were willing to let it all slide.  But then...  Then...\n\nUpon arrival, we were told to give our valet tickets to the servers 15 minutes before we wanted to leave.  So we tried to do that, but again our waitress was nowhere to be found.  So 2 of us went to the hostess stand and she offered to take our valet tickets and have them get our cars.  15 minutes later, our massive group is outside fully expecting to get into our vehicles and drive home happy (despite the lacking dining experience).\n\n1 hour (ONE HOUR!!!!!!) later our massive group is still outside waiting for our cars.  20 people, at 10pm, on a freezing cold night.  And we weren't the only ones.  Several other families had ALREADY been waiting 90 minutes at that point.\n\nSo we went inside to ask the manager to help find out what was going on.  We asked politely, we weren't overly upset because honestly we were all just enjoying each others company.  But the manager's reaction was thoroughly unexpected.\n\nTo say he was rude, smug, obnoxious, arrogant, and even spiteful, would be an understatement.  He said maybe 20 times that \"it's not my problem\" and \"the valet company doesn't work for us so I can't control what they do.\"\n\nThis manager simply HATES his customers.  Another patron just lost it at that point and started yelling and screaming at this horrible manager.  I don't know how I restrained myself from joining him in shouting (God knows how bad I wanted to let him have it).  \n\nSo this poor guy and his son were screaming at the manager who was basically laughing in their face.  Other patrons just couldn't eat because their jaws had long since hit the floor.  Waiters were frozen in a mixture of shock, fear, and more uselessness.  And 25 people were still waiting for their cars.\n\nAnd to make it even worse, we had to wait another 20 minutes until the first car arrived.  Luckily it was Mr. Screamer's car.\n\nMistakes happen, but what is inexcusable is incompetence mixed with contempt for your customers.  \n\nProspective patrons, spare yourself the abuse and go elsewhere.

It's been a few days since we ate here for Dine Out Boston and I STILL feel like I can't eat anything! That's how generous the portions of food at Fogo De Chao are! Located tucked away inside of the Westin Hotel in the heart of Back Bay, Fogo De Chao not only features interactive dinner service where specially trained Brazilian gaucho chefs come to your table with giant skewers of every flavorful meat imaginable, but also a gorgeously abundant Market Table, where you can stock up on every kind of fruit, veggie, and salad imaginable throughout your meal. All this PLUS dessert for $40? I'm sold!\n\nWe had an 8 PM reservation, but were so excited to eat dinner that we showed up a tad bit early. No problem! We were seated pretty much right away. However, I definitely recommend making reservations via Opentable, because the foyer looked crowded, even though it was a weeknight. The restaurant itself is giant and well decorated, with barrels of Brazilian liquor repurposed for aesthetics, dim lighting (the official Yelp selfie light came in handy here for food pics!), and helpful, smartly dressed servers flitting from table to table, attending on the every whim of the customer. I found the service here to be extremely attentive, and that was a very high point of our dining experience.\n\nEach meal at Fogo De Chao begins with a trip up to the Market Table buffet, and boy, were we in for a treat! We piled our plates high with INCREDIBLE maple bacon (oh my GOD I am still dreaming about this), assorted fruits (starfruit and papaya were excellent), authentic Brazilian feijoada black bean stew, charcuterie, cheeses, and an insanely addictive basil pesto sauce that tasted awesome paired with the meat we had later. You could make a meal out of the Market Table alone, but no one comes here just for the sides. No, the main course is the meat! Every diner is equipped with a little circular card that is green on one side for \"yes, pile the plate with meat!\" or red on the other for \"no, I need to save room for dessert!\" I wanted to try a bit of all of the offerings, and there were many. From tender leg of lamb to a fantastic bacon wrapped chicken breast, it was a carnivore's paradise! I haven't eaten that much food in one sitting in a loooooong time, but I'm sure glad that I did. I was also very happy that the portions of meat weren't gigantic, so you were able to try a little of everything without getting too stuffed all at once. There were also complimentary sides: mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, polenta fries, and pao de queijo, a traditional Brazilian cheese bread that tasted like a cross between a croissant and a popover. I wish I had more room to load up on this carb carnival, but what I did have, I enjoyed.\n\nWe had to save room for dessert, so we opted for the key lime pie (my boyfriend) and the chocolate mousse cake (me). Both desserts were just okay, but I also insisted on ordering a slice of Tres Leches Cake, which is my all time favorite dessert, and that was FABULOUS! It was very sweet, moist, and tender, and probably my favorite part of the meal! Along with the Dine Out Boston meals, extra dessert, and two drinks - a very tangy Grapefruit Spritzer for me, and a Brazilian Guarana ginger ale for my boyfriend - the bill came out to around $100. Not a bad deal, but I can see how Fogo De Chao isn't super affordable for frequent dining. I saw a small cocktail going for $16.. eek! Maybe next time.. sans the full price churrascaria experience *embarrassed face emoji*\n\nAnyway, I'm glad to have crossed Fogo De Chao off of my Boston dining bucket list, and had an awesome time eating here for Dine Out Boston!"}]}, "Nanning Wok": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 4, "text": "When you live in Southie (or anywhere else for that matter), there is always going to be very healthy competition for your late night drunken chinese food dollar.

I thought for this price range, I would get a premium green tea flavor but it tasted so watered down.

Just so shocked that people would dish out this much money for cheese tea - their most expensive drink goes up to $10.95!!!

I came to Drink on opening night and have been back more often than I have been any where else in this entire city. As a regular, a lover of cocktails, an individual who appreciates those who love their craft and a big fan of Barbara Lynch and John Gertsen in general, I thought it time update my review, with a few choice pieces of advice for those who have never been, those who've been and didn't enjoy it as much or for those who just wanna hate.\n\n1. If you don't like cocktails (or cannot at least have an open mind about them), don't come here. Yep, I said it. Go some where else. There are plenty of beer bars, dive bars, wine bars and college bars in Boston. Please don't come here and bitch about the beer or wine selection. That's like being a vegetarian and going to a BBQ joint and wining about the lack of non-meat items. Save it and go elsewhere.\n\n2. The lack of menu is a GREAT thing. You get to be up close and personal with some of the best in the biz, who will craft you a drink based upon whatever it is you like. The possibilities are endless. Just name it and they will come up with something, make it right there on the spot and then tell you all about it so you can learn a bit about what your drinking! Like a certain flavor? Just say it! Like a certain spirit? It's that easy. Got taste aversions or really can't stand gin? Just let them know!\n\n3. Well-made things take time. This place is not in business to sling shots or pour gin and tonics so you and your friends can get shit faced and try to pick up the first thing you see that has a vagina. Drink exists for the old-fashioned pastime of cocktails and conversation, enjoyment of good company and the pleasure of sipping something to taste its flavors and not just get bombed. If you want to get wasted and hit on people, go to Faniuel Hall. No one wants you here anyway.\n\n4. This is not a restaurant/pub/lounge. The food was meant to accompany the drinks, not to be the main attraction. Barbara Lynch has a bunch of other places that focus on food. If you want to eat and fill yourself up, go there. If you want bad-ass cocktails and something equally delicious to SNACK on (snack, not gorge, being the operative word), this is the place to go.\n\n5. $10 for a drink is a bargain. Especially when you consider what you're getting. If you'd rather pay $12-$14 for a vodka-tonic, please see rule numbers 2 &3, because you are clearly lost. For those of you who bitch about not getting \"goose\" or that Smirnoff isn't good enough for you, I guarantee that you wouldn't know the difference in a taste test. And last I checked, Smirnoff consistently scores higher than ANY other vodka in existence for taste and quality. Google that fact.

Such a creative take on duck that completely deconstructs it and then puts it back together into a dish that is so true to its essence. This might not make any sense until you actually try it. Basically the duck is cooked two different ways, one wrapped in licorice, with crisped duck skin served on the side.

It's definitely a more casual vibe than your average $$$$ place; I saw people in hoodies and sweatshirts. You won't feel out of place if you dress to impress, though. The vibe is very swanky and Clio is located in a corner of the super chic and fabulous Eliot Hotel.\n\nOther legit restaurants in Boston: Toro, L'Espalier, O Ya, Saus, Oleana. The rest you can skip.

About twenty minutes later, our appetizers arrived. Again, quite fervently, we devoured our appetizers. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Forty-five minutes into the wait, we asked how much longer the entrees would take, since we now had been there for an hour and a half and still had not gotten our entrees.

To be honest with you, our chef just walked out of the kitchen and flipped over trays of food for the party and we had to remake everything. That's why we brought you the clam chowder. It'll probably be another twenty minutes.\" \n\nNow, we had assumed that when a restaurant says that their kitchen was \"delayed a little\" that this did not mean an hour and a half of waiting for your entree. On top of that, if your chef had walked out and flipped over a trays of food for a party, you might want to have a better back up plan than make ALL of your guests wait that long. At the very, very least, have the decency to be apologetic about it, instead of giving us a condescending response.\n\nA few of us were agitated.

Coca cola!\"\n\nWhile ordering, since we were not sure about the portion/size, we just ordered 3 entrees for 5 of us.

He insisted us that, these 4 portions combined(looked like just one normal portion which you get elsewhere) should be enough and why do you need more? We still insisted then he said, \"decide what all you want in one go or the chef will kick his butt!\" I do not really understand this policy. Do you really expect the guests to decide upfront what all you need without looking at your portions? Are you going to decide how much we should order? Obviously, suggestions are really welcome, but it has to be a friendly gesture!\n\nAt the end, we waited for at least 20 mins finishing our dinner just to get the check/bill. Even while giving that, he made funny comments about you can stay back more time waiting for check and why you should hurry etc.\n\nOn presenting 4 credit cards, he made faces like anything and complained about having to make difficult(!) calculations. So we rounded it to a good figure which a 2nd grade student can divide by 4 with generous tip, he says \"You are nice, (with pause) sometimes!\"\n\nHis overall attitude made us feel that we were not welcome there.

The decor is nice and modern.   I especially liked the set-up of the bar.  It definitely seemed like a great place to grab drinks after work.  As for the service, you can definitely tell they are a new restaurant.  Our waitress seemed to be very unfamiliar with sushi and messed up on our order.  She quickly apologized and put in the correct order.  I've tried a number of different sushi restaurants and this one was mediocre.  It's a lot better than the other sushi restaurant in the financial district so I would come again.  The fish I had was very fresh.   As for the lunch menu, it ranged from about $10-$15.  They have an interesting menu with different options from your typical sushi restaurant like gnocchi and different variety of prepared salmon other than the usual salmon terriyaki.  Beers were between $4-$5 and cocktails for $12.  I would go again during lunch or afterwork for drinks but it doesn't compare to my favorites; fugakyu and fujis.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI just went back for a second visit.  Their spicy tuna rolls are awesome but the service really needs to get better.

I got to the restaurant at 1:20 and my food was not done yet.  I decided to pay ahead of time.  At 1:35,  I asked where my food was and he said he'd check.  He came back telling me that it should be done within the next few minutes.   I waited and waited.. My co-worker who  finished with her cigarette by then came in looking for me because she wasn't sure where I was.  At 1:45 (45 minutes after I placed a takeout order), he came over realizing I was upset and said, \"you know it's busy. We don't know if each day will be busy or not so it's hard for us to tell you how long the food will take.  What do you want me to do?\"  I was so upset by his comment.  It shouldn't take 45 minutes for a takeout order.  My co-worker exchanged a few words with him and he just stared at her blankly.   He didn't offer anything!!!

Secondly, we had the very good and very well presented spicy scallop dish with scallions. The long stems shooting out the top, while also eye-appealing, provided plenty of veggie crunch to off-set the soft mollusk. We also had the oyster dish, which was rather squishy and textually not my thing, but hey, they're oysters...so they  tasted great. Finally we ordered something called Mysai on Fire (not sure if i'm spelling it right). This is served with almond slices, adding just the right amount of crispiness that i thought balanced the dish very well in flavor as well as texture. The spicy sauce for this dish is served over the sushi as opposed to underneath and more generous in its amount. Each spicy sauce had its own unique flavor as well. From the cinnamony tuna dish to the the more tangy Mysai dish each came at the pallett in its delectable own way.

I was aware that there might be an outside-drink policy, but nobody said anything so I was like okay I guess it wouldn't hurt to try a sip of this bubble tea that I've dying to try. Then 3 hours later, we got the bill and saw that there was a $27 \"bar charge\" to our bill. Promptly, we went up to ask what it was for and our waiter gave us attitude and was like \"thats the charge for the drinks\" and we were like \"what drinks?\" and here is what angers me the most:\n\nThe waiter proceeded to ask in a sarcastic tone with his eyebrows raised up and with a smirk, \"you brought those drinks with you didn't you? huh?\" and ended with that.  \n\nI sat there in disbelief because that was the nastiest tone and nastiest facial expression I ever received from a waiter. \n\nFIRST OF ALL, as our waiter, he should've informed us about charging us on the drinks that we BARELY drank when we first got there. Because he told us after and gave us so much attitude about it, it makes him seem so sketchy and seem to have hidden agendas.\n\nSECOND OF ALL, as a waiter, he should have know better than to give attitude or any condescending manners to your customers. After all, we are the ones giving you business and tip (I hope he enjoyed that $3 tip btw). \n\nTHIRD OF ALL, he completely ruined the tone and the mood of the dinner for my two friends who were celebrating their birthdays here. No customers should have to experience that, especially at a restaurant like Giacomos.\n\nThe reason why I'm so anal about him informing us about extra charges is because the second I brought a cake to the hostess, she INFORMED us that there was going to be a $4 charge per person for the cake. I was like okay thanks for informing us because thats proper etiquette. I wouldn't have minded the extra charges from my waiter if he informed us in the first place. $27 is a ridiculous price.\n\nOther things: service is SUPER SLOW here. We made reservations for 6PM and didn't get seated until 7PM. And then we ate from 7PM to 9PM. It took our crappy waiter 15 minutes before attending to us (some other waiter had to get our drink orders). Then another 15 minutes for our incompetent waiter to get our orders, which I had to repeat at least FOUR times that I wanted a SMALL caesar salad. Was he not paying attention or did he not understand English? Whichever it is, get your act together or just stop being a waiter before you piss more customers off.\n\nAnyways, we waited another half hour before getting our food. After getting the food, we asked the waiter to bring the cake out, and then he proceeded to say \"sorry we don't sing happy birthday\", but 10 minutes later, I saw another table singing happy birthday with their waiter. What the heck? Not like we cared about a stupid birthday song. But what the heck?\n\nAnd then the whole fiasco with the extra \"bar charge\" came about. Throughout the whole night, I already had a hunch feeling that our waiter was condescending, but I decided to brush it off. But nope, I guess I was right. I could tell you that he is a 40 year old man with brown curly hair and an accent, but that does not matter to me.\n\nI'm usually a generous tipper, no matter how mediocre the service was, but this service was ABSOLUTE CRAP and he did not deserve any tips whatsoever. $3 is already good enough.\n\nOn the one hand though, they have amazing caesar salads and the hostess is super friendly and made the one hour wait more bearable.

There are two bar areas and two dining rooms, latter with a smaller one for private events. \n\nEats: The chefs hail from Rialto and Blue serving upscale Italian with charm and flair. Though I was not pleased by the prevalence of veal on the menu, I carnivored out with phenomenal meatball 'taste.' Essentially a huge, tender, juicy ball on a roll slathered with yummy tomato sauce and topped with cheese and arugula, a divine gourmet meatball sub. The twice-cooked artichokes and wild mushrooms on crostini were very temping, so veggie lovers sharpen your knives.\n\nWe stuck to the pasta dishes, myself the gnocchi with pesto which was wonderful. Thick, moist and irregular in size one could tell the pasta was housemade and prepared with care. The pesto was some of the best I've had in the city. My friend had the Trenette alla Genovese with green beans, potatoes and pesto. It came with less sauce than mine, and was a bit bland. I wanted the baked rigatoni veal, tomatoes and parmigiano but I couldn't hang with the tortured calf thing. Not my style. Snagged a bite of the noodles and sauce and it was excellent! Not too acidic, just enough olive oil. \n\nThe prosecco was solid and my St. Micheal Essan (?) pinot noir complemented the dishes nicely. I love me an espresso with dessert. They get a w00t for the perfect foam on top. Killer. The Pacciugo di Portofino strawberry & vanilla sorbet with strawberry sauce, whipped cream & amaretti was an amazing blend of flavors that I never would have put together, but was fantastic.\n\nService: The staff was super friendly and accomodating. Though we arrived right as the dining room was closing we were sat and served by a jovial guy who my friend shamelessly hit on until he interjected he was gay. Oh snap! \n\nTwo cents: This place is a winner. I think it'll do really well in this developing neighborhood. A little birdie told me that they're installing old-style lamps and cobblestoning the sidewalks in the 'hood.

I'd already eaten a light dinner when a friend and I came to the ICA, but my friend hadn't.  We hadn't thought to do any research beforehand into a good place nearby for vegetarians, and the only options we could see looked heavy on hamburgers and seafood, so we decided to just try this place.  But her sandwich was bland and the \"homemade chips\" we got to share between us were inexplicably sometimes crunchy and sometimes chewy or soggy, and they didn't vary according to size, so I just don't know what caused it.  Additionally, the free night at the ICA begins before the cafe opens, so by the time they started taking oders at 6, all the tables were full and there was a several-person line waiting to order.  They only took one order at a time (despite at least two people behind the counter), so it took at least 20 minutes for the line to die down, probably longer.   Because every table was already full as the line moved super slowly, there were people standing around waiting for tables to open up before everyone in line had even ordered.  Next time we'll check Yelp before going to the ICA and eat somewhere with several good reviews, and hopefully a place that is much better organized than this.\n\n\nEdited to add:  The same thing recommended by the reviewer who posted right after me, \"Potato chips with blue cheese dipping sauce (Thick cut potatoes with a flavorful dipping sauce),\" are the homemade chips that were so gross to us.

The first red flag was the difficulty, and almost hostility, I received when paying with a debit/credit card. Myself and co-workers have all been told numerous times that \" we charge you more for using cards.\" This rubbed my the wrong way, so I looked up Massachusetts State Laws regarding this \"fee\" and quickly found that businesses are not allowed to tack on extra change as a penalty for using a card, however, they are more than welcome to offer a discount for those paying with cash. FINE. The menu prices listed, however, are their cash prices, so when you do pay with card, you're charged more than the menu price. I realize this is a small verbiage formality and that I'm just sounding cheap, but my feelings of being cheated have only worsened with additional transactions...\n\nI have ordered the same latte, same size, same flavor shot, same woman making it, three times. The first two times, I paid with card and was charged $4.00. The listed price for my latte was 3.25, so I was confused at how tax and their 'card upcharge' fee tacked on an exact extra 75 cents. The third time around I happened to have cash, and sadly when handed my coffee, was again charged $4.00. At this point I was already unhappy with their menu pricing, so I contested it. The woman didn't know how to react. Her tactic was to point at the menu board and claim that the latte is 3.25 and tax is not included in that price. After some more discussion she reveals that my flavor shot is .35 ( which is not mentioned on their menu board). At his point I'm feeling like I might just be crazy, but she turns her computer monitor to me and punches the order in. She comes out with a total of 3.79 or so, just hands me 30 cents, and apologizes.  \nSo my question is this, if I am being charged 4.00, but their system thinks it received 3.80, where does that 20 cents go?  I realize that 20 cents is a small sum, and that I may be over reacting, however, after the numerous confusions and issues I have had with payment alone, I feel as if there is some shady money handling here. I still do not know how they calculate the price they charge, based on the price that's posted.

While Porter Square's Yume Ga Arukara has already been serving udon, LAU offers greater variety and levels of customization with the added convenience in location. \n\nAcross from Allston's Star Market, it's a contemporary and casual dining place that is great for solo or group dining. \n\nYou order from the counter starting with your choice in udon base (original, curry, miso, new england chowder, or zaru udon). For an additional $2, you can add beef and onion (which is a must). You can also add a variety of different tempura as well ie. shrimp, spam, vegetables etc. Your order will then be brought out to you. \n\nI did not get the impression that they made their udon in house, however, it was still good and chewy. They do have racks of tempura on display next to the cashier, but they were rather lackluster with either empty or less than 5 pieces per option. Perhaps they'd prefer to do their tempura made to order or they were re-stocking? \n\nRecs: \n(+++) New England Chowder Udon $10.88 with beef and onion.\nRecommended for those who want to venture off from the original soup base. I was skeptical this combo was going to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. Their chowder is thick and creamy with pieces of clams scattered throughout.

Terra is an absolutely beautiful restaurant, with greenery all around the restaurant, hanging from the ceiling and along the walls, a beautifully lit bar, and glass windows overhead that make you feel like you're outside. The decor is absolutely stunning, and the perfect setting for a girl's night. Our group of 3 wanted to treat ourselves to wine, charcuterie, and pasta, and felt that Terra would totally be the place to do so!\n\nWe started with crisp white wines, which were great to start. \n- CHEF'S SELECTION OF CHARCUTERIE ($34): There was a variety of meats including prosciutto, salami and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, but there was also a weird selection of meats where the texture and flavor profile did not match our tastes. There were also some parmigiano, which was good and a mozzarella that just spilled milk all over the board the minute it was cut. Of course accompanied with all of the meats and cheese were pickled vegetables and olives. Of the entire board, we probably only ate 1/3 of it.\nDisappointed with our appetizer, we were excited to try our entrees:\n- POLPO ($17): The octopus was so extremely charred on the outside that all you tasted was burnt charcoal and salt, but the inside was extremely tender and almost too raw. It tasted as if it was frozen and immediately burned. The celery, parsley, and lemon did not help this dish.\n- SPAGHETTI ($17): This was the most bland spaghetti I've ever had, and I'm pretty sure a homemade spaghetti would be better than the one they served here. The \"smoked tomato\" had absolutely no flavor, and salt could not help this dish. \n- GNOCCHI: The gnocchi really was not like gnocchi at all. The potato flour was so mushy and soft that it almost felt like the texture of over-boiled Asian rice cake. It was not the texture that gnocchi should be. Also, the flavor was so bland we only had one piece each and left the dish untouched.\n\nOur server asked multiple times if we were done eating, because we had barely touched our dishes. We eventually told him that we did not like our gnocchi, and he later agreed that the gnocchi was undercooked and that they could make a new entree.

I particularly liked the Porgy, an example of a terribly unsexy, but delicious fish that is often thrown away.\n\nWe also enjoyed the Polpo (octopus) several times, although the preparation varies. With Calabrian chile peppers and arugula it was amazing.  Crispy smashed potatoes with rosemary and lemon are must order too.\n\nIsland Creek and other very local oysters, crudos, some seafood pasta...what's not to like?  Try the Movia Rebula orange wine ($18/63 glass/bottle) with oysters, an unusual but very successful pairing we dreamed up.\n\nThere's even a card to get punched everytime you buy something marked with a \"Fish Better, Eat Better\" symbol, with a 10% discount when you reach enough punches.\n\nPerfect, knowledgeable service.  Open for lunch and dinner (I think it shuts down in between, which is different than the pasta and pizza restaurants, IIRC).\n\nI've tried all the sit-down restaurants at Eataly, except Terra, and this is the one that really stands out to me.

Pretty similar to the old Common Ground layout (minus the nests, whittled chairs, and bearded petrouli-scented servers which have since been replaced with your average Dorchester lifer.) Sure they have only been open a few days, and maybe they plan to add stuff to the walls or whatnot, but allow me to suggest a few improvements:\n\n1. I sat at the bar/counter and ordered an iced tea. I received a plastic Arizona bottle out of the cooler with a glass of ice. Meh. One thing that the old Common Ground did well was make their own iced tea...and it was amazing. It's literally the easiest thing in history and you can display the jugs on the table behind the bar...instead of nothing there right now. I can get an Arizona at the Four Provinces lottery joint next door. Not saying much...\n\n2. There is NOTHING on the walls as of yet. Like I said before, the simple addition of some local art or photographs would only improve the experience. Why not?\n\n3. I ordered the turkey bacon sandwich with avocado and some other stuff. First, there was no avocado on it. Second the top slice of bread (homemade btw, nice) was about 2 inches thick compared to 1/4 inch on the bottom. Same went for the two tomato slices inside. Bizarre. It was tough to eat because of all this, but regardless, the sandwich would have been a C in perfect form. Also, pretty sure the turkey was that waterlogged kind you see behind the grocery store glass stewing in its own plastic wrapped juices. Worst kind. Just roast your own. It's not that hard. \n\n4. They served homefries with my sandwich. Hmmmm, ok. It was 1pm on a Tuesday, and I didn't expect that. Can't quite understand the reasoning. Simple FF's or chips would have been much better and expected, not a leftover from breakfast. \n\nAll that said, the service was good and everyone seemed attentive to all the tables there. Positive to see right away. I actually mentioned some of my gripes to the woman behind the counter when she asked and the manager came to talk to me about it. Without even knowing, he comped me a discount on the bill because of the flaws above. I was in no way expecting something like that, but good practice.

I usually get forced to one of the suburban locations, go to different dim sum spot, or, better yet, hold out until one of my trips to Los Angeles. Growing up, however, this was the spot my family would go for dim sum, always remembering those lengthy waits for a table and not settling to share one (because other parties do steal your own food, hehe). In high school, you'd eat almost anything edible, especially after a long wait. \n\nI came here recently for a business meeting and my expectations weren't all that high. The meeting was strategically mid-week and before the lunch crowd so it was dead quiet, save for a few older Chinese folks. There was no FOH and we just awkwardly fetched a table for ourselves. The new decor doesn't really impress me a whole lot. Fake trees? \n\nI kept it simple and did ha gao and siu mai. Well, they weren't horrific but definitely sub-par. The ha gao's filling was passable but the dumpling skin was as thick as Donald Trump's infamous hair. You can immediately tell if a dim sum place is good by the ha gao dumpling skin. The siu mai was warm but lacking in a whole lot of character. Overall, both dumplings felt overly starchy and sat in my stomach like an anchor.\n\nFor whatever reason, and I kinda don't want to know, the ha cheung tasted tart. The sauce is soy sauce, the rice noodle neutral, and the shrimp slightly sweet, so what gives? That shouldn't be the case. So far, I haven't felt any ill effects, but if you don't see posts from me for while, you'll know why.\n\nThe beef tripe provided minimum spice and maximum oiliness.

In contrast to the previous reviews this one is from the perspective of the Dean's List as a bar in lieu of a restaurant. \n\n   Living in Las Vegas, I take it for granted that I could go into a 7-Eleven and pick up a 24-ounce can of beer. However near the cobblestone streets of Beacon Hill and the Cambridge River bridges, it was difficult picking up a 24-ounce can of beer from 7-Eleven and the liquor stores that seemed to close early. The Dean's List was my source of a nighttime cold one on the nights when I was in the vicinity of the hotel by 11 PM.\n\n   The bar is U-shaped with TVs broadcasting professional sports. On my last evening in Boston after visiting Fenway Park, it was at this very bar where I witnessed A Rod play his last game as a NY Yankee. I witnessed NY Yankee baseball history over a 20 ounce Sam Adams draft. The 20 ounce draft costs $9. Sam Adams is one of a few drafts on tap. \n\n  During the few nights that we visited in the bar around 11 PM, it wasn't busy. This feels more like a hotel bar than one of the popular bars in town. When we weren't witnessing baseball history at the bar, we would carry our beer a few feet to the plush couches overlooking the Wyndham hotel lobby. Nearby was the rack of Boston brochures.

This was an environment with little noise that was ideal for enjoying a Major League baseball game and planning an excursion near the elevator to the hotel room. \n\n  As far as the service it wasn't exactly the kind of place where everybody knows your name. In actually it momentarily appeared that I was going to give it two stars when we arrived here ten minutes before closing time at 11 PM when the bar tender stated he had made the last call. My dad mentioned that it closes in ten minutes. The bartender was briefly disgusted when he had to delay closing up. I even mentioned to my dad that we should walk over to the Red Hat. Just like Boston weather, the bar tender's attitude suddenly changed for the better. Now he was engaging us in conversation. That conversation touched on Major League baseball. He even let us know that we were welcome to bring the beer up to the room.

Just a normal evening in South Boston in the early 80s.\n\nLynch's ascent from growing up in gang-infested public housing projects to being just the second woman to win the James Beard \"Outstanding Chef\" award to owning the only non-NYC restaurant in the northeast U.S. on the \"Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux\" list is an extraordinary story, and I could write just about that - but this review needs to be about Menton, another interesting topic for me as someone who has enjoyed many meals there since its opening in 2010.\n\nIn my recent review of Lynch's first restaurant, \"Park No. 9,\" I mentioned that it was not showy, not \"tweezer food,\" not OCD, not truly \"fancy.\" Menton is the opposite of that: an exercise in self-indulgent culinary artistry and of bleeding-edge cooking techniques, all delivered in a veneer wood-paneled environment featuring stylized diamond pagoda-like ceiling lanterns with the appropriately scrupulous service demanded by a venue of this level of stately grandeur. You don't earn '5 Stars' from Forbes and '5 Diamonds' from AAA without some razzle-dazzle. Differences aside, Park No. 9 and Menton are both excellent restaurants and my preference for one or the other is purely dependent on mood.\n\nMenton's name comes from the coastal town in southeastern France that borders Italy, reflecting Lynch's general M.O. of fusing French and Italian cuisines. The food at Menton is not just great, it is practically perfect. My latest visit in April came just after Chef Lynch returned to Menton's kitchen for the first time since it opened to implement a new menu and, aside from a tear I noticed in the upholstery of my seat, was perhaps the most flawless of my visits over the many years I've dined here. My waiter for that evening, Danny, was an excellent server and ensured that I got not just a meal, but an experience.\n\nI ordered the 9-course Chef's Whim tasting ($165) as I usually do when I'm here. My favorite dish off of the new spring menu was the \"Chickering Farms Goat,\" a sausage-wrapped goat loin from with a fava bean pur\u00e9e and a punchy pepperonata. The grassy and earthy flavors of the goat paired perfectly with the recommended wine pairing, the \"Malpa\u00eds\" from Front\u00f3n de Oro, a charcoal-y blend of three Canary Island grapes: Preto, Tintilla, and List\u00e1n Negro. The lean goat was more taut than tender, proving that meat doesn't need to \"melt\" in one's mouth to be extraordinary.\n\nAnother favorite dish off of the tasting menu was the \"Poached Shellfish,\" a combination of local shrimp, peekytoe crab, and speck covered with a gloriously rich \"mussel cr\u00e8me\" sauce - Grade A plate-licking stuff - and accompanied by a complimentary small pour of dry sherry. Other highlights included the \"Island Creek Oysters\" - a trio of 3 plump oysters harvested in nearby Duxbury in a chilled mango-cucumber 'broth' that interplays with the natural sweetness and meatiness of these particular oysters - and the \"Spaghetti,\" a typically astounding Lynchian pasta course with smoked duck confit and a sweet tomato sauce that has been reduced and caramelized to the point of it almost being a glaze rather than a sauce.\n\nMenton is reportedly experiencing some financial woes, like many other Boston restaurants facing exorbitant rent hikes, and has started to offer lunch as part of its plan to achieve profitability. While there must be extraordinary pressures to \"downscale\" the menu, cut corners, or make the restaurant more accessible during dinner hours, I have seen no evidence of that from this recent visit.

I love the way they've redone the entrance way which is a stairway leading down into a basement it is completely tiled with mah-jongg pieces. It looks fabulous and it is very unique as is the menu here. I highly suggest a reservation as the tables are few but the atmosphere is huge. On my first tasting here I ordered Oxtail Chow Foon   The noodle was fabulous and I was informed that it is homemade noodle. As for the oxtail and the gravy the oxtail was plentiful and the gravy was superb.  The wait staff very polite and knowledgeable on the menu as well as very attentive to the customer's needs. \nDishes came out hot and water was refilled promptly. The interior of the restaurant is decorated very nice almost romantic and is comfortable and airy which is very surprising for a space with no windows.

Luke's Lobster is a pretty recent addition to the new twin buildings in Seaport that house the new bowling alley and The Scorpion Bar.

There aren't really big tables so I wouldn't suggest coming with a big group. \n\nFood: They feature more or less the same menu as their other locations. I did notice that they did not have the crab claws which I saw at another Boston location. Not sure if that was a seasonal item. Their famous combo is called Luke's Trio which features three half rolls of lobster, baby shrimp, and crab. The lobster was succulent and sweet, the best of the three! I felt the shrimp in itself didn't really have too much flavor. The lumps of crab were delightful delicious on its own. All three care on a half New England style split top hot dog bun, toasted with butter and with each roll topped with what seems to be a variant of Old Bay seasoning. I also got the clam chowder which was full of potatoes and clam! Thick and creamy, it was the perfect pairing for any of the rolls. \n\nVerdict: The Trio cost $20 while the small chowder cost $6. I did visit on a weekend so I'm not sure if the chowder will always be as full as I just got it today. I think the Trio is a good way to sample most of their items and the price isn't too outrageous for what you're getting. Right down the road is James Hook which also serves lobster rolls stuffed to the brim as well. Luke's will give you a nice place to sit and dine, with it's food items looking more refined.

Most of my triggers are food related, making going out to eat pretty frustrating. However, a friend of mine was having a going away party there this evening, so disease be damned, I was going out.\n\nFirst major props go to Peter G. as he actually went to the restaurant at lunch to go over my allergies with the chef and the manager, as they both wanted to discuss it with him (I had doctor's appointments, and he works near there anyway). That was beyond awesome...he is too though.\n\nWhen I got there this evening, they were fully aware of my condition and my triggers, had gotten a list of them that they kept in the kitchen, and were so well versed when I ordered something that had something I was allergic to in it that isn't a common ingredient (I ordered mashed potatoes, and they had buttermilk in them) the waiter came out seconds later to discuss it with  me. Seriously, they took my health and allergies that seriously that they kept paperwork on it onhand to make sure they wouldn't accidentally give me food with an allergen in it. The waiter even asked me if I'd mind explaining my condition with him, since it seemed really interesting since it went outside the realm of normal food allergies (for those who don't read all my reviews, I have systemic mastocytosis. it's super rare and super annoying)\n\nSecond, they custom made me a meal that wasn't on the menu so that I'd have no risk of cross contamination or anything. It was a simple meal (chicken breast with rosemary and olive oil) but it was delicious. The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly.\n\nFor dessert I had a coconut creme brulee which is one of the best I've ever had, maybe slightly edged out by one I had in Paris. The top was carmalized perfectly, not too bitter, not too sweet, and the coconut was a fantastic touch.\n\nWhen they found out that we were sending a friend off to Korea, our waiter took a picture of our table together, which I thought was very sweet.\n\nI do wish I still drank as their drink list was astounding. Classic cocktails, absinthe cocktails, just great.\n\nSeriously, everything there was fantastic, the atmosphere, the service, the quality of the food...just awesome.

Rio's is a very casual restaurant (plastic over the tablecloths, drinks in the cooler style) that offers a menu that's half Italian/half Brazilian, so you'll see things like lasagna next to oxtail and fried yucca in their buffet.  Load up a plate or take out box at the buffet then proceed to the counter where you can order roasted meat from the brick oven.  Once you're done, they'll weigh your dish and charge you $6.99 a pound, which I thought was a good price.  My plate cost $6.99, while my husband's plate which was loaded up with a giant pile of oxtail, beef, and sausage was twice that\n\nI enjoyed the garlicy beans and the feij\u00e3o tropeiro which had plenty of pork, but overall I wished everything was hotter and steamier.. that's the sacrifice you make with a buffet, I suppose.

On the other hand, it turns out I wanted to steal my husband's entire serving of sausage (no jokes, please), and the chicken other folks were getting looked pretty good too.  Anything from the grill doesn't have the lack of heat issue since it's grilled right before your eyes and then dumped on your plate, so take advantage.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, pop in with some cash (they don't take credit cards) and have a cheap casual lunch.

I wanted to try it when it opened but the restaurant is a rather out-of-my-way and my previous attempts to come afterward were unsuccessful. But I had business in Brookline, and this spot wasn't too far. I can still taste that burger from that first visit and this latest one.\n\nThe Alpha burger (double patty) is still one of the juiciest burgers I've had. It's not that greasy-type of juicy either. So the burgers are cooked in a sort of sous-vide method before it is seared on the grill. The potato bun for the burger holds up well with the liquidity. The lettuce and tomato were fresh and their steak sauce a bit tangy. \n\nThe major complaint I have was that the fried egg I ordered ended up being roughed up, overcooked, and yolk solid as a rock. The problem was that the restaurant doesn't really use much oil on the grill for their patties after the sous-vide process, and that's fine. Not using any oil for the egg, however, causes trouble. The egg sticks to the grill and will make it difficult to cook without a yolk hull breach. If I'm paying extra for it, I expect a better product. \n\nThe shaken fries were fine, with a regular packet of powered garlic and parmesan. I wasn't in love with the fries but they weren't a detriment either. They were fairly thin and okay in crispiness. \n\nSeating and decor is spartan but clean and orderly.

I have been here many times. I clearly remember the very first time I went there as well. But I will not make this one a 'reminiscing old memories' kind of a note! :o)\n\nLast night was back to the good ol days. And once again, Mistral never disappoints. If you are looking for some really good French cuisine (ok - no comparisons to anyone who has had french food in France - that's not fair for very obvious reasons!) with a classy chic ambiance, Mistral is a safe bet in Boston.\n\nAgain, the place does not need any negative comments of any kind. But here are a few things to know if you are a first time diner here:\n\n- Make a reservation. No matter what the time of the year, the restaurant is almost always full. You can try your luck at the bar if you are not on a date (where you really want to be at the table for a specific reason) or with family or a big group.\n\n- Don't try parking on the street. You will never find a spot. It is Back Bay. They valet your car. Avoid getting ticketed by the Boston parking police.\n\n- If you do end up at the bar by any chance, and are inquisitive about specials etc., do strike up a conversation with the bartenders. They are really nice. And they make some really good martinis :o)\n\n- Appetizers: \n* The Tuna Tartar is possibly the best you will find in Boston. It is so so good!\n* The lobster ravioli comes a close second. But I have always got Tuna Tartar no matter what.\n* I have tried other apps too and they don't disappoint either\n\n- Entrees:\n* Believe it or not, I have ordered the duck confit that is listed under Apps as my 2nd or the main course. Now the reasoning being - I love their tuna tartar so much that it makes me so full and so satisfied so easily that I dread ordering one of their main entrees simply because they are good enough but the portions are sizable enough that I loose my appetite. I mean don't get confused by my eating habits and go with what your gut is asking - :o) The Duck Confit still rocks!\n* Beef tenderloin is good too (yes, I have had the main entrees despite my infatuation with T T)\n* And once I was brave enough to not order the T T and instead ordered the Entire roasted duck after having the ravioli. Very impressive indeed!\n* But the entree which is my favorite has to be the colorado rack of lambs. So juicy and so intelligently done. Words can't describe. Again, I cannot eat big portions. But if you can or if you are fasting all day to have a great meal, don't miss out on the rack of lambs. So worth the complete gastric experience!\n\nFinally, take it easy and enjoy every course as slowly as you can. Even if you are a habitual fast eater, try eating slowly for once and see the difference. OK, I have to stop now else I will go on and on...

Delicious bread starts out your meal...it's WICKED doughy but in a good way. My fingers were basically glossed with oil from the bread, also in a good way. And of course by 'good' I mean fattening and harmful to heart health. Whaddup cheerios diet?\n\nSo why only four stars? It hurt me to not give all 5 because I think this place really has potential. They lost a star though on the roasted chicken entree due to a salt assault. Here's my opinion....trust your food and make it tasty...don't rely on spices to complete your meal. Why bother ordering your food when I can just salt a Swiss cake roll for the same taste at a lower price? And that goes the other way for diners--never salt or pepper your food until you've tasted it...that's just rude.\n\nI guess something good did come out of the saltiness though--Ligaya and I were absolutely FORCED to order the Key Lime Creme Brulee to adjust our tastebuds.

The tableside caesar salad was the highlight of the meal with a strong dijon dressing. Our waiter was quite nice but forgot to bring out our appetizer and brought out the steaks pre-sliced despite us requesting they be left intact. The staff was very apologetic and remade our steaks but did little else to correct for this. \n\nMore alarmingly, the steaks themselves were very unimpressive. The NY strip was overly seared and the interior was dry and lacking flavor. The sides were lukewarm and the mashed potatoes dry and not creamy. The baked Alaska and chocolate cake were good but nothing special. \n\nGiven the multitude of options in the Seaport I recommend going elsewhere for dinner.

However, we got into Boston incredibly late due to our flight being delayed 3 times.  Yes, 3 times.  We were all set to board on time when we were told that the FAA delayed the flight by an hour.  An hour came and went, then we were told it would be delayed yet another hour.  Finally, we boarded, taxied out to the runway for take off, when the pilot said we had to go back to the gate because the plane was low on some type of fluid.  An hour after that, we finally took off and had the fastest flight ever to Boston.\n\nWe landed to pouring rain, at this point, past 10 p.m.  After getting to the hotel and being really hungry, the restaurant in the hotel was open until 1 a.m.  So...it was either get a bite there or eat nothing.  We checked into our room, then went to the restaurant.  But I digress.\n\nThis was a Friday night and the restaurant was filled with rowdy people celebrating the Bruins win.  We were seated and given menus, then watched as servers kept passing our table.  My husband asked one if this was her section, she said \"no\".  Finally, my husband found the manager who came to our table, apologized and took our order.  A few minutes after taking our order, a server showed up.  She said that they were short-staffed that night.  That was the only time we saw her.  The manager ended up bringing our drinks and food.  The kitchen was extremely slow.\n\nWe both ordered their turkey sandwich which, in addition to the turkey, consisted of watercress, roasted tomato, baby Swiss cheese and basil mayo.  It was edible but very lackluster.  My husband had a beer while I got a mixed drink.  I can't remember what it was but it was strong.\n\nWhen the manager brought the check and we paid, my husband told him he should keep the tip because he was the one who waited on us.  The manager said that he was going to give it to the server.  I know that restaurants tend to not allow managers to accept tips.  But still...\n\nNormally, if we were seated in a restaurant and no server showed up in a reasonable amount of time, we would just go elsewhere.  However, given the horrible weather and  the late hour, we were a captive audience (of sorts).  This restaurant also serves a weekend breakfast buffet which is expensive.  And, no, we didn't try it.\n\nSo...I would say give this restaurant a pass.  If you stay at the Boston Long Wharf Marriott, this is the restaurant that does room service.

Holy shit. $64 per person, but worth it.\n\nCafe Fleuri's AYCE brunch items are loaded with dishes I cannot pronounce, and this is coming from a guy whose daily vocabulary includes words like spondylolisthesis. If you are going to drop a few Andrew Jacksons, you best come here with 2 things: an appetite and a plan.\n\nAs with any buffet, the goal is to win. The need for an appetite is self-explanatory. Lack of a plan usually leads to the house winning, but if you want to justify your wallet's weight loss, a strategy here is more important than ever.\n\nThe food options are broad, with about 60% appetizers/mains and 40% dessert.  Regular-guy dishes like waffles, french toast, pancakes are readily available. Middle class dishes like eggs benedict, clam chowder, seafood bar are equally represented. Rich-folk dishes include  \"Canadian 'Shrimp Cocktail' with organic baby tomatoes and remoulade\" and \"mozzarella bocconcini, heirloom tomato, basil, sea salt and pesto crostini\" (the names of which I am typing from photograph rather than memory).\n\nDessert options are abundant, and can be divided as above. Regular-guy dishes include rice crispy treats and cookies. Middle-class options include cinnamon beignets, apple cobbler, and a cr\u00eape station. Rich-folk desserts include \"70% valrhona chocolate truffle pop\" and other items for which the names are larger than the serving.\n\nBack to the strategy. Right off the bat, stay away from regular-guy options. Ain't nothing wrong with being a regular guy, but if you are \"Joe from the block\" and droppin' enough dough for a couple pizza pies, you won't make a profit eating bread and chicken nuggets. Now... middle class or rich-folk food? For main courses, go with either. The rich-folk items are small enough that you can sample them, realize you don't have the palate to appreciate them, and not get full. The middle class items are the greatest bang for your buck, especially if you eat seafood.\n\nAs for dessert, definitely stick with the middle class options. Go on, make yourself an apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream. I tried one of their \"chocolate decadence\" cupcakes (I am putting most pastries in the rich-folk category), and the taste was not so decadent, with the cake quite dry. You can go and sample some of these high class dishes, but at this point of the meal, you are probably rationing the space in your stomach. \n\nThe strategy doesn't end there. Focus on protein for the heart of your meal, and save the carbs for dessert. That means avoid the bread and pastas, if possible. \nDon't go nuts with portions of any single dish. If you want to spend this much money on an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert, go to any other restaurant. This is a buffet. Try as much as possible.\n\nOverall, a stunningly beautiful venue in a less-frequented (outside of work) but beautiful part of town, with great service and food (not amazing). One could argue that if you are only in town for one Sunday, this is the place to eat at. \n\nPS: Tim 1, Cafe Fleuri 0.\n\n(^_^) Venue\n(^_^) Service\n(^_^) Options\n(^_-) Taste\n(^_-) Bang for buck\n\nGlad I came.

Even more excited when I spotted on their website that they are a Californian chain and that this was their first outpost in the New England area.  I couldn't wait to try them... but I did, for over a month...\n\nIt is a small spot on Bromfield Street, closer to the Tremont Street side, just a storefront or two down from Silvertone Bar & Grill.  Inside, there are maybe 6 (occupied) tables, a couple of recycle bins and trash bins, a salsa station, and the counter with the lone cash register set on the left.\n\nI placed my order, they asked for my name; credit cards are swiped with an ipod touch/phone and signature made with your finger.\n\nMy order was wrapped to go, I picked up a pre-packed green salsa (verbally advertised as the mild option upon my inquiry), scooped some of the red chunky salsa, and headed off to find someplace to settle down and eat.\n\nBy the time I got there, the salsa that had come wrapped with my tacos had warmed up, so I was glad that I had thought to pick up some additional, which had remained cool in its little plastic container.  My tacos resembled shiny peking ravioli due to the wrapping method.  The fish taco ($2.99) and the potato taco ($2.99) were identical, with the exception of the fried piece of fish being perhaps half the width of the fried potato patty.  After their mini trip, neither were exceptionally crispy, but both retained a hint of crisp.  The potato patty would have been better served immediately consumed on site, while the fish taco may have traveled a bit better.  The cabbage slaw was crisp.  The potato taco was more generously doused with the white sauce, which I think helped it to beat out the fish taco a bit tastewise.\n\nAlso worth noting - this was likely the first time I ate my taco with its double soft corn tortilla... and enjoyed it.  Usually the tortilla is too much, too thick, too coarse, too tough, too fall apart, not tasty, so I delayer my original taco and reassemble it as two new tacos out of the fixings, or simply remove one layer, but this time I consumed it as it was served to me.\n\nTwo tacos made for a decent lunch for $6.35 after tax.\n\nFor future trips, I'm considering the shrimp taco $3.99, lobster taco $4.99, their fresh guacamole $1.69 and chips $1.39, maybe the low carb bowl (steak, salsa, guac, cheese) $4.89, or a burrito (shrimp - $5.99, chicken - $4.99, add potatoes for 79 cents).\n\nPedro's takes credit cards, even Discover, and they take LevelUp - but there isn't an initial purchase bonus, unlike many other LevelUp businesses.  But \"Spend $50, Earn $5\" on LevelUp.\n\nAlso, you can make anything a combo (aka add rice and beans) for $1.79.\n\n*** 1/2013 again ***\n\nI went back for the shrimp taco ($4.24 after tax) after their lunch time rush was gone and over with (2pm or so one fine afternoon's day).  Their dining in area was completely empty, so I went with the eating in option, and was awarded with a silver wrapped ravioli dumpling set upon a tray with some napkins about 5 minutes after ordering.\n\nThe shrimp hiding beneath the generous hill of chlled cabbage shreds were perhaps 5 in number, and they didn't look fried to me - perhaps they were grilled?  I'm not sure.  They weren't large, but they were decent, and meaty, and juicy.  A very good option here.\n\nWith the caveat that the last trip was take out, so they weren't exactly on equal footing, the current order of preference is shrimp, potato, fish.  But this could change after an inhouse tasting of the contenders... who knows...\n\n*** 6/2016 hi stranger! ***\n\nPicked up a potato soft taco $2.99 (crispy hash brown, cabbage, salsa & dressing) to go with my mac & cheese from elsewhere.\n\nTwo corn tortillas that tore as I ate.  Nice and refreshing, especially as a counterpart to the rich cheese in my other dish.

There were 4 varieties of mushrooms in this and I would bet you dinner that they used dried mushrooms hydrated in fish stock because the result was a funky fishy flavor that lingered in my palette for hours after my meal.

We had 11 people and basically every dish was good.  Nothing was bad at all.  The drinks and wines are well worth it.  The hostess was really nice and took our coats without us even asking.  Now for the bad:  Service was not up to standard.  The server (Julio) may have been new on the job or inexperienced.  Lets assume he was new.  \n\n1.He took our appetizers (mussels, calamari and a side of brussels sprouts) and 11 dinner orders.  One of my friends asked what was the starch that came with the lamb and he gave no answer.  Really, he just said Lamb.  So the whole dish was lamb eh?  No, it wasn't.  The starch was risotto.  He never once informed us what the starch was.  My other friend ordered the monkfish (which was the special of the day).  She wanted to know if the monkfish was prepared with a cream sauce (which she didn't want).  Julio said no, its not prepared with a cream sauce.  Well, it was prepared with a cream sauce.  The birthday girl ordered a dish where she wanted to replace something in the fettuccine with vegetables.  She asks Julio what vegetables can they replace it with.  He responds, \" Well what vegetable do you want?\"  What?  We have no idea what you guys had?!  We shot out 3 veggie choices and he said they didn't have them.  On the 4th one, we asked for broccoli rabe and he said we have this but there would be an up-charge.  There was no frustration but we felt we had to dig deep to get options out of our server.  \n2.The entrees came out and it was good!  We chatted and enjoyed our main course.  We then noticed something missing; our appetizers.  They never came out.  We got our servers attention and he went back to the kitchen to bring out the food.  \n3.Now for dessert.  We decided not to get dessert since we bought a cake for the bday girl.  The bday girl's husband brought the cake in before our dinner and the front desk informed him that there is a plating charge of $15-$20 dollars.  He was ok with that.  Well, when Julio took the cake to the back to the kitchen for cutting, he came right back out to tell us the plating fee is now 5 dollars a person. ($55)  Ok, this was new.  This was the first time our group of friends ever sent two friends to the manager to complain about the inconsistent prices for the plating fee.  The manager understood and even took the plating fee off the bill.  We really appreciated it.\n4. When they were SPEED serving the cakes to our table.  One of the servers (probably Julio or one of the bus boys; we were not sure, they were moving so fast) drops a piece of the cake onto my friend's bag and jacket.  They just said sorry and disappeared.  Nobody came to clean it off.  As we sat there, the cake was just sliding off my friend's bag.  This was ridiculous.  As a second time, we went to the front desk to ask if someone can help us.  The same manager (Rita DeAngelo) came over and said sorry and had Julio clean off the cake.  \n5. The bill comes.  We took the total + tax + \"mandatory\" service charge of 18% and divided it evenly.  Half of it was in cash and half of it was in credit cards.  Julio leaves for 15 mins and comes back with our receipts.  My receipt came out right but two of my friends had \"tips of 18% of the total bill\" added onto their portion of the bill.  So just think, paying for your portion of the bill (with tip/tax included) and then adding another 18% tip of the TOTAL bill to that.  He would have had an extra 60 in tips.  I had to walk him through the math to fix it.\n6. As we were walking out, I said to the manager could you just pay attention to the receipts at our table.  I think there may have been some miscalculation.  (I said it in the most respective tone.  I swear.)  Rita says, \"I don't want to hear it.\"  I said look I'm not trying to cause any issues but just please pay attention to the receipts and then she said it again.  \"Yes, I don't want to hear it!\"  She then goes on to complain how they had a bad day and it was busy and didn't need to hear this from us.  There were 3 tables in the restaurant besides us that night.  It was not busy at all!  She then goes and says, \"What do you want me to do about him? (Julio) You want me to take him downstairs and whip him!?\"  I didn't say anything.  I asked for her name and she says Rita DeAngelo, the GM of the Restaurant and we can write anything about her.  She didn't care.  \n\nSo there you have it.  We were respectful.  It was a quiet and calm dinner with hiccups and management embarrassed themselves.  Again, we are fair here.  We know the hospitality business is about servicing people.  However, if you expect to get 18% tip from customers for strictly customer service... well I dont know anymore...  Julio might have been new but Rita forced me to write this as her attitude requires adjustment and she says she didn't care if we wrote the truth about our night at this fine establishment, which is Lucca Back Bay."}]}, "Zest Mediterranean Grille": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 13, "text": "YUM!

No, not that one, and I think this indicates this will take only a minute longer. She finishes up and inquires if we have reservations, walks us to our table and departs with near zero warmth. \n\nThe space, designed by the South End's Office dA, *is* lovely - an organic canopy structure of precisely cut wooden blades carving out a biomorphic topography unlike any Boston restaurant. Nice details too in the tables and flooring, but if you've visited while the space was Banq, you have seen it. Only the bar area in front has appreciable changes. \n\nOur waiter arrives and she is warm and friendly. She explains the concept of small plates and asks us our drink orders. We order a couple of their tamarind margaritas, and she leaves us to our menu. The menu - a floppy laser print that succinctly says \"who meeds a graphic designer? Let's just do this ourselves.\" \n\nOur waiter recommends we order 4 shared plates. We follow her suggestion ordering 4 dishes: some duck meatballs, summer ( or was it spring?) rolls, peanut spareribs, and grilled shrimp with an herby salad. A different waiter or a runner brings us our first plate, the spring roll. It is okay, leaning towards bland, but the sauce walks it up a bit. It would be so nice to have our cocktails with our food. I look to the bar which has had our order for about 15 minutes and there are maybe 4 parties in the dining room and 2 at the bar. What's up? We become distracted by the arrival of the shrimp, this time from our first waiter who apologizes for the delay and promises to look into our drink order. Ahh, finally with the arrival of duck meatballs and the spare ribs. Everything is pretty tasty, including the tamarind margaritas. The spare ribs, were the best of the night. A real lacquered appearance that comes from slow cooking, they had a deep satisfying flavor, but the portion teeters toward the diminutive, and we wish we had ordered 2. Well, 4 plates is not going to satisfy our hunger and we order more. I forget exactly how many but I do remember in the mix were a tea smoked duck and Chinese pancake with roasted plums, and a different take on short ribs. The ribs arrived first and soon thereafter our second set of cocktails. I preferred the peanut spareribs. We've polished off the spareribs and made a sizable dent in the margaritas, but are left wondering where the duck/plums/pancake dish is? We hail our waiter who returns with them. We take bites to discover the dish is cold. Okay flavor in the duck and good flavor in the roasted plumbs but the pancake that might have been palatable 15 minutes ago is worse for the wear and not good. \n\nWe have now shared at least 6 plates and both of us remain hungry. The small plates add up. We order a parfait of black sticky rice, mango and coconut ice cream. It's pretty decent, reminding me of Laotian food.\n\nIn the end our nice waiter does inquire about how we liked our meal and we tell her we liked most everything but the duck/plum/pancake dish was really cold. To Ginger Park's credit we are comped our dessert ($6), I'd find more justice in being comped on the $18 duck dish that arrived cold. \n\nWe've kept our good cheer but both confess we are not impressed. On the way out we pass both of our hosts now off the phone, neither offers a farewell, or thanks.\n\nThe small dish concept adds a host of moving parts to a meal, multiple dishes for each guest, multiplied by the number of guests, and it becomes clear you have to get hot food to the tables quickly. Myers and Chang seem to manage this. The small plate is a bit deceiving too in that it can, on first sight, appear moderately priced but land you with a pretty high tab.\n\nI'll cut some slack for service problems on opening night, but this is by no definition a moderately priced night out, we wound up in the range of Aquitaine and an unsatisfying experience. The hosts are self-absorbed and frosty. The bar moves at a commensurate glacial pace."}]}, "Fisherman's Net": {"reviews": [{"stars": 3.0, "useful": 5, "text": "the New England clam chowda in a sourdough bread bowl wasn't better than Boudin's in San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf, but at least the seafood was fresh. i'm a little biased since i'm from SF. the guy behind the counter was very helpful, but i had to take away a star b/c he's a Patriots and Red Sox fan."}]}, "Woody's Grill and Tap": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 11, "text": "Woody's is the closest thing to the Cheers bar I've ever been.

After all, you can enjoy both, and appreciate the art and history of both (I myself love greasy Chinese American food, as well as real, authentic Chinese food.. they can both be labeled as \"Chinese\" but we all know how different they are).\n\nNow, I'll admit, I was a bit disappointed this place didn't at least have some BBQ sauce in the back for patrons like myself - I'm sure they get asked quite often, so taking feedback and at least having some in situations like these would have been a good business acumen to have.  Therefore, I  was REALLY skeptical when I asked, and all they said was \"no\".  However, the promises of the best Wagyu beef I'll ever have lured me in, hook, line and sinker.  Was it?  Really close.  They do a great job here, and the prices (for Wagyu) is fairly good.  For lunch, six generous pieces (with veggies and noodles) will run you $28.  The pieces were perfectly marbled with fat, and weren't too thin, so you'll be able to enjoy a good portion of the meat.  Most importantly, it isn't FROZEN, which most other shabu places in Boston serve, and was extremely fresh.  The short ribs, a mere $15 for a lunch combo, was also top notch and just as fresh.  Meat is  A++++!\n\nAnother point, is the sauce.  Lots of people complaining about how \"weird\" the sauce is.  I'll admit, after coming from a hardcore fandom of BBQ sauce with my shabu, it took some adjusting for myself too.  But, traditional Japanese shabu uses two staples of sauces - sesame, and ponzu (soy sauce).  The sesame sauce here was fantastic - I was dipping away like no tomorrow.  The ponzu, was a bit sour (I'd have preferred higher quality ponzu, which should have been sweet).  In addition, they provide a few other condiments to mix your core sauces with - spicy oil sauce, scallions, creamy hot mustard and minced radish.  Mixing these all together will create an interesting but tasty sauce.\n\nAs for the veggies, I'll agree with everyone else here.  High quality.  Super yummy.  And after dumping everything into your pot, it makes a hella good soup (it's absolutely bland at first, so skip drinking the soup until at the end of the meal, the way it's supposed to be done traditionally)!  Notably within the veggie platter that comes with the combo, is the japanese yam, japanese cabbage, lotus root, Bunashimeji mushroom and king oyster mushroom.  Unique and very japanese, loved it!  The cabbage especially made the soup extra good, adding a slight sweet flavor.  I do wish they had a small piece of tofu - normally, I'd expect to see it at both a standard hotpot restaurant as well as a Japanese one.  \n\nUdon.  Best I've ever had in Boston, and super comparable to the ones I've had in Japan.  Extra chewy, tasty, amazing.  I must find the source of their vendor.\n\nLastly, layout.  All the real Japanese restaurants I've been to, provide one pot per person.  Even at the table.  THANK YOU.  No longer are the needs to share ONE side of a pot with another person.. and something TWO other people.  Seriously, nothing frustrates me more than cramming six people around a table with one pot that's split into two sections.  You won't have this problem here, although table space is fairly limited, so you may have to end up at the bar.\n\nPHEW.  I wrote a novel, like always.  But again, I feel the public needs to know this poorly misunderstood gem serving rare, authentic Japanese cuisine.  C'mon people, stop being so Westernized.

The problem with Indians reviewing Indian food places is either they expect it to taste just like what their mom would make or if not that then it has to be 'authentic'. Well it doesn't really work that way. The truth is AUTHENTIC FOOD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN TASTY FOOD - two aspects of food most people seem to bundle together. I have grown up eating the most authentic kati rolls ever on the streets of Calcutta where it originated, some have been outstanding and others have been just terrible - yet they are all undeniably 'authentic'. \nChutney's DOES NOT make an authentic kati roll (or wrap), nor is their biryiani  'authentic' but I can tell you they both taste DAMN GOOD! The spinach lamb or chicken has some real flavor and if you pair it with the biriyani - its fabulous!. Their wrap is more of a burrito with spinach lamb or tikka chicken inside - quite like a Indian-Mexican fusion, which I loved! \nThe best part of Chutneys is that you can customize everything with the toppings and veggies and the sauces they have. So you can build something up to suit your taste. I load up on my favorite sauces, throwing in some mint chutney, some fiery habanero and cilantro with some curd-sauce to temper the heat and its out of this world! \nIn the end, who cares if it is authentic or not, give me good, fresh, a nice blend of Indian spices that really jump out, each with its original tone and I will call it Indian any day and enjoy it to the fullest. Chutneys does exactly that -in no way do they claim that they serve 'authentic Indian food' (I would have deducted a star if they did) - but they serve up good, fresh, honest food with bright flavors that street food should have. Authentic Indian Food aficionados would probably disown me for this, but sorry, traditionalists, give me good tasting innovative 'pseudo-Indian' food any day over really badly prepared, tasteless, 'authentic' Indian food and I am happy."}]}, "The Bebop": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 12, "text": "Stay far away from this place. It is dangerous. Let me start by saying that I don't drink and haven't had a drink in 29 years. On Aug. 8 2017, myself and another middle aged mom from Palo Alto California were in Boston visiting our teenagers who were finishing a 5 week summer program at Berklee school of music. Two of their friends were performing at this restaurant and we took our children to sit at a table outside and listen to their young peers perform. So just to be clear, two suburban moms, two teenagers listening to two teens play folksongs on acoustic guitars. No one was drinking any alcohol. I don't drink and my friend may have had one glass of wine with dinner several hours earlier. We wanted some cokes and fries. But we never got a chance to order cokes, because within moments of us sitting down, the bouncer came over and was just incredibly rude. He was just super aggressive and rude and accusing us of \"taking up tables and not getting anything,\" in an incredibly aggressive voice and demeanor.\n\n Apparently my Hillary Clinton hat set him off, because he (I am not making this up) leaned over the table toward me and yelled \"are you going to eat or drink or just sit here and take chairs\" very confrontationally and I said, I\"d have a Diet Coke and my friend tried to order some fries. The Bouncer then continued to in a very angry voice yell something about our chairs and then said \"do you have a problem\" and I repeated that I would like a coke and I would like to hear the music. He said \"You can't just come here with your Hillary Clinton hat\" (my baseball hat). I was like \"What?\" This is crazy, and I can't hear the music. \n\nI decided he was nuts so I went inside to hear the music rather than engage with him. I tried to get my son to come in but he stayed outside with his friend. I went inside and tried again to order a coke from the bartender. I wanted to hear the children play their songs but before long there was a commotion outside. Now the bouncer was attacking another patron (not in our group) physically and flipped the table over. That guy apparently also failed to order enough food. IDK. At that point, my friend's daughter was crying hysterically, my son was panicking, and my friend and I tried to complain to the manager that the bouncer was behaving badly. She promised to address it and buy us drinks. \n\nI asked if I could bring my son inside and have him sit with me and she said yes. I went to get him and he was afraid of the bouncer, but I said no it's fine the manger (a blond Irish woman wearing a T-shirt from the Burren, another bar owned by the same owner) told me we can just come inside and we can avoid this guy. So I persuaded my son that we could go inside but the bouncer tried to physically block us from entering and cursed at me. My son then tried to protect me, and then the bouncer basically launched himself at me and my 5'4\" 120 lb teenage son and I had to try to protect each other from this man, who was over 6' and probably 250 lbs with a very large neck and meaty face. It was bizarre. The whole time it was happening I was thinking, this is insane, I just wanted to get a diet coke and listen to these kids play their folksongs and now I am being attacked by a maniac who hates Hillary Clinton. \n\nI wrestled my kid away from him. Now all the kids were sobbing, my friend was calling the police, and the manager even though this happened literally in front of her face refused to send this employee home or to otherwise defuse the situation. By now a crowd of teens from Berkelee were there watching this debacle and saying that they felt unsafe and couldn't be inside the establishment. \n\nI have never experienced anything like this. Now my finger is probably broken, my wrist hurts, and my elbow is scraped. The police were called, and took a report. The whole thing was completely insane. It was like from a bad movie. I'm glad we weren't beaten and killed. \n\nI've been to the actual Burren in Ireland and to many many pubs all over Ireland and never have I experienced anything remotely like this. It was shocking. It was violent. It was uncalled for. Again, two suburban moms from the SF Bay and their teens trying to hear some folk music played by other kids ended in a violent attack by a bouncer over the fact that he hates Hillary Clinton hats.\n\nI never got to order food so I can't evaluate that."}]}, "Blue Dragon": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 10, "text": "Normally when you see an Asian restaurant review on Yelp you should probably skip over the ones by the white guys.

A brand new theater opening in Boston is a big deal, particularly one opening right at the Garden. \n\nAt first, I thought perhaps they simply aren't ready for prime time, but the company itself despite having the self-proclaimed ethos being well thought out are anything but. \n\nLet me walk you through the issues as I experienced them. \n\n#1 The App - I downloaded the app and to my surprise, the Boston location isn't even an option. You have to use the website, fine. Not ideal, but whatever. \n\n#2 The Website - The Website is designed fairly poorly. A slight upgrade over GeoCities only made worse by the maintenance of the showtimes on the website. I wanted to see a movie on New Year's Eve and as of Friday the 27th of December, no showtimes were available. \n\n#3 Phone - I tried calling ArcLight Boston to see when showtimes would become available, but there is no Boston number. Instead, there is a central hub that answers all of their calls. I stayed on hold for entirely too long and when I reached someone he claimed that all theater showtimes are updated on Sundays. I asked why the Hollywood, CA theater (which the website defaults to when you refresh the page) had showtimes through Wednesday, he said that theater was the only exception. \n\n#4 Showtimes - For some reason I checked the site again on Sunday and what did I see? Showtimes had become available. I would say I was fortunate that I checked early, but the theater was nearly completely empty the day of. Regardless, it was frustrating to be told one thing (that sounded a bit ridiculous) only to confirm through my own efforts that it wasn't accurate. \n\n#5 Locating the theater - We had to ask around as there wasn't great signage showing where the theater was located. ArcLight must have spent millions of dollars putting a theater in North Station, but couldn't get signage as part of the deal? You would think, once you know where it is it won't be a problem, but I don't think they're going to get much repeat patronage. \n\n#6 Printing Tickets - I went to the kiosk to print out my tickets with the card I used to purchase the tickets. The kiosk was unable to print out my tickets and said to go to the ticket counter. I asked an employee where the ticket counter was and she was confused and directed me back towards the kiosks, despite me explaining the situation at the kiosk. She then proceeded to try and print out tickets, which took her entirely too long. At least 5 minutes. \n\n#6 The Bar - The Bartender was very nice, but seemed a bit in over her head. There were two other patrons getting a drink when we arrived, and two others who arrived after us. It probably took her about 10-12 minutes to make the drinks and charge each group for them. What made matters worse is that she would make a set of drinks and rather than charge the group immediately, she started on the next set of drinks, making each group wait before they could go to their movie. \n\n#7 The Heat - It felt like a furnace at the theater. I've never gone to a theater and felt like the heat was on and it felt like it was on blast. It was hot in the lobby and it was hot in the theater as well. \n\n#8 - The Seating - Millions of dollars spent and they made a terrible decision with the chairs. They aren't remotely comfortable and are entirely too small. If you're an average adult, your legs are almost certainly going to hang off the end of the recliner. In the age of modern theaters, these are by far the worst chairs I've seen. To make matters worse, finding your seat is a pain as they've made it as difficult as possible to ascertain which row is which at least in the room we were in. The bass kickers in the seat were weak and felt like more of a distraction than anything else. There is also no elbow room to speak of.\n\n#9 - Audio/Video - Others have complained that the audio system isn't great. And it isn't. I went to an Atmos-enabled room and I'm surprised that Dolby has signed off on this. The audio quality was quite poor. The widescreen was underwhelming as was the projection. After seeing Dolby Vision projectors at AMC in Assembly. I know that Dolby Cinema is exclusive to AMC in the US, but you would think they would have put in at least a 4K laser projector. \n\nI just don't see the value in this theater. Its location isn't quite as convenient as the AMC in Boston Common. It isn't as quaint as the theater in Somerville. It's not as impressive as the theater in Assembly Row or as I would guess the new theater in the Seaport. \n\nI can't imagine this theater will be successful given how much it must cost to rent the space. They've oddly gone for quantity over quality and when that fails, they will simply end up marking up the ticket prices and at that point, people will just go to the Common AMC."}]}, "Hilton Boston Back Bay": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 17, "text": "After a terrible Hilton experience in Portsmouth, NH, we were given a Hilton free stay pass to any Hilton in the US to give them another shot.

First of all, it is a huge dish for an appetizer (don't expect to graze across this menu, since every dish is quite large).  Although the concept is appealing, fresh corn surrounded by a crispy fried crust, this dish takes an exciting, seasonal ingredient, and basically hides it, wilted inside a fairly heavy crust\n\nSEE EW (BEEF): Wide rice noodle stir-fried with egg, Chinese broccoli and black soy sauce ($10.95)\n~Also available with chicken, tofu or shrimp, this was my favorite dish, with tender beef, a smokey dark flavor and slightly chewy noodles\n\nCHICKEN SATAY: Served with peanut/ cucumber relish ($9)\n~Not the typically small skewered grilled meat, this was a large dish with no skewers in sight.  The chicken was flavorful and tender and served with rice and assorted steamed veggies.  The peanut sauce wasn't the fake tasting stuff from a can that most Thai restaurants serve.  A good deal for the price, it would make a nice lunch by itself.  Brown or sticky rice can be substituted \n\nTHAI ICED TEA: ($3.50)\n~Nice, not too sweet, served in a big Mason jar mug\n\nHOMEMADE ICE CREAM IN A CUP: \"Flavor of the Week\", no artificial ingredients, 3.8 oz ($2.75)\n~Mutiple flavors were available, so we tried two.  Strawberry had a good fruit flavor, whereas Green Tea was very strongly flavored, unlike the weak versions served at most Asian restaurants.  However, the ice cream was served at a much too cold temperature, which hurt its flavor/creaminess and made it difficult to eat with the supplied small wood spoons\n\nAn attractive, although small interior, perhaps a bit loud (thanks to an awful sound track in the background).  You can either order takeout at the counter, and there is table service as well.

We could not even see what was going on, on the dance floor. \n\nThe meal was a buffet. They called each table to get their food one at a time. While we were standing in line, some guy said, \"please stand in a single line\" but in a rudely manner. \"Please\" does not make everything polite, it's the tone. Then the chef (found out later he was the main chef, seriously?), a tall african american guy walked out of the buffet area and screamed at us \"Can you please move!?\" My sisters and I were all shocked at his nasty manner.

At least it was for us when we were up for a late night snack. \n\n  Felcaro Pizza is diagonally across from the Beacon Hill Wyndham where we were staying on Cambridge Street. If you are unfamiliar with Cambridge Street it is the busy arterial that divides Beacon Hill from the West End and connects Cambridge with downtown Boston. In the vicinity of the Beacon Hill Wyndham, Cambridge Street is devoid of activity on a late weeknight in Boston. The CVS has long closed for the night. When you are by this hotel and Massachusetts General Hospital, a late night pizzeria and sub shop is golden. \n\n  When we were walking west on Cambridge Street hoping that the further CVS by the station was open, we came across Felcaro. In addition to Felcaro being the cure for a late night snack attack, it would bestow me with one more chance to eat and savour that delicious Boston pizza that is rare where I live in Las Vegas. For sure, the slice of pizza that went for around $3 and 16 ounce bottle of soda exceeding $2 was inflated; but it was worth it. It wasn't the best but at the time I ate it in the  late night for those minutes it was. Although it is considered Boston style pizza, the slice was identical to the New York slice that I grew up with. There was zero difference in the thin slice, marinara sauce, and melting cheese. Just like the New York slice of pizza that molded me into a life long pizza lover, I couldn't have only one. I'd return to the counter for a second. \n\n    Where my brother and I seemed to have the northernmost sidewalk of Beacon Hill (Cambridge Street) to ourselves, we shared Felcaro Pizza with several night owls. There was a constant line to the counter and the pizzeria was close to filling up. The clientele ranging from college kids to seniors created a moderate to loud noise level. If I wanted to listen to a professional sports broadcast on the TV that hung from the brick wall or to the right of the counter, it would be hard to hear. Felcaro was more about the scent of taste than hearing. \n\n   When we left Felcaro it was a much closer walk to the hotel than it would of been from the CVS by the station if it was even open.

For about $40 you get a meal for four.  And this is a meal for four hungry people.  Maybe three bottemless-pit-stomach people could finish it off, but otherwise you will be leaving some food on the table.  Call 24 hours in advance and treat yourself with three friends.  You'll look awesome and they will all buy you drinks in return.  You will end up turning a profit on the whole night after looking like a hero and getting your tummy filled.  If you don't believe me, just try it.\n\nBut I'm going to veer away for a second and talk about something other than the duck.  I'm going to talk about the staff.  It all started when I decided I was craving duck so my lunch companions and I decided to pick a date.  I called to make a reservation for 8 and asked how many I could add on if we found more duck lovers.  I was met with a giggle and being told \"as long as you have less than forty friends, we can fit all of your friends!\".  Well touche, China King, touche.  Needless to say, I accepted the challenge and called back no less than five times over the next three days until our group was up to 23 people and six ducks.  There can be a bit of a barrier, but the frequent phone calls always ended in laughter.\n\n\nSo my group rolled in and I may have been the last to show.  We were split into two tables and then began the gloriousness.  Out came dumplings and scallion pancakes before the entire duck was presented.  My favorite moment may have been when someone leaned over and whispered \"well, what do we do when they just hand us that thing?\".  But fear not, duck virgins.  While I don't think we would have objected to a whole duck being handed over, you are instead served courses of deliciousness.\n\nSo first there's the tacos.  I never knew you were supposed to paint the hoisin sauce onto the tacos with the scallions; BRILLANT!  So you're telling me I can play with my food, eat with my hands, and it involves all the duck meat I want?  And tacos?! AND DUCK SKIN?!!!!! That, my friends, is how we describe glory.\n\nAnd then there is the stir fry.  I previously thought nothing could rival my love of duck tacos.  Then I was introduced to duck stir fry with homemade udon noodles. Ask the staff nicely and just do it.  Seriously: DO IT.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is the duck soup.  A duck broth is made from the character you just ingested.  Tofu is added and, apparently, some bones are left in for a lighter finish to your delicious dinner.\n\n\nEven while serving 20 increasingly intoxicated people, the staff did nothing but smile.  Everything was brought out with efficient timing (I bet no one else noticed that, did ya?) and water glasses stayed full when we decided to hydrate ourselves responsibly.  They even served up a jokingly requested duck head to Damien S.  Note to self: China King doesn't joke about duck heads; ask and thee shall recieve!\n\n\nThe icing on the cake was when I got a hug goodbye. The cherry on top was when I called today to make a reservation far in advance (it really was THAT good), and not only did they recognize my voice but knew my name.

We wouldn't have come here as it wasn't on the main drag except that there was an accident in the sewer that day and the main drag was mostly blocked by the police, so we ended up at Villa Francesca.\n\nWe were in college and were going out to eat a lot and she had spent a lot on airfare so we wanted to be economical.  There was a lobster risotto we wanted for $24 so to make up for that we ordered a cheap mushroom ravioli and drank water and split desert with no appetizer.  When we ordered the risotto the waitress said they didn't have it, but that it was one of their specials and was that ok?  I shrugged wondering why she bothered to say anything.\n\nUntil the bill came, It was a really nice meal.  The food, I thought, was good and the waitress was good if a little pretentious- I even complimented her on her earrings because they were fab.  It had good ambiance and it was packed.  Then the bill came and they had charged us $32 for the lobster risotto.  I pulled the waitress aside and said that she had made a mistake.\n\nHer response?  She scoffed, said, \"I told you it was one of the specials,\" rolled her eyes and walked away.  My jaw dropped.  I waited until she passed by again and asked for the manager.\n\nThe manager came by and got into a 15 minute argument with us and yelled at us.  English was not his first language and that may have had part to do with why he got so worked  up, but booooy did he get worked up.  He told us that it was a good price for what we had gotten (and it probably was, it was a whole lobster on rice) and I explained that that wasn't the point, it was that the menu was misleading.\n\nHe told me that the owner would never let him give it to me for that price- I asked to speak to the owner who he claimed wasn't there and I said that I doubt the owner would think it was worth $8 to alienate a customer- and finally I said that I was never eating there again and that I would tell all my friends never to eat there.  And after so much arguing I pulled out my card and said \"it's not worth it.\"  He told me angrily, \"Fine!  But then it's coming out of her tip!\" pointing to the waitress, who had protested a few times during our argument, \"I told you it was one of the specials!\"  I told them both that they needed to either change the menus, or he needed to train his waitstaff how to deal with it better and that it was his fault, not hers.\n\nI repeated \"It's not worth it\" a few times holding out my card.\n\nI guess that's where the language barrier came into play because he seemed to think I meant that the food wasn't worth it, and apparently this mortally offended him, when what I really meant was that it wasn't worth arguing.  I was already never coming back.\n\nAt that he said, \"Fine, it's not worth it!\" and stomped away.\n\nI tipped the waitress 15% anyway because it must suck to have a manager like that, but now looking back on it I probably shouldn't have because she was kind of a bitch, too.\n\nAfter that incident I thought about it and reported them to the Better Business Bureau.  I love them- they take every complaint seriously and are very diligent.  They tried several times to get into contact with the owner and found that he was completely non-responsive.\n\nGee, I'm shocked.  All I had asked was for a refund of my $8 and, more importantly, that they change their menus.

From the food prices and the cocktail selection, to the suspiciously affordable wine and even the warm service, there is a level of consistency and experience here pretty much unheard of at this price point.\n\nThough you can certainly have a better meal in this city, Post 390 offers some interesting items worth checking out, like a huge (like, embarrassingly giant) Kobe beef hot dog, Plymouth succotash, beer-and-bacon mac n' cheese, and sour cream biscuits. Some of the more basic items miss the mark. The calamari, for instance, is overly salted, greasy and rubbery in texture.

There's no denying it.  If you spend any amount of time in Pizza Shuttle, you will see among the customers more local flavor than you could ever get on a pizza.  \n \nA man with a bag full of nips once told me to never start drinking or do drugs. He then went on a paranoid tirade about he knows my parents (who live in Maine, by the way) and knows what they think of him and that's why they sent me down to pick up the pizza instead of coming to get it themselves. I once saw a man in his 60's hitting on some teenage girls, which actually wouldn't seem overly strange if not for the fact that they seemed to be flirting back. Then there are the men who I see coming in from the door next to Pizza Shuttle which simply has the words \"Private Club\" on it in stick-on letters.  \n \nAll of that, though, does not change the fact that Pizza Shuttle is my go-to pizza place.  Other more well-known places may be within walking distance of my house, but 99 times out of 100, I'll go to Pizza Shuttle.  The pizza, first of all, is delicious.  The dough is very tasty and just thick enough to hold up the toppings without everything sliding off when you try to pull it apart.  They have a good selection of toppings and specialty pizzas, too.  We usually get the spinach and garlic pizza, which is great and really packed with flavorful garlic.  \n \nAlso, love the fries.  Anywhere else we go for pizza, it's usually just the pizza, we rarely even mention the idea of getting fries, too.  But one day we tried Pizza Shuttle's fries, which were crunchy and well-seasoned and just as greasy as you would want your fries to be.  Now, every time we order pizza we have to decide between the fatty choice of getting a greasy pizza or the super tubbo choice of a greasy pizza and a giant order of fries (there is only one size, and it's huge).  There is often some hemming and hawing, some \"Should we get fries?  I don't know... okay, let's just get them,\" like it's some kind of special splurge, just this once.  But the truth is, we make the same decision almost every time.  \n\nThere is one benefit to getting the fries beyond just the fact that they are excellent.  Pizza Shuttle has a $15 minimum on credit card purchases, but most of their pizzas are under $15.  So if you want to go but don't have any cash?  Fries cost just enough to get it over that threshold.  It's like some kind of devious trick!  A delicious, delicious devious trick. \n \nFinally, as I've mentioned before, I like when people I don't know call me \"my friend.\"  I don't know what it is about it, but it's very endearing, and some of the guys here do that.  They are very nice, and even though they are all a little hard to understand, they always have a smile.  I usually call in my order for pickup, and when I show up to pick up the pizza, they immediately know who I am.  Someone usually catches my eye as soon as I walk in the door (I know my pizza is done when I walk in because all I can smell is garlic) and they have my pizza sitting on the counter before I can even walk up there to pay for it. \n\nI really like Pizza Shuttle.  Come here for great, cheap pizza and fries.  Do not come here for something upscale or healthy.

He then pulled out a jumbo orange pill container filled with gray-colored orbs that had \"One-a-day\"  etched into them.

I asked the worker what red rice was. The guy showed me the rice and I noticed there were colorful specs inside. I asked him what they were and him and the workers had no idea how to explain it to me. One of the girls was literally so nervous she pulled in another worker and she ran away. Like how are you serving food but have no idea what you're serving? I'm assuming they're just bits of veggies.\n\n2. Toppings  - They should really list out all the toppings that they have available instead of saying \"Power, anti-aging, etc.\". Labelling toppings like doesn't really help me choose. I would probably suggest them to list out the toppings and list the benefits underneath. (ex: Red Beets: Power). \n\n3. Sauce - You know how some salsas are chunky with lots of tomato and onion chunks inside? That's how the sauces are. You are able to mix sauces together if you like.

I had a jean jacket on and at one point he was holding it by the collar and practically choking me. I told him he was hurting me and asked him repeatedly to let me go, as I was capable of walking myself out.

It comes with a ginger fish sauce which you can dip the chicken into to add saltiness. \n\nAnother popular menu item is Bo Ne or Napoleon beef. This is a very popular dish in Vietnam. It's usually a brunch item but can be eaten any time of the day. Because it is expensive to get good quality beef in Vietnam, you will see minced beef or other variation or cuts of meat in Vietnam.

During family hour, everyone will smile at you, while during non-family hours, you'll get a mix of leers and smiles if you bring a woman or are a woman.  It's really not a gringo place and we've never seen non-Central Americans when we've come here, so that's probably why they stare at us (maybe worried?).  But never mind that.  You're here for the food!\n\nHere's where i tell you what to order and what to avoid.  You CANNOT go wrong with the tacos.  While the chicken and beef tacos were terrific, the real star was the beef tongue tacos.  Tongue is EXTREMELY easy to mess up.  I'm very particular when it comes to eating tongue and usually only order from kosher delis.  But I was adventurous and for $2, it wasn't a big risk to try.  AMAZING!  A friend tried it and was also blown away.  The cheese papusas are amazing.  I tried the jalapeno chicken last time.  The chicken was flavorful and grilled to perfection, and the accompanying sauce was spicy but terrific.  The boy once again order his beef soup, which is also delicious.  Our friend ordered some steak dish (I forget which), and it was also absolutely delectable.  The sangrias are perfect, not too sweet and not too dry, and they let it sit long enough where all the fruit absorb the sangria liquid... I've never been anywhere that you can pick up the grapes, bite into it and taste wine.\n\nAs far as what not to order?  No clue.  Everything has been amazingly tasteful so far.\n\nThe priciest thing on the menu is the salmon at $12.  I'll work my way there one day.\n\nThe location is in kind of an odd place.  Middle of nowhere and walking by, you'd never know that such a phenomanal restaurant lies within.\n\nService is outstanding.  I know others have mentioned they don't know English.  Nonsense!  Everytime we've gone, the waitresses have spoken nearly perfect English to us, much better English than many other places around the Boston area, where you'd expect they'd speak English.  The waitresses are so helpful and really keen on making sure everyone's happy."}]}, "Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 11, "text": "My last day I was looking for a delicious place to end my trip.

I was then told that they were out of Coors and almost every other draft beer, but that I was welcome to have a $6 bottle of Budweiser or Bud Light. Don't get me wrong, I will gladly drink a Budweiser, I just refuse to pay $6 for one when I can get a pitcher for that much at nearby establishments.

There has been so much hype surrounding its Boston opening and I honestly wish I had done ANYTHING else with my night.\n\nI went to the restaurant with 3 other friends.  When we were first brought into the dining room we were sat next to a table of 3 screaming children when there were obviously a great deal of other open tables.  We politely asked to be relocated without trying to embarrass the father and when we were brought to another table, a nearby waiter (unfortunately, soon-to-be ours) scoffed and made a rude comment about picky customers under his breath.  I understand that asking to move somewhere other than where you're seated is annoying, but we shouldn't have been brought to that neighboring table in the first place.\n\nAfter being sat at a table without napkins or silverware, our waiter brought 4 menus over.  That's when I realized it was so dark I couldn't see mine.  My 3 friends had similar complaints and we were all nose-to-menu to try to read it.  After our waiter had been away from the table for 90 seconds he returned, \"Do you need more time?\"  Um...yes.  Another 45 seconds, and...he was back!  This guy could not take a hint.  He was overly chatty and then annoyed when we still weren't ready to order.  He also seemed high out of his mind.  I also was not under the impression that we got the \"dud\" waiter.  On a number of occasions I saw at least 8 or 9 waiters standing in a group, not doing anything and blocking the restrooms.  Management - GET YOUR TEAM CONTROL.  They should not be lingering in the dining room, it makes your customers think they're not working...which they weren't.\n\nA waiter (not ours) came over to fill our water glasses and dumped half of his pitcher on my leg and completely soaked my bag.  Now, I know it's a risk I take by putting my bag on the floor under my chair....but he didn't even apologize, all he said was, \"wow, I guess that happens to me a lot.\"  Really???\n\nWe placed our order and relatively quickly, our appetizer was brought over.  The table still did not have napkins or silverware.  Our waiter did not notice, and I had to flag down someone else to bring us some.  When our entrees were delivered, all but one were brought and no excuse or reason was offered as to why there were 3 out of our 4 orders on the table.  3 minutes later when I had seen our waiter enter and exit the kitchen with no sign of my friend's dinner, I called another waiter (the third we had dealt with at this point) over to check on her food.  He returned a minute later with it.\n\nThe food was fine.  Nothing spectacular (again, what's with the hype?), but filling I guess.\n\nWe told our waiter (the terrible one) at the beginning of the night that we were on our way to a movie and would like to order dessert as soon as he dropped the meals.  He delivered our entrees and ran away, without the dessert order in hand.  After flagging him down (there has been a lot of flagging at this point) and giving him our dessert order, we finished our entrees and they were cleared.  4 desserts were brought over, and 3 of them were ours.  The fourth, was not what we had ordered, and belonged, coincidentally, to the same friend whose dinner had been forgotten in the kitchen.  Bummer.  We waited another 2 minutes for her actual dessert to be brought out.\n\nThe desserts were not good.  The apple waffle was not warm and quite bland.  The dessert pizza, while topping-heavy, did not interest me and left two of my friends feeling ill.  The tiramisu, while we were impressed with the plate, was uneventful.  The egg rolls were far too heavy and plated in a way that you couldn't possibly not get messy with them.  All around, not impressed.\n\nAt this point in the meal our waiter came over and, point blank, said \"Hey guys, our computers just went down a little while ago, so, uh, we can only take cash...\"  This, to me, is unacceptable, especially in a city where so many people depend solely on plastic.  I've worked in restaurants and retail stores and I can promise you there is ALWAYS a back-up system.  Telling a table that \"cash is preferred, as our computer system is down and processing credit cards will take a while\" is ok to say.  Telling the table that it is out of the question is completely irrational.  All restaurants have back up systems.  What would they have done if I came in with only a credit card?  Made me wash dishes to pay off my tab??  The way our waiter approached the situation was completely unprofessional and just another mark on their painfully new and untrained staff.\n\nWe were given our bill, paid (in cash) and were getting up to leave.  The aisles between tables are not roomy to say the least and our waiter burst through our group to grab our bill and then complained that we only left a $10 tip (false) to another waiter.  I was appalled at this behavior and that his manager deemed it acceptable.\n\nI walked out of Max Brenners not only disappointed but angry."}]}, "Orinoco": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 13, "text": "We're moving soon, and as we entertain a new bed, she's into the idea of an upholstered sleigh looking thing in neutral linen, with a footboard that's functional and comfortable.\n\nI want to take a Pepito de Costillita, the $8 passionfruit-glazed, boneless baby back rib sandwich, under a handful of vinegar slaw and pickled red onion - fluff it up with bacon wrapped, almond stuffed datile pillows, and spend eight hours a day sleeping on it.\n\nBecause, really, this lunch is comfort defined.

You'd think that if they know a group of 20 is coming and making me pay $70 in planning fees, they might remind us to come a little earlier on in the day so we could at least keep buying drinks and play some of the few games that were not out of commission.\n\nIt was just a huge bummer, because its in a cool location and the space itself is neat and seems like it could have a lot of promise if they just gave the most minimum of a shit at maintaining it (shocking given its only 1-2 months old how totally broken it was).\n\nDon't think I'll be going back anytime soon.

My bad - I didn't see a sign on the door that specified a certain level of pretentiousness was required.

The tomatoes were just from the store. I wouldn't order this again. \n\nBruschetta Napoletana (grilled country bread, brushed with olive oil, topped with garden tomatoes, basil and fresh mozzarella, $8.50) - this dish missed the mark. The bread needed to be toasted more, or better yet pan fry it in oil. Mozz was low quality and basil was stingy with basil. I wanted to return this dish. \n\nInsalata del giardino (a medley of fresh seasonal greens, garden tomatoes, onions, olives and served with house dressing, $6.50) - my friend ordered it and liked it, but how hard is it to screw up salad?\n\nGnocchi al Pesto (gnocchi tossed with a pesto sauce, made with fresh basil, pine nuts, olive oil and parmiggiano cheese, $15.75) - yuck. No flavor and texture was way off. Definitely not house made. Dish came out on the cold side of lukewarm. I wanted to return it. \n\nTortellini Quattrocento Formaggi (tortillini in a rich cheese sauce of Romano, mozzarella, bel paese and parmiggiano cheese, $15.75) - I totally think this is the same exact tortellini found in the Costco frozen food section... It came out at room temperature. I totally wanted to call them out on using frozen tortellini. \n\nMelanzane alla Parmigiana (baked eggplant layered with mozzarella and Romano cheese in a light tomato sauce, $16.25) - this dish came out cold (the eggplant was cold, the cheese was hot). I didn't like it at all.\n\nTotal for 3 of us was $79.20 + 10.00 for 2 beers + 6.00 for pellegrino + 6.66 tax + 15.00 tip = 116.86 total. \n\nSome quotes from our table:\n\"This is the worst Italian food I've ever had.\"\n\"I'm Chinese and I could make better Italian food.\"\n\"I seriously need to detox tomorrow.\"\n\"Let's go purge.

To start, she mentioned that she was having a rough morning. Possibly she was trying to be funny, however this is something as a customer that I don't want to hear about. We ordered the Mimosa tower. The tower that she poured our mimosas into was broken. Instead of getting a functional tower, she taped the top shut with masking tape. Not ideal, but not the end of the world either. \nOur party paid as we went with cash instead of on a credit card. She gave us a disgusted look when we paid/tipped her for the first tower. We proceeded to order a second Mimosa tower, but for this tower we asked to lighten up on the OJ and put a little bit of cranberry juice in it instead. Upon paying for this tower, the bartender made a snide remark about how much we left for tip. She essentially called our party \"cheap\" because we didn't leave 20% tip on an $80 tower, yet we she was inattentive the entire time we were there. She stated that she went \"out of her way\" to take out the soda gun to put some cranberry juice in the tower (a pretty basic task if you ask me). Even if she felt negatively about the lack of tip she thought she deserved, there are more professional ways to bring it to the attention of the customers rather than calling them cheap (i.e, asking the customers what she could have done better, asking for feedback about the service, etc).\n\nThe whole situation was unfortunate because we were going to stay for an extended period of the afternoon to watch the 1 PM football games, and we were planning to order food and more drinks. It was for sure a lost opportunity due to a poor attitude. \n\nThe manager on staff handled the situation appropriately and offered to find us a table away from the bar so we could finish our overpriced mimosa tower. We would have stayed longer, but we were all disgusted by how we were treated and how this bartender handled the situation. I am not one to write reviews (no matter how good or bad the experience), however this one was one I had to share because it was so disappointing. \n\nThere are so many options to choose from in the neighborhood, therefore I will have to reconsider the destination the next time I visit town."}]}, "Blue Yama": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 10, "text": "If you are looking for a restaurant that has inexpensive lobster yet doesn't skimp on the quality, Blue Yama is your place.

The night started off with a friendly greeting from the hostess who was very forward with us about the two hour wait. We decided it was worth waiting for because we have lived in the area for the last 9 months, anxiously awaiting the opening since construction started. The hostess asked for my number and entered into their system, letting us know we would get a text to confirm the check in. The text also included a link to MyTableUp, which allowed us to view the number of parties in front of us as well as wait times. I personally love expectation setting, so I very much appreciated it.\n\nKnowing we would be waiting for up to 2 hours, we headed down to the lower bar to grab a drink. In case you aren't aware, the restaurant is laid out across two floors with a bar on each. The upper floor is more of a traditional setup with a huge center bar and high top tables surrounding it. As you walk downstairs, the lower floor has more of a restaurant vibe. It's slightly quieter and there is more seating with a very attentive wait staff going table to table. Both floors are nicely decorated -- you can tell the owners did not skimp on any of the details.  Huge flat screen TVs are all over the place for patrons to watch games, good music is playing in the background and everything is super clean.  The lower floor also has really cool exposed brick with subway tile and more of an industrial look.\n\nOK so back to our experience on the lower floor... We started by ordering a drink standing at the bar. After about 20 minutes (Dorset Hall was absolutely packed the entire time we were there so I would imagine all patrons had this experience), the couple sitting in front of us at the bar left and kindly let us know we could grab their seats. As soon as we sat down, the bartender asked what he could get us from drinks to food. We started with another drink and then checked the app for wait time -- still 14 tables ahead of us, but down from 19 to start. Knowing we still had some time, we ordered the mussels. They came out within 10 minutes and they were AMAZING. We opted for the red sauce but white was also an option. Not only were they delicious but the portion size was massive... Little did we know, this would be the theme for the night, delicious and substantial meals.\n\nAbout halfway into our mussels, I received a text that our table was ready (roughly 90 minutes from arriving). We decided to stay at the bar to order dinner since we already had the mussels, prime seating in front of the Bruins game and an awesome bartender.  After the mussels, we ordered our meals -- I got the steak tips and my girlfriend got the fish tacos. And delicious and massive, so big that we boxed up half of each meal to take home.\n\nEven though we were stuffed, my girlfriend insisted on the brownie sundae to end the night. And it was well worth it!\n\nAfter spending almost 2.5 hours at Dorset Hall in total, we paid the bill and headed home. Our entire bill was sub $100 which was a pleasant surprise. We are used to eating downtown and easily paying over $100, so we almost couldn't believe how great the service and food was for under that amount.\n\nWe will certainly be back and have already recommended Dorset Hall to a few friends within the last hour!"}]}, "Great Taste": {"reviews": [{"stars": 1.0, "useful": 3, "text": "Horrible!!

The meat tender enough, and the collard greens wet and overcooked with dry bits of meat, but okay on the whole.\n\nI ordered the Double Tasty $11.75 so that I could sample both their brisket and pork belly on one visit.  Both had some fat layered in there, but not overly so.  The belly was preferred.  Their bbq sauce was a good non-spicy option, and their pickles and onions helped to make the meal a tad healthier.  Their onions were surprising mild.\n\nGenerally, the Double Tasty is served with 2 meats, a hot & a cold side, pickles, raw onions, & bbq sauce, but they will allow a double portion of a side.\n\nI sampled a few other items on another visit, and found that I preferred the potato salad over the cole slaw for their cold side options.  The mac & cheese was pretty good, and their bbq brisket quite tender and tasty.  I didn't try the broccoli, but they were a beautiful vibrant green.\n\nSo in terms of their meat, I recommend the bbq chopped brisket, then pork belly, and last but not least - the brisket.\n\nAs for their desserts, I had their banana pudding $3 and caramel flan $3.25.\n\nThe banana pudding is assembled before your eyes, with the pudding squeezed out of one of those plastic bags like frosting, several of those round Nilla Wafer type cookies placed along the edges, and topped off with whipped cream sprayed from those aerosol cans from the supermarket.  As such, the whipped cream doesn't last too long, and the cookies will soften over time.  There is no real banana sliced in unlike what is traditionally known as banana pudding in the US.  The pudding itself is rather dense and could do with a boost of banana flavoring, since it is after all called a banana pudding.  In short - tasty, eat it sooner than later, but not quite befitting its name.  (Turns out they forgot to add the sliced banana.)\n\nThe flan was cut from a tray not quite 3/4 of an inch thick.  It is quite a dense dessert.  Creamy, sweet.

I ordered a pancake  and got french toast.  When the pancake arrived it was too thick and heavy so I ate the wheat toast instead which was good.  The bacon was also good and the home fries were so-so.\n\nFinally, before we left I decided to use the restrooms which are located in the back.

Currently has Watermelon rum and Banana rum slush that can be made into frozen cocktails. The boozy slushys have a good amount of alcohol in them because I turned really pink ( embarrassing to say, but I get pretty bad Asian glow. But it's also how I know there's enough alcohol in my drink!).\n\nThe menu is meanly meatballs, of course. But they have paninis, and sides such as pasta and Tator tot poutine, etc. The meatballs are really good! Great for sharing between a small group.\n\n- TURDUCKEN MEATBALL ($15) - this is one giant meatball in a gravy and topped with cranberry sauce (my picture doesn't do it justice, it's BIG). The meatball is made with chicken, duck, and turkey meat. It sounds a bit crazy but it is absolutely delicious. It was so juicy and tender! Great for sharing between 2-4 people. Apparently they only make a few of these a day so I'd definitely recommend you give this a try if it's available!\n\n- SHRIMP MEATBALL BAO ($13) - shrimp meatball was the daily special. The meatball already comes with a chili lime fish sauce. It sounds a bit weird but this was amazing. I've never had meatballs with Viet/Thai flavors before. It is SO good and so flavorful. I definitely recommend this one (if you like fish sauce). The meatball Bao came in 3 steamed baos with 1 meatball in each. Only downside is that I wish the baos had  more sauce. I think the bao would soak up the sauce really nicely.\n\n- SPICY KOREAN MEATBALL BAO ($9) - we got this with the yogurt sauce. It was the least memorable of everything we got today. It was good but nothing was too special about it.\n\nThis place is more on the pricier side. Our bill came out to be a little over $60 (food and drinks).

For our main meals she had the stuffed rabbit accompanied by blanched nettles and salsify on top of glazed prunes, I the hangar steak with oxtail and frites. The rabbit was a white meat so it actually was very mild, even with the pancetta wrapping. The prunes were very sweet and the salsify crunchy so an interesting mix of flavor and texture. The salty and bitter taste of the nettles went very well with the rabbit. My hangar steak was wonderful, cooked to the way I asked for it (i.e. medium rare). The oxtail tasted incredible, braised to perfection. Fries were fine as a standard for a meat and potatoes dish.\n\nOur waiter was attentive and courteous even when he had to return several times before we knew what we were going to order.

During my 20s, Chef McClelland's grand tastings were a true special occasion meal - one that I would budget for and look forward to for months.\n\nThat this historic 40-year-old restaurant sadly and suddenly closed on New Year's Eve has been difficult for me to process - it feels like a tragedy on the level of losing a close friend. I have not yet informed Mrs. K about L'Espalier's end, as I suspect it will affect her similarly.\n\nUnfortunately, the writing was on the wall. During what would be my final visit to L'Espalier this past summer in a bulky rental car, I was shocked to discover they no longer offered valet parking - something they had always done theretofore. Typical of L'Espalier, the restaurant went out of their way to provide special parking accommodations to me after explaining that, in these times of rideshare, no one drives to their restaurant anymore. Given the grayer demographic that L'Espalier attracted, this should have been a sign to me that the end was near. What should have nailed it for me was not receiving a coconut macaroon as I exited the restaurant - a plastic-wrapped fresh departure pastry that I had grown accustomed to leaving with each time I had visited L'Espalier. In fact, no one was manning the Ma\u00eetre d' station when I left the restaurant.\n\nOver two decades, L'Espalier introduced me to so many \"firsts\" and influenced my dining vocabulary and sensibilities to the point that it became the quintessential French fine dining experience that I measure all others against. Even at the end, I was supremely delighted by McClelland's \"Roasted Squab and Liver Vinaigrette,\" which bore strong nutty flavors of acorn and pine, yet did not feel out of place as a featured dish in a summer degustation. It was one of the best things I ate in 2018 as well as a dish that perfectly reflected the aesthetic sensibilities of L'Espalier's kitchen with its luxuriously decorative plating worthy of the exorbitant Back Bay rent-hikes that forced L'Espalier's closure.\n\nThe \"Grand Fromage\" cheese course was always excellent and possibly the aspect of dinner I would look forward to the most at L'Espalier. In fact, I would argue that Chef McClelland and fromager Matthew Helvitz's meticulously curated cheese courses are unrivaled by any others I've had here in the U.S. During each tasting, their cheese course would consist of: 1) a soft cheese selection consisting of anything from wrinkled goat cheese to a camembert, 2) an aged, natural rind cheese, typically sweet and nutty, 3) a stinky, complex washed-rind cheese like an \u00c9poisses or appenzeller, and 4) a blue cheese, typically rich and pungent.\n\nThe best thing I ever ate at L'Espalier? In late summer 2007, I was served a dish with lobster, Chatham squid, and pickled eggplant in a tomato broth that I can still remember every bite of.\n\nAdieu, L'Espalier.\n\nFood-D\u00e9cor-Service: 4.7/4.4/4.8"}]}, "Penguin Pizza": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 13, "text": "**4.5/5**\n\nFirst and foremost, the Monday night 15\u00a2 wings are delicious!

I originally tried to stop by another place that my guide recommended (Falafel King), but it was closed on Sun.  Needing something relatively quick and close by, I decided to give Ziti's a try.\n\nI asked the person behind the counter what was popular and relatively quick, and she recommended the hot subs and the ziti marinara.  Given that I don't eat beef (therefore, no meatball subs for me), I decided to go with the latter ($8.35).  True to their word, it came out extremely quickly--indeed, it was awaiting me as I emerged from the bathroom after ordering.  I'm one of those people that gets suspicious if food comes out too quick, given that this is usually a sign that it's not made to order, and my skepticism turned out to be well-founded in this case.\n\nThe dish was extremely simple, consisting of ziti noodles with marinara sauce and a slight sprinkling of romano cheese.  Although the portion size was generous, the flavor was extremely bland.  The sauce was watery, and the noodles were a tad overcooked.  It came with a roll, but as another reviewer said, it was just a generic roll with nothing special about it.  This dish reminded me of something similar that I sometimes make when I come home from work and don't want to do real cooking, except my version is slightly better, given that I know how to cook noodles al dente and choose a decent quality sauce.\n\nThe ambiance is reminiscent of an old-school fast food place, with brightly colored tabletops and walls.  There's an Italian fast food chain in the Midwest called Fazio's that a reviewer described as \"McDonald's meets Olive Garden.\"  While I've never been, this is what I imagine it to be like.

The individuals with whom I was sitting were white and were not asked to leave the bar, though we had been there as long as they had and had partaken in some of the shots as well. It is especially troubling that, out of the four asked to leave, two had been there for the duration of our stay with two only just arriving minutes before. In addition, the bartender had told this group that they had all been there before and had caused a scene then as well. We know that, last time we went to Dorset Hall, another black friend was very intoxicated and was cut off, rightfully so. This individual was not at the bar, nor had been at the bar, at any point that evening. \n\nI honestly hope that this is not an act of singling people out and grouping events and people solely based on their race, but the entire event has made me extremely sad and angry, especially in a season where we need to love and respect one another. I do understand that two colleagues became angry when this event occurred which warranted expulsion from the bar, but I also believe that the staff at this bar did not handle the matter in a professional way, and gave no valid reason as to why they were cut off.  If these individuals were told in a polite and professional manner the reasons for their not being served, the matter would not have escalated. The demeanor of the bartender involved was rude and unprofessional. This has been an attitude that we have encountered at this establishment before.  I also feel it is important to note that, after we all left, we went to another establishment - of equal class and quality - where were served politely and without hesitation. \n\nI will not be a customer at Dorset Hall in the future and will be sure to tell all who are interested in attending your establishment that the behavior of staff there is rude, unprofessional and - most upsettingly - discriminatory. \n\n\nCouldn't give a \"0\" rating.

Because Clink is in the lobby of the hotel, it stays open later than two, so I get to spend more time watching Balison get crazy on strangers.  Also, large glasses of wine.  And people come here to act pretentious, so you know you will meet some characters.  And honestly, cool scene.  But let's get down to the good stuff.\n\nSometimes when I'm getting ready to go out, I look in the mirror and think - \"Man, Jen S...you know what you haven't done in a while?  You haven't gotten hit on by a really old man who will blatantly attempt to use his money to attract you.  I'm talking OLD man...dentures wearing, almost-in-adult-diapers old man.\"  Then I put on my best standing around shoes and hop the nearest Boston Cab to Clink.  This bar never ceases to disappoint.  Below are some of the men that you will literally find at this bar every time you go.\n\n(1) The Radiologist aka Dr. Steve.\n\nThe first time I met Dr. Steve, I was with my friend Crazypants.  Balison and I have been hanging with Crazypants (CP to make it easier on my typing fingers) and she fits in well with us - see the nickname.  This guy sidled up to us, bald head glimmering in the dim lighting, paunch hanging aggressively over his belt buckle, and coolly informed me that he makes over $500,000, and is in fact a doctor in private practice.\nWere I not a nice young woman, I would have inquired why he didnt use some of that hard earned dough to get hairplugs, liposuction, and some class.  Thankfully, I bit my tongue because moments later he invited us to attend one of his \"parties\" frequented by over 300 influential people.  CP and I will surely be banging down the door of that party this summer.  Unless I have my frontal lobotomy scheduled for that day.\n\n(2) Dr. Steve's friend, \"The Bulgarian\"\n\nBecause we are the luckiest women in the world, Dr. Steve introduced us to his friend, after he asked CP if she liked Bulgarians (apparently he had his sights set on me - YESSSSSSSSSSSS) and she replied no.  That didn't dissuade Dr. Steve...he wanted to hook his boy, The Bulgarian, up with CP.  No wonder - her pants were looking particularly crazy on this night.  Naturally, CP ignored The Bulgarian.  But two weeks later, at this very same hotel \"lounge\", The Bulgarian appeared as though from nowhere to ask my group of friends \"May I ask you a question, as females?\" to which my friend replied \"None of us are female\" to which The Bulgarian - seemingly unphased - replied \"you all look like females to me.\"  Astute.\n\n(3) The hot bartender from Harvard Gardens who had to clean up Balison's puke (by the way do you think there's any way he reads these?)\n\nOkay, technically he doesnt work at Clink, but he works downstairs at Alibi (no longer at Harv Gardens) and his name is Justin.  Seriously, go check him out.\n\n(4) The Man With the Fake Tan and His Shirt Unbuttoned to His Navel, showing off Considerable White Chest Hair Because he is ONE HUNDRED AND TWO YEARS OLD.\n\nOh Im sorry.  Did I say \"The MAN\" SINGULAR?  Don't you worry - Jen S. and Balison wont be monopolizing all of these fine specimens - there are plenty to go around.  Most recently I went out with Balison, CP, and Balison's roommate The Melestor and there was a swarm.  Balison and The Melestor settled on talking to two \"pilots\" who were furiously showing off chest hair and looked like they had been tanning on the surface of the sun before jetting back to earth to arrive at Clink and pursue us.  Thankfully, the night ended with only the Melestor exchanging digits, which is okay, because she likes a crusty old man.\n\nIn conclusion, go to Clink, drink their large glasses of wine, and say hello to the old people for me - just make sure you speak loudly and into the ear with the hearing aid."}]}, "ZAPS": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "text": "Really amazing.\n\nWent here earlier this week with some co-workers.

If you said yes, this place has your answer. This place is located inside the basement of a building in the side streets of Boston's Chinatown, and they serve a simple selection of Chinese barbecue meats. I walked inside, and stared at the barbecue meats, while at the same time, looked at the menu to see what selections and combinations they had. I saw a small and somewhat stout Chinese lady, and she was saying to me in Cantonese Chinese:\n\n\"Yiu mat ye ah? Yiu mat ye ah?\" (What do you want?) \n\nI decided to get a rice dish with three Chinese barbecue meats, since I wanted to try everything so after reading the Chinese characters on the menu, I said,\n\n\"Saam bo, cha siu, siu youk, siu ngaap.\" (Three treasures, barbecue pork, crispy roast pork, and roasted duck) \n\nShe seemed to understand everything I said in Cantonese Chinese. Although she seemed to be a competent English speaker from talking with the non-Chinese people inside, she was definitely more comfortable speaking Cantonese Chinese and told me to sit down.  \n\nI was given a glass of tea, and some warm chicken soup as I waited. The soup was simple, but good. Within a few minutes, I was given a plate filled with rice, the Chinese barbecue meats I ordered, mixed with a somewhat oily sauce made from freshly cut scallions. The pork meats were tasty, I really liked the crispiness of the roast pork and the tenderness of the meat. Combined with the flavor of the scallion and the warm rice, it was a tasty combination. The roasted duck was also good, was not bony, and it was a fairly meaty and tender duck. I thought I was given a really generous portion. Since the food is served on a plate, if you are not good at using chopsticks, you can use the soup spoon to scoop up the rice. One small bowl of chicken soup, with a rice plate filled with cha siu, siu youk, and siu ngaap should be enough to fill the stomach of one hungry man. After finishing my meal, the somewhat stout lady said to me. \n\n\"Luk mun boon,\" ($6.50)\n\nThat's fairly inexpensive for a tasty meal that can fill up your stomach. $6.50 is probably enough to buy you only a low-quality factory processed fast food meal with soda, a large cup of frozen yogurt, a small hot sandwich, a couple slices of premium pizza, a small roll of sushi, or a medium sized salad in the somewhat decent city of Boston. \n\nAtmosphere is fairly gritty, so do not expect a really clean restaurant or really nice people, but somewhat effective service. Somehow, they can keep the government inspectors happy. \n\nOverall, this is a really good choice if you want a simple Chinese barbecue meal if you can tolerate the gritty setting and atmosphere. This is also a great option if you are on a really tight budget, want a good meal to fill your stomach and if you are not willing to spend more than $10 for a meal. \n\nAnother fact for those people who love Yelp way too much: This place has not one, but two stickers saying \"People Love Us on Yelp\" posted on the counter, so this place should be \"legit\"."}]}, "Stardust - Inspired Mediterranean": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 6, "text": "Such a great little restaurant in the heart of West Roxbury, delicious Greek food, great for takeout.

The breading was crispy and when paired with the Cane's dipping sauce, it was heaven.\n\nThis is chicken, fries and coleslaw though.   I'm giving it 5 stars for it's category.

After looking at their menu online, I bookmarked it and told myself that we would go next time we were in Boston.\n\nSince we weren't very familiar with the South End, I had to find out how to get there.  Much to my surprise the T has a trip planner on their website.  I found out that we could take the orange line to Back Bay station and Vejigantes is about a 4 block walk away.  For those who are wondering---when you get off at Back Bay  station, exit at Dartmouth Street and make a left.  Walk down Dartmouth Street and eventually it becomes West Dedham Street.\n\nWe set out to go on a Saturday night with the plan to arrive there around 5 p.m.  Yelpers mentioned making reservations but we decided to take our chances.  Well...we got there and the place was incredibly busy.  The man at the host stand told us it would be a 45 minute wait but said that we could wait at the bar.  Figuring that we came all that way, it would be best to wait at the bar.  Turns out that the bar is very small with only 4 seats and it is right at the entrance to the kitchen.  The bartender was a nice young woman who was  very welcoming.  My husband ordered a beer while I ordered a Vejigantes mango margarita.  The drink was well made with the mango flavoring clearly coming through.  It was suggested that we order an appetizer while waiting.  So we chose pastelillos con queso.   Figuring that we were in for a long wait, we slowly sipped our drinks.  When the pastelillos arrived, we were about to dig in when the host came over to tell us that our table was ready!  It turned out that the wait was only about 15 minutes.  He helped us by carrying the pastelillos to our table.\n\nSeating is really cramped here as it is a small dining area.  We bit into the pastelillos and were surprised to find that there was more than cheese in them.  There was also some onion and  tomatoes.  What also  hit us was that they weren't true pastelillos---nor were they empanadas.  Rather they were somewhere in between.  They lacked the thin, flaky crust of a pastelillo but weren't as thick as an empanada.  It was an interesting and tasty take on pastelillos.\n\nAfter finishing the pastelillos, our server, Cindy came to take our orders.  She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items.  I saw that there was pollo frito on the menu and figured that it was best to ask what they considered to be pollo frito.  She told me that it was chunks of chicken with bones that had a spice rub.  Okay---I'll try that.  I also chose a side of arroz con gandules and a side of platanos maduros.\n\nMy husband got what he always gets in PR restaurants---bistec encebollado.  He surprised me  this time by getting a side of platanos maduros.\n\nAt this time, the restaurant got busy again so it took a while for our meals to arrive.  When they arrived, we noticed how huge the portions were.  Ah...but I should have known!  PR restaurants are all about large portions at reasonable prices.\n\nThe pollo frito wasn't conventional pollo frito.  Conventional pollo frito is basically fried chicken with a crispy skin and moist interior with an undercurrent of PR flavors.  This pollo frito was moist and flavorful but it lacked any skin.  Still, I did enjoy this take on the dish.\n\nThe arroz con gandules was actually the conventional version with plenty of pigeon peas (gandules) in it.   The one drawback---it was a bit on the dry side.\n\nThe platanos maduros (sweet plantains) also were conventional and properly made, thus a pleasure to eat.\n\nMy husband's bistec encebollado (steak with onions) was the real deal.   He said that the meat was tender and moist.  He enjoyed it but thought the portion could have been smaller.\n\nWe were both way too full to finish everything.  If we lived in town, I would have taken it home for later.  We explained to Cindy that despite not finishing everything, we did, indeed, like our meals.  I told her how nice it was to be able to go to a PR restaurant as in the DC area if I want PR food, I have to make it to myself.\n\nAll in all, we both were glad we went.  That said, we both agree that making a reservation is a wise idea.  The restaurant is in a PR enclave in the South End and lots of locals were dining here.  Plus some came in for takeout orders.  With friendly, welcoming staff and great (if not always conventional food), we would certainly return!\n\nThe decor reminds me of the Island.

It's steps from the Freedom Trail and all the landmark restaurants, and we would have had a single studio in one of the hotel chains for the same rate we paid for our two bedroom Bricco suite. \n\nThe place is very Euro-style with minimal furnishings that gives the suite a very clean and spacious feel. I thought it was odd not to have a couch in the common area, but I didn't miss it or the germs found in hotel upholstery. (I see other units have couches, however.) We sat in the dining chairs that could be wiped down and slept in crisp white clean sheets under an equally stark white fluffy comforter on a mattress protected by an additional clean white cover. It was like sleeping on a cloud. \n\nOur dining table and shower drain area could have been scrubbed a little better, but the entire suite was clean otherwise. \n\nThe kitchen is outfitted with a fridge stocked with standard overpriced Voss water and soda for purchase and a two-burner stove with a tea kettle. Bottle opener, mugs, wine glasses, cutting board, plates, cloth napkins, utensils, and a coffee maker are available. Would have liked either a pot, pan, or a microwave to warm up food. \n\nOther amenities include large TVs, iron and board, hairdryer, toiletries, dimmers for nearly every light switch (simple but nice luxury!), a safe, plush towels, and a full length mirror. :) \n\nWe had a good night's sleep every night. The hum from the highway didn't bother us except when one angry driver laid on his horn for an obnoxiously long time. Black out curtains would be nice, but the blinds and thick curtains do a decent job of keeping the room dark. \n\nI would definitely return here and recommend it for anyone wanting to be within walking distance to the tourist stops and take a cab or Uber elsewhere. The closest paid parking is four blocks away. If you do drive, park briefly in front of the Bricco restaurant and inside the host will direct you to check in.

I've never gotten food here, so I was looking forward to it.\n\nWe sat at the bar and both ordered drinks - he a cocktail, I a beer. We eventually ordered food - he the grilled Spanish octopus and I the Lion's Tail Burger without the horseradish mustard. Both of us enjoyed our meals tremendously, actually. My date said the octopus was cooked perfectly, and my burger was cooked a beautiful medium, and after the first one was brought out with the mustard (I had no clue, and they fixed what I didn't even know was a problem within seconds), I was able to enjoy quite a good meal.\n\nThis was when things got weird. \n\nWe paid, and upon my credit card being handed to me by the bartender, I was told that I was no longer welcome there and that people like me who don't like their business don't deserve to be served. A blink of an eye later (arguably a blink. My eyes were so wide because of what was just said.), there was a man at my shoulder with his phone in his hand opened to my previous Yelp review. He introduced himself as the owner and told me that he invested his time and money into this business and doesn't need scared people like me hiding behind computers and complaining. I was told that I should've been mature about the entire situation and had an adult conversation in person.\n\nUm, what?\n\nFirst of all, I wasn't the first person to leave a 2-star review, nor was I the only person who said what I said in their reviews. Clearly I'm not making things up when customers before and after me experienced the same things. \n\nSecondly, when you elect to put your business on an online platform like Yelp, you're opening up your business to the good, the bad, and the ugly, and you have to be willing to accept that. \n\nThirdly, is this really the way you want to approach a patron who was coming here wanting to give you a third shot and experience the business in a way that he hasn't before? Let's talk about mature, responsible ways of approaching a situation. \n\nI work in sales and get reviewed by my customers on the daily. If I receive criticism, I don't call them up and harass them. I call them up and ask \"What can I do better?\" That's the point of crowd-sourced reviews - to find out from the people who matter what you can do to be the best business you can be.\n\nSo if you're coming to Lion's Tail and consider writing a less than stellar review or have already left one, take some advice from this scared, immature internet troll - write a review and own the one you've written.\n\nLion's Tail deserves the good, the bad, and the ugly reviews it receives, just like any other establishment around the world."}]}, "P.F.

Woah, a surprise.\n\nWas here the other day before a concert at the HoB, noticed that if you eat at their restaurant, you get to 'skip the line', and wait in a separate line that gets admitted earlier then the others. Kinda nice. ($15 minimum required.)\n\nMy girlfriend got in there first, was seated almost immediately, but then didn't see a waiter for almost 20 minutes.

During this time, nobody came by the table to say it was going to take a bit, we never had anyone check on our drinks, and when we asked someone for help, it still took them a bit to get the food over. After everything was done, the waitress swooped over to snatch up the check and payment, only to drop the receipts off and run off, never to be seen of again.\n\nFood time: I got a cheeseburger, pretty simple, and my girlfriend got the chicken salad BLT sandwich.

If you're getting a fresh lobster, where you get it isn't going to make all the difference.

The experience I had with the staff was THE WORST.\n\nHaving seen in an earlier review that someone with a coupon was given smaller-than-paid-for lobsters, I came up with what I thought was a reasonable and honest solution to their dishonest tendencies, and asked for 4 1.5 lbs lobsters upon walking in, without mentioning the coupon.  The guy helping me out took out 4 lobsters from a bucket, weighed them, put them in a bag, and asked if I needed anything else.  Then I pulled out the coupon and asked about the chowder and said here you go.  \n\nHe took the coupon, looked at it, and took the lobsters he had in the bag for me and dumped them back into the bucket and pulled out four new lobsters from a different bucket.  I was almost stunned in disbelief but I managed to say \"hey, uh, what was wrong with those lobsters?\" He told me what I ordered wasn't what the coupon said, which was obviously 100% false, as I essentially read off the coupon what I was entitled to.  I told him I asked for 1.5 pounders, he gave me 1.5 pounders, and I paid for 1.5 pounders.  When he bagged the new lobsters, I asked about the weight, and he goes \"see? 6 pounds.\" though looking at the scale I could obviously see it said 5.2 lbs.  \n\nHonestly, what?  Try and pull a fast one on a customer to shortchange him and then lie about it?  Obviously I called him out for it and he passed me off to some supervisor and stood in the back of the counter area.  Obviously this guy working with me had been told that people with this coupon FOR POUND AND A HALF LOBSTERS would not get pound and a half lobsters.  The supervisor asked the problem and I said the coupon is for pound and a half lobsters, not pound and a quarter to pound and a third.  He said OK i'll take care of it... so I thought we were done.  As he puts the lobsters on the scale, he's whispering to the other guy behind the counter the whole time, both looking at us, just continuing to be unbelievably disrespectful.  He eventually says \"there you go, 6 pounds, do you want to check the scale?\" in one of the most condescending tones I've experienced (single most condescending, by far, from anyone who was supposed to be serving me in any way).  The people I had to interact with were insufferable and I will not be back, and you shouldn't either.  Get your fresh lobsters anywhere else and your lobster rolls everywhere else.

The reason? That it is extremely, extremely good.\n\nGordon Hamersley is one of Boston's best, whipping up dishes that do not disappoint. He keeps it simple, though. With just one restaurant to focus on, with the same decor its always had, Gordon would rather focus on the food, and it shows.\n\nWhile his counterparts go off and create modern masterpieces on the walls of their restaurants with sculptures, art collections, and all sorts of trinkets to distract you from your dish, Gordon keeps the focus on what's important and that for which you came (yes, I'm talking about the stellar food). With an open kitchen, this guy's got nothing to hide, and why should he? Everything is fabulous.\n\nSure, it might be out your price range (especially for most Yelpers) but remember... you get what you pay for...\n\nThe crowd Hamersley's caters to probably doesn't Yelp (I mean does your rich uncle use his iPhone to rant to his cyber friends that his $30 skirt steak was bland?)\n\nSo consider the silent majority of people's (more than likely positive) opinions of this restaurant when reading the rest of this online crap and don't miss this NEIGHBORHOOD GEM because some angst-y, socially-deprived cyber bully doesn't quite understand the appeal of a restaurant that has existed since long before they were born.\n\n\nBut for those of you looking for a \"normal\" Yelp review, here are some highlights: service is on point (Eddy, we love you), patio is superb, this place is GREAT for brunch, and the host staff is quite simply... adorable."}]}, "Quality Cafe": {"reviews": [{"stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "text": "this is my favorite restaurant in chinatown. i am such a loyal customer because the food is great, the price is right, and the service is good. \n\nwhen you get a craving for some baked pork chop on rice, it wont be satisfied until you come here. same with beef & broccili on udon noodles =)"}]}, "Quiznos": {"reviews": [{"stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "text": "So I wanted to confirm the whole theory that this quiznos is stingy with their ingredients, so I went there.

This incredible ciabatta bread from heaven was accompanied by butter sitting in a small dish of olive oil and took it to another level.

Salmon tartare originating from Faroe Islands was served to the table encased in smoke topped with caviar was sumptuous and the Alaskan King Crab introduced me to my first tastebud climax of the evening.

The shellfish meat took on a bit of a different texture and flavor like how the claw tips came off like a menage a trois between foie gras, a prawn from the Mediterranean and French butter.

Instead of making people needlessly stand in line outside for 30 mins on a Wednesday even though there is plenty of room inside, why not just pointedly refuse entry to every 4th person and make everyone else wait at least an hour and clean the sidewalk too. Except skanky girls. Keep letting them skip the line. It makes them feel special. That way you get more of them.\n\n2. Instead of grumbling when letting me in wearing my converse and jeans, why not just adopt a policy of not letting any guy in who isn't wearing a blue buttondown shirt undone to the third button with khakis and shiny black leather shoes. Those who wear a gold chain get first pick of the brushes during sidewalk-cleaning hour.\n\n3. Don't just charge 12 dollars for a whisky and coke. Come on - scum can afford that! At least charge 18 dollars and refuse to serve anyone not waving their cash at you from their monogrammed silver clip. Also, I didn't see nearly enough douchey drinks on offer. You shouldn't be letting anyone get anything from the bar without having to break a 50.\n\n4. Think about playing all the terrible songs you play more than once. There are only so many really terrible mediterranean house songs and Fergie remixes that attract the skanky girls AND the 100s of sleazeball wannabe players onto the painfully badly laid-out dance area.\n\n5.

NOT vegan friendly as of right now).\n\nCashier: What's your name? \nAllix: Alli\nCashier: How do you spell that? \nAllix: A-L-L-I\nMe: Like the diet drug that makes you crap yourself. \n\nI ordered the \"Adopted Luke\" which, much like the Maggie Mooooooooshakes from back home, made me feel awkward to say. But for a burger with swiss, mushrooms, onions, and BBQ sauce on a whole wheat bun, I'd say something more awkward than that. \n\nCue blurp sound and pOp Up ViDeO bubble.. Did you know the \"Adopted Luke\" is named after Leonardo DiCaprio's character in Growing Pains? Crazy huh. The dude who named it (there was a contest) gets FREE \"Adopted Luke\"s for LIFE. \n\nThe burger was supremely tasty. Just enough BBQ to compliment the burger and not my work shirt/skirt (no intense goo-age, no Yelp bib here). And for less than $6 bucks it beats out all those TGIAppleTuesdaysmediumwellmytuckus burgers. The fries were okay. Oven toasted instead of fried, I'd rather have a baked potato instead. Kudos though for not putting me into a salt/fry coma. I also had a vanilla milkshake which brought my meal total to about $10, not bad. The shake tasted more like those Horizon organic vanilla milks (as seen in Starbucks and my freshman roomie's care packages from her mommy) which isn't necessarily bad, but not a shake if you're looking for that consistency. Oh and note, don't do what Alli did. There's a reason why your veggies come in a separate container. Don't dump them on your plate unless you're trying to reenact that time you ate in the rain (water water everywhere). \n\nThey took out the mop around 8pm which was a leetle annoying, but they didn't slosh it up slippery style so I appreciate their upkeep. It was just me and Alli for awhile so it's not like they were asking people to lift up their feet while they were eating (we didn't). At 8:55pm, Alli and I were given the heave ho warning. Wahoo! Considering our ridiculous conversation, respectable ejectage for once! \n\nOH derby girl photos on the wall.. along with some random pix... scenic views of water and buildings.. and what looks to be sock puppets getting into a gang fight.

Got seated within 10 minutes downstairs, and our group was pretty excited about the variety of the menu options. Although I will admit feeling a little repulsed when I saw that they renamed their Bloody Mary to \"Bloody Marilyn\"...!\n\nI had the Brandied Pear French Toast which came with a big portion and was a nice change from the typical types of french toast I see at brunch places. To their credit, it was pretty good, and for the most part my group was very happy with their food - one person mentioned how perfectly her eggs were poached.\n\nThe first issue we had was with the bill. My friend Christine ordered the Ham Benedict, but asked to switch out the ham for bacon instead. The waitress said no problem, but failed to mention that it was going to come with an extra $4 charge. When the bill came out and we asked why there was a side of bacon added to our bill, the waitress said that's what she had to do when Christine asked for the bacon instead of ham, and she would not remove it from the bill. It would have been nice to have been told that switching ham and bacon actually meant removing ham and buying a side of bacon, but that is not how they do it here!\n\nThat was nothing compared to what happened next. A couple hours after we left the restaurant, me and my friends were walking out of my apartment which is across from the restaurant, and eventually realized that a waitress was chasing us down the street. She said that our credit card authorizations got lost, and we needed to come back in to pay.\n\nWe wanted to make sure we paid our share, so we went back in. When we got there, one of the guys working let us know that our faces were about to be put on Most Wanted signs because we hadn't paid our bill and the waitress was going to have to pay for us out of her pocket. Apparently, we were terrible people who wanted to make someone else buy our brunch.\n\nWe all pulled up our handy Bank of America apps on our phones, letting them know that our charges were showing as in process so it seemed to have gone through, but we were assured that it hadn't and they needed our credit cards again - and we definitely wouldn't get charged twice. We handed over the cards, paid again, and left.\n\nSure enough, we were double charged. One friend called and was told that each of us had to call in to get reimbursed. I stopped by in person, but a manager is never available. I left my information but still heard nothing, so a few minutes ago I went in again - surprise, no manager.\n\nIt's been over a week since it happened, and apparently in order to get our money back we have to wait until we get a call back from a manager (Rebecca) who doesn't seem to exist. Pretty frustrating that they KNOW about the issue, I was told that the hostess heard them talking about it the first night when I left my information, but management still doesn't seem to want to refund us the extra charges that we were chased down the street for and then basically shamed about once inside the restaurant.\n\nAs the cherry on top, one friend used a debit card, so the unexpected double charge caused her to overdraw her account.\n\nI also find it hard to trust new restaurants that claim to be the \"Best Of\" anything (though I guess it's not new if you count the time when it was under the same ownership but named Cafe Nuovo - with absolutely terrible service).

If you're not interested in anything more exotic than Chicken Tikka Masala or Tandoori Chicken, take your money and head to your local Indian restaurant instead.\n\n- If you are here to try something different (\"Garsh, I wonder how Pakistani cuisine is different from Indian?\"), be prepared for exotic, adventurous items that push your palate and challenge your acceptance of what's edible.\n\n- If you are this kind of adventurous eater, Darbar will be a match made in heaven.

You may never look at vegetables (or mustard greens, at least) the same way again. We ordered a second one of these because the first was so quickly devoured.\n\nNihari - Beef chunks. Cow meat good.\n\nHaleem - Minced beef with lentils. Thick, creamy, good cow-liness.\n\nPaya - Oh man oh man oh man, I was practically salivating at the sight of this on the menu. Goat or beef feet soup? YESSSSS, mama! I come from the culture that eats chicken feet for dim sum. I ain't afraid of quadriped soup! God, this was so thick and creamy and savory, but be warned: it's not actually a soup like grandma's chicken noodle soup.

There are about five to six options in each category.  If you are lucky enough to sit in the back left corner, you can see why the list of dishes is so manageable: the chef does all work to order in a small kitchen.  As a result, the output is indescribably delicious.\n\nAntipasto - I took my parents here about a year ago and my dad still talks about the antipasto.  He commented on how each cured meat was the best he ever had and sighed at the cheese. \n\nBruschetta - quality grilled bread, fresh tomatoes, mozz, basil, olive oil, and vinegar is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSteak - yes, my Italian father insisted on ordering steak at an Italian restaurant.  And he loved it.  His biggest compliment for red meat is when he orders \"still mooing\" and actually gets what he wants.  The man who chooses to only eat red meat and starches also ate all the vegetables served to him.  Big deal.\n\nTripe - not my thing, but the boy who ordered it loved it.\n\nRigatoni - ohhhhh delicious.  One of my favorite things is a simple dish done well.  This dish is that exemplified.\n\nGnocchi - this rich, creamy, deep, pillowy dinner was ordered by my friendate last night.  I know I will be back on a cold winter night to dive in face first.  That is exactly what she did.  Once the gnocchi was gone, the rest of the sauce was sopped up by bread.\n\nCod over spaghetti - one of the three fish specials last night.  Holy delicious.  I died over this dish.  The homemade spaghetti was cooked perfectly with each firm bite proving to me how wrong I cook my pasta.  The cod was flakey and plentiful.  I could not have been happier with the dish.  Mine too was cleaned and the white wine/garlic/splash of red sauce did not stand a chance against my bread dipping power.\n\n\nI've never had enough stomach room left to attempt desserts but chocolate, truffle ice cream with homemade espresso churned in made me consider finding room.  I couldn't this time, but I might have to next time.

Thai food doesn't have to be screaming hot , although it can be, but it does need to have spices.  This was so lacking in every way.   I will also add that the staff was unfriendly both on the phone and when I went to pick up my food.  Not so much as a greeting, a head-nod or a smile..  Just a stare from the woman at the register. I told her who I was, she handed me my food, mumbled the amount I owed and that was it.  Also, the prices  are too high. Maybe not if the food was amazing but in this case it feels like robbery.

Considering that Coppa won a James Beard award (and only after being open for just a few years), you might think that Coppa is an eclectic and/or fine dining restaurant.  However, that is not the case.  Coppa is a casual Italian restaurant that serves the type of everyday pasta courses and pizzas that you would expect to find at a good and not too expensive Italian bistro like Los Angeles' Little Dom's or Pizzeria Mozza.\n\nLike those two restaurants, Coppa is not that expensive.  There are several inexpensive small starters as well as pastas available in half sizes so that you can try a variety of proteins and ingredients without having to spend a lot of money.\n\nMy lunch started with complimentary bread and an excellent and citrusy olive oil.  The bread was soft, but it still had a distinct and chewy crust.  My first course was two local raw oysters topped with a pear puree, verjus and tiny pearls, which were sweet and tart.

The flavor of the whole dish was great.  It had a richness and creaminess though it was not overly heavy, oily or greasy.  The smoked pancetta was thick and delivered a great bacon flavor while the uni was very creamy and slightly sweet.  The spaghetti noodles were cooked appropriately though I would have preferred a thicker noodle.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coppa-boston-2?select=4ShY938Ip1f4Rcy68O5O7Q#8h02MRyDuDll-pSK9sXf8A\n\nFor dessert, I had two of their gelato flavors.  The first I tried was their ricotta, which had a great mild cheese flavor.  The texture was slightly icy, but the ricotta flavor was very impressive.  I also tried their Nutella gelato, which was incredibly rich.  I felt it had a very strong and pleasing chocolate flavor, but it had only a very mild hazelnut flavor.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coppa-boston-2?select=4ShY938Ip1f4Rcy68O5O7Q#-vwOpeRrU03XbdZb4DHRIw\n\nService was excellent--very personable and friendly but also extremely polite and professional.\n\nAs mentioned, prices were reasonable.
