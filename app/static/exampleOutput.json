They checked our table every three minutes or so and picked up empty plates or brought new tea quickly without bothering us. They speak very politely. One of the staffs (he might have been the owner) even opened the door, bowed, and greeted us when we left the restaurant. I've never experienced this level of customer service. This might be because there were only a few people eating at the restaurant when we were there. Even so, their effort to make their customers happy is excellent. This place is large and clean, and their foods were very good! I'll definitely come back."},
     {"Tayla Rhine": "This place was a wonderful food experience for my husband and I during our short vacation in New York. The Jasmine tea is very aromatic, presentation was everything and flavor of the Peking duck was perfection! If you are looking for a warm place to try authentic dim sum, this is the place! Customer service was amazing as well! I highly recommend!!!"},
     {"Zoe Johnson": "Great customer service! Very clean, spacious. Amazing options for small servings (sharing options) or entrees! The drinks were great, fresh herbs, decently priced. Definitely coming back to try different dishes and more drinks!"},

The waiters  cooperated in a gorgeous style, the cuisine was very good and my guests were so  delighted. We shall definitely visit again for more events. thanks very much."},

There's salads, pastas, sandwiches, quinoa bowls as well as entrees.This place also has numerous fruit bowls\n- There's limited seating available at this place as well\n\nCons\n- The waiting line can be long during peak hours\n- I tried the pasta after ordering it online and found it to be too greasy for my comfort.\n\nI think amongst the numerous food options, the quinoa bowl and salad bowl beat all others by a mile. They're economical, healthy and substantial quantity wise.They also have a ton of breakfast options and I've tried the scrambled eggs here on numerous occasions.\n\nPro-Tip\nIf you create an online account and order online you'll get a 10% discount on your order. There's a column indicating that on the page."},

Market Crates is a stealth great option in a neighborhood where there aren't many. Once my ordered-ahead food wasn't ready when I arrived, and the staff gave me a coffee while I waited. I'll certainly be back."},

I have used them to do catering before but did my first breakfast catering order today and was very impressed. Everything was wonderful and good amount for price. Bonus points cause I put the wrong address and the delivery guy called me, redelivered to the correct spot + set up the food for me. Additional bonus points for the undying consistency over the past 4+ years! ü§ó"},

It's a really unique crowd, a lot of customers from all around the world, international staff as well. Not like a stereotypical wild/loud American sports bar, it has a much more relaxed or respectful feel I think. Never seen a harder working restaurant/bar staff either to be honest, they come to you - so you never have to wait on them or struggle to get their attention. 5 stars all across the board for me."}],

We stood at the counter for at least 5 minutes before the woman so much as looked at us (had it not been pouring with rain I would have walked). After another 5 minutes we noticed customers after us leaving with their orders and had to ask for ours, when it finally arrived the order was wrong and in the end we asked for a refund. This was the only time we got any attention - when all 3 staff had something to say about it. The staff need some serious customer service training, extremely unpleasant and rude.\n\nI hate to leave a bad review but stay away from this place. It's not the sort of memory you want of your visit to NYC."}],
    "14": [{"Samantha Ng": "It's okay. Not my favorite, not awful. There are definitely places that I just find makes better KFC. Its fried there will be grease but this place leans on a greaser level. The price is fair and comparable to others. Because they make it fresh, allow them 20minutes grace period."},
     {"Joanne Uy (JT)": "I was in K-Town yesterday afternoon and husband told me to get something for dinner so my immediate thought was our usual spot. Then I saw the raving reviews for this place and thought why not.\n\nEntered the food court, temperature taken, and the 15 wait began. Ordered the soy garlic wings regular and was looking forward to how it would compare to others.\n\nIt was still warm when I got home so that was really nice. Tried it and thought it was tasty but still lacked something to deliver that perfect soy garlic taste. Also not crispy and crunchy and to be fair, it was on me. There was an option to make it crispy so I thought it was the regular korean fried chicken crispness * 2 if I took that option. There was no crisp whatsoever so I'll probably try their crispy option again one day."},

The best part was the lovely lady who was taking our order at the register. She was so incredibly sweet and accommodating. Because of COVID we sat outside in the outdoor dining area and an external worker assumed we were eating outside food and requested a receipt. I told him the food was from Noona and he would not believe me (I did not request an original receipt), so I quickly went inside to ask the same lady for a receipt and she - despite being busy taking other orders - without hesitation gave me a genuine concerning smile and printed out a receipt for me promptly.

There was only a couple pieces of beef, and not that many vegetables either.
