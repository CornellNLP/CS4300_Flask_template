He talks his friend Cameron into taking his father's prized Ferrari and with his girlfriend Sloane head into Chicago for the day. While they are taking in what the city has to offer school principal Ed Rooney is convinced that Ferris is, not for the first time, playing hooky for the day and is hell bent to catch him out. Ferris has anticipated that, much to Rooney's chagrin.","tokens":["high","school","senior","ferri","bueller","matthew","broderick","decid","skip","school","spring","dai","fake","ill","parent","lyman","ward","cindi","pickett","encourag","girlfriend","sloan","mia","sara","pessimist","best","friend","cameron","alan","ruck","spend","dai","chicago","on","last","fling","graduat","head","differ","colleg","ferri","persuad","cameron","let","us","father","restor","1961","ferrari","250","gt","california","pick","sloan","part","cover","travel","citi","the","rest","school","mani","resid","learn","ferri","exagger","ill","offer","donat","help","save","ferri","howev","two","peopl","convinc","ferri","decept","sister","jeani","jennif","grei","outrag","ferri","abil","defi","author","easili","school","princip","edward","roonei","jeffrei","jone","believ","ferri","truant","ferri","friend","arriv","downtown","leav","ferrari","two","garag","attend","richard","edson","larri","jenkin","drive","short","later","take","joyrid","ferri","sloan","cameron","enjoi","sight","includ","take","game","wriglei","field","visit","sear","tower","art","institut","chicago","chicago","mercantil","exchang","take","part","von","steuben","dai","parad","ferri","lip","sync","dank","schoen","beatl","version","twist","shout","ferri","also","us","ploi","pretend","ab","froeman","sausag","king","chicago","dine","upscal","restaur","rush","street","narrowli","avoid","father","dine","busi","associ","meanwhil","mr","roonei","gone","campu","try","find","ferri","first","local","hangout","ferri","home","mr","roonei","attempt","gain","entri","end","get","stuck","mud","lose","shoe","wallet","chase","dog","jeani","come","home","look","ferri","instead","discov","mr","roonei","mistak","burglar","she","call","polic","forc","mr","roonei","flee","scene","when","polic","show","haul","jeani","prank","call","polic","station","talk","drug","dealer","charli","sheen","tell","need","stop","obsess","brother","focu","jeani","mother","show","collect","upset","at","end","dai","ferri","friend","retriev","ferrari","discov","wai","home","hundr","mile","ad","odomet","send","cameron","panic","fear","abus","father","reaction","after","calm","cameron","ferri","come","plan","run","car","revers","place","rear","wheel","jack","cameron","father","hillsid","garag","hope","revers","odomet","when","realiz","work","cameron","unleash","pent","anger","father","yell","father","love","car","son","damag","front","car","come","realiz","long","due","stand","father","vow","accept","consequ","cameron","calm","rest","car","previou","action","unbalanc","jack","car","hit","ground","race","revers","crash","glass","wall","land","ravin","despit","ferri","offer","take","blame","cameron","still","plan","admit","action","father","take","consequ","ferri","walk","sloan","home","quickli","race","backyard","neighborhood","attempt","beat","parent","home","when","get","find","mr","roonei","wait","howev","jeani","appar","come","appreci","brother","crafti","sped","home","despit","mother","demand","find","two","first","she","pretend","scold","ferri","try","walk","home","hospit","ill","thank","mr","roonei","drive","home","make","sure","show","mr","roonei","wallet","left","behind","broke","earlier","ferri","race","room","make","bed","parent","check","after","leav","break","fourth","wall","impart","wisdom","audienc","life","move","pretti","fast","if","stop","look","around","could","miss","as","credit","roll","mr","roonei","dishevel","state","forc","catch","ride","back","school","school","bu","drive","student","home","and","tag","end","credit","ferri","emerg","bathroom","plead","audienc","directli","you","still","it","go","home","go","turn","around","reenter","bathroom"],"tmdb_score_value":7.5,"tmdb_score_count":1676,"imdb_score_value":7.8,"imdb_score_count":272769,"meta_score_value":61.0,"meta_score_count":272769}
