The ex-Special Forces operative hires himself out as a mercenary \"transporter\" who moves goods--human or otherwise. Very simple, he delivers, no questions asked. Frank has relocated from the French Mediterranean to Miami, Florida, where as a favor to a friend, Frank is driving for the wealthy Billings family. There's very little that can surprise The Transporter, but young Jack Billings has done just that; Frank has unexpectedly bonded with Jack, age 6, who he drives to and from school. But when Jack is kidnapped, Frank must use his battle-tested combat skills to retrieve the boy and thwart the kidnappers' master plan to release a virus that will kill anyone with whom it comes in contact.","tokens":["frank","martin","jason","statham","reloc","southern","franc","miami","florida","as","favor","becom","temporari","chauffeur","wealthi","bill","famili","the","marriag","jefferson","matthew","modin","audrei","bill","amber","valletta","great","strain","due","demand","high","profil","govern","job","frank","bond","son","jack","hunter","clari","drive","elementari","school","new","audi","a8","w12","[3]","later","somewhat","drunk","audrei","show","frank","home","tri","seduc","tactfulli","send","home","frank","prepar","arriv","inspector","tarconi","françoi","berléand","detect","friend","franc","come","spend","holidai","florida","frank","when","frank","take","jack","medic","checkup","realiz","bare","time","impostor","kill","replac","doctor","receptionist","a","lengthi","fight","erupt","villain","led","lola","kate","nauta","unarm","frank","frank","abl","escap","jack","arriv","jack","hous","receiv","phone","call","inform","jack","sight","sniper","capabl","penetr","car","bulletproof","glass","frank","forc","let","lola","car","speed","awai","jack","shake","mani","pursu","polic","car","thei","arriv","warehous","frank","meet","gianni","alessandro","gassman","ringlead","oper","frank","order","leav","without","jack","he","discov","explos","attach","car","succe","remov","prior","deton","jack","return","famili","payment","ransom","unknown","frank","jack","inject","deadli","viru","eventu","kill","anyon","child","breath","suspect","everyon","except","audrei","on","kidnapp","frank","track","on","fake","doctor","dimitri","jason","flemyng","tarconi","assist","frank","pretend","infect","dimitri","viru","let","escap","dimitri","panic","hurri","lab","get","cure","kill","tipov","frank","follow","behind","frank","kill","dimitri","frank","refus","bargain","doctor","charg","lab","hurl","two","vial","contain","antidot","window","traffic","frank","manag","retriev","on","vial","intact","frank","sneak","back","bill","home","tell","alreadi","ail","audrei","happen","he","us","antidot","jack","meanwhil","cough","jefferson","director","nation","drug","control","polici","address","head","mani","anti","drug","organ","around","world","confer","frank","drive","hous","gianni","decid","inject","remain","suppli","antidot","precaut","after","dispatch","gianni","mani","henchmen","frank","archvillain","gunpoint","gianni","explain","colombian","drug","cartel","pai","get","rid","enemi","frank","cannot","risk","kill","death","would","render","antidot","unus","then","arm","lola","show","lead","mexican","standoff","gianni","leav","lola","deal","frank","frank","final","manag","kill","kick","wine","rack","sharp","metal","point","frank","track","gianni","make","escap","helicopt","wait","jet","us","lamborghini","murcielago","roadster","gianni","garag","frank","speed","airport","board","gianni","jet","drive","onto","runwai","climb","onto","jet","nose","gear","frank","get","interior","plane","confront","gianni","pull","gun","when","wrestl","round","kill","pilot","plane","crash","ocean","frank","incapacit","gianni","paralyz","render","immobil","preserv","antidot","system","push","captiv","sink","plane","boat","converg","pick","the","bill","given","antidot","when","frank","visit","hospit","enter","room","see","jack","joke","he","silent","walk","back","car","tarconi","wait","he","drop","friend","airport","alon","frank","receiv","call","man","need","transport"],"tmdb_score_value":6.2,"tmdb_score_count":1333,"imdb_score_value":6.3,"imdb_score_count":171691,"meta_score_value":56.0,"meta_score_count":171691}
