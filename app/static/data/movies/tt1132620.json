Her body was never found, yet her uncle suspects murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history; but, the Vangers are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.","tokens":["mikael","blomkvist","journalist","work","magazin","millennium","local","swedish","newspap","publish","left","wing","polit","articl","lose","libel","case","brought","corrupt","swedish","industrialist","han","erik","wennerström","the","magazin","&","blomkvist","order","pai","damag","blomkvist","sentenc","short","prison","term","while","wait","serv","sentenc","blomkvist","approach","lawyer","henrik","vanger","frail","&","wealthi","octagenarian","the","vanger","group","live","remot","island","locat","sever","mile","north","stockholm","surround","famili","member","hous","it","turn","mr","vanger","want","hire","blomkvist","unearth","truth","behind","niec","harriet","disappear","40","year","ago","sixteen","although","bodi","never","found","mr","vanger","believ","murder","dai","accid","bridg","link","island","mainland","the","bridg","close","nobodi","could","get","&","nobodi","could","get","onto","island","yet","harriet","vanish","thin","air","although","40","year","pass","cold","case","mr","vanger","still","hope","learn","happen","di","befor","go","island","see","mr","vanger","blomkvist","unawar","follow","&","photograph","lisbeth","saland","goth","girl","make","live","comput","hacker","work","part","time","merrin","secur","inc","the","young","woman","troubl","past","due","crime","commit","youth","later","learn","much","younger","set","fire","man","presum","abus","father","car","must","report","probat","guardian","control","financ","on","dai","inform","previou","guardian","stroke","new","on","assign","dure","first","meet","lawyer","name","nil","bjurman","forc","perform","oral","sex","threaten","accus","caus","troubl","put","psychiatr","hospit","compli","some","dai","later","lisbeth","saland","attack","punk","subwai","tunnel","scuffl","laptop","comput","damag","requir","visit","nil","bjurman","request","monei","replac","she","arriv","apart","get","monei","new","comput","fulli","expect","might","endur","sexual","harrass","prepar","camcord","hidden","purs","record","violat","in","spite","seem","cooper","bjurman","catch","complet","guard","throw","hit","violent","handcuff","bed","bind","leg","proceed","brutal","rape","threaten","keep","quiet","abus","some","time","later","saland","show","unannounc","bjurman","door","turn","electr","stun","devic","she","strip","nake","bind","gag","done","she","plai","record","last","time","understand","proof","saland","proce","sodom","forcefulli","dildo","find","room","us","tattoo","needl","carv","perman","chest","abdomen","i","sadist","pig","&","rapist","she","threaten","reveal","evid","author","media","abid","her","rule","never","contact","touch","financ","releas","guardianship","glow","behavior","report","year","time","so","arous","suspicion","dure","investig","blomkvist","find","pc","hack","lisbeth","saland","send","anonym","clue","assist","investig","disappear","vanger","niec","harriet","he","abl","trace","back","saland","come","apart","back","stockholm","lisbeth","spent","night","anoth","woman","name","miriam","wu","lisbeth","appar","pick","night","he","persuad","collabor","research","togeth","dig","troubl","inform","show","someth","sinist","mr","vanger","rel","prei","fortun","perhap","succe","get","rid","harriet","sake","inherit","as","investig","relationship","progress","blomkvist","saland","return","cottag","blomkvist","rent","on","night","discov","lock","pick","&","someon","examin","research","blomkvist","decid","pai","clandestin","visit","home","on","mr","vanger","brother","alwai","nazi","sympath","he","surpris","insid","howev","old","man","rifl","point","face","martin","harriet","brother","appear","&","tri","calm","old","man","leav","mikael","blomkvist","confid","martin","lot","inform","dug","martin","leav","room","pretens","call","polic","while","martin","room","mikael","suddenli","question","martin","old","man","hous","revel","come","late","martin","inject","neck","kind","tranquil","when","awaken","find","ti","martin","reveal","serial","killer","kill","mani","women","past","four","decad","he","show","blomkvist","collect","photo","dead","women","rape","&","mutil","the","reason","i","take","whatev","i","want","he","admit","father","religi","fanat","taught","strangl","victim","martin","put","noos","around","blomkvist","neck","winch","hang","saland","research","archiv","mr","vanger","compani","come","back","hous","stai","find","blomkvist","miss","after","view","surveil","video","see","intrud","saland","rush","martin","hous","time","save","blomkvist","hang","take","golf","club","martin","head","arm","despit","broken","right","arm","martin","get","awai","car","drive","full","speed","uncertain","saland","motobik","hot","pursuit","to","avoid","frontal","collis","big","truck","martin","swerv","roadsid","car","overturn","steep","slope","come","rest","upsid","as","saland","arriv","beg","plead","help","look","recal","set","match","abus","father","car","year","martin","burn","aliv","gasolin","leak","catch","fire","saland","walk","awai","saland","want","face","p
