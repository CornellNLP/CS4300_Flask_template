Howard offers her a pair of crutches to help her remain mobile with her leg injury sustained from the car crash and tells her to \"get good on those\" before leaving the bunker. She has been given the information that there has been an alien attack and the outside world is poisoned. However, Howard and Emmett's intentions soon become questionable and Michelle is faced with a question: Is it better in here or out there?","tokens":["in","open","scene","woman","name","michel","mari","elizabeth","winstead","look","outsid","window","she","phone","someon","argu","michel","pack","bunch","belong","leav","home","michel","drive","far","citi","rural","area","her","fianc","ben","voic","bradlei","cooper","call","she","answer","let","talk","sai","sorri","leav","like","michel","hang","ben","call","michel","take","ey","road","second","car","get","slam","truck","caus","roll","ditch","michel","wake","head","wound","small","room","needl","arm","hook","salin","drip","to","horror","see","leg","chain","pipe","she","grab","salin","drip","pole","pull","phone","toward","call","help","unfortun","signal","someon","come","downstair","open","door","room","it","man","name","howard","john","goodman","he","claim","rescu","michel","car","accid","keep","aliv","howard","offer","michel","pair","wooden","crutch","help","remain","mobil","leg","injuri","sustain","car","crash","tell","get","good","leav","room","michel","set","carv","tip","on","crutch","sharpen","weapon","attack","howard","the","next","time","howard","show","michel","tri","stab","sharpen","crutch","unsuccessfulli","howard","quickli","grab","sedat","when","come","howard","calmli","explain","michel","attack","surfac","air","unbreath","brought","michel","bunker","beneath","farm","howard","bring","michel","airlock","see","go","outsid","noth","appear","unusu","michel","spot","howard","truck","red","paint","side","recogn","truck","hit","from","bedroom","clatter","sound","heard","outsid","howard","goe","yell","someon","screen","michel","leav","room","find","younger","man","name","emmett","john","gallagh","jr","hi","arm","broken","howard","tell","michel","emmett","knock","shelf","week","worth","food","emmett","appear","friendli","howard","he","explain","willingli","join","howard","build","bunker","emmett","claim","seen","attack","occur","describ","red","flash","run","get","insid","sai","explain","broken","arm","howard","make","michel","emmett","join","dinner","like","famili","michel","engag","pleasant","convers","emmett","appear","sort","flirti","caus","howard","angrili","respond","he","warn","two","behav","like","when","look","michel","grab","kei","a","rumbl","occur","overhead","distract","everyon","give","michel","chanc","smash","beer","bottl","howard","head","she","run","toward","airlock","tri","get","michel","stand","airlock","outsid","insid","howard","beg","go","outsid","a","car","arriv","middl","ag","woman","suzann","cryer","approach","plead","let","insid","skin","clearli","deform","infect","howard","urg","michel","let","woman","the","woman","grow","agit","start","bang","head","glass","door","now","fear","howard","mai","right","kind","chemic","weapon","attack","michel","begin","listen","he","apolog","previou","behavior","admit","hit","car","he","tell","michel","stitch","wound","head","broken","bottl","over","next","sever","dai","trio","becom","friendlier","start","work","togeth","like","real","famili","underground","bunker","howard","let","michel","borrow","cloth","belong","daughter","megan","lost","he","show","michel","pictur","megan","michel","emmett","also","bond","emmett","discuss","chanc","plai","sport","univers","skip","chanc","leav","town","afraid","michel","recount","time","saw","littl","girl","abus","dad","hardwar","store","felt","bad","walk","awai","noth","especi","consid","troublesom","childhood","on","dai","air","filtrat","system","goe","michel","small","enough","fit","vent","go","filtrat","room","she","reset","unit","notic","ladder","lead","outsid","beneath","window","on","window","help","scratch","l","p","trace","blood","on","floor","michel","find","two","bloodi","ear","recogn","pictur","megan","she","show","pictur","emmett","sai","girl","pictur","realli","girl","high","school","name","brittani","went","miss","back","the","two","realiz","howard","threat","need","get","michel","emmett","steal","howard","tool","start","construct","makeshift","biohazard","suit","ga","mask","howard","discov","stolen","tool","bring","vat","pylor","acid","dissolv","howard","demand","know","try","take","gun","emmett","speak","sai","michel","could","respect","wai","respect","howard","howard","forgiv","emmett","shoot","head","michel","finish","suit","tri","make","escap","howard","catch","push","vat","acid","toward","caus","slip","fall","face","first","onto","she","climb","head","toward","exit","the","acid","eat","electr","wire","start","fire","howard","follow","michel","push","shelf","top","she","climb","vent","head","filtrat","room","howard","stab","vent","knife","he","grab","onto","michel","make","end","slam","hand","hard","enough","rip","the","fire","start","spread","bunker","michel","put","suit","ga","mask","prepar","head","outsid","on","surfac","sun","shine","everyth","calm","she","see","howard","truck","goe","she","accident","rip","homemad","hazmat","suit","freak","quickli","repair","duct","tape","brought","but","hear","see","bird","overhead","take","mask","breath","fresh","air","she","stand","to
