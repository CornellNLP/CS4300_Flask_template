As a New Year's Resolution, Bridget decides to take control of her life, starting by keeping a diary in which she will always tell the complete truth. The fireworks begin when her charming though disreputable boss takes an interest in the quirky Miss Jones. Thrown into the mix are Bridget's band of slightly eccentric friends and a rather disagreeable acquaintance who Bridget cannot seem to stop running into or help finding quietly attractive.","tokens":["bridget","jone","ador","plai","rene","zellweg","unattach","30","someth","realiz","got","chang","life","after","new","year","ev","vow","new","year","on","get","act","togeth","she","lose","weight","smoke","drink","less","document","diari","complic","everyth","bridget","attract","boss","daniel","cleaver","plai","hugh","grant","man","question","charact","thei","launch","affair","bridget","fall","head","heel","realiz","later","feel","reciproc","boss","get","engag","anoth","woman","thrown","mix","barrist","mark","darci","colin","firth","admittedli","find","bridget","attract","bridget","find","repuls","it","bridget","clearli","see","truth","daniel","also","clearli","see","mark","man","feel","realli"],"tmdb_score_value":6.6,"tmdb_score_count":1835,"imdb_score_value":6.7,"imdb_score_count":194616,"meta_score_value":66.0,"meta_score_count":194616}
