The Bureau, directed by the fierce Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), enforces a strict family-planning agenda that the sisters outwit by taking turns assuming the identity of one person: Karen Settman. Taught by their grandfather (Willem Dafoe) who raised and named them - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - each can go outside once a week as their common identity, but are only free to be themselves in the prison of their own apartment. That is until, one day, Monday does not come home.","tokens":["in","distant","futur","overpopul","famin","forc","govern","undertak","drastic","on","child","polici","seven","ident","sister","portrai","noomi","rapac","live","hide","seek","exist","pursu","child","alloc","bureau","the","bureau","direct","fierc","nicolett","cayman","glenn","close","enforc","strict","famili","plan","agenda","sister","outwit","take","turn","assum","ident","on","person","karen","settman","taught","grandfath","willem","dafo","rais","name","mondai","tuesdai","wednesdai","thursdai","fridai","saturdai","sundai","go","outsid","week","common","ident","free","prison","apart","that","on","dai","mondai","come","home"],"tmdb_score_value":7.2,"tmdb_score_count":1818,"imdb_score_value":6.9,"imdb_score_count":59646,"meta_score_value":47.0,"meta_score_count":59646}
