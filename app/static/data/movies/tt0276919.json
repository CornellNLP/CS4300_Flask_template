Persuaded by Tom, the town agree to hide Grace, and in return she freely helps the locals. However, when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice, advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts, the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace, in return for their silence; and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster, even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her, the town's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave. But Grace has a deadly secret that the townsfolk will eventually encounter.","tokens":["dogvil","small","american","town","rocki","mountain","road","lead","nowher","go","mountain","the","film","begin","prologu","meet","dozen","fifteen","citizen","thei","portrai","lovabl","good","peopl","small","flaw","easi","forgiv","the","town","seen","point","view","tom","edison","paul","bettani","aspir","writer","procrastin","try","get","fellow","citizen","togeth","regular","meet","subject","moral","rearmament","it","clear","tom","want","succe","ag","father","moral","spiritu","leader","town","it","tom","first","meet","grace","nicol","kidman","run","gangster","appar","shot","grace","beauti","modest","woman","want","keep","run","tom","assur","mountain","ahead","difficult","pass","as","talk","gangster","approach","town","tom","quickli","hide","grace","nearbi","mine","on","gangster","ask","tom","seen","woman","deni","gangster","offer","reward","hand","card","phone","number","call","case","grace","show","tom","decid","us","grace","illustr","next","meet","wai","townspeopl","prove","inde","commit","commun","valu","will","help","stranger","thei","remain","skeptic","tom","propos","grace","given","chanc","prove","good","person","grace","accept","two","week","tom","explain","meet","convinc","townspeopl","like","on","tom","suggest","grace","offer","chore","citizen","talk","lone","blind","jack","mccai","ben","gazzara","help","run","small","shop","look","children","chuck","stellan","skarsgård","vera","patricia","clarkson","forth","after","initi","reluct","peopl","accept","help","chore","nobodi","realli","need","nevertheless","make","life","better","becom","part","commun","in","tacit","agreement","expect","continu","chore","gladli","even","paid","small","wage","return","grace","begin","make","friend","includ","jack","pretend","blind","grace","trick","admit","blind","earn","respect","after","two","week","everyon","vote","allow","stai","but","polic","arriv","place","miss","poster","grace","pictur","name","mission","hous","mood","darken","slightli","should","cooper","polic","still","thing","continu","usual","4th","juli","celebr","after","tom","awkwardli","admit","love","grace","whole","town","express","agreement","becom","better","place","thank","polic","arriv","replac","miss","poster","want","poster","grace","want","particip","bank","robberi","everyon","agre","must","innoc","sinc","time","robberi","took","place","chore","townspeopl","everi","dai","nevertheless","tom","argu","increas","risk","town","harbor","someon","want","crimin","grace","provid","quid","pro","quo","chore","townspeopl","within","time","less","pai","at","point","previous","voluntari","arrang","take","slightli","coerciv","natur","grace","clearli","uncomfort","idea","still","amen","want","pleas","tom","grace","agre","at","point","situat","worsen","addit","workload","grace","inevit","make","mistak","peopl","work","seem","equal","irrit","new","schedul","take","grace","the","situat","slowli","escal","male","citizen","make","small","sexual","advanc","grace","femal","on","becom","increasingli","abus","even","children","pervers","jason","mile","purinton","perhap","10","year","old","son","chuck","vera","ask","grace","spank","final","compli","much","provoc","soon","thereaft","chuck","return","home","rape","grace","becom","obviou","hardli","abl","defend","exploit","after","tom","discuss","possibl","escap","grace","blame","vera","spank","jason","rape","chuck","in","reveng","vera","threaten","grace","destroi","porcelain","figurin","creat","town","shop","acquir","littl","wage","given","grace","beg","merci","remind","vera","taught","children","stoicism","in","respons","vera","challeng","grace","stand","without","shed","tear","destroi","first","two","porcelain","figurin","grace","abl","hold","tear","vera","destroi","remain","figurin","the","symbol","belong","town","gone","know","must","leav","with","help","tom","ben","freight","driver","attempt","escap","appl","truck","find","rape","ben","return","town","the","town","agre","must","let","escap","the","monei","us","pai","ben","taken","tom","father","grace","blame","theft","tom","refus","come","forward","explain","wai","still","protect","grace","without","peopl","get","suspici","at","point","grace","statu","slave","final","confirm","collar","chain","larg","iron","wheel","must","carri","around","heavi","allow","move","anywher","outsid","town","more","humiliatingli","still","bell","attach","collar","announc","presenc","wherev","goe","tom","male","citizen","town","rape","thi","culmin","late","night","gener","assembl","grace","follow","tom","suggest","relat","calmli","endur","everyon","town","embarrass","complet","denial","townspeopl","final","decid","get","rid","when","tom","inform","grace","consol","attempt","make","love","adult","male","townperson","sex","grace","howev","refus","sex","angri","partli","grace","reject","even","realiz","would","eventu","stoop","forc","upon","like","everyon","els","town","tom","end","person","call","mobster","later","propos","unanim","approv","lock","shack","when","mobster",
