The plot is about an idealistic pro-Stalin security officer who decides to investigate a series of child murders in a country where supposedly this sort of crime doesn't exist. The state would not hear of the existence of a child murderer let alone a serial killer. He gets demoted and exiled but decides, with just the help of his wife, to continue pursuing the case.","tokens":["base","first","trilogi","tom","rob","smith","set","stalin","era","soviet","union","the","plot","idealist","pro","stalin","secur","offic","decid","investig","seri","child","murder","countri","supposedli","sort","crime","exist","the","state","would","hear","exist","child","murder","let","alon","serial","killer","he","get","demot","exil","decid","help","wife","continu","pursu","case"],"tmdb_score_value":6.1,"tmdb_score_count":692,"imdb_score_value":6.5,"imdb_score_count":53821,"meta_score_value":41.0,"meta_score_count":53821}
