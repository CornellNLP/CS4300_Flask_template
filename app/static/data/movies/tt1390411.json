The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. \"In the Heart of the Sea\" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.","tokens":["herman","melvil","visit","old","thoma","nickerson","whale","ship","essex","the","man","refus","speak","wife","insist","otherwis","believ","thoma","torment","refus","speak","stori","start","nantucket","farmer","whaler","owen","chase","convinc","wife","better","get","promis","captainci","but","execut","first","mate","instead","next","whale","journei","aboard","essex","accommod","young","captain","georg","pollard","descend","famili","prestigi","whaler","after","set","owen","show","de","facto","captain","skill","initi","on","dai","captain","order","crew","head","squall","despit","owen","warn","as","ship","get","damag","captain","order","turn","around","wave","wreak","havoc","ship","thi","start","open","animos","georg","owen","grudgingli","remain","alli","sake","ship","success","thei","captur","sperm","whale","chase","displai","expertis","correctli","guess","whale","would","abl","dive","deep","enough","drag","harpoon","boat","water","young","nickerson","get","first","experi","whale","oil","order","slip","insid","head","scoop","leftov","oil","but","whale","appear","essex","next","sever","month","after","sail","far","meet","spanish","captain","inform","larg","whale","pack","locat","also","demon","whale","both","georg","owen","agre","chase","pack","dismiss","demon","whale","myth","thei","reach","place","soon","find","demon","30","foot","long","white","whale","it","easili","damag","essex","hull","forc","crew","abandon","the","whale","oil","crew","gather","earlier","catch","fire","crew","abl","save","three","harpoon","boat","makeshift","sail","the","crew","ration","suppli","suppli","limit","the","crew","face","friction","among","week","pass","men","grow","larg","beard","grow","increasingli","haggard","after","dai","adrift","owen","spot","demon","whale","follow","the","second","mate","matthew","joi","get","injur","storm","again","owen","spot","demon","whale","time","attack","boat","kill","men","thei","get","wash","ashor","island","but","time","owen","find","cave","full","decompos","bodi","realiz","crew","strand","wait","vain","someon","rescu","owen","propos","leav","sinc","boat","come","thei","go","leav","injur","matthew","three","other","some","dai","adrift","on","men","di","as","ration","scarc","owen","propos","eat","remain","surviv","the","men","georg","boat","even","draw","straw","determin","sacrific","next","meal","back","present","old","nickerson","tearfulli","admit","sheer","atroc","cannib","draw","lot","see","next","meal","memori","refus","share","even","wife","the","crew","spot","demon","the","crew","cooper","owen","gain","kill","shot","posit","hold","makeshift","trident","captain","pollard","forg","island","he","whale","exchang","stare","cancel","owen","throw","the","two","remain","boat","separ","current","eventu","becom","rescu","pollard","boat","contain","pollard","on","survivor","found","anoth","whale","vessel","vessel","captain","horrifi","number","human","bone","boat","owen","boat","drift","near","harbor","rescu","ship","area","arriv","back","nantucket","owen","georg","intimid","execut","demand","owen","georg","lie","preserv","industri","reput","the","execut","want","horror","stori","monster","whale","human","cannib","spread","among","sailor","would","inevit","quit","fear","but","owen","refus","claim","would","dishonor","dismiss","crew","gone","georg","eventu","tell","truth","inquiri","owen","move","nantucket","the","young","nickerson","meet","owen","owen","leav","owen","give","nickerson","whale","bone","pin","badg","whale","prowess","nickerson","longingli","look","first","board","essex","the","elderli","nickerson","still","pin","present","ask","melvil","fact","includ","stori","melvil","respectfulli","answer","add","leav","other","nickerson","reliev","melvil","like","includ","atroc","stori","melvil","leav","nickerson","close","door"],"tmdb_score_value":6.5,"tmdb_score_count":1601,"imdb_score_value":6.9,"imdb_score_count":99954,"meta_score_value":47.0,"meta_score_count":99954}
