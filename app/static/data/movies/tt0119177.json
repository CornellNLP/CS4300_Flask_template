Society has categorized Vincent Freeman as less than suitable given his genetic make-up and he has become one of the underclass of humans that are only useful for menial jobs. To move ahead, he assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a perfect genetic specimen who is a paraplegic as a result of a car accident. With professional advice, Vincent learns to deceive DNA and urine sample testing. Just when he is finally scheduled for a space mission, his program director is killed and the police begin an investigation, jeopardizing his secret.","tokens":["in","distant","futur","genet","engin","human","common","dna","plai","primari","role","determin","social","class","vincent","ethan","hawk","conceiv","born","without","aid","technolog","suffer","nearli","erad","physic","dysfunct","myopia","congenit","heart","defect","well","given","life","expect","30","2","year","vincent","face","extrem","genet","discrimin","prejudic","the","wai","achiev","life","long","dream","becom","astronaut","break","law","imperson","valid","person","appropri","genet","advantag","[4]","he","assum","ident","jerom","eugen","morrow","jude","law","former","swim","star","despit","genet","profil","second","none","silver","medal","high","profil","competit","he","attempt","commit","suicid","jump","front","car","fell","short","goal","succeed","paralyz","waist","howev","incid","occur","outsid","countri","on","know","newli","acquir","disabl","thu","vincent","bui","ident","on","wiser","though","requir","orthoped","surgeri","increas","height","persist","practic","favor","right","hand","instead","left","contact","lens","replac","glass","match","jerom","ey","us","valid","dna","blood","tissu","urin","sampl","pass","genet","test","long","take","extrem","measur","leav","trace","ident","valid","but","object","scorn","piti","perpetr","unspeak","fraud","legal","exposur","would","subject","fine","social","consequ","would","far","extrem","heret","new","order","genet","determin","vincent","borrow","ladder","refer","ladder","structur","un","coil","dna","strand","harsher","languag","de","gene","erat","with","jerom","impress","genet","profil","easili","gain","access","gattaca","aerospac","corpor","interview","consist","entir","urin","test","prestigi","space","flight","conglomer","dai","with","equal","impress","determin","quickli","becom","compani","ac","celesti","navig","but","week","vincent","schedul","leav","saturn","moon","titan","mission","director","murder","evid","vincent","valid","dna","found","build","form","eyelash","the","presenc","unexpect","dna","attract","attent","polic","vincent","must","evad","ever","increas","secur","mission","launch","date","approach","pursu","relationship","co","worker","iren","cassini","uma","thurman","after","numer","close","call","investig","eventu","come","close","director","josef","adam","s","gottbett","arrest","murder","lead","detect","cover","investig","alan","arkin","the","director","reveal","murder","mission","director","order","bui","time","mission","launch","window","opportun","launch","open","everi","seventi","year","late","stop","launch","howev","vincent","appear","clear","confront","on","detect","reveal","vincent","estrang","brother","anton","loren","dean","anton","tri","convinc","vincent","go","protect","vincent","found","howev","soon","becom","appar","anton","act","insecur","concern","vincent","manag","get","better","despit","suppos","genet","superior","vincent","anton","settl","competit","children","see","could","swim","ocean","farthest","as","young","vincent","manag","beat","brother","save","drown","thi","simpli","refus","save","strength","swim","back","will","risk","everyth","succe","convers","brother","worri","preserv","enough","strength","swim","return","fear","kept","test","true","limit","anton","vincent","how","vincent","how","done","we","go","back","vincent","it","late","closer","side","anton","what","side","do","want","drown","us","vincent","you","want","know","i","thi","i","anton","i","never","save","anyth","swim","back","as","dai","launch","final","arriv","jerom","bid","vincent","farewel","sai","intend","travel","he","reveal","store","enough","genet","sampl","last","vincent","two","lifetim","overwhelm","grate","vincent","thank","jerom","lend","ident","allow","success","gattaca","jerom","repli","howev","grate","sinc","vincent","lent","jerom","dream","as","vincent","move","gattaca","complex","launch","site","stop","unexpect","dna","test","vincent","reluctantli","agre","take","test","even","though","none","jerom","genet","materi","hide","ident","the","test","result","uncov","vincent","valid","statu","doctor","lamar","xander","berkelei","reveal","known","vincent","true","ident","along","sai","for","futur","refer","right","hand","men","hold","left","just","on","thing","lamar","alter","test","result","allow","proce","regardless","confess","son","admir","vincent","want","astronaut","like","despit","unforeseen","genet","defect","would","alreadi","rule","as","shuttl","lift","jerom","shown","commit","suicid","insid","home","inciner","wear","silver","medal","turn","gold","flame","the","stori","center","ironi","perfect","jerom","fail","succe","despit","given","everi","advantag","imperfect","vincent","transcend","defici","forc","spirit","a","milder","version","disord","afflict","vincent","prevent","iren","take","part","space","flight","thi","dichotomi","show","eugen","polici","gattaca","world","set","advers","affect","human","vincent","jerom","well","invalid","valid","human","repres","a","coda","cut","final","film","list","variou","peopl","succee
