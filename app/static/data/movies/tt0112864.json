But when a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller Department Store the police go insane trying to figure out what's going on. Soon, a man named Simon calls and asks for McClane. Simon tells Inspector Walter Cobb that McClane is going to play a game called \"Simon Says\". He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he'll set off another bomb. With the help of a Harlem electrician, John McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles that the crafty terrorist gives him. But when a bomb goes off in a subway station right by the Federal Reserve (the biggest gold storage in the world) things start to get heated.","tokens":["when","bomb","explod","bonwit","teller","depart","store","man","call","simon","phone","major","case","unit","inspector","walter","cobb","polic","station","claim","respons","bomb","he","order","suspend","polic","offic","lt","john","mcclane","walk","middl","harlem","underwear","wear","sandwich","board","slogan","i","hate","nigger","mcclane","driven","cobb","three","offic","harlem","electrician","zeu","carver","spot","mcclane","tri","get","street","kill","gang","black","youth","attack","mcclane","carver","bare","escap","return","station","mcclane","carver","learn","simon","like","possess","sever","gallon","bio","chemic","agent","explos","stolen","night","simon","call","station","demand","mcclane","carver","put","seri","game","prevent","explos","mcclane","forc","lie","carver","gain","trust","on","simon","game","requir","mcclane","carver","travel","wall","street","subwai","station","70","block","awai","within","30","minut","stop","bomb","though","mcclane","manag","get","aboard","train","identifi","bomb","throw","train","car","simon","still","ignit","bomb","ravag","much","station","without","fatal","thank","mcclane","carver","the","two","met","fbi","agent","identifi","simon","simon","peter","gruber","brother","han","gruber","kill","mcclane","first","film","sever","cohort","dure","debrief","simon","call","group","warn","anoth","bomb","plant","on","new","york","citi","school","polic","radio","could","set","as","mcclane","carver","forc","complet","game","identifi","school","polic","organ","massiv","search","everi","school","forc","team","reli","telephon","commun","mcclane","plai","simon","game","realiz","someth","wrong","return","wall","street","carver","continu","follow","simon","instruct","mcclane","find","simon","men","raid","feder","reserv","bank","ruin","subwai","system","make","$140","billion","gold","bullion","vault","haul","awai","dump","truck","mcclane","attempt","follow","dump","truck","aqueduct","simon","destroi","cofferdam","flood","tunnel","mcclane","escap","regroup","carver","thei","continu","follow","dump","truck","tanker","make","dare","attempt","board","quickli","caught","at","time","polic","attempt","evacu","school","think","bomb","mcclane","carver","find","simon","instead","us","rest","explos","rig","tanker","explod","would","send","gold","bottom","sea","after","simon","leav","mcclane","carver","escap","doom","tanker","bomb","deton","as","regroup","polic","wound","tend","mcclane","reveal","gold","ship","replac","scrap","metal","simon","like","gotten","awai","carver","prompt","mcclane","call","estrang","wife","holli","line","discov","aspirin","bottl","given","simon","identifi","nearbi","border","town","quebec","mcclane","lead","raid","along","royal","canadian","mount","polic","warehous","simon","men","start","distribut","gold","simon","attempt","escap","helicopt","shoot","mcclane","mcclane","abl","fire","upon","power","line","sever","onto","helicopt","destroi","carver","join","mcclane","convinc","finish","call","holli","nearbi","pai","phone"],"tmdb_score_value":7.0,"tmdb_score_count":2512,"imdb_score_value":7.6,"imdb_score_count":325251,"meta_score_value":58.0,"meta_score_count":325251}
