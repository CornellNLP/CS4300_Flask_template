However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than anticipated with Trench's forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.","tokens":["robert","trench","undercov","dea","agent","take","advantag","gunman","michael","stigman","idea","rob","bank","bust","mob","boss","howev","prove","success","much","monei","seiz","anticip","trench","forc","stop","getawai","complic","thing","still","stigman","turn","naval","intellig","agent","shoot","trench","take","monei","the","interservic","debacl","suddenli","find","trench","stigman","bloodi","web","corrupt","clandestin","rivalri","hunt","blackmail","isol","monei","side","law","now","fugit","must","work","togeth","find","wai","situat","on","turn"],"tmdb_score_value":6.5,"tmdb_score_count":1858,"imdb_score_value":6.7,"imdb_score_count":172993,"meta_score_value":55.0,"meta_score_count":172993}
