The creator died before he could finish Edward's hands; instead, he is left with metal scissors for hands. Since then, he has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers him and welcomes him into her home. At first, everyone welcomes him into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse.","tokens":["on","even","elderli","woman","tell","granddaught","bedtim","stori","snow","come","tell","stori","young","man","name","edward","johnni","depp","scissor","hand","creation","old","inventor","vincent","price","the","inventor","final","result","humanlik","young","boi","everyth","except","hand","inventor","suffer","heart","attack","di","act","give","pair","real","hand","edward","leav","unfinish","forev","mani","year","edward","creat","local","avon","saleswoman","peg","bogg","diann","wiest","visit","decrepit","gothic","mansion","hill","edward","live","there","find","edward","alon","upon","realiz","virtual","harmless","decid","take","home","edward","becom","friend","peg","young","son","kevin","robert","oliveri","husband","bill","alan","arkin","he","later","fall","love","bogg","beauti","teenag","daughter","kim","winona","ryder","despit","initi","fear","peg","neighbor","impress","edward","adept","hedg","trim","hair","cut","skill","scissor","hand","two","townspeopl","religi","fanat","name","esmeralda","o","lan","jone","kim","boyfriend","jim","anthoni","michael","hall","impress","on","housew","neighborhood","joyc","kathi","baker","ag","seductress","suggest","edward","open","hair","cut","salon","while","examin","propos","site","attempt","seduc","back","room","caus","edward","leav","state","panic","want","monei","van","jim","take","advantag","edward","abil","pick","lock","us","attempt","break","parent","hous","the","burglar","alarm","sound","everyon","except","edward","flee","despit","kim","angri","insist","return","edward","arrest","releas","psycholog","examin","reveal","isol","allow","live","without","sens","realiti","common","sens","at","time","arrest","offic","befriend","meanwhil","infuri","edward","reject","joyc","exact","reveng","claim","tri","rape","thi","ad","break","caus","mani","neighbor","question","person","therefor","ruin","popular","reput","dure","christma","season","edward","fear","outcast","almost","everyon","around","except","bogg","famili","result","famili","becom","outcast","well","while","famili","set","christma","decor","edward","creat","angel","ic","sculptur","the","shave","creat","effect","fall","snow","kim","danc","jim","call","kim","distract","edward","accident","cut","hand","jim","sai","edward","intention","harm","attack","edward","run","awai","tear","cloth","peg","gave","wander","neighborhood","rage","kim","fed","jim","behavior","toward","edward","break","goe","friend","van","get","drunk","while","peg","bill","search","edward","return","kim","greet","hug","when","kevin","almost","run","jim","drunk","friend","edward","push","wai","cut","face","caus","wit","think","attack","when","polic","arriv","edward","flee","hilltop","mansion","neighbor","form","angri","mob","led","joyc","follow","despit","peg","bill","plea","offic","jim","tri","deceiv","everyon","fire","shot","air","give","impress","edward","dead","mob","refus","listen","continu","mansion","see","edward","realli","dead","kim","run","mansion","reunit","edward","jim","follow","attack","edward","anger","jim","brutal","assault","kim","edward","stab","jim","stomach","push","window","death","kim","confess","love","edward","share","kiss","sai","goodby","return","downstair","kim","li","townspeopl","sai","edward","jim","kill","fight","she","tell","roof","cave","show","disembodi","scissor","hand","similar","edward","shock","sadden","death","neighbor","return","home","at","time","guilti","joyc","realiz","li","done","the","elderli","woman","actual","reveal","kim","old","ag","finish","tell","granddaught","stori","sai","never","saw","edward","she","chose","visit","want","rememb","wai","youth","she","also","mention","edward","still","aliv","seemingli","immort","sinc","artifici","never","ag","creat","snow","ic","sculptur","fall","upon","neighborhood","she","tell","granddaught","sometim","still","catch","danc","while","edward","creat","ic","sculptur","flashback","young","kim","shown","danc","snow","fall","angel","ic","sculptur","sourc","wikipedia"],"tmdb_score_value":7.6,"tmdb_score_count":4977,"imdb_score_value":7.9,"imdb_score_count":394676,"meta_score_value":74.0,"meta_score_count":394676}
