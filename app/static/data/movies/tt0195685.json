This losing streak even extends to a failed lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully browbeats her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one takes her seriously, with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. What she discovers is that the company is trying quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and, in turn, poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her law firm in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-billion dollar corporation.","tokens":["desper","work","unskil","erin","brockovich","julia","robert","singl","parent","three","take","rel","inconsequenti","job","legal","assist","california","law","firm","low","wage","while","organ","paperwork","pertain","real","estat","case","puzzl","notic","medic","record","on","file","on","whim","littl","investig","come","suspect","land","purchas","pacif","ga","electr","pg&e","land","chromium","contamin","result","pg&e","environment","irrespons","action","examin","local","water","record","interview","resid","ill","exposur","poison","chromium","confirm","erin","suspicion","pursuit","legal","proceed","pg&e","would","seem","beyond","capabl","small","law","firm","work","still","erin","succe","make","boss","ed","masri","albert","finnei","passion","case","take","both","ed","erin","must","make","great","sacrific","live","legal","cost","spread","ed","thin","round","clock","work","take","erin","touch","boyfriend","kid","erin","kid","resent","lack","attent","attempt","explain","merit","eldest","son","futil","on","dai","eldest","son","happen","across","on","mani","document","pertain","pg&e","case","he","read","child","ag","ill","know","erin","work","help","child","ask","child","mother","cannot","provid","need","help","when","erin","explain","child","mother","ill","son","first","time","appreci","natur","import","erin","work","in","end","erin","special","abil","bond","victim","chromium","contaminaton","famili","ed","legal","administr","prowess","kei","ingredi","make","case","pg&e","as","team","manag","successfulli","lai","groundwork","payment","legal","damag","pg&e","harm"],"tmdb_score_value":7.1,"tmdb_score_count":996,"imdb_score_value":7.3,"imdb_score_count":149765,"meta_score_value":73.0,"meta_score_count":149765}
