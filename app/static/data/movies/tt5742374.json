With an infernal reputation of being a brutal man of results, the specialised in recovering missing teens enforcer will embark on a blood-drenched rescue mission, when Nina, the innocent 13-year-old daughter of an ambitious New York senator, never returns home. But amidst half-baked leads and a desperate desire to shake off his shoulders the heavy burden of a personal hell, Joe's frenzied plummet into the depths of Tartarus is inevitable, and every step Joe takes to flee the pain, brings him closer to the horrors of insanity. In the end, what is real, and what is a dream? Can there be a new chapter in Joe's life when he keeps running around in circles?","tokens":["balanc","feverish","dreamlik","hallucin","torment","past","grim","disori","realiti","grizzl","joe","traumatis","gulf","war","veteran","unflinch","hire","gun","live","frail","elderli","mother","finish","successfulli","yet","anoth","job","with","infern","reput","brutal","man","result","specialis","recov","miss","teen","enforc","embark","blood","drench","rescu","mission","nina","innoc","13","year","old","daughter","ambiti","new","york","senat","never","return","home","but","amidst","half","bake","lead","desper","desir","shake","shoulder","heavi","burden","person","hell","joe","frenzi","plummet","depth","tartaru","inevit","everi","step","joe","take","flee","pain","bring","closer","horror","insan","in","end","real","dream","can","new","chapter","joe","life","keep","run","around","circl"],"tmdb_score_value":6.8,"tmdb_score_count":143,"imdb_score_value":7.2,"imdb_score_count":12579,"meta_score_value":85.0,"meta_score_count":12579}
