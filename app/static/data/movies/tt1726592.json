The man explains that he is her husband, Ben, and that she suffered brain damage from a car accident ten years earlier. Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of her life from her early twenties onwards. Christine receives treatment from Dr. Nasch, a neurologist at a local hospital who provides her a camera to record her thoughts and progress each day, and calls her every morning to remind her to watch the video in the camera. Soon, she starts to discover the truth around her.","tokens":["a","woman","lost","memori","begin","feel","doubt","husband","sincer","honesti","she","aid","therapist","the","therapist","ask","record","memori","videocamera","she","feel","doubt","reliabl","therapist"],"tmdb_score_value":6.2,"tmdb_score_count":807,"imdb_score_value":6.3,"imdb_score_count":59053,"meta_score_value":41.0,"meta_score_count":59053}
