Despite the pressure he constantly receives from the local authorities, Rick's cafe has become a kind of haven for refugees seeking to obtain illicit letters that will help them escape to America. But when Ilsa, a former lover of Rick's, and her husband, show up to his cafe one day, Rick faces a tough challenge which will bring up unforeseen complications, heartbreak and ultimately an excruciating decision to make.","tokens":["in","earli","year","world","war","ii","decemb","1941","moroccan","coastal","citi","casablanca","attract","peopl","world","particularli","nazi","occupi","europ","mani","transient","try","get","europ","try","make","buck","most","gambler","refuge","nazi","resist","fighter","plain","old","crook","find","wai","rick","café","américain","swank","nightclub","own","american","expatri","rick","blain","humphrei","bogart","though","learn","later","rick","harbor","enough","ideal","put","risk","fight","fascism","embitt","cynic","profess","neutral","detach","i","stick","neck","nobodi","ugart","peter","lorr","come","rick","letter","transit","obtain","kill","two","german","courier","the","paper","allow","bearer","travel","freeli","around","german","control","europ","includ","neutral","lisbon","portug","lisbon","rel","easi","get","unit","state","thei","almost","priceless","refuge","strand","casablanca","ugart","plan","make","fortun","sell","highest","bidder","due","arriv","club","later","night","howev","exchang","take","place","ugart","arrest","polic","command","captain","loui","renault","claud","rain","a","corrupt","vichi","offici","renault","accommod","nazi","unknown","renault","nazi","ugart","left","letter","rick","safekeep","somehow","despis","on","i","trust","through","renault","rick","introduc","small","compani","nazi","offic","overse","casablanca","among","major","strasser","conrad","veidt","come","casablanca","inspect","staff","make","effort","hide","suspicion","rick","strasser","goe","far","ask","rick","imagin","german","war","effort","reach","shore","unit","state","even","new","york","citi","rick","grave","warn","certain","section","new","york","major","i","advis","try","invad","soon","reason","rick","bitter","enter","life","ilsa","lund","ingrid","bergman","arriv","husband","victor","laszlo","paul","henreid","purchas","letter","laszlo","renown","czech","resist","leader","escap","nazi","concentr","camp","the","letter","wai","escap","america","continu","work","at","time","ilsa","first","met","fell","love","rick","pari","believ","husband","kill","when","discov","still","aliv","left","rick","abruptli","without","explan","return","laszlo","leav","rick","feel","betrai","after","club","close","ilsa","return","try","explain","rick","drunk","bitterli","refus","listen","at","differ","time","rick","ilsa","torment","ask","club","piano","player","sam","doolei","wilson","plai","as","time","goe","by","song","love","togeth","pari","the","famou","line","plai","sam","refer","song","actual","appear","movi","ilsa","sai","plai","sam","later","rick","order","plai","while","sam","plai","song","rick","reminisc","affair","ilsa","pari","though","seem","happi","rick","mood","near","end","time","togeth","cautiou","learn","husband","mai","dead","when","nazi","begin","close","pari","receiv","word","victor","inde","aliv","anoth","part","europ","she","rick","plan","take","train","southern","franc","escap","german","armi","assault","howev","platform","rick","receiv","handwritten","letter","she","write","explain","leav","love","rick","sam","leav","without","the","next","night","laszlo","suspect","rick","letter","speak","privat","obtain","thei","interrupt","group","nazi","offic","led","major","strasser","command","sam","piano","begin","sing","die","wacht","rhein","the","watch","rhine","german","patriot","song","infuri","laszlo","order","hous","band","plai","la","marseillais","honor","occupi","franc","the","band","leader","look","rick","guidanc","nod","laszlo","start","sing","alon","first","long","suppress","patriot","fervor","grip","crowd","everyon","join","drown","german","in","retali","strasser","order","renault","close","club","later","night","ilsa","confront","rick","desert","cafe","he","refus","give","document","even","threaten","gun","she","unabl","shoot","confess","still","love","rick","decid","help","laszlo","lead","believ","stai","behind","laszlo","leav","laszlo","jail","minor","charg","rick","convinc","renault","releas","laszlo","promis","set","much","seriou","crime","possess","letter","transit","howev","rick","doubl","cross","renault","forc","gunpoint","assist","escap","at","last","moment","rick","make","ilsa","get","plane","lisbon","husband","tell","would","regret","stai","mayb","todai","mayb","tomorrow","soon","rest","life","major","strasser","drive","tip","renault","rick","shoot","tri","interven","when","men","arriv","renault","inform","strasser","dead","cover","rick","sharpli","order","round","usual","suspect","he","recommend","leav","casablanca","renault","suggest","join","resist","walk","fog","rick","sai","loui","i","think","begin","beauti","friendship"],"tmdb_score_value":8.0,"tmdb_score_count":1851,"imdb_score_value":8.5,"imdb_score_count":442979,"meta_score_value":100.0,"meta_score_count":442979}
