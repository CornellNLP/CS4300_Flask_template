Peter LaFleur doesn't want to lose his gym to Goodman, but can't find a way to get $50,000 in time. Peter and his gang of gym buddies think of ways to raise money, finally settling on winning a dodge ball tournament. White Goodman retaliates by creating his own dodge ball team to finish off Peter. Peter's team doesn't do too well, until legendary ADAA champ Patches O'Houlihan turns up ready to train them.","tokens":["the","movi","open","infomerci","globo","gym","america","corp","we","introduc","white","goodman","ben","stiller","talk","globo","gym","beacon","human","physic","fitn","extrem","talk","compani","first","custom","creator","globo","gym","lifestyl","then","reveal","peter","la","fluer","vinc","vaughn","watch","infomerci","tv","hous","peter","owner","oper","averag","joe","gymnasium","he","wake","begin","get","readi","anoth","dai","averag","joe","gymnasium","hi","car","bare","make","build","averag","joe","push","peopl","make","membership","gym","we","introduc","member","gym","includ","former","airport","employe","dwight","chri","william","teenag","cheerlead","wannab","justin","justin","long","obscur","sport","fan","gordon","stephen","root","steve","the","pirat","alan","tudyk","learn","peter","collect","membership","fee","sever","month","justin","tell","peter","humili","compet","high","school","cheerlead","audit","and","owen","tell","peter","date","troubl","and","peter","reassur","owen","somebodi","everybodi","rare","circumst","two","somebodi","everybodi","peter","call","jackpot","peter","enter","offic","greet","attract","auditor","name","kate","veatch","christin","taylor","sort","averag","joe","financi","woe","secretli","hire","white","goodman","gut","averag","joe","remain","asset","as","peter","kate","get","acquaint","kate","inform","gym","taken","white","goodman","owner","oper","globo","gym","america","corp","peter","goe","globo","gym","meet","white","appear","hostil","seem","televis","white","inform","peter","$50k","hole","plan","bulldoz","averag","joe","turn","place","park","lot","membership","it","learn","white","extrem","bizarr","lust","junk","food","employ","realli","unusu","method","help","ignor","temptat","back","averag","joe","peter","inform","member","gym","financi","difficulti","go","round","q&a","session","figur","best","cours","action","take","owen","suggest","hold","car","wash","peter","agre","unfortun","bad","time","plan","mean","match","group","attract","women","bikini","happen","hold","car","wash","across","street","the","custom","successfulli","manag","attract","creepi","gui","monster","truck","angri","bull","dog","keep","pai","justin","wash","car","the","car","wash","failur","actual","wound","cost","averag","joe","monei","addit","$50k","hole","alreadi","peter","decid","alreadi","defeat","even","though","done","anyth","make","monei","requir","member","gordon","pibb","fan","obscur","sport","read","magazin","obscur","sport","quarterli","decid","got","shot","$50k","plai","dodgebal","peter","agre","justin","find","train","tape","need","the","tape","host","american","dodgebal","associ","of","america","adaa","featur","legend","patch","o","houlihan","explain","rule","dodgebal","after","watch","video","coupl","practic","round","feel","readi","tournament","unfortun","pair","girl","scout","troop","#417","humili","on","side","game","lose","but","averag","joe","save","on","member","troop","#417","test","posit","number","perform","enhanc","steroid","low","grade","beaver","tranquil","that","mean","averag","joe","qualifi","la","vega","open","that","night","celebr","victori","confront","white","goodman","announc","also","form","dodgebal","team","serious","competit","player","includ","fit","counsel","meshel","jone","jamal","duff","extrem","strong","lethal","romanian","player","averag","joe","member","owen","strang","attract","gordon","tell","white","fail","win","region","qualifi","match","white","tell","gordon","help","adaa","presid","shed","unwant","poundag","therefor","ow","favor","white","humili","knock","trai","full","mexican","food","go","home","park","lot","peter","confront","strang","man","motor","wheelchair","tell","region","qualifi","game","averag","joe","troop","#417","absolut","worst","displai","dodgebal","seen","40","year","the","strang","man","reveal","none","adaa","legend","patch","o","houlihan","rip","torn","he","agre","becom","new","coach","begin","train","varieti","unusu","method","includ","throw","wrench","make","dodg","traffic","while","practic","white","goodman","present","cardboard","cutout","hidden","camera","record","everi","move","it","attach","30","dai","trial","membership","globo","gym","meant","insult","dure","practic","round","kate","pick","ball","throw","decapit","cut","goodman","impress","peter","white","try","woo","kate","join","respect","side","kate","ultim","agre","join","averag","joe","find","white","creepi","would","want","noth","see","lose","end","final","match","it","time","vega","open","dodgebal","championship","it","held","everi","year","la","vega","learn","annex","year","broadcast","espn","8","the","ocho","motto","if","almost","sport","the","ocho","the","announc","tournament","cotton","mcknight","gari","cole","pepper","brook","jason","bateman","averag","joe","make","rather","bizarr","first","impress","adaa","commun","owen","throw","old","uniform","replac","new","on","thank","ship","error","forc","plai","first","round","s&m","garb","peopl","suppos","receiv"
