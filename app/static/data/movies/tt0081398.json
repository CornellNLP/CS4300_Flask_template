But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone.","tokens":["the","film","open","1964","older","fatter","jake","lamotta","robert","de","niro","practic","stand","comic","routin","debut","comedi","nightclub","a","flashback","shift","box","career","1941","oppon","jimmi","reev","infam","cleveland","bout","lose","fight","fix","result","caus","fight","break","end","match","jake","brother","joei","lamotta","joe","pesci","spar","partner","also","respons","organ","fight","joei","discuss","potenti","shot","titl","on","mob","connect","salvi","batt","frank","vincent","wai","brother","hous","neighborhood","bronx","when","final","settl","hous","jake","admit","much","faith","abil","accompani","brother","local","open","air","swim","pool","restless","jake","spot","15","year","old","girl","name","vicki","cathi","moriarti","edg","pool","although","remind","brother","alreadi","marri","opportun","invit","dai","soon","come","true","joei","give","jake","two","fight","sugar","rai","robinson","set","two","year","apart","jake","lose","second","judg","rule","favor","sugar","rai","leav","sport","temporarili","conscript","unit","state","armi","thi","deter","jake","win","six","straight","fight","fear","grow","wife","vicki","feel","men","particularli","toni","janiro","oppon","forthcom","fight","keen","enough","show","sexual","jealous","beat","front","local","mob","boss","tommi","como","nichola","colosanto","vicki","the","recent","triumph","janiro","tout","major","boost","belt","joei","discuss","journalist","though","joei","briefli","distract","see","vicki","approach","tabl","salvi","crew","joei","word","vicki","sai","give","brother","blame","salvi","joei","vicious","attack","fight","spill","outsid","club","when","tommi","como","hear","two","rose","fist","public","place","order","apolog","tell","joei","mean","busi","at","swim","pool","joei","tell","jake","realli","want","shot","take","dive","first","in","fight","billi","fox","jake","even","bother","put","fight","jake","suspend","board","suspicion","throw","fight","though","realiz","error","judgment","late","thi","littl","harm","career","final","win","titl","marcel","cerdan","open","air","brigg","stadium","three","year","pass","jake","ask","brother","fought","salvi","copca","vicki","jake","ask","joei","affair","wife","joei","refus","answer","decid","leav","jake","decid","find","truth","interrog","wife","affair","sarcast","state","sex","entir","neighborhood","includ","brother","salvi","tommi","como","suck","brother","cock","knock","bathroom","door","wife","briefli","hide","run","straight","toward","brother","hous","start","fight","joei","defend","championship","belt","laurent","dauthuil","make","call","brother","fight","joei","assum","salvi","end","jake","sai","noth","thi","drag","jake","eventu","lose","sugar","rai","robinson","final","violent","encount","let","sugar","rai","land","sever","hard","blow","punish","a","coupl","year","later","middl","photo","shoot","jake","lamotta","surround","wife","children","tell","journalist","offici","retir","bought","new","properti","after","stai","night","new","nightclub","miami","vicki","tell","want","divorc","plan","sinc","retir","arrest","introduc","ag","girl","pose","21","year","old","men","serv","jail","sentenc","fail","rais","bribe","monei","take","jewel","championship","belt","instead","sell","belt","in","jail","cell","jake","brutal","pound","wall","whilst","sorrowfulli","question","misfortun","sit","alon","cry","despair","return","new","york","citi","serv","sentenc","meet","estrang","brother","joei","garag","park","lot","share","nervou","hug","go","back","begin","sequenc","jake","refer","i","coulda","contend","scene","on","waterfront","complain","brother","also","keen","enough","give","slack","dart","across","room","inform","crowd","auditorium","stage","hand","camera","remain","pivot","mirror","lamotta","chant","i","boss","whilst","shadow","box","the","film","end","ambigu","note","biblic","quot","all","i","know","onc","i","blind","i","see","symbol","even","men","like","lamotta","redeem"],"tmdb_score_value":7.8,"tmdb_score_count":1276,"imdb_score_value":8.2,"imdb_score_count":268423,"meta_score_value":92.0,"meta_score_count":268423}
