Hunt now has a fiancé, Julia, who believes that he works for the traffic department when he really trains younger IMF agents to go into combat. He is assigned to his last mission. His mission, should he choose to accept it is to capture Davian, who is selling a toxic weapon called the rabbits foot. But Davian is reckless, cruel, and deathly. He promises Hunt that he will find Julia, hurt her, and Ethan will be too dead to help her. The mission is no more different to others, its dangerous, smart, and impossible; but now it's personal.","tokens":["ethan","hunt","tom","cruis","retir","imf","team","leader","instead","opt","quiet","life","fiancé","julia","michel","monaghan","hospit","nurs","captiv","open","sequenc","dure","engag","parti","ethan","contact","imf","oper","director","musgrav","billi","crudup","provid","dispos","camera","after","view","video","hidden","camera","find","musgrav","want","rescu","agent","lindsei","farri","keri","russel","ethan","protégé","captur","berlin","owen","davian","philip","seymour","hoffman","promin","dealer","intern","black","market","captor","open","he","reluctantli","agre","particip","mission","meet","team","select","consist","declan","gormlei","jonathan","rhy","meyer","zhen","maggi","q","old","partner","luther","stickel","ving","rhame","the","team","assault","enemi","stronghold","berlin","extract","agent","farri","successfulli","di","escap","explos","capsul","place","insid","head","deton","after","lindsei","funer","ethan","notifi","packag","sent","lindsei","discov","microdot","hidden","stamp","blank","postcard","ethan","discuss","possibl","import","luther","decid","keep","exist","secret","us","inform","recov","laptop","berlin","mission","ethan","decid","go","davian","target","meet","vatican","citi","lucr","transact","involv","mysteri","object","codenam","the","rabbit","foot","appar","take","place","neither","ethan","superior","director","brassel","laurenc","fishburn","musgrav","author","mission","befor","leav","ethan","reassur","julia","relationship","promptli","marri","hospit","small","ceremoni","the","team","arriv","rome","set","elabor","plan","abduct","davian","bare","avoid","disast","process","the","oper","succe","nonetheless","ethan","interrog","davian","flight","home","howev","anger","davian","quiet","confid","threat","kill","wife","attempt","throw","plane","talk","stickel","while","transport","davian","across","chesapeak","bai","bridg","tunnel","convoi","luther","hand","ethan","laptop","comput","plai","video","messag","decod","microdot","lindsei","discov","director","brassel","mole","leak","inform","davian","imf","oper","suddenli","ethan","team","attack","foreign","mercenari","us","uav","drone","manag","extract","davian","rememb","davian","threat","kill","wife","ethan","immedi","rush","hospit","julia","work","he","arriv","bare","moment","late","find","julia","alreadi","abduct","at","moment","despair","ethan","receiv","call","davian","proposit","must","retriev","rabbit","foot","facil","shanghai","within","48","hour","wife","kill","ethan","anxiou","begin","mission","rescu","wife","abruptli","taken","custodi","imf","accus","mastermind","ambush","howev","manag","escap","help","musgrav","intercept","ethan","call","davian","instruct","ethan","go","shanghai","in","shanghai","ethan","reunit","team","manag","infiltr","heavili","guard","build","contain","rabbit","foot","steal","ethan","goe","establish","meet","place","davian","wait","told","ask","question","made","drink","substanc","knock","he","awak","seedi","room","davian","inject","explos","charg","like","on","kill","lindsei","head","the","scene","shown","prologu","ensu","julia","ethan","bound","chair","davian","threaten","kill","julia","told","locat","rabbit","foot","ethan","panic","insist","deliv","howev","count","ten","davian","execut","julia","after","davian","leav","musgrav","enter","reveal","traitor","explain","situat","stun","ethan","davian","sell","rabbit","foot","known","middl","eastern","enemi","unit","state","result","attack","anticip","control","gener","accept","loss","concept","fals","flag","attack","taken","next","level","thi","justifi","massiv","retali","would","result","internation","support","hostil","takeov","region","he","show","ethan","dead","julia","actual","on","davian","incompet","personnel","wear","mask","us","make","sure","ethan","brought","real","rabbit","foot","julia","still","aliv","ethan","escap","bite","musgrav","arm","attack","take","phone","us","track","julia","locat","instrument","assist","benji","simon","pegg","imf","laboratori","technician","after","furiou","run","neighborhood","ethan","final","find","julia","free","davian","activ","bomb","ethan","head","the","result","split","nois","ethan","head","render","incap","think","properli","defend","davian","begin","savag","beat","ethan","davian","prepar","kill","julia","ethan","manag","make","impress","comeback","hurl","davian","window","davian","kill","truck","run","ethan","scuffl","ethan","bottom","clear","truck","unabl","find","defibril","ethan","loosen","power","cabl","abl","put","electr","bodi","deactiv","bomb","head","quickli","teach","julia","shoot","beretta","pistol","julia","turn","power","seemingli","kill","ethan","musgrav","attack","after","kill","musgrav","successfulli","resuscit","ethan","cpr","two","walk","rabbit","foot","ethan","proce","tell","julia","truth","secret","life","back","headquart","ethan","congratul","heroic","action","leav","honeymoon","julia","bless","applaud","teammat","promis","anoth","mission","white","hous","keen","contact"],"tmdb_sco
