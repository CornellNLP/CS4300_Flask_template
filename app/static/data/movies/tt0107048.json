This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realisation that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing EVERY day.","tokens":["on","februari","1","self","center","sour","tv","meteorologist","phil","connor","bill","murrai","new","produc","rita","andi","macdowel","cameraman","larri","chri","elliott","fiction","pittsburgh","televis","station","wpbh","tv9","travel","punxsutawnei","pennsylvania","cover","annual","groundhog","dai","festiv","punxsutawnei","phil","groundhog","have","grown","tire","assign","phil","grudgingli","give","report","festiv","parad","after","celebr","conclud","blizzard","develop","connor","predict","would","miss","close","road","shut","long","distanc","phone","servic","forc","team","return","punxsutawnei","connor","awaken","next","morn","howev","find","februari","2","dai","unfold","almost","exactli","wai","connor","chang","behavior","peopl","sai","thing","said","previou","dai","unless","connor","chang","someth","he","awar","repetit","everyon","els","seem","live","februari","2","first","time","thi","recurs","repeat","follow","morn","on","for","connor","groundhog","dai","begin","morn","6","00","a","m","wake","room","victorian","bed","breakfast","hi","clock","radio","alwai","plai","song","sonni","&","cher","i","got","you","babe","hi","memori","previou","dai","intact","trap","seemingli","endless","time","loop","repeat","dai","small","town","after","briefli","try","ration","situat","think","insan","connor","take","advantag","learn","dai","event","inform","abl","gather","town","inhabit","find","action","long","term","consequ","he","revel","situat","time","seduc","beauti","women","steal","monei","even","drive","drunk","experienc","polic","chase","howev","attempt","seduc","produc","rita","met","repeat","failur","he","begin","tire","dread","exist","start","dai","smash","alarm","clock","profess","inan","groundhog","dai","holidai","newscast","in","vain","attempt","break","cycl","kidnap","phil","groundhog","after","polic","pursuit","connor","drive","stolen","truck","quarri","caus","man","rodent","die","fieri","explos","loop","stop","he","commit","suicid","sever","time","he","electrocut","let","truck","hit","road","jump","tall","build","attempt","allud","mere","death","cannot","stop","dai","repeat","after","di","simpli","wake","listen","sonni","&","cher","bed","dai","he","initi","tri","seduc","rita","learn","much","daili","basi","first","ask","want","man","someon","humbl","kind","gener","courag","sensit","someon","like","children","someon","love","mother","plai","music","instrument","he","learn","like","rocki","road","ic","cream","sweet","vermouth","french","poetri","like","white","chocol","pretend","share","tast","thi","also","fail","consist","scene","scene","rita","slap","night","howev","abl","befriend","sincer","fashion","he","tell","circumst","reliv","dai","manag","convinc","truth","extens","knowledg","event","come","live","punxsutawnei","townspeopl","rita","he","open","heart","rita","advic","help","gradual","find","goal","trap","life","benefactor","other","he","cannot","singl","dai","bring","other","fulfil","need","achiev","self","improv","educ","daili","basi","after","see","elderli","homeless","man","die","connor","vow","on","die","dai","perform","mani","heroic","servic","everi","repeat","dai","includ","perform","heimlich","maneuv","choke","man","save","littl","boi","fall","tree","howev","becom","despond","unabl","save","homeless","man","despit","try","get","medic","care","when","demand","see","man","medic","chart","nurs","tell","sometim","peopl","die","not","todai","connor","repli","never","manag","prevent","though","film","specifi","number","repetit","enough","time","connor","learn","mani","complex","skill","plai","jazz","piano","speak","french","sculpt","ic","memor","life","stori","almost","everyon","town","he","also","master","art","flip","plai","card","upturn","hat","offhandedli","suggest","take","six","month","accord","danni","rubin","share","screenwrit","credit","director","intent","origin","script","time","frame","connor","repeat","dai","ambigu","longer","singl","lifetim","the","studio","object","ask","reduc","two","week","director","harold","rami","tri","leav","time","frame","loop","ambigu","mani","time","connor","live","februari","2","strongli","specul","connor","viewer","least","10","year","eventu","connor","enhanc","human","understand","return","make","appreci","belov","man","town","phil","abl","befriend","almost","everyon","meet","dai","us","experi","save","live","help","townspeopl","in","process","get","closer","rita","he","craft","report","groundhog","dai","celebr","eloqu","station","turn","microphon","after","big","groundhog","dai","even","danc","rita","phil","retir","togeth","phil","room","thei","believ","rita","cycl","mai","interrupt","he","wake","next","morn","bed","rita","still","fulli","cloth","find","time","loop","broken","februari","3","phil","differ","person","februari","1","go","outsid","phil","rita","talk","live","punxsutawnei","togeth","connor","suggest","we","rent","start","the","close","song","almost","like","be","love","brigadoon","music","also","dealt","villag","trap","time"
