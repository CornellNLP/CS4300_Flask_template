Under those circumstances, Bryce would do anything to prove his worth once again, and as a result, it won't be long before he accepts an offer from Interpol to escort the renowned international assassin Darius Kincaid from Manchester to the Hague. The task seems simple: Bryce only needs to transport the contract killer from point A to point B, nevertheless, Kincaid, as the only one with the guts and enough hard evidence to testify against a tyrannical Belarusian dictator, is an obvious target, while the trip to the Netherlands is long and hazardous. Without a doubt, this is a race against the clock as the mismatched duo will have to put aside their grudges, in a non-stop concerto for bullets.","tokens":["with","reput","tatter","painfulli","unsuccess","deliveri","distinguish","japanes","client","former","tripl","a","execut","protect","agent","michael","bryce","two","long","year","disgrac","incid","reduc","mere","second","class","bodyguard","hire","under","circumst","bryce","would","anyth","prove","worth","result","long","accept","offer","interpol","escort","renown","intern","assassin","dariu","kincaid","manchest","hagu","the","task","seem","simpl","bryce","need","transport","contract","killer","point","a","point","b","nevertheless","kincaid","on","gut","enough","hard","evid","testifi","tyrann","belarusian","dictat","obviou","target","trip","netherland","long","hazard","without","doubt","race","clock","mismatch","duo","put","asid","grudg","non","stop","concerto","bullet"],"tmdb_score_value":6.7,"tmdb_score_count":1819,"imdb_score_value":6.9,"imdb_score_count":124524,"meta_score_value":47.0,"meta_score_count":124524}
