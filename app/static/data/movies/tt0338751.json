Hughes was a risk-taker spending several fortunes on designing experimental aircraft and eventually founding TWA as a rival to Pan AM airlines owned by his great rival Juan Trippe. When Trippe's politico Senator Ralph Owen Brewster accuses Hughes of being a war profiteer, it's Hughes who gains the upper hand. Hughes also had many women in his life including a long relationship with actress Katharine Hepburn. From an early age however, Hughes was also germophobic and would have severe bouts of mental illness.","tokens":["the","aviat","open","credit","titl","the","film","begin","1913","nine","year","old","hugh","bath","mother","warn","diseas","you","safe","the","film","next","show","1927","22","year","old","prepar","direct","hell","angel","hire","noah","dietrich","john","c","reilli","run","hugh","tool","co","overse","flight","sequenc","film","hugh","becom","obsess","shoot","film","realist","even","shoot","dogfight","by","1929","film","final","complet","the","jazz","singer","releas","hugh","shoot","film","sound","cost","anoth","year","$1","7","million","nevertheless","hell","angel","huge","hit","hugh","make","scarfac","the","outlaw","howev","on","goal","relentlessli","pursu","aviat","dure","time","also","pursu","katharin","hepburn","cate","blanchett","the","two","go","nightclub","plai","golf","fly","togeth","grow","closer","move","togeth","well","dure","time","hepburn","becom","major","support","confid","hugh","help","allevi","symptom","obsess","compuls","disord","as","hugh","fame","grow","seen","starlet","hugh","take","interest","commerci","passeng","travel","purchas","major","interest","transcontinent","&","western","air","twa","predecessor","tran","world","airlin","in","1935","test","fli","h","1","racer","crash","beet","field","fastest","man","planet","boast","hepburn","three","year","later","fli","around","world","four","dai","shatter","previou","record","three","dai","meanwhil","juan","tripp","alec","baldwin","owner","pan","american","airlin","senat","owen","brewster","alan","alda","worri","possibl","hugh","might","beat","quest","commerci","expans","brewster","introduc","commerci","airlin","bill","give","world","expans","sole","pan","am","tripp","advis","brewster","check","disquiet","rumor","mr","hugh","hepburn","hugh","eventu","break","announc","fallen","love","movi","costar","although","briefli","seen","never","clearli","state","viewer","alreadi","know","costar","would","life","long","partner","spencer","traci","he","soon","new","interest","15","year","old","faith","domergu","kelli","garner","later","ava","gardner","kate","beckinsal","he","also","fight","motion","pictur","associ","america","steami","scene","the","outlaw","he","learn","pan","am","effort","run","twa","map","yet","secur","contract","armi","air","forc","two","project","spy","plane","troop","transport","by","1946","hugh","finish","xf","11","reconnaiss","aircraft","build","h","4","hercul","spruce","goos","fly","boat","with","strain","meet","deadlin","budget","hugh","start","show","sign","alarm","behavior","repeat","phrase","exhibit","phobia","dust","germ","that","juli","take","xf","11","test","flight","on","propel","malfunct","caus","crash","beverli","hill","neighborhood","rush","hospit","slowli","recuper","learn","h","4","hercul","transport","longer","need","order","product","continu","when","discharg","whole","twa","fleet","built","readi","go","danger","bankrupt","airlin","fly","boat","afraid","media","try","find","hugh","place","microphon","tap","ava","phone","line","keep","track","suspici","activ","after","confront","gardner","return","home","find","fbi","search","hous","incrimin","evid","embezzl","govern","fund","the","incid","power","trauma","hugh","give","enemi","knowledg","condit","hugh","meet","brewster","offer","drop","charg","hugh","support","cab","bill","sell","twa","stock","tripp","hugh","sink","deep","depress","afterward","shut","screen","room","grow","ever","paranoid","detach","realiti","terrifi","germ","urin","dozen","empti","milk","bottl","hepburn","tri","visit","unabl","help","tripp","pai","hugh","visit","enrag","hugh","vow","never","sell","twa","tripp","warn","dietrich","world","see","hugh","becom","goe","hear","after","nearli","three","month","hugh","final","emerg","prepar","face","senat","encourag","ava","gardner","help","get","clean","hugh","arriv","hear","start","counter","claim","brewster","charg","why","tell","truth","senat","why","tell","truth","investig","realli","born","dai","twa","first","decid","fly","europ","humili","enrag","turn","event","brewster","formal","state","hugh","charg","defens","depart","$56","million","aircraft","never","flew","hugh","defend","reveal","tripp","essenti","bribe","brewster","hold","hear","the","h","4","hercul","spruce","goos","transport","hugh","successfulli","test","fli","fly","boat","after","flight","talk","dietrich","mechan","odi","matt","ross","new","jetlin","twa","the","convair","880","coronado","make","date","gardner","celebr","parti","long","beach","shorelin","hugh","seem","free","inner","demon","see","three","attend","busi","suit","white","glove","edg","toward","trigger","obsess","compuls","fit","begin","repeat","the","wai","futur","dietrich","odi","take","hugh","bathroom","hide","dietrich","fetch","doctor","odi","stand","outsid","guard","door","alon","insid","howard","flashback","boyhood","wash","mother","resolv","fly","fastest","aircraft","ever","built","make","biggest","movi","ever","becom","richest","man","world","as","film","end","mutter","wai","futur","wai","futur","
