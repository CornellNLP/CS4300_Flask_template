Doss, the conscientious objector who, at the Battle of Okinawa, won the Medal of Honor for his incredible bravery and regard for his fellow soldiers. We see his upbringing and how this shaped his views, especially his religious view and anti-killing stance. We see Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the US Army and trying to become a medic. Finally, we see the hell on Earth that was Hacksaw Ridge.","tokens":["the","film","start","veri","graphic","viscer","imag","warfar","soldier","blown","apart","burnt","aliv","get","shot","piec","the","voic","desmond","t","doss","andrew","garfield","speak","god","grow","tire","weari","children","matter","bad","thing","we","see","desmond","carri","awai","stretcher","anoth","soldier","tell","everyth","fine","16","year","earlier","desmond","plai","darci","bryce","brother","hal","roman","guerreiro","run","wood","playfulli","thei","live","mother","bertha","rachel","griffith","father","tom","hugo","weav","former","soldier","veteran","world","war","i","haunt","past","war","drink","heavili","often","beat","son","the","whole","famili","seventh","dai","adventist","on","afternoon","boi","fight","front","hous","desmond","pick","larg","brick","whack","hal","face","knock","unconsci","as","parent","frantic","try","aid","hal","desmond","feel","noth","utter","remors","he","look","illustr","ten","command","guilt","tom","goe","whip","belt","bertha","stop","teach","desmond","anyth","she","reassur","son","hal","okai","15","year","later","desmond","work","church","mother","sing","group","thei","near","loud","nois","outsid","see","young","man","car","part","fall","leg","work","the","part","sever","arteri","caus","blood","gush","leg","desmond","us","belt","tourniquet","when","take","boi","hospit","desmond","first","see","nurs","name","dorothi","schutt","teresa","palmer","she","take","blood","donor","desmond","offer","donat","continu","talk","desmond","dorothi","later","go","date","movi","after","show","two","walk","dorothi","almost","walk","path","car","desmond","pull","asid","stun","kiss","she","slap","expect","she","walk","awai","leav","desmond","disbelief","dorothi","ask","join","he","start","walk","almost","get","hit","car","tom","bertha","becom","displeas","hal","plai","nathaniel","buzol","sign","fight","world","war","ii","he","stand","ground","insist","right","reason","desmond","take","dorothi","hike","thi","time","let","kiss","quickli","fall","love","desmond","even","learn","thing","medicin","dorothi","howev","desmond","inform","enlist","armi","dorothi","becom","upset","she","ask","ask","marri","he","ask","spot","accept","desmond","find","father","cemeteri","stand","grave","friend","lost","fight","war","tom","worri","fate","befal","son","desmond","sai","farewel","dorothi","head","train","when","get","camp","encount","sever","noteworthi","charact","includ","hollywood","zane","luke","pegler","pull","up","nude","plu","smitti","riker","luke","bracei","throw","knive","anoth","soldier","foot","sergeant","howel","vinc","vaughn","show","smitti","end","knife","foot","run","line","howel","goe","around","berat","soldier","meet","proce","train","the","men","begin","train","obstacl","cours","when","come","time","handl","rifl","desmond","state","wish","us","weapon","simpli","try","medic","also","choos","train","saturdai","sabbath","howel","bring","desmond","captain","jack","glover","sam","worthington","order","desmond","sai","long","field","howel","sever","soldier","make","desmond","time","live","hell","when","desmond","cannot","get","discharg","howel","turn","soldier","make","desmond","look","like","coward","conscienti","objector","smitti","tri","provok","desmond","take","bibl","pictur","dorothi","desmond","never","budg","some","soldier","beat","desmond","bed","night","when","howel","ask","point","attack","desmond","refus","carri","train","when","squad","releas","train","furlough","desmond","refus","pass","complet","rifl","train","when","stand","belief","detain","incarcer","insubordin","to","make","matter","wors","wed","dai","dorothi","he","put","cell","forc","miss","wed","dorothi","visit","question","whether","mistak","god","desmond","put","trial","tom","put","old","uniform","speak","former","captain","gener","son","predica","he","show","courthous","letter","gener","state","desmond","right","follow","belief","refus","carri","weapon","protect","constitut","desmond","thu","let","go","allow","continu","work","field","immedi","marri","dorothi","thei","later","consumm","desmond","join","squad","head","1945","battl","okinawa","thei","climb","maeda","escarp","better","known","hacksaw","ridg","onc","top","soldier","quietli","move","forward","across","field","dead","soldier","the","japanes","soldier","begin","fire","lead","brutal","bloodi","battl","in","midst","chao","countless","men","blown","smithereen","desmond","tend","fellow","soldier","field","administ","morphin","wound","try","get","cliff","safeti","at","night","squad","set","camp","desmond","smitti","foxhol","get","know","better","smitti","acknowledg","asshol","desmond","desmond","recount","father","would","abus","brother","went","mother","desmond","held","tom","back","held","gun","he","took","gun","awai","tom","point","readi","shoot","bertha","stop","desmond","talk","came","close","kill","father","smitti","apolog","desmond","the","next","dai","japanes","strike","back","heavi","forc","deliv","grenad","bullet","everywher","the","american",
