They are at first strangers, then they become friends. Throughout the weeks, they grow closer as they learn more about each other. One night, after some heavy drinking, they find a deeper connection. They then indulge in a blissful romance for the rest of the summer. Unable to deal with their feelings for each other, they part ways at the end of the summer. Four years go by, and they each settle down, Ennis in Wyoming with his wife and two girls, and Jack in Texas with his wife and son. Still longing for each other, they meet back up, and are faced with the fact that they need each other. They undeniably need each other, and unsure of what to do, they start a series of \"fishing trips\", in order to spend time together. The relationship struggles on for years until tragedy strikes.","tokens":["in","summer","1963","two","young","men","meet","find","work","sheep","herd","summer","brokeback","mountain","fiction","picturesqu","set","wyom","enni","del","mar","heath","ledger","19","engag","marri","fall","aspir","somedai","run","ranch","follow","footstep","parent","di","car","crash","left","young","enni","brother","sister","alon","fend","jack","twist","jake","gyllenha","ag","dream","becom","greatest","rodeo","cowboi","aliv","both","feel","essenti","alon","world","while","share","sheephand","backbreak","work","load","face","toil","troubl","weather","shortag","food","wild","anim","attack","work","friendship","eventu","develop","someth","break","employ","rule","on","man","must","sleep","sheep","on","camp","on","night","even","booz","shoot","bull","end","share","tent","avoid","freez","the","bitter","cold","lead","sleep","spoon","jack","initi","touch","enni","eventu","respond","over","next","sever","dai","two","increasingli","give","attract","on","anoth","when","summer","end","two","men","separ","continu","live","enni","marri","alma","michel","william","soon","get","pregnant","give","birth","two","daughter","alma","jr","jenni","jack","contrast","still","drawn","men","remain","unmarri","meet","drunken","on","night","stand","son","feisti","cowgirl","lureen","newsom","ann","hathawai","whose","father","own","profit","busi","sell","farm","machineri","texa","openli","look","jack","search","accept","approv","uncondit","love","jack","write","enni","1967","arrang","meet","when","jack","arriv","wyom","men","passion","kiss","enni","make","weak","attempt","discreet","kiss","seen","alma","becom","sicken","from","point","enni","jack","relationship","rebuild","develop","even","deepli","alma","becom","increasingli","suspici","men","frequent","fish","trip","brokeback","mountain","eventu","alma","enni","divorc","novemb","1975","alma","get","custodi","daughter","as","soon","hear","divorc","final","jack","show","wyom","hope","abl","live","life","ranch","enni","torn","long","idyl","life","jack","describ","explain","dare","live","togeth","kill","local","queer","thi","lead","arrang","wherebi","jack","drive","texa","wyom","meet","enni","three","four","time","year","meet","lead","anoth","emot","departur","by","1978","enni","desper","struggl","make","end","meet","pai","child","support","becom","briefli","involv","waitress","cassi","cartwright","linda","cardellini","as","result","enni","meet","less","frequent","jack","visit","mexico","look","satisfi","physic","need","seedi","underground","gai","bar","club","when","jack","taunt","enni","inform","effort","make","jealou","end","rant","sai","i","wish","i","could","quit","in","1980","enni","get","postcard","sent","jack","return","deceas","mark","across","when","enni","contact","lureen","tell","jack","accident","kill","tire","iron","chang","flat","all","enni","envis","jack","beaten","death","homophob","mob","queer","enni","describ","happen","neighbor","knew","child","lureen","also","tell","enni","jack","want","ash","spread","favourit","place","brokeback","mountain","enni","goe","visit","jack","childhood","home","jack","father","peter","mcrobbi","insist","jack","ash","place","famili","burial","plot","at","jack","mother","roberta","maxwel","invit","enni","visit","jack","bedroom","find","two","shirt","on","jack","worn","two","young","men","summer","1963","smear","blood","fight","the","shirt","hang","togeth","hanger","tenderli","fold","on","anoth","jack","denim","shirt","enni","dress","shirt","insid","enni","take","shirt","leav","enni","move","town","low","bare","scantili","furnish","trailer","alon","noth","on","jump","forward","1983","visit","19","year","old","eldest","daughter","alma","jr","kate","mara","bring","happi","new","sens","hope","engag","enni","want","know","boyfriend","realli","love","she","sai","invit","enni","wed","leav","enni","sit","beaten","year","hard","work","alcohol","weather","ag","heartbroken","with","jack","shirt","still","entwin","revers","enni","shirt","jack","postcard","pictur","brokeback","mountain"],"tmdb_score_value":7.6,"tmdb_score_count":2087,"imdb_score_value":7.7,"imdb_score_count":284402,"meta_score_value":87.0,"meta_score_count":284402}
