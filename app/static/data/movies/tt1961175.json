Seeking revenge, he is enlisted by CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy as a black ops recruit. Kennedy then assigns Cold War veteran Stan Hurley to train Mitch. Together they will later on investigate a wave of apparently random attacks on military and civilian targets. The discovery of a pattern in the violence leads them to a joint mission with a lethal Turkish agent to stop a mysterious operative intent on starting a world war in the Middle East.","tokens":["twenti","three","year","old","mitch","lost","parent","tragic","car","accid","ag","fourteen","girlfriend","terrorist","attack","engag","seek","reveng","enlist","cia","deputi","director","iren","kennedi","black","op","recruit","kennedi","assign","cold","war","veteran","stan","hurlei","train","mitch","togeth","later","investig","wave","appar","random","attack","militari","civilian","target","the","discoveri","pattern","violenc","lead","joint","mission","lethal","turkish","agent","stop","mysteri","oper","intent","start","world","war","middl","east"],"tmdb_score_value":6.1,"tmdb_score_count":937,"imdb_score_value":6.2,"imdb_score_count":42690,"meta_score_value":45.0,"meta_score_count":42690}
