When the client Ted Garza calls Elise to ask for help since he is haunted since he moved to a house in New Mexico, Elise refuses the request since the address is the same house where she spent her childhood. However she changes her mind and accepts the job, and travels with her assistants Specs and Tucker to New Mexico where they will discover an evil entity in the house.","tokens":["the","movi","begin","1953","elis","childhood","mother","audrei","brother","christian","father","gerald","new","mexico","gerald","work","execution","nearbi","prison","on","night","moment","prison","execut","via","electr","chair","begin","see","paranorm","thing","includ","know","prison","name","famili","crime","elis","mother","speak","elis","tell","father","understand","gift","afraid","come","anyth","as","go","sleep","mother","give","christian","toi","whistl","promis","time","us","protect","thei","fall","asleep","night","elis","hear","entiti","room","attempt","talk","spirit","tri","get","come","the","spirit","scare","elis","brother","caus","scream","gerald","come","storm","tri","convinc","elis","admit","see","ghost","elis","refus","gerald","hit","throw","basement","leav","dark","while","demon","red","door","tempt","child","voic","open","door","direct","kei","hang","nearbi","she","pick","kei","open","hand","kei","finger","attach","kei","thumb","the","demon","kei","face","possess","elis","caus","hous","violent","shake","audrei","goe","basement","investig","see","elis","shake","front","wall","a","wire","descend","ceil","strangl","audrei","gerald","find","wife","dead","bodi","elis","releas","possess","the","older","elis","wake","nightmar","elis","work","paranorm","investig","two","colleagu","spec","tucker","take","client","via","phone","call","she","call","help","ted","garza","experienc","paranorm","activ","sinc","move","hous","while","phone","reveal","live","childhood","home","hesit","first","explain","colleagu","happen","childhood","decid","accept","job","order","make","thing","right","while","new","mexico","elis","stai","old","home","garza","he","tell","lot","paranorm","incid","happen","home","mostli","old","bedroom","blockad","refus","enter","elis","walk","home","night","us","night","vision","camera","see","while","old","room","stumbl","across","christian","whistl","bed","lost","six","she","also","find","set","kei","room","attach","father","old","uniform","led","basement","mysteri","sound","femal","ghost","appear","visibl","crew","when","touch","ghost","jump","behind","steal","whistl","shout","help","elis","inform","seen","ghost","teenag","year","tell","stori","dai","christian","clean","floor","elis","heard","nois","check","laundri","room","saw","femal","ghost","initi","gerald","appear","see","ghost","she","plead","abus","grab","face","reveal","suffer","heart","attack","di","futur","she","run","awai","home","abandon","christian","elis","seen","colleagu","cafe","two","women","sit","besid","elis","recogn","christian","daughter","niec","christian","walk","recogn","immedi","becom","upset","accus","ly","abandon","father","christian","storm","refus","speak","elis","elis","give","on","daughter","pictur","christian","whistl","give","tell","found","old","bedroom","that","night","explor","hous","elis","tucker","hear","whistl","blown","downstair","the","whistl","lead","elis","basement","realiz","come","behind","dead","wall","elis","ask","seri","question","reveal","elis","find","look","behind","wall","elis","realiz","wall","door","rush","bedroom","get","kei","when","elis","open","door","find","miss","girl","chain","wall","garza","storm","gun","threaten","influenc","kei","face","leav","find","spec","upstair","lock","spec","disarm","garza","garza","could","kill","push","bookcas","onto","kill","instantli","the","polic","arriv","rescu","girl","elis","brought","question","while","question","polic","elis","see","ghost","niec","melissa","polic","station","realiz","brother","two","daughter","gone","hous","seek","whistl","sentiment","valu","christian","while","melissa","lure","basement","kei","face","pretend","father","attack","insert","kei","finger","throat","kei","face","take","awai","soul","further","christian","imogen","try","find","melissa","elis","come","rush","find","secret","cellar","room","found","miss","girl","melissa","unconsci","bloodi","ti","chain","elis","vow","get","melissa","soul","back","thi","prompt","imogen","admit","elis","see","spirit","stai","help","elis","elis","tucker","go","basement","look","ghost","search","red","door","enter","the","further","rescu","melissa","meanwhil","imogen","spec","try","find","red","bibl","garza","held","dear","elis","believ","help","while","basement","elis","see","someth","exhaust","vent","plumb","system","find","night","gown","belong","femal","ghost","reveal","name","anna","when","elis","hold","gown","abl","see","flashback","dai","elis","saw","anna","laundri","room","aliv","escap","cellar","room","gerald","kept","similar","garza","when","gerald","walk","laundri","room","see","anna","pretend","noth","elis","also","see","younger","self","run","hous","father","brutal","kill","anna","come","vision","elis","tucker","see","string","gown","stretch","ti","suitcas","plumb","pipe","tucker","remov","exhaust","elis","goe","examin","suitcas","elis","find","belong","skeleton","anna","insid","when","leav","pipe","hear","nois","ahead","go","ahead","examin","find","mani","simi
