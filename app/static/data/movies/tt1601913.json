Only seven workers survive in the wilderness and John Ottway, who is a huntsman that kills wolves to protect the workers, assumes leadership of the group. Shortly after they learn that they are surrounded by a pack of wolves and Ottway advises that they should seek protection in the woods. But while they walk through the heavy snow, they are chased and attacked by the carnivorous mammals.","tokens":["john","ottwai","liam","neeson","work","alaska","kill","wolv","threaten","oil","drill","team","we","see","scene","shoot","wolf","watch","hand","almost","though","sorri","breath","slowli","final","di","on","last","dai","job","ottwai","write","letter","wife","ana","ann","openshaw","left","plan","commit","suicid","while","hold","barrel","winchest","model","70","mouth","ottwai","hear","howl","wolf","stop","upon","complet","job","team","ottwai","head","home","plane","crash","blizzard","ottwai","see","vision","wife","awaken","find","on","team","lewenden","jame","badg","dale","mortal","wound","ottwai","calm","let","know","go","die","lewenden","di","peacefulli","ottwai","set","survivor","task","collect","materi","fire","he","see","woman","need","help","find","eaten","grai","wolf","also","attack","ottwai","he","rescu","other","explain","like","wolv","territori","after","start","fire","survivor","take","turn","keep","watch","while","urin","hernandez","ben","brai","kill","two","wolv","the","remain","survivor","find","bodi","morn","ottwai","suggest","leav","crash","site","wide","open","attack","diaz","frank","grillo","question","ottwai","leadership","begin","defi","order","befor","leav","ottwai","other","remov","wallet","mani","bodi","intent","return","surviv","famili","member","hendrick","sai","prayer","thank","god","allow","surviv","crash","survivor","leav","crash","site","while","hike","across","snow","flanneri","joe","anderson","fall","behind","kill","three","wolv","the","remain","survivor","continu","make","camp","wood","tension","ottwai","diaz","come","head","survivor","creat","makeshift","weaponri","diaz","threaten","ottwai","knife","disarm","ottwai","the","survivor","meet","alpha","wolf","send","omega","test","diaz","howev","survivor","abl","kill","wolf","eat","diaz","sever","head","throw","back","symbol","defianc","the","group","stop","build","campfir","night","start","convers","diaz","tell","group","men","di","heaven","god","talget","admit","believ","ottwai","confess","atheist","wish","could","believ","burk","nonso","anozi","awaken","begin","hallucin","hypoxia","he","goe","back","sleep","front","campfir","the","group","bond","person","stori","a","blizzard","approach","try","preserv","campfir","prevent","hypothermia","despit","best","effort","ottwai","find","burk","frozen","lifeless","bodi","morn","further","travel","survivor","come","across","high","canyon","wall","within","screen","tree","identifi","river","hendrick","dalla","robert","jump","tree","secur","line","mean","travers","diaz","ottwai","make","across","line","join","hendrick","talget","dermot","mulronei","afraid","height","lose","glass","wai","freez","fear","he","reluctantli","continu","across","soon","find","injur","hand","begun","bleed","get","caught","makeshift","rope","talget","struggl","untangl","line","break","crash","tree","ground","wound","talget","see","vision","daughter","drag","awai","wolv","while","attempt","save","talget","diaz","fall","tree","injur","knee","the","three","remain","survivor","continu","trek","make","river","exhaust","diaz","make","prefer","stai","die","go","hendrick","tri","convinc","diaz","carri","ottwai","tell","futil","thei","give","final","goodby","ottwai","hendrick","leav","diaz","riversid","crackl","branch","caus","wolv","heard","ottwai","hendrick","continu","soon","chase","wolv","flee","hendrick","fall","river","get","foot","stuck","underwat","rock","ottwai","jump","river","attempt","save","hendrick","drown","river","freez","alon","ottwai","curs","god","ask","hi","help","respons","ottwai","continu","without","wet","coat","eventu","daze","hypothermia","take","effect","he","stop","pull","wallet","collect","dead","examin","memento","contain","place","pile","snow","ad","wallet","well","suddenli","pack","wolv","surround","lead","ottwai","discov","walk","right","den","he","soon","spot","alpha","wolf","realis","femal","pack","member","back","ottwai","see","anoth","vision","wife","reveal","dy","hospit","bed","suggest","reason","earlier","attempt","suicid","decid","make","stand","tape","broken","miniatur","alcohol","bottl","fist","knife","hand","he","recit","father","poem","aloud","charg","alpha","wolf","screen","goe","black","in","post","credit","scene","back","ottwai","head","seen","lai","side","presum","dy","alpha","wolf","stomach","breath","slowli","bookend","similar","scene","begin"],"tmdb_score_value":6.4,"tmdb_score_count":1794,"imdb_score_value":6.8,"imdb_score_count":219764,"meta_score_value":64.0,"meta_score_count":219764}
