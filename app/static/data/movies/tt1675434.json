Out of the blue, Driss cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position so he can receive his unemployment benefit. Philippe challenges Driss, offering him a trial period of one month to gain experience helping him. Then Driss can decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the challenge and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees.","tokens":["the","film","begin","night","pari","driss","sy","drive","philipp","cluzet","maserati","quattroport","high","speed","thei","soon","chase","polic","caught","driss","unfaz","doubl","bet","philipp","convinc","get","escort","in","order","get","awai","speed","driss","claim","quadripleg","philipp","must","urgent","driven","emerg","room","philipp","pretend","stroke","fool","polic","offic","eventu","escort","hospit","as","polic","leav","hospit","philipp","ask","driss","answer","now","let","take","care","drive","the","stori","two","men","told","flashback","take","almost","rest","film","philipp","rich","quadripleg","own","luxuri","parisian","mansion","assist","magali","interview","candid","live","carer","driss","candid","ambit","get","hire","he","get","signatur","show","interview","reject","order","continu","receiv","welfar","benefit","he","extrem","casual","shamelessli","flirt","magali","he","told","come","back","next","morn","get","sign","letter","driss","goe","back","tini","flat","share","extend","famili","bleak","parisian","suburb","hi","aunt","exasper","hear","six","month","order","leav","flat","the","next","dai","driss","return","philipp","mansion","learn","surpris","trial","period","live","carer","job","he","learn","extent","philipp","disabl","accompani","philipp","everi","moment","life","discov","astonish","complet","differ","lifestyl","a","friend","philipp","reveal","driss","crimin","record","includ","six","month","jail","robberi","philipp","state","care","driss","past","on","treat","piti","compass","equal","he","sai","fire","long","current","job","properli","over","time","driss","philipp","becom","closer","driss","dutifulli","take","care","boss","frequent","suffer","phantom","pain","philipp","disclos","driss","becam","disabl","follow","paraglid","accid","wife","di","without","bear","children","gradual","philipp","led","driss","put","order","privat","life","includ","strict","adopt","daughter","elisa","behav","like","spoil","child","staff","driss","discov","modern","art","tradit","modern","opera","even","take","paint","for","philipp","birthdai","privat","concert","classic","music","perform","live","room","at","first","reluct","driss","led","philipp","listen","carefulli","music","open","philipp","music","driss","plai","music","like","philipp","boogi","wonderland","earth","wind","&","fire","open","everybodi","room","danc","driss","discov","philipp","pure","epistolari","relationship","woman","call","eleonor","live","dunkirk","driss","encourag","meet","philipp","fear","reaction","discov","disabl","driss","eventu","convinc","philipp","talk","eleonor","phone","philipp","agre","driss","send","photo","wheelchair","hesit","ask","aid","yvonn","send","pictur","accid","a","date","eleonor","philipp","agre","at","last","minut","philipp","scare","meet","eleonor","leav","yvonn","eleonor","arriv","philipp","call","driss","invit","travel","privat","jet","paraglid","weekend","philipp","give","driss","envelop","contain","11","000","euro","amount","abl","get","driss","paint","sold","on","friend","sai","come","artist","adama","driss","younger","cousin","troubl","gang","take","refug","philipp","mansion","driss","open","philipp","famili","past","orphan","seneg","adopt","childless","aunt","uncl","brought","back","franc","hi","adopt","parent","later","began","children","uncl","di","aunt","bore","still","children","philipp","recogn","driss","need","support","famili","releas","job","suggest","mai","want","push","wheelchair","life","driss","return","suburb","join","friend","manag","help","younger","cousin","due","new","profession","experi","land","job","transport","compani","in","meantim","philipp","hire","carer","replac","driss","happi","hi","moral","low","stop","take","care","yvonn","becom","worri","contact","driss","arriv","decid","drive","philipp","maserati","bring","stori","back","first","scene","film","polic","chase","after","elud","polic","driss","take","philipp","straight","seasid","upon","shave","dress","elegantli","philipp","driss","arriv","cabourg","restaur","great","ocean","view","driss","suddenli","leav","tabl","sai","good","luck","philipp","lunch","date","philipp","understand","second","later","eleonor","arriv","emotion","touch","philipp","look","window","see","driss","outsid","smile","the","film","end","driss","bid","philipp","farewel","walk","awai"],"tmdb_score_value":8.2,"tmdb_score_count":6988,"imdb_score_value":8.5,"imdb_score_count":612714,"meta_score_value":57.0,"meta_score_count":612714}
