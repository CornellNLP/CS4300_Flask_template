He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as a Swiss bank account, the number of which is implanted in his hip. He soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with Marie on a search to find out who he is - and why he is being hunted.","tokens":["an","italian","fish","boat","crew","work","coast","marseil","franc","find","unconsci","man","matt","damon","adrift","mediterranean","two","gunshot","wound","back","the","man","awaken","board","soon","come","realiz","suffer","retrograd","amnesia","on","clue","ident","account","number","safe","deposit","box","provid","tini","laser","projector","surgic","implant","hip","he","us","inform","travel","z√ºrich","switzerland","find","correspond","bank","discov","skill","advanc","hand","hand","combat","fluent","german","instinct","defend","two","policemen","question","loiter","close","park","night","the","man","arriv","bank","find","deposit","box","contain","signific","amount","cash","differ","currenc","handgun","sever","passport","photo","numer","alias","nation","he","assum","ident","top","passport","jason","bourn","leav","a","bank","employe","notifi","cia","special","activ","divis","group","oper","treadston","visit","polic","arriv","scene","bourn","manag","escap","flee","u","s","consul","accost","offici","manag","elud","captur","a","block","awai","bourn","approach","mari","kreutz","franka","potent","offer","us$20","000","take","pari","address","bourn","passport","meanwhil","back","cia","headquart","alexand","conklin","chri","cooper","head","treadston","reveal","supervisor","deputi","director","ward","abbott","brian","cox","bourn","covert","oper","respons","fail","assassin","attempt","exil","african","dictat","nykwana","wombosi","adewal","akinnuoy","agbaj","intend","sever","connect","cia","wombosi","conklin","send","three","highli","train","asset","assassin","elimin","bourn","bourn","mari","arriv","apart","pari","find","on","alias","john","michael","kane","supposedli","kill","two","week","ago","the","first","asset","code","name","castel","nicki","naud","ambush","bourn","subdu","brief","fight","mari","check","castel","bag","panic","discov","hit","list","packag","photo","cctv","footag","bourn","embassi","dai","as","bourn","tri","calm","castel","escap","jump","window","death","bourn","learn","anyth","els","conklin","enlist","nicolett","nicki","parson","penina","mezei","logist","technician","treadston","pari","safe","hous","assist","track","bourn","mari","bourn","goe","meet","wombosi","obtain","inform","second","asset","code","name","the","professor","clive","owen","kill","wombosi","bourn","arriv","with","new","wombosi","death","bourn","surmis","assassin","onset","amnesia","bourn","mari","flee","home","stepbroth","countrysid","bourn","decid","longer","want","back","cia","headquart","conklin","track","bourn","mari","countrysid","hous","the","next","morn","the","professor","tri","snipe","bourn","bourn","creat","divers","dispatch","cropfield","sneak","as","di","the","professor","tell","bourn","mutual","connect","treadston","bourn","send","mari","stepbroth","awai","safeti","us","the","professor","cell","phone","arrang","meet","conklin","bring","open","track","bourn","tail","conklin","back","pari","safe","hous","conklin","tell","bourn","plan","entir","oper","kill","wombosi","the","revel","trigger","bourn","memori","success","flashback","bourn","rememb","us","kane","alia","infiltr","wombosi","entourag","bring","kill","wombosi","wombosi","children","present","he","abort","mission","tri","flee","boat","shot","twice","wombosi","fell","overboard","wombosi","yacht","mediterranean","italian","fishermen","later","found","bourn","tell","conklin","quit","treadston","warn","follow","after","knock","conklin","bourn","engag","shootout","sever","treadston","agent","build","bourn","wound","gunfight","kill","agent","escap","build","after","bourn","escap","conklin","order","nicki","close","safe","hous","shortli","afterward","murder","third","asset","code","name","manheim","russel","levi","order","abbott","some","time","later","abbott","explain","oversight","committe","shut","treadston","ineffect","cost","benefit","ratio","propos","new","program","oper","blackbriar","bourn","free","cia","travel","mykono","greec","reunit","mari","run","scooter","shop","two","share","embrac"],"tmdb_score_value":7.3,"tmdb_score_count":4267,"imdb_score_value":7.9,"imdb_score_count":453184,"meta_score_value":68.0,"meta_score_count":453184}
