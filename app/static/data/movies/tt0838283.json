The sons still live with the parents so they must now share a room. Initial antipathy threatens the household's peace and the parents' relationship. Dad lays down the law: both slackers have a week to find a job. Out of the job search and their love of music comes a pact that leads to friendship but more domestic disarray compounded by the boys' sleepwalking. Hovering nearby are Brennan's successful brother and his lonely wife: the brother wants to help sell his step-father's house, the wife wants Dale's attention, and the newlyweds want to retire and sail the seven seas. Can harmony come from the discord?","tokens":["brennan","huff","ferrel","sporad","emploi","thirti","nine","year","old","loser","live","mother","nanci","mari","steenburgen","dale","doback","reilli","termin","unemploi","forti","year","old","live","father","robert","richard","jenkin","when","robert","nanci","get","marri","move","togeth","brennan","dale","forc","live","step","brother","thei","immedi","like","dale","warn","brennan","touch","drum","set","els","brennan","feel","tempt","soon","brennan","final","plai","dale","drum","set","leav","room","return","dale","enter","room","notic","chip","on","drumstick","confront","brennan","brennan","deni","fight","break","two","brennan","vow","make","good","promis","rub","nutsack","drumset","the","fight","end","dale","brennan","strike","time","bat","golf","club","the","parent","declar","irrespons","men","find","job","els","hous","later","brennan","success","mean","brother","derek","adam","scott","come","visit","famili","as","brennan","dale","hide","dale","tree","hous","derek","come","mock","brennan","dale","anger","derek","dale","punch","derek","face","brennan","aw","dale","someth","derek","alwai","want","after","occur","derek","long","suffer","wife","alic","kathryn","hahn","find","arous","dale","punch","derek","becom","infatu","both","men","eventu","realiz","lot","common","becom","best","friend","thei","take","job","interview","perform","quit","poorli","walk","home","brennan","dale","decid","start","compani","call","prestig","worldwid","encount","kid","beat","dale","regular","basi","the","kid","beat","dale","brennan","forc","lick","dog","fece","at","home","parent","reveal","derek","sell","hous","dale","brennan","sabotag","derek","plan","dress","bad","neighbor","klansman","nazi","respect","pretend","brennan","di","front","buyer","soon","creat","music","video","promot","sing","talent","shot","robert","boat","show","parent","derek","other","derek","birthdai","parti","the","video","reveal","boat","crash","rock","robert","punish","dure","christma","time","boi","sleepwalk","attack","robert","wake","anger","robert","forc","divorc","nanci","put","blame","dale","brennan","blame","divorc","go","back","hate","thei","go","separ","wai","get","apart","brennan","start","work","derek","dale","becom","cater","at","sale","parti","helicopt","catalina","wine","mixer","arrang","brennan","famili","meet","band","quit","due","heckler","robert","realiz","boi","miser","tell","go","dream","brennan","dale","go","stage","prestig","worldwid","brennan","sing","parent","derek","chang","charact","robert","nanci","fall","love","derek","regain","love","brother","dale","break","relationship","alic","acknowledg","need","husband","children","sinc","dale","brennan","becom","success","karaok","duo","derek","learn","becom","less","egotist","robert","nanci","get","marri","move","back","hous","new","tree","hous","made","destroi","boat","dale","brennan","dure","end","credit","brennan","dale","arriv","helicopt","exact","reveng","kid","beat"],"tmdb_score_value":6.5,"tmdb_score_count":1300,"imdb_score_value":6.9,"imdb_score_count":233315,"meta_score_value":51.0,"meta_score_count":233315}
