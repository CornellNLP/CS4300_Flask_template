He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.","tokens":["in","open","text","agent","program","start","creat","genet","enhanc","men","us","unstopp","kill","machin","an","organ","known","syndic","intern","seek","dr","litvenko","man","start","program","howev","syndic","locat","young","woman","name","katia","van","dee","hannah","ware","ti","litvenko","sever","syndic","mercenari","track","katia","locat","head","find","thei","pursuit","someon","deton","bomb","street","take","on","van","the","mercenari","syndic","doctor","try","find","respons","thei","corner","agent","47","rupert","friend","he","kill","two","men","leav","on","doctor","aliv","long","enough","tell","47","katia","after","doctor","kill","bomb","plant","47","the","agent","proce","kill","everi","man","build","syndic","chairman","le","clerq","thoma","kretschmann","inform","kill","research","facil","demand","stop","agent","47","get","contact","handler","diana","angelababi","he","two","new","target","take","care","katia","desper","look","man","feel","connect","she","also","know","see","feel","thing","explain","sens","woman","attack","husband","lead","katia","hit","polic","alarm","street","save","woman","as","katia","continu","pursuit","mysteri","man","found","subwai","man","call","john","smith","zachari","quinto","he","follow","katia","approach","make","clear","know","go","look","thei","found","pursu","47","shoot","smith","take","katia","awai","arriv","embassi","he","fire","two","shot","soldier","front","apprehend","katia","katia","met","sander","dan","bakkedahl","ask","smith","47","arriv","embassi","intention","get","captur","huge","gun","gun","found","sander","interrog","bring","gun","room","47","notic","tattoo","sander","arm","famili","he","question","sander","get","rise","kick","tabl","caus","gun","fire","shoot","on","cufflink","tabl","47","beat","kill","two","men","room","take","on","uniform","knock","sander","sai","will","die","children","47","slip","katia","run","get","smith","smith","take","katia","awai","hotel","anoth","chase","shot","arm","47","he","reveal","katia","man","look","litvenko","father","smith","sai","last","seen","year","earlier","stage","3","cancer","he","ask","tell","anyth","rememb","right","47","arriv","shoot","smith","repeatedli","knock","katia","take","katia","wake","dark","room","ti","47","sai","kill","want","help","find","father","he","also","tell","possess","similar","skillset","like","unti","47","pull","lever","reveal","katia","front","jet","turbin","hone","skill","free","as","47","katia","get","move","smith","arriv","turn","possess","sort","super","strength","agil","unlik","agent","other","mercenari","arriv","kill","two","47","shoot","katia","caus","two","get","suck","turbin","allow","two","get","awai","47","inform","katia","real","name","mean","90","indic","advanc","agent","47","he","also","known","sinc","children","saw","taken","awai","home","thei","go","undetect","airport","eventu","find","litvenko","ciaran","hind","although","happi","see","daughter","want","around","troubl","lurk","abandon","47","see","assassin","disguis","civilian","kill","he","take","katia","litvenko","awai","smith","syndic","merc","chase","smith","order","villain","trap","citi","thei","shoot","harpoon","47","car","trap","katia","litvenko","middl","citi","the","merc","descend","upon","47","shoot","thei","still","manag","take","litvenko","litvenko","brought","syndic","headquart","smith","tortur","pain","serum","get","litvenko","tell","make","agent","le","clerq","tell","smith","stop","kill","litvenko","le","clerq","tri","get","answer","litvenko","never","budg","meanwhil","47","page","system","inform","villain","presenc","make","think","chopper","outsid","it","realli","katia","ti","made","fly","chopper","build","more","mayhem","ensu","merc","get","kill","smith","le","clerq","run","awai","litvenko","smith","realiz","47","alreadi","build","thei","supercharg","fight","smith","almost","overpow","47","he","punch","wall","expos","electr","circuit","47","ti","garrot","around","smith","neck","press","circuit","electrocut","smith","le","clerq","take","litvenko","roof","build","escap","person","chopper","insid","litvenko","take","inhal","le","clerq","realiz","late","explos","litvenko","press","destroi","le","clerq","katia","ey","47","get","call","diana","confirm","le","clerq","termin","ask","katia","throw","phone","roof","47","tell","katia","need","find","litvenko","put","end","agent","program","complet","also","assur","katia","litvenko","love","thei","turn","back","go","build","katia","sens","on","person","kill","the","elev","door","open","reveal","agent","48","look","ident","47","he","sai","diana","sai","hello","47","katia","shoot"],"tmdb_score_value":5.6,"tmdb_score_count":1377,"imdb_score_value":5.7,"imdb_score_count":75817,"meta_score_value":28.0,"meta_score_count":75817}
