While his wife checks into the hotel, he grabs a cab to return to the airport for his briefcase, left at the curb. En route, an auto accident puts him in a coma, from which he awakes four days later without identification and with gaps in his memory. He goes to the hotel: his wife refuses to recognize him and another man has claimed his identity. With help from a nurse, the cab driver, a retired Stasi agent, and an academic friend, he tries to unravel what's going on. Is the answer in the briefcase?","tokens":["martin","harri","liam","neeson","wife","liz","januari","jone","arriv","berlin","biotechnolog","confer","give","paper","when","arriv","hotel","also","site","confer","martin","realiz","left","briefcas","passport","airport","while","liz","check","take","cab","retriev","briefcas","when","truck","cargo","crash","road","cab","veer","river","the","cab","driver","gina","dian","kruger","rescu","disappear","crowd","author","arriv","martin","coma","four","dai","when","reviv","memori","shaki","when","see","televis","new","report","biotechnolog","confer","rememb","suppos","he","check","hospit","goe","hotel","he","see","liz","recept","goe","embrac","but","claim","know","introduc","everyon","husband","claim","martin","harri","aidan","quinn","martin","wander","street","berlin","he","track","gina","illeg","immigr","work","sever","job","she","want","help","risk","deport","martin","goe","meet","professor","bressler","sebastian","koch","german","bioscientist","phone","call","plan","revolution","food","product","but","arriv","martin","b","alreadi","after","argument","martin","escort","polic","he","check","back","hospit","test","on","nurs","give","name","privat","detect","after","on","test","hit","man","kill","nurs","tri","abscond","martin","martin","disappear","crowd","emerg","room","escap","martin","goe","see","privat","detect","ernst","jurgen","bruno","ganz","former","stasi","offic","jurgen","believ","martin","stori","tell","track","gina","he","find","ask","place","stai","night","give","watch","liz","gave","anniversari","as","take","shower","hit","man","burst","gina","kill","poison","as","escap","borrow","cab","pursu","second","hit","man","thei","elud","hide","discothequ","martin","gina","meet","jurgen","he","friend","airport","search","secur","camera","footag","martin","contact","martin","colleagu","rodnei","cole","martin","certain","help","martin","follow","liz","photographi","exhibit","at","first","pretend","know","pull","asid","tell","forc","betrai","still","love","wait","airport","when","martin","b","second","hit","man","appear","martin","bare","abl","escap","gina","rodnei","cole","frank","langella","arriv","jurgen","offic","realiz","cole","realli","jurgen","take","cyanid","rather","reveal","know","martin","gina","retriev","briefcas","passport","thousand","euro","cash","gina","leav","martin","wait","airport","cole","arriv","take","martin","black","van","taser","second","hit","man","gina","see","follow","black","van","stolen","cab","cole","hit","man","take","martin","top","level","desert","park","garag","cole","explain","martin","realli","govern","assassin","us","martin","harri","cover","when","martin","woke","post","accid","coma","believ","cover","stori","truth","martin","b","call","finish","mission","befor","second","hit","man","kill","martin","gina","crush","van","cab","impact","send","van","cole","crash","ground","martin","rememb","everyth","sever","month","earlier","liz","gone","hotel","plant","bomb","it","would","us","kill","bressler","manner","could","blame","muslim","extremist","oppos","liber","plan","princ","shada","miro","hamada","also","sponsor","biotechnolog","confer","he","gina","race","hotel","there","recept","bressler","liz","copi","file","contain","inform","new","easili","grown","form","corn","arm","bomb","martin","arriv","time","persuad","hotel","secur","bomb","go","when","secur","evacu","hotel","liz","goe","disarm","bomb","martin","b","follow","bressler","order","kill","liz","fail","obliter","explos","martin","martin","b","fight","amidst","debri","gina","watch","martin","kill","martin","b","glass","shard","the","next","dai","bressler","princ","shada","freeli","give","new","corn","world","mutual","effort","end","world","hunger","us","addit","fake","passport","found","briefcas","martin","gina","leav","berlin","togeth","henri","claudia","taylor"],"tmdb_score_value":6.5,"tmdb_score_count":1550,"imdb_score_value":6.9,"imdb_score_count":226465,"meta_score_value":56.0,"meta_score_count":226465}
