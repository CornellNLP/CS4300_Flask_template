He along with his son and daughter and his brother Merrill lives in a farmhouse. Crop circles begin to appear in their corn fields which Graham dismisses as mischief by miscreants. After hearing strange noises and watching news coverage on crop circles appearing all over the world, the family grows suspicious of alien activities. Now they must stick together and believe, as a family to survive the ordeal and find a way to escape.","tokens":["the","hess","famili","live","farm","doylestown","buck","counti","pennsylvania","graham","hess","mel","gibson","former","episcop","priest","lost","faith","god","wife","colleen","di","horrif","traffic","accid","caus","veterinarian","name","rai","reddi","plai","m","night","shyamalan","addition","graham","cannot","come","term","son","morgan","rori","culkin","asthma","condit","caus","great","suffer","no","longer","practic","religi","graham","morgan","live","graham","daughter","bo","abigail","breslin","strang","habit","leav","unfinish","glass","water","around","hous","graham","younger","brother","merril","joaquin","phoenix","former","minor","leagu","basebal","star","never","made","big","leagu","habit","swing","whatev","pitch","came","wai","thing","fairli","unev","graham","life","mysteri","crop","circl","appear","cornfield","it","origin","purpos","unknown","townspeopl","specul","mai","prank","other","think","mai","creat","intellig","alien","life","form","meanwhil","report","violent","anim","behavior","spread","across","town","support","on","hess","dog","try","attack","bo","morgan","morgan","kill","dog","barbecu","fork","leav","shock","silent","as","stori","progress","becom","clear","graham","farm","watch","on","night","merril","chase","tall","dark","figur","spy","roof","barn","the","mysteri","disappear","crop","move","faster","disappear","far","easili","anyon","explain","soon","graham","famili","shock","learn","similar","crop","circl","suddenli","appear","world","wai","quickli","mere","grand","elabor","hoax","morgan","take","like","sheriff","radio","walki","talki","tell","us","babi","monitor","work","on","wai","he","find","bo","old","babi","monitor","basement","decid","take","town","on","return","home","strang","nois","resembl","bubbl","click","come","babi","monitor","morgan","believ","sound","alien","talk","climb","car","roof","get","better","signal","he","get","famili","join","hand","boost","signal","nois","soon","stop","morgan","theoriz","commun","two","mysteri","visitor","that","even","graham","investig","dog","bark","goe","corn","investig","there","hear","unusu","click","nois","speak","loud","firm","tone","tell","unseen","get","public","stalk","farm","famili","he","suddenli","see","long","green","leg","disappear","corn","startl","sprint","back","hous","look","back","he","tell","bo","morgan","merril","turn","televis","someth","steadfastli","object","earlier","thei","turn","new","discov","larg","mysteri","unidentifi","light","spot","mexico","citi","that","night","graham","convers","merril","faith","it","reveal","graham","longer","believ","god","follow","accid","kill","wife","he","sai","two","kind","peopl","see","sign","miracl","see","coincid","which","kind","merril","relat","stori","go","kiss","girl","parti","nearli","vomit","sai","believ","miracl","when","merril","ask","brother","question","graham","answer","later","flashback","show","graham","approach","scene","accid","still","cleric","suit","he","see","wife","pin","tree","truck","offic","tell","wife","live","long","held","aliv","truck","pin","place","the","flashback","end","the","follow","morn","merril","see","startl","video","footag","new","alien","spot","boi","birthdai","parti","passo","fundo","rio","grand","sul","brazil","graham","take","short","visit","rai","reddi","hous","find","rai","stare","blankli","car","window","bleed","rai","apolog","accid","occur","tell","graham","like","water","lot","peopl","gone","lake","befor","drive","awai","leav","graham","drivewai","rai","tell","trap","on","pantri","in","extend","scene","graham","investig","he","take","carv","knife","kitchen","attempt","us","like","mirror","catch","intrud","reflect","pantri","door","when","finger","human","try","claw","hand","side","startl","graham","us","knife","cut","finger","quickli","depart","graham","return","home","propos","famili","two","option","go","lake","hope","alien","like","water","stai","home","after","famili","vote","graham","sai","vote","count","two","behalf","dead","wife","famili","decid","stai","home","board","door","window","while","graham","merril","morgan","bo","watch","new","find","mysteri","airborn","light","visibl","approxim","274","citi","worldwid","appear","within","mile","crop","sign","appear","grow","rapidli","befor","famili","finish","board","hous","decid","last","full","famili","meal","choos","favorit","food","in","emot","scene","graham","hold","children","brother","cry","realiz","much","death","colleen","affect","scare","suddenli","babi","monitor","begin","make","familiar","mysteri","nois","graham","check","televis","see","longer","broadcast","thei","board","last","door","window","go","live","room","wait","alien","their","dog","accident","left","outsid","begin","bark","alarmingli","quickli","silenc","yelp","soon","someth","heard","climb","onto","roof","break","attic","when","merril","realiz","on","board","attic","access","door","ceil","famili","retreat","basement","the","intrud","soon","find","basement","door","try","break","need","someth",
