After a spectacular escape from an FBI prisoner convoy, the most notorious, wanted drug kingpin in the hemisphere is hurtling toward the border at 200 mph in a specially outfitted car with a hostage and a fierce army of gang members. He is headed, it turns out, straight for Summerton Junction, where the whole of U.S. law enforcement will have their last opportunity to make a stand and intercept him before he slips across the border forever. At first reluctant to become involved, and then counted out because of the perceived ineptitude of his small town force, Owens ultimately accepts responsibility for the face off.","tokens":["sheriff","rai","owen","arnold","schwarzenegg","man","resign","life","fight","littl","crime","take","place","sleepi","border","town","sommerton","junction","arizona","leav","lapd","post","follow","bungl","oper","left","wrack","failur","defeat","partner","crippl","team","decim","the","crime","experienc","sommerton","rang","mayor","park","camaro","fire","lane","vintag","arm","collector","lewi","dinkum","johnni","knoxvil","fire","gun","slab","meat","deputi","on","night","intern","drug","lord","gabriel","cortez","eduardo","noriega","make","dare","escap","fbi","custodi","la","vega","speed","modifi","chevrolet","corvett","c6","zr1","take","agent","ellen","richard","génesi","rodríguez","hostag","race","southbound","toward","mexico","speed","200","mph","agent","john","bannist","forrest","whitak","blockad","set","bullhead","citi","arizona","cortez","men","mow","polic","offic","site","clear","road","continu","getawai","cortez","also","us","extraordinari","drive","skill","immobil","two","swat","vehicl","head","toward","summerton","junction","befor","fly","arizona","agent","bannist","team","financi","background","check","agent","involv","find","cortez","manag","escap","easili","sometim","past","4","00","morn","owen","dispatch","deputi","jerri","bailei","zach","gilford","sarah","torranc","jaimi","alexand","visit","resid","local","farmer","parson","harri","dean","stanton","suddenli","miss","usual","milk","deliveri","diner","after","discov","parson","murder","deputi","follow","trail","tire","track","lead","cortez","henchman","thoma","burrel","peter","stormar","mercenari","cutthroat","plant","mobil","assault","bridg","across","canyon","mark","u","s","/mexico","border","bailei","fatal","shot","middl","shootout","deputi","thug","owen","rush","bring","offic","back","precinct","shortli","notifi","agent","bannist","cortez","presenc","owen","gather","torranc","senior","deputi","mike","figgi","figuerola","lui","guzmán","he","also","deput","jail","local","frank","martinez","rodrigo","santoro","former","marin","ptsd","develop","streak","never","finish","start","becaus","bailei","friend","martinez","insist","falter","final","owen","recruit","dinkum","protect","town","dinkum","agre","becom","deputi","keep","gun","us","begin","movi","gotten","troubl","previous","at","7","10","am","owen","deputi","town","main","road","barricad","car","burrel","men","arriv","prompt","lengthi","firefight","arm","tommi","gun","figuerola","hold","thug","injur","sniper","owen","dinkum","mow","major","thug","vicker","machin","gun","dub","nazi","killer","mount","back","school","bu","torranc","snipe","sever","gunmen","rooftop","after","owen","kill","burrel","cortez","corvett","eventu","arriv","town","veer","past","barricad","owen","deputi","shoot","cortez","eject","agent","richard","car","speed","corn","field","suddenli","encount","mayor","red","chevrolet","camaro","zl1","command","owen","car","collid","tractor","a","daze","cortez","continu","escap","foot","owen","meet","bridg","owen","ignor","cortez","bribe","offer","men","wrestl","despit","sustain","slash","stab","wound","cortez","push","dagger","owen","defeat","drug","lord","handcuff","drag","back","town","batter","camaro","agent","bannist","arriv","take","cortez","back","custodi","arrest","agent","richard","take","drug","lord","bribe","aid","escap","deputi","figuerola","dinkum","taken","hospit","treat","wound","martinez","turn","deputi","badg","bailei","badg","owen","given","earlier","owen","tell","keep","earn","as","mayor","see","left","camaro","owen","warn","park","fire","lane","torranc","martinez","walk","diner"],"tmdb_score_value":5.8,"tmdb_score_count":1420,"imdb_score_value":6.4,"imdb_score_count":122511,"meta_score_value":54.0,"meta_score_count":122511}
