An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe damage to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.","tokens":["on","assign","budapest","intercept","courier","work","person","interest","code","name","cobalt","imf","agent","trevor","hanawai","kill","assassin","name","moreau","hanawai","team","leader","jane","carter","newli","promot","field","agent","benji","dunn","extract","ethan","hunt","hunt","sourc","bogdan","moscow","prison","hunt","recruit","lead","carter","dunn","infiltr","secret","moscow","kremlin","archiv","locat","file","identifi","cobalt","halfwai","mission","someon","broadcast","across","imf","frequenc","alert","russian","hunt","team","although","hunt","dunn","carter","escap","bomb","destroi","kremlin","russian","agent","sidorov","accus","hunt","mastermind","attack","the","imf","extract","hunt","moscow","the","russian","call","attack","undeclar","act","war","us","presid","activ","ghost","protocol","black","oper","conting","disavow","entir","imf","hunt","team","take","blame","attack","allow","escap","govern","custodi","mai","oper","track","cobalt","befor","hunt","escap","imf","secretari","kill","russian","secur","forc","led","sidorov","leav","hunt","intellig","analyst","william","brandt","find","wai","the","team","identifi","cobalt","kurt","hendrick","swedish","born","russian","nuclear","strategist","believ","weak","must","die","strong","surviv","plan","start","nuclear","war","start","next","stage","human","evolut","hendrick","bomb","kremlin","acquir","russian","nuclear","launch","control","devic","need","code","budapest","courier","order","launch","nuclear","missil","america","the","exchang","moreau","hendrick","right","hand","man","wistrom","due","take","place","burj","khalifa","dubai","there","hunt","team","member","separ","convinc","moreau","wistrom","made","exchang","on","anoth","howev","moreau","identifi","brandt","agent","while","hunt","chase","wistrom","realiz","wistrom","actual","hendrick","disguis","hendrick","escap","code","carter","detain","moreau","moreau","attempt","kill","inexperienc","dunn","carter","throw","window","death","brandt","accus","carter","compromis","mission","reveng","moreau","hunt","accus","brandt","keep","secret","displai","fight","skill","atyp","analyst","while","hunt","seek","inform","bogdan","brandt","admit","assign","secur","detail","hunt","wife","julia","assign","julia","kill","serbian","hit","squad","prompt","ethan","pursu","kill","caught","russian","sent","prison","bogdan","arm","dealer","cousin","inform","hunt","hendrick","mumbai","hendrick","facilit","sale","defunct","soviet","militari","satellit","indian","telecommun","entrepreneur","brij","nath","anil","kapoor","could","us","transmit","order","fire","missil","while","brandt","dunn","infiltr","server","room","take","satellit","offlin","carter","get","nath","reveal","satellit","overrid","code","but","hendrick","anticip","hunt","plan","take","nath","server","offlin","send","signal","televis","broadcast","tower","russian","nuclear","submarin","pacif","the","submarin","fire","san","francisco","hunt","pursu","hendrick","launch","devic","team","member","attempt","bring","broadcast","station","back","onlin","hunt","hendrick","fight","launch","control","devic","hendrick","jump","death","ensur","launch","dunn","kill","wistrom","allow","brandt","restor","power","station","enabl","hunt","deactiv","missil","he","confront","sidorov","see","hunt","stop","missil","prove","imf","innoc","kremlin","bomb","the","team","reconven","week","later","hunt","issu","new","assign","brandt","refus","accept","mission","hunt","reveal","julia","death","stage","knew","could","protect","us","death","pretext","infiltr","russian","prison","get","close","bogdan","imf","sourc","hendrick","reliev","guilt","brandt","accept","mission","hunt","watch","julia","afar","thei","share","smile","goe","next","mission"],"tmdb_score_value":6.8,"tmdb_score_count":4677,"imdb_score_value":7.4,"imdb_score_count":397275,"meta_score_value":73.0,"meta_score_count":397275}
