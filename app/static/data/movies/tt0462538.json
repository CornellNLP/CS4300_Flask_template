Meanwhile, Spider Pig's waste has filled up a silo in just 2 days, apparently with Homer's help. Homer can't get to the dump quickly so dumps the silo in the lake, polluting it. Russ Cargill, the villainous boss of the EPA, gives Arnold Schwarzenegger, president of the USA, 5 options and forces him to choose 4 (which is, unfortunately, to destroy Springfield) and putting a dome over Springfield to prevent evacuation. Homer, however, has escaped, along with his family. Can he stop the evil Cargill from annihilating his home town, and his family, who have been forced to return to Springfield?","tokens":["the","movi","open","ralph","wiggum","sing","along","20th","centuri","fox","logo","we","cut","itchi","&","scratchi","the","movi","thei","moon","itchi","kill","scratchi","return","earth","paint","hero","media","shortli","thereaft","itchi","elect","presid","later","itchi","white","hous","see","supposedli","dead","scratchi","moon","scratchi","hold","sign","sai","i","tell","freak","presid","itchi","itchi","retali","send","hundr","missil","toward","scratchi","thi","seen","theater","attend","simpson","homer","stand","yell","bore","lisa","repli","dad","see","movi","homer","goe","tirad","pai","watch","someth","theater","normal","watch","tv","everyon","audienc","gigant","sucker","especi","cue","fanci","styliz","version","standard","simpson","open","theme","the","open","end","green","dai","host","concert","lake","springfield","sing","simpson","theme","open","credit","after","finish","song","talk","environ","the","audienc","becom","angri","begin","throw","garbag","pollut","lake","caus","barg","dissolv","sink","kill","the","next","dai","church","short","memori","green","dai","grampa","possess","god","warn","citi","futur","disast","marg","believ","grampa","predict","decid","work","mean","messag","meanwhil","lisa","start","talk","environ","success","she","encount","colin","irish","boi","share","passion","homer","get","note","marg","chore","on","fix","sinkhol","instead","fix","homer","put","maggi","sandbox","hi","next","chore","fix","roof","while","repair","roof","homer","bart","decid","dare","contest","homer","dare","bart","climb","antenna","bart","get","stuck","homer","shake","order","get","bart","homer","dare","bart","skateboard","krusti","burger","nake","bart","object","sai","girl","see","doodl","after","homer","threaten","call","chicken","rest","life","bart","agre","bart","becom","stuck","nake","window","build","after","apprehend","polic","ti","stop","sign","pole","homer","turn","decid","order","meal","bring","sock","shirt","pant","insid","restuar","ned","flander","help","bart","give","pair","pant","understand","feel","begin","relationship","mutual","respect","two","meanwhil","krusti","film","commerci","when","record","finish","krusti","order","pig","us","commerci","slaughter","caus","flee","homer","adopt","call","spider","pig","that","even","lisa","hold","confer","citi","hall","call","an","irrit","truth","explain","town","lake","cannot","sustain","anymor","pollut","mayor","quimbi","declar","state","emerg","order","cleans","protect","lake","springfield","thei","put","fenc","around","lake","halt","dump","announc","idiot","proof","us","cletu","exampl","try","throw","possum","lake","fail","soon","marg","ask","homer","spider","pig","s/harri","plopper","wast","go","homer","show","overflow","silo","ask","pig","fill","two","dai","homer","repli","help","horrifi","marg","tell","homer","dispos","safe","while","wait","queue","dump","homer","told","lenni","lard","lad","donut","shut","give","awai","free","donut","homer","hast","get","giveawai","decid","quicker","mean","dispos","dump","silo","lake","caus","becom","heavili","pollut","a","nearbi","squirrel","jump","becom","sever","mutat","mani","ey","nearbi","bart","flander","hike","hill","discov","squirrel","immedi","captur","epa","at","white","hous","contain","squirrel","brought","presid","arnold","schwarzenegg","russ","cargil","head","epa","he","state","springfield","becom","pollut","govern","must","take","drastic","action","propos","five","differ","solut","the","presid","pick","plan","3","random","choos","even","read","lead","giant","glass","dome","place","springfield","cargil","tell","town","springfield","pollut","citi","earth","govern","decid","contain","the","next","dai","maggi","fall","sinkhol","sandbox","emerg","outsid","dome","return","the","polic","reveal","homer","pollut","lake","angri","mob","approach","simpson","hous","torch","the","famili","escap","sink","hole","expand","destroi","hous","the","famili","flee","whilst","hide","dilapid","motel","homer","reveal","alwai","kept","backup","plan","event","run","town","he","propos","entir","famili","move","alaska","plan","marg","eventu","agre","the","next","dai","famili","attend","carniv","homer","enter","ball","death","challeng","spheric","cage","must","ride","motorcycl","around","full","vertic","circl","he","win","truck","famili","move","alaska","begin","enjoi","new","life","back","springfield","townspeopl","attempt","break","dome","russ","cargil","tell","presid","keep","springfield","state","forev","present","five","new","solut","again","schwarzenegg","tri","randomli","choos","plan","time","lead","cargil","choos","plan","destroi","springfield","back","alaska","famili","see","advert","present","tom","hank","promot","new","grand","canyon","locat","springfield","marg","kid","decid","must","save","springfield","homer","refus","help","town","tri","kill","later","night","return","home","local","bar","eski","moe","homer","discov","video","tape","left","bed","pre","record","messag","marg","tell","left","she"
