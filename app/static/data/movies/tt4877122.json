Hidden within the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone's user. In this world, each emoji has only one facial expression - except for Gene, an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become \"normal\" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic \"app-venture\" through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it's deleted forever.","tokens":["the","emoji","movi","unlock","never","seen","secret","world","insid","smartphon","hidden","within","messag","app","textopoli","bustl","citi","favorit","emoji","live","hope","select","phone","user","in","world","emoji","on","facial","express","except","gene","exuber","emoji","born","without","filter","burst","multipl","express","determin","becom","normal","like","emoji","gene","enlist","help","handi","best","friend","hi","5","notori","code","breaker","emoji","jailbreak","togeth","embark","epic","app","ventur","app","phone","wild","fun","world","find","code","fix","gene","but","greater","danger","threaten","phone","fate","emoji","depend","three","unlik","friend","must","save","world","delet","forev"],"tmdb_score_value":5.6,"tmdb_score_count":855,"imdb_score_value":3.1,"imdb_score_count":37785,"meta_score_value":12.0,"meta_score_count":37785}
