Inevitably, when his body is discovered in the following morning, a frenetic surge of raw panic spreads like a virus in the senior members of the Council of Ministers, as they scramble to maintain order, weed out the competition, and, ultimately, take power. But in the middle of a gut-wrenching roller-coaster of incessant plotting, tireless machinations, and frail allegiances, absolutely no one is safe; not even the feared chief of the secret police, Lavrenti Beria. In the end, who will prevail after the death of Stalin?","tokens":["in","earli","1953","moscow","great","terror","heavi","cloak","state","paranoia","ever","watch","soviet","leader","joseph","stalin","collaps","unexpectedli","brain","haemorrhag","inevit","bodi","discov","follow","morn","frenet","surg","raw","panic","spread","like","viru","senior","member","council","minist","scrambl","maintain","order","weed","competit","ultim","take","power","but","middl","gut","wrench","roller","coaster","incess","plot","tireless","machin","frail","allegi","absolut","on","safe","even","fear","chief","secret","polic","lavrenti","beria","in","end","prevail","death","stalin"],"tmdb_score_value":7.3,"tmdb_score_count":208,"imdb_score_value":7.2,"imdb_score_count":28753,"meta_score_value":88.0,"meta_score_count":28753}
