Suddenly, every son and daughter--not only in the neighbourhood but also in the entire region--have to run for their lives, as the rage-filled murderous intent is simply as unstoppable as it is inexplicable. Of course, Brent and Kendall's teenage children are no exception, and before long, the simmering but usual familial tensions will take a completely different meaning. Kids, stop hiding. Mum and Dad love you so much.","tokens":["the","film","open","mother","put","sooth","music","child","set","car","railroad","track","leav","child","car","die","then","introduc","ryan","thei","famili","four","strain","relationship","brent","nicola","cage","father","approv","teenag","daughter","carli","anni","winter","new","boyfriend","carli","angri","well","mother","kendal","selma","blair","consid","touch","carli","also","fight","much","younger","brother","josh","zackari","arthur","annoi","carli","forc","cancel","plan","boyfriend","damon","robert","t","cunningham","dinner","visit","grandpar","as","carli","school","unexplain","static","start","transmit","tv","screen","radio","the","effect","seen","ryan","housekeep","murder","daughter","meat","tender","front","terrifi","josh","suddenli","mob","parent","rush","carli","school","effort","kill","children","mean","carli","escap","school","best","friend","rilei","olivia","crocicchia","hide","hous","rilei","mom","attack","strangl","rilei","death","carli","run","home","terror","run","damon","kill","father","self","defens","damon","tell","carli","parent","appear","intent","want","want","kill","kid","peopl","accompani","home","get","josh","somewher","safe","after","exercis","class","kendal","goe","hospit","present","younger","sister","jenna","samantha","lemol","babi","static","transmit","jenna","give","birth","caus","attempt","kill","babi","kendal","escap","hospit","see","report","mass","hysteria","televis","static","give","parent","natur","instinct","slaughter","children","in","effort","protect","children","kendal","head","home","brent","head","home","well","bore","work","upon","see","carli","damon","home","hysteria","fulli","overtak","brent","knock","damon","attack","carli","kendal","join","upon","get","home","infect","signal","car","radio","carli","josh","escap","lock","basement","kendal","brent","bond","share","desir","kill","children","run","hose","oven","ga","pump","basement","effort","poison","kid","when","carli","see","ga","rig","trap","match","basement","door","hide","josh","hous","ventil","system","brent","cut","door","lock","open","door","ignit","ga","trigger","explos","knock","kendal","brent","wake","damon","damon","help","carli","josh","evad","parent","kendal","wake","stab","cheek","wire","hanger","push","stair","rail","knock","the","parent","close","kid","interrupt","doorbel","brent","parent","arriv","dinner","when","brent","open","door","mother","pepper","sprai","father","stab","reveal","unknown","hysteria","affect","grandpar","well","everyon","chase","hous","josh","evad","brent","attempt","hide","father","car","garag","kendal","chase","carli","outsid","hit","head","brent","mother","attack","finish","carli","brent","start","car","drive","garag","crash","kill","parent","knock","kendal","prepar","finish","carli","damon","knock","shovel","head","kendal","brent","wake","find","restrain","basement","carli","josh","damon","watch","thei","continu","exhibit","symptom","hysteria","kid","refus","let","go","kendal","tearfulli","tell","children","love","ask","let","go","brent","continu","but","sometim","want","the","film","end","finish","sentenc","leav","everyth","unansw"],"tmdb_score_value":5.6,"tmdb_score_count":114,"imdb_score_value":5.5,"imdb_score_count":7125,"meta_score_value":58.0,"meta_score_count":7125}
