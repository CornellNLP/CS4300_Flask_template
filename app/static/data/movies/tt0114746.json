Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, and is forced to live underground. A convict (James Cole) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic (who he's told was spread by a mysterious \"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\") and locate the virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it. Unfortunately Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990, six years earlier than expected, and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert.","tokens":["the","time","indetermin","futur","a","viru","deliber","releas","1996","multipl","locat","around","world","kill","earth","popul","five","billion","peopl","survivor","establish","elabor","underground","civil","earth","surfac","consid","uninhabit","human","anim","roam","freeli","inherit","surfac","from","time","time","prison","volunt","protect","gear","gather","specimen","insect","surfac","test","presenc","viru","on","prison","jame","cole","retriev","sampl","given","chanc","go","back","time","1996","find","inform","group","believ","respons","known","the","armi","12","monkei","throughout","ensu","episod","cole","find","rememb","dream","variou","thing","wit","child","includ","kill","man","airport","theme","persist","stori","miscalcul","send","cole","1990","find","incarcer","insan","asylum","sever","beat","arrest","offic","hi","psychiatrist","kathryn","railli","think","met","rave","incoher","eventu","cole","sent","insan","asylum","lock","lunat","there","meet","jeffrei","goin","wall","patient","tri","help","escap","hand","kei","dai","room","cole","quickli","recaptur","restrain","isol","room","when","railli","&","boss","dr","fletcher","enter","room","check","cole","vanish","snatch","back","present","time","scientist","sent","he","interrog","given","second","chanc","complet","mission","tell","scientist","lock","asylum","drug","wrong","year","a","second","miscalcul","send","battlefield","world","war","i","shot","leg","as","crawl","around","nake","pain","wound","suddenli","propel","futur","arriv","1996","cole","kidnap","dr","railli","tri","convinc","futur","he","find","jeffrei","goin","whose","father","famou","virologist","asylum","work","father","form","the","armi","12","monkei","cole","race","time","mishap","final","decid","want","stai","1996","dr","railli","surrend","inevit","destruct","human","life","thei","travel","philadelphia","eventu","find","shabbi","storefront","headquart","jeffrei","goin","armi","12","monkei","the","organ","claim","sever","ti","jeffrei","becom","unpredict","radic","thei","travel","jeffrei","father","mansion","railli","remov","bullet","cole","pick","trench","world","war","i","leg","drop","kinder","demeanor","cole","lock","railli","trunk","car","leav","wood","in","middl","fundrais","dinner","cole","meet","jeffrei","jeffrei","rambl","cole","given","idea","releas","viru","would","destroi","human","cole","leav","chase","secur","mansion","find","railli","wood","while","rant","want","stai","railli","time","furiou","railli","honk","car","horn","try","attract","attent","dr","goin","secur","search","when","turn","find","cole","disappear","dr","railli","soon","becom","convinc","somehow","cole","know","someth","predict","outcom","minor","event","uncanni","the","radio","follow","disappear","nine","year","old","boi","believ","fallen","mine","shaft","cole","said","boi","found","hide","barn","disappear","prank","plai","boi","friend","the","bullet","remov","cole","leg","prove","pre","1920","forc","check","photograph","research","taken","battlefield","imposs","show","cole","trench","she","becom","convinc","the","armi","12","monkei","inde","pose","threat","begin","search","cole","order","persuad","take","caus","railli","continu","investig","clue","cole","collect","make","wai","shabbi","storefront","western","district","philadelphia","believ","headquart","armi","12","monkei","while","pound","door","cole","suddenli","appear","he","convinc","delusion","want","railli","help","insid","storefront","loyal","follow","fear","jeffrei","rambl","railli","found","must","process","thought","complex","comput","system","predict","next","locat","he","loyalist","leav","carri","plan","cole","commun","past","present","telephon","number","leav","messag","scientist","present","when","goin","armi","releas","anim","zoo","roam","street","new","york","leav","father","anim","pen","zoo","post","flier","declar","we","cole","realiz","12","monkei","threat","leav","phone","messag","effect","shortli","jose","fellow","volunt","present","approach","cole","order","complet","mission","hand","revolv","cole","initi","refus","notic","guard","present","glare","jose","make","clear","dr","railli","kill","cole","compli","meanwhil","polic","cole","kidnap","dr","railli","in","airport","attempt","cole","elud","captur","dr","railli","recogn","dr","peter","man","work","jeffrei","goin","father","virolog","lab","apocalyps","nut","she","rush","inform","cole","frantic","identifi","along","travel","plan","jose","overhear","rant","the","man","goe","airport","screen","manag","persuad","secur","biolog","sampl","on","mani","citi","itinerari","harmless","dr","railli","alert","cole","attempt","stop","man","to","dr","railli","horror","cole","shot","polic","chase","real","perpetr","escap","board","plane","cole","death","wit","boi","name","jame","parent","young","cole","cole","dream","final","reveal","memori","death","young","cole","dr","railli","lock","ey","moment","on","plane","peter","take","seat","start","convers","fellow","passeng","we","recogn",
