Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.","tokens":["miami","born","carl","casper","head","chef","gaulois","brentwood","california","while","popular","kitchen","staff","hostess","molli","restaur","owner","riva","want","carl","stick","tire","classic","rather","innov","dish","carl","strain","relationship","tech","savvi","preteen","son","perci","rich","ex","wife","inez","when","carl","chanc","prove","creativ","talent","visit","prestigi","critic","blogger","ramsei","michel","riva","demand","stick","old","favorit","last","minut","caus","carl","conced","lead","scath","review","on","twitter","carl","insult","ramsei","review","realiz","repli","public","gain","larg","twitter","follow","carl","come","inspir","new","menu","staff","love","invit","ramsei","rematch","after","confront","riva","owner","want","old","menu","carl","walk","quit","at","home","prepar","menu","want","serv","ramsei","carl","assist","becom","interim","chef","even","regular","dish","becom","disast","ramsei","start","tweet","bad","carl","quit","lead","carl","go","restaur","angrili","publicli","berat","ramsei","video","featur","carl","meltdown","go","viral","profession","credibl","evapor","molli","inez","encourag","run","food","truck","he","accept","inez","invit","miami","spend","qualiti","time","perci","rediscov","love","cuban","cuisin","inez","ex","husband","marvin","offer","dilapid","food","truck","carl","reluctantli","accept","he","also","find","marvin","inez","spent","time","togeth","divorc","inez","made","littl","angri","he","perci","bond","restor","truck","bui","groceri","carl","bui","chef","knife","martin","friend","gaulois","turn","restaur","promot","work","carl","becom","exuber","passion","chef","the","three","drive","food","truck","across","countri","back","lo","angel","serv","top","qualiti","cuban","sandwich","yuca","fri","perci","find","wai","promot","food","truck","social","media","websit","truck","becom","success","new","orlean","austin","texa","daili","special","includ","item","made","local","ingredi","po","boi","barbecu","brisket","back","lo","angel","carl","realiz","import","relationship","son","accept","perci","enthusiast","offer","help","weekend","holidai","ramsei","visit","truck","explain","wrote","bad","review","knew","carl","creativ","suit","restaur","serv","menu","year","he","leav","offer","bankrol","new","restaur","in","flash","forward","set","six","month","later","new","restaur","hit","close","privat","event","carl","inez","remarri"],"tmdb_score_value":7.1,"tmdb_score_count":1417,"imdb_score_value":7.3,"imdb_score_count":162310,"meta_score_value":68.0,"meta_score_count":162310}
