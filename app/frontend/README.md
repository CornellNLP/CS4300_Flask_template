# Frontend
## This is built using webpack + React.js

Firstly, run ```npm i``` if this your first time attempting to run the frontend. To test this, run ```npm run build-dev``` and then open ```index.html``` in a browser to test it. Otherwise, you can also run ```npm run watch``` so the the page will refresh automatically once changes are made.

To properly build this to deploy, run ```npm run build``` to run webpack. Then it will update properly on the frontend locally. The build directory, ```dist/``` is gitignored. Not sure how this will work for heroku.
