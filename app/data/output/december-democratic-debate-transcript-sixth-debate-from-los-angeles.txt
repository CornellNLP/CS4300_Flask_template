Tonight\u2019s podium order on the stage was determined by an average of recent polls. And let\u2019s begin"}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "00:23", "text": "To the candidates. Last night at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike 1974 and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have so far not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump. Why do you think that is, and what can you say or do differently in the coming weeks, to persuade more Americans that this is the right thing to do? I want to ask all of you to respond, but to begin with Vice President Biden."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "01:05", "text": "You know, Judy, it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did, and Trump\u2019s response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now, I find is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do. Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling that\u2019s been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American, the American president. Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, \u201cStand fast,\u201d and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him. We need to restore the integrity of the presidency, of the office of the presidency. And it\u2019s about time we get that underway. My job, and I think the job of all of us up here, is to, in fact, well that\u2019s not true, some are going to be actually voting in the Senate. But my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesn\u2019t deserve to be president of United States for another four years."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "01:59", "text": "Senator Sanders, why do you think more people are not in support of impeachment and what else can you do?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "02:05", "text": "Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "03:19", "text": "Senator Warren, why do you think, why do you think more Americans don\u2019t agree that this is the right thing to do and what more can you say?"}, {"speaker": "E. Warren", "time": "03:26", "text": "So I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate who\u2019s taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution, and that doesn\u2019t mean loyalty to an individual, it doesn\u2019t mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country, and that vote will play out over the next several weeks. But the way I see this is we\u2019ve now seen the impact of corruption, and that\u2019s what\u2019s clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in this race."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "04:47", "text": "Senator Klobuchar\u2026 Senator Klobuchar, what argument can you make to persuade more Americans this is the right thing?"}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "04:56", "text": "Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, \u201cThe president is not king in America; the law is king.\u201d And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think he\u2019s a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent."}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "05:49", "text": "And I would make this case: as we face his trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesn\u2019t he have all the president\u2019s men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.\u201d We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president. That is the case. If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "06:29", "text": "Mayor Buttigieg\u2026 Mayor Buttigieg, what additional argument can you make to the American people?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "06:37", "text": "At the end of the day, this is beyond public opinion, this is beyond polls, this is beyond politics. The president left the House with no choice, and I think a lot of us are watching this process, watching Washington go through the motions and not expecting much, but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate. We cannot give in to that sense of helplessness because that\u2019s what they want. They want us to be taken in by that cynicism where we give up on the process altogether. Meanwhile, their allies are laughing all the way to the bank."}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "07:11", "text": "As we see policies that let giant corporations, some of which made billions in profits, pay, not just zero, but as we\u2019ve recently learned, negative taxes, all while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working Americans. Here\u2019s the good news \u2013 it\u2019s up to us. No matter what happens in the Senate, it is up to us in 2020. This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness, to refuse and reject the cynicism. That is what this presidential election is about. It is what my campaign is about. Our opportunity in 2020, no matter what happens in Washington, as a country, to change the course of this nation for the better."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "07:57", "text": "Mr. Yang, what more-"}, {"speaker": "Tom Steyer", "time": "07:58", "text": "I\u2019m over here."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "08:00", "text": "Mr. Yang, what more can you say to the American people?"}, {"speaker": "Tom Steyer", "time": "08:01", "text": "Judy, Judy, sorry."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "08:03", "text": "I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Steyer, I\u2019m sorry."}, {"speaker": "Tom Steyer", "time": "08:06", "text": "Well, let me remind everyone that I\u2019m the person who started The Need to Impeach movement over two years ago. Because I believe what counts here is actually the American people\u2019s opinion. Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history, it\u2019s not a question of political expediency, it\u2019s not a question of political tactics, it\u2019s a question of right and wrong. So now when we look what\u2019s going on, I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar. The question here is, if we want the American people to understand what\u2019s going on, we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge."}, {"speaker": "Tom Steyer", "time": "08:54", "text": "The court that counts here is the court of public opinion. The American people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath, so we can make up our mind. If we want Republican senators to do the right thing, we need their constituents to see the truth on TV, and tell them, \u201cGet rid of this guy or we\u2019ll get rid of you.\u201d That\u2019s what I believe in. I\u2019m a believer in the grassroots, as an outsider, getting the American people\u2019s voice to count. That\u2019s who I trust and that\u2019s who I trust now."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "09:27", "text": "Mr. Yang."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "09:30", "text": "It\u2019s clear why Americans can\u2019t agree on impeachment. We\u2019re getting our news from different sources, and it\u2019s making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating, last I checked, it was something like 17 percent, and Americans don\u2019t trust the media networks to tell them the truth. The media networks didn\u2019t do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place. If you turn on cable network news today, you would think he\u2019s our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and e-mails all mixed together."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "10:02", "text": "But Americans around the country, no different. We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri. I just left Iowa. We blasted 40,000 manufacturing jobs there. The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what\u2019s going on in our communities and solve those problems. What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country, a new way forward to help beat him in 2020, because make no mistake, he\u2019ll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "10:57", "text": "Thank you, Mr, Yang. Let\u2019s turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all Americans, and that is the economy. Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It was supported by union-friendly leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and big labor groups like the AFL-CIO. They say it is going to be a big job creator. Senator, my question is, will you support this deal, and if not, why not?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "11:35", "text": "Judy, you\u2019re talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNC [inaudible 00:11:45] with China, two agreements that cost us over four million decent-paying jobs. Now, I don\u2019t agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word \u201cclimate change,\u201d to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "12:46", "text": "Senator Klobuchar-"}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "12:48", "text": "I have a different view. I\u2019ll go with my friend Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that\u2019s come in front of him, and he\u2019s voting for this, and I am too. And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we\u2019ve got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also oppose."}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "13:19", "text": "95 percent of our customers are outside of our borders, and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says \u201cmade in America,\u201d it is the ingenuity of our workers. It is equality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest, and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "14:03", "text": "All right. We can pull some of your, I see some other hands up. I want to move to the next question and you can bring in, I think, your points with this, but this one I\u2019m going to initially address to Vice President Biden, and that is the overall U.S. economy right now looks strong. The unemployment rate is at historic lows, unemployment among African Americans is down, the markets are booming, wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they\u2019re still doing about as well as they were in the Obama/Biden era. My question to you, Mr. Vice President is, what is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight, who may not like everything President Trump does, but they really like this economy and they don\u2019t know why they should make a change?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "14:47", "text": "Well, I don\u2019t think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that. You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest, 40 percent of them could pay, couldn\u2019t pay their bills last year. You have most Americans, if they\u2019ve received the bill for 400 dollars or more, they\u2019d have to sell something or borrow the money."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "15:13", "text": "The middle class is not, is behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate significant number of these god-awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in healthcare. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle class people so they can maintain their standard of living. That\u2019s not being done, and the idea that we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are, and that\u2019s why we must change this presidency now."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "15:49", "text": "Mayor Buttigieg, is that your, is that your assessment?"}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "15:53", "text": "Yes. Where I live folks aren\u2019t measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking, they\u2019re measuring the economy by how they\u2019re doing. When you\u2019re doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table, and you find that, even if your wages have gone up, is not nearly going as fast as the cost of health, and how\u2019s\u2026 This economy is not working for most of us, for the middle class, and, I know you\u2019re only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we\u2019ve got to talk about poverty in this country."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "16:22", "text": "There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full time at the minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment. In most places, not even a one bedroom apartment. The biggest problem in our economy is simple \u2013 people are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. It\u2019s the result of bad policy, and we\u2019ve got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "16:52", "text": "Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "16:55", "text": "GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today. Also at record highs, depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt, even suicides and drug overdoses. It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years, because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history. The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people\u2019s lived experience on the ground. If you\u2019re a recent college graduate, you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesn\u2019t require a college degree. That doesn\u2019t show up in the headline unemployment rate, nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "17:39", "text": "Senator Warren, you have your hand up."}, {"speaker": "E.

I\u2019m proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rising GDP, rising corporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across this country. I\u2019m proud to stand on a stage with people who see that America\u2019s middle class is being hollowed out, and that working families and poor people are being left behind."}, {"speaker": "E. Warren", "time": "18:11", "text": "What we need to talk about, though, is why that has happened, and the answer is we\u2019ve got a government that works great for those with money, and doesn\u2019t work for much of anyone else. We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us, who see climate change bearing down upon us. And when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected and for no one else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "19:06", "text": "I want\u2026 I want Senator Sanders, if you would, a brief response, and then I have another question."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "19:12", "text": "Look, here\u2019s the response. Trump goes around saying, \u201cThe economy is doing great.\u201d Do you know what, real inflation accounted for, wages went up last year? One point one percent. That ain\u2019t great. Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 500,000 Americans, including 30,000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent. That is what our campaign is about."}, {"speaker": "Judy Woodruff", "time": "19:59", "text": "Senator Warren, I have a question for you. Every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy. But you have especially ambitious plans that, apart from healthcare, would hike taxes an additional eight trillion dollars over the decade, the biggest tax increase since World War II. How do you answer top economists who say taxes of this magnitude would stifle growth and investment?"}, {"speaker": "E. Warren", "time": "20:26", "text": "Oh, they\u2019re just wrong. Let\u2019s start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, 50 million dollars and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage."}, {"speaker": "E. Warren", "time": "21:03", "text": "\u2026 Pre K for every three-year-old and four-year-old and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher. We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates, we can cancel student loan debt, but think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires. They\u2019re not eating more pizzas, they\u2019re not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours. We can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up. That\u2019s how we built it in small towns, that\u2019s how we built it in rural America and that\u2019s how we built it in urban America.

And in addition, I\u2019ve talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for 95% of Americans by 10%.

We can also be smart about the promises we\u2019re making. Make sure they\u2019re promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy. It\u2019s why, for example, I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans, but it doesn\u2019t have to be free for the top. If you\u2019re in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on, that would make a big difference. Whether it\u2019s infrastructure, childcare, housing, health.

Basically president Trump. How do you deal with him and the economy? Let\u2019s start with the economy. That\u2019s the number one issue for voters here.

It is a values check. It is a patriotism check. When you see people, and we\u2019ve all had this happen, that come to our meetings and say yeah, I voted for Donald Trump but I don\u2019t want to do it again because I want my kids to be able to watch the president on TV and not mute the TV.

So when I think about the gift that I\u2019d like to give, and I\u2019ve seen that too. I mean I think it starts with cruelty.
