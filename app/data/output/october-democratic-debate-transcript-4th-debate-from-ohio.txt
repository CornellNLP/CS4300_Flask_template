The debate took place in Westerville, Ohio on October 15, 2019 and included presidential candidates Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. This was the first debate since the impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump began, and it was a hot topic of the debate.

We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and watching around the world, watching us on CNN, CNN International, CNN Espanol, cnn.com, thenewyorktimes.com CNN, CNN\u2019s Facebook page, and listening on the Westworld One Radio Network, Sirius XM satellite radio, NPR, and the American Forces Network. I\u2019m Anderson Cooper moderating tonight\u2019s debate along with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor, Marc Lacey. We are in Ohio tonight because it\u2019s one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896."}, {"speaker": "Erin Burnett", "time": "00:43", "text": "The top 12 democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate. So to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "00:55", "text": "Before we begin a reminder of the ground rules, you\u2019ll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates as that will count against your time."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "01:14", "text": "And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let\u2019s begin. Since the last debate House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there\u2019s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is with the election only one year away, why shouldn\u2019t it be the voters who determine the president\u2019s fate?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "01:44", "text": "Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn\u2019t think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn\u2019t happen and look what happened as a result, Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but understand it\u2019s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "03:01", "text": "Thank you, Senator Warren. You\u2019re all going to get in on this by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach President Trump? Please respond."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "03:08", "text": "No they don\u2019t. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It\u2019s not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "04:03", "text": "Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings you said, and I quote, \u201cThe American people don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.\u201d With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "04:21", "text": "Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report. If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice, but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "05:11", "text": "Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be in her words, \u201cfair to the President and give him a chance to exonerate himself.\u201d You\u2019ve already said that based on everything you\u2019ve seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the President?"}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "05:27", "text": "Well, it\u2019s just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it\u2019s shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou who told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time. During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He\u2019s been selling out working people. He\u2019s been selling out our values, he\u2019s been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, he\u2019s been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must ask but the reality of it is that I don\u2019t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it."}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "06:21", "text": "And and he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server and there has been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "06:39", "text": "Senator Booker, you have said that president Trump\u2019s \u201cmoral vandalism disqualifies him from being president.\u201d Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "06:49", "text": "So first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship. Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel, but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn\u2019t rip us apart. Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus. That\u2019s what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator, do my duty. This president has violated his, I will do mine."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "07:40", "text": "Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people\u2019s day to day lives, healthcare, the economy and could backfire on Democrats."}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "07:53", "text": "We can do two things at once, that\u2019s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America because this President has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests. He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He\u2019s not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he\u2019s digging up dirt on an opponent, that\u2019s illegal conduct. That\u2019s what he was doing. He didn\u2019t talk to them about the Russian invasion, he talked to him about that. So I\u2019m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I\u2019d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again."}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "08:53", "text": "And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn\u2019t make America great again, it makes Russia great again. And that is what this President has done. So whether it is worker\u2019s issues, whether it is farmer\u2019s issue, he has put his own private interests and I will not do that."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "09:14", "text": "Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment of distraction?"}, {"speaker": "Julian Castro", "time": "09:17", "text": "Not at all. We can walk and chew gum at the same time and all of us are out there every single day talking about what we\u2019re going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises. Because Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them. Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out 10 different instances where the President obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly, in an ongoing way, violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this President and the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal, he should be removed."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "10:12", "text": "Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There\u2019s been obviously very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "10:22", "text": "Well, it\u2019s a mistake on the part of Republicans who enabled a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share. Look, the President has left the Congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It\u2019s also about the presidency itself because a president, 10 years or 100 years from now, will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion, either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it\u2019s going to be like, what it\u2019s actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president."}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "11:18", "text": "It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over, but really think about where we\u2019ll be, vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues, from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. I\u2019m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "11:46", "text": "Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Congresswoman Gabbard, you\u2019re the only sitting House member on this stage, how do you respond?"}, {"speaker": "Tulsi Gabbard", "time": "11:53", "text": "If impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we\u2019ve already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016. The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House and I think that it should continue to play its course out together. All the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "12:45", "text": "Thank you, Congresswoman. Mr. Steyer, you\u2019ve been calling for impeachment for two years, does there need to be bipartisan support?"}, {"speaker": "Tom Steyer", "time": "12:51", "text": "Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House. But I also want to point out that Anderson\u2019s right, two years ago, I started the Need To Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So in fact, impeaching and removing this President is something that the American people are demanding. They\u2019re the voice that counts and that\u2019s who I went to, the American people."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "13:39", "text": "Mr. Yang, do you think there\u2019s already enough evidence out there to impeach the President? Please respond."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "13:44", "text": "I support impeachment, but we shouldn\u2019t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will one be successful or two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We\u2019re standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state. Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and we\u2019re not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands. It\u2019s not just you, Amazon alone as closing 30% of America\u2019s stores in malls soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office. The fact is, Donald Trump, when we\u2019re talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "14:38", "text": "Congressman O\u2019Rourke, on impeachment, please respond."}, {"speaker": "Beto O\u2019Rourke", "time": "14:41", "text": "You know, I think about everyone who\u2019s ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on the stage tonight, Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard. Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this President\u2019s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation. Then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "15:34", "text": "Thank you, Congressman."}, {"speaker": "Beto O\u2019Rourke", "time": "15:34", "text": "If you do not hold them to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our constitution and our country, we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line and we cannot do that."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "15:45", "text": "Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump\u2019s attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you. Having said that on Sunday, you announced that if you\u2019re president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it\u2019s not okay for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president, Vice President Biden?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "16:22", "text": "Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that\u2019s what we should be focusing on. And what I wanted to make a point about and my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself, he spoke about it today. My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th \u2026 look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "17:09", "text": "This president on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the President and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He\u2019s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "17:41", "text": "Hold on, I\u2019m sorry. I just want follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you\u2019ve said to your son, Hunter today gave an interview. He admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him, you were the point person on Ukraine at the time? If you can answer."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "17:58", "text": "Look, my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. I did my job, I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We\u2019ve always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed any, so there\u2019d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made. I\u2019m proud of what he had to say and let\u2019s focus on this, the fact of the matter is that this is about Trump\u2019s corruption. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "18:30", "text": "Senator Sanders, your response."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "18:31", "text": "Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster if the American people believed that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we\u2019re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under insured. We\u2019re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country."}, {"speaker": "Anderson Cooper", "time": "19:17", "text": "Senator Sanders, thank you, Mark."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "19:18", "text": "We want to move now now to the economy, Senator Warren, [crosstalk 00:19:22] You\u2019ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college \u2026 [crosstalk 00:19:26] Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "19:28", "text": "It is wrong to move on."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "19:30", "text": "Senator Warren, you\u2019ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal child care, eliminating most Americans college debt, and you\u2019ve said how you\u2019re going to pay for those plans, but you have not specified how you\u2019re going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for All. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "19:55", "text": "So I have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking, middle class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is I have been out all around this country. I\u2019ve done 140 town halls now. Been to 27 States and Puerto Rico, shoot, I have done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy. And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I\u2019ve talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter\u2019s been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I\u2019ve talked to the young man who has M.S. And here\u2019s the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "20:55", "text": "Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer. To think about the changes in your family, if your mom\u2019s got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with M.S. But what you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about is how you\u2019re going to pay for your healthcare after that."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "21:14", "text": "Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he\u2019s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You\u2019ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "21:26", "text": "So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "21:50", "text": "Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been \u201cevasive\u201d about how she\u2019s going to pay for Medicare for All. What\u2019s your response?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "21:58", "text": "Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer. This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature Senator, is to have a plan for everything except this, no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself. But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for All who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too. That is what most Americans want. Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family. And it can be delivered without [crosstalk 00:23:00]"}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "22:59", "text": "Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "23:00", "text": "So let\u2019s be clear, whenever someone hears the term Medicare for All who want it, understand what that really means. It\u2019s Medicare for All who can afford it, and that\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got. Medicare for All is the gold standard. It is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American, including the family whose child\u2019s been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who\u2019s just gotten an M.S. diagnosis. That\u2019s how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this, I\u2019ve laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy, they\u2019re going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs because costs are what people care about. I\u2019ve been studying this for the biggest part of my life, why people go bankrupt."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "23:53", "text": "Thank you, Senator, can the mayor respond?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "23:56", "text": "Sure."}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "23:56", "text": "I don\u2019t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that healthcare. It\u2019s just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not. And I don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big bold goal. And once again, we\u2019re competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now. After everything we\u2019ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there\u2019s a better way to deliver coverage for all."}, {"speaker": "Marc Lacey", "time": "24:49", "text": "Thank you, Mayor, Senator Sanders."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "24:50", "text": "I\u2019d like to be able to respond-"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "24:50", "text": "As somebody who wrote the damn bill as I said. Let\u2019s be clear on the Medicare for All bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out of pocket expenses are gone.

They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2% fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans an hour. So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well.
