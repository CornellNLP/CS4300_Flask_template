We\u2019re dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We\u2019re dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact tens of millions of workers in this country. We are dealing with a political crisis as well."

Burlington, Vermont, laws have been shut down. restaurants shutdown, showcase centers shut down, schools shutdown. What happens to all the people who lose their jobs? What happens to the people who tonight are worried that they may have the coronavirus but don\u2019t have the resources to get the tests they need or the treatment that they need."

And what I wanted to do tonight along with you is to talk about a series of proposals that we all working on right now and will introduce to the democratic leadership as to how we can best go forward. And in this unprecedented moment this will require an unprecedented amount of money and my own guess is that we\u2019ll be spending at least $2 trillion in funding to prevent deaths, job losses, and to avoid an economic catastrophe."

We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get the healthcare they need regardless of their income. This is kind of a no-brainer. It\u2019s something that should have happened in our country many, many years ago. But in the midst of this crisis, what I believe we must do is empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency."

We can\u2019t pass that right now, but what this does say is that if you\u2019re uninsured, if you are under insured, if you have high deductibles, if you have high copayments, if you have out of pocket expenses, Medicare will cover those expenses so that everybody, regardless of their healthcare needs, and I\u2019m not just talking about the coronavirus, but their health care needs in the midst of this crisis, will get all the healthcare that they need. That is what we should be doing in this moment of crisis."

What the fear is as you know, is that there will be a surge of patients coming into the hospitals and that we will not have the equipment that we need to deal with that crisis."

In other words, federal government must take the responsibility of working with the private sector and saying, you know what, this is a major priority. You\u2019re going to get the job done."

One of the great fears that we are facing right now is that doctors themselves and nurses themselves will become ill. And if our frontline defense in the medical profession is injured, is made sick, is not able to treat the American people, that\u2019s only going to make a very difficult situation even worse."

We must massively increase the availability of test kits, test kits for coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We must look to successful coronavirus testing models in other countries and throughout our own country and implement best practices here. And right now there are communities and states all over this country that do not have the test kits. It\u2019s taking too long to get the results. We\u2019ve got to aggressively address that."

One of the ongoing crisis is that our healthcare system faces in many parts of this country under the best of times, people can\u2019t find a doctor or a hospital 200 miles away from them.

These are folks who don\u2019t have a lot of money as all of you know, some 40% of the people in this country cannot afford a $400 emergency. So people are sitting out there and they\u2019re saying, \u201cMy God, what am I going to do? How do I take care of my families?\u201d And that has got, got to be the major, major economic priority that we address.

Now we\u2019re throwing out a lot of ideas and when you deal with the United States Congress, you don\u2019t get everything that you want. There will be picking and choosing here and there, but I think it\u2019s important for us tonight to discuss the various options that they have. And one of those options is to make sure that people at least getting $2,000 a month check to take care of their basic needs."

We must provide emergency unemployment assistance to anyone who loses their job through no fault of their own.
