Peter and I seriously have a lot in common. He is also a champion for the environment and protecting the places that make this state and country so special. So Peter, thanks for being a leader and an ally in that fight. We owe you a great round of applause."

Now I know what it\u2019s like to be a Utah fan in Provo during the Holy War. So how was your night last night?"

And if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like Senator Sanders, it will be a fatal error. We need Democrats and Independents and Republicans to win, and that was the coalition that propelled Democrats to success in the midterms, and it\u2019s the coalition that we need to win in November, and that won\u2019t happen with pie in the sky promises and proposals that will bankrupt the country. Voters don\u2019t want empty talk. They want leadership. They don\u2019t want hand-waving and finger pointing. They want common sense ideas that can become real policy. And this election is just too important, the stakes are too high, and we cannot afford to get it wrong. So we\u2019re here today. Thank \u2026 Yes."

Ben McAdams proved that a Democrat can win a congressional seat here. Mitt Romney proved the Trump fever gripping the Republican Party can break here, and in November we\u2019re going to prove that a Democratic candidate for president can win here statewide."

We\u2019re going to compete in blue states, and purple states, and red states all across this country, and we\u2019re going to win, and finally start putting this country back together. But to do that, we need to nominate someone who can build a broad coalition that attracts voters from all across the spectrum, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. Because this is not an election where we can just roll the dice."

Now, this is a national emergency. We might not recover from four more years of Trump. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, and the way to defeat Trump is by appealing to the broadest possible coalition, Americans of all backgrounds and parties, to stand shoulder to shoulder. The way to defeat Trump is with workable, sensible solutions to our biggest challenges. And now we all know that Trump is a bully, but I say I\u2019m a New Yorker, and I know how to deal with bullies. I did it all the time. I\u2019m not afraid of Trump, and he knows it, and he sees our poll numbers and he is scared. That\u2019s why he tweets about me all the time. If he didn\u2019t care, he wouldn\u2019t do it. But he knows we have a record and the resources to beat him, and he that if he keeps tweeting, he thinks I\u2019m going to go away? Wrong, Donald. I\u2019m going to stay more than you ever dreamed of."

And then in 2018, I worked to help hold him accountable by flipping 21 House seats and making Nancy Pelosi the speaker, and that\u2019s what started the impeachment process. But since the Republican Senate didn\u2019t have the courage to remove the President from office, it is up to us to do that this November. So I\u2019m running a campaign for change, for sanity, for honesty, for inclusion, compassion, and a campaign for human decency."

We need a nominee who can deliver it. But that\u2019s not all we need to win, because let\u2019s face it, Donald Trump is the world\u2019s biggest schoolyard bully with no respect for civility, for decency, or facts, or honesty, and our party needs a candidate who can go toe to toe with him and take the fight to him."

Well, Donald Trump\u2019s insults don\u2019t bother me, and you can rest assured, I will never run away from a fight, and he is not going to bully me, and I won\u2019t let him bully you either."

My whole career has been as a doer, and I believe we need less talk, less partisanship, less division, less tweeting. In fact, I will make you a commitment right here. I do this at all these speeches. I\u2019m going to commit, when I\u2019m President, no tweeting from the Oval Office ever again. I should point out it\u2019s easy for me to say that since I can\u2019t spell, but then again, neither can Donald."

He respects data, and I tell the truth, or he doesn\u2019t respect data and I tell the truth. He looks out for people who inherited their wealth like him while I\u2019m a self-made person, and I\u2019ll raise the estate tax to generate some of the revenue we need to start fighting income inequality."

But that\u2019s just the beginning, because getting it done means finally providing health insurance to every American who lacks it, and lowering costs to everyone else. And we can do it without a massive tax hike on the middle class and forcing people to give up their private insurers. We can do it by building on Obamacare and bringing down drug prices."

As mayor, I raised them in New York 43%. You want good teachers? You got to pay them. Same thing for your cops and your firefighters, your sanitation workers. They have jobs and they want to be paid, and they want to do a great job and be part of the City of New York, and that\u2019s what happened. You talk about improving public schools. I raised graduation rates by more than 40%."

Others talk about fighting climate change. I cut new York\u2019s carbon footprint by 13% and helped create a grassroots movement to close more than 300 polluting coal-fired power plants across this country. Greener jobs and a greener planet. We can get it done together. I also talk about stopping gun violence, and in New York City, we cut murders by 50% and I helped create a gun safety group with six million members that is working to pass common sense gun laws in states across this country."

But I offer a different choice and a different kind of leadership. I didn\u2019t spend my whole career in politics and I don\u2019t just go out and make speeches. I build teams, and I nurture good ideas, and I hold myself accountable for results. Like I said, I am the Un-Trump, and that\u2019s how I run my business and that\u2019s how I ran New York City."
