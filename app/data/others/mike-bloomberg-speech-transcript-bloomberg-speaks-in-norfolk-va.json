Tessa, thank you of her words and for all her advocacy on behalf of veterans and military families around this country. And also Mayor Alexander for his good work here, and for welcoming us to a great city. I\u2019m glad to be back here in Norfolk and to be standing by the USS Wisconsin, which helped protect America\u2019s freedom from World War II and through the first Gulf War. It was one of the great ships we have. Unfortunately, it was not built in New York, which I was sort of hoping for a New York built battleship out here, but when we built them, it was a long time ago and I don\u2019t think they used today."

I launched my presidential campaign in this city, and since then I\u2019ve been to almost 60 cities in 25 States around the country, and I came back to Norfolk for two reasons. The first is to announce some new plans to support veterans and military families here in Southeast, and Virginia and around the country. I won\u2019t get into all of the details, but you can rest assured that our administration will help more veterans launch small businesses. Our administration will connect veterans with good jobs, and build on the skills and training that they have, and our administration will strengthen the VA to better serve those who need it."

The second reason why I\u2019m here in Norfolk is to do something about veterans and military families know a lot about, and that is leadership, and that\u2019s really what I wanted to talk about today. And the more serious the discussion, the more important leadership really is. And there\u2019s nothing more serious than decisions that involve the lives of men and women in uniform."

Most candidates for president don\u2019t talk about these skills and qualifications because they don\u2019t have them. They don\u2019t have any experience leading large organizations when making hard decisions, and most of them are legislators, not executives."

Those are decisions that must never be taken lightly, or without broad consultation with senior military and civilian national security advisors, but they are not the only hard decisions that presidents must be prepared to make. The president mussels to decide, in this day in age, how to respond to a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. How to prepare for a combat, to combat a global pandemic like the Novel Coronavirus that threatens to become one. How to respond to aggressive foreign powers or using unconventional weapons, including cyber weapons and disinformation campaigns to disrupt our society, and so discord here."

And no one can be fully prepared for what awaits them in the oval office, but I have had some experience running large complex organizations and leading through a crisis. As mayor of New York City I oversaw a workforce of 300,000 people, and I was elected just weeks after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. People were still mourning, our city was in tatters, and our economy was in recession. Many people thought New York\u2019s best days were behind it, but I\u2019m happy to say we came together. We consulted widely. We hired a diverse, talented and experienced staff and we developed strategies to rebuild the city while also working to stop any future attacks."

So I\u2019d like to try to explain how I will be a different kind of leader in each of those areas. Let\u2019s start with team building, and I\u2019ll just tell you a quick story. Ever since FDR, reporters have written stories about elected officials first hundred days in office. They\u2019re obsessed with it. Usually those are just a laundry list of accomplishments. After my first few months in office, reporters wanting to write a hundred day story about our administration. And they asked me, \u201cWhat have you accomplished?\u201d And my answer was, \u201cWe built a team.\u201d And they said, \u201cYeah, but what did you accomplish?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no. We built a team.\u201d The reporters just could not wrap their heads around why I thought that was an important accomplishment, but the fact is the team we built over a hundred days made possible every single thing we accomplished over the next 11 years."

Near the end of his first year, he was supposedly asked about the large number of unfilled posts in the state department. His answer was, \u201cI\u2019m the only one that matters.\u201d I spell the word team with four letters, T. E. A. M. He spells it with one letter: I. When he accepted his nomination at the Republican Convention, he painted a picture of America as a lawless hell scape and said, quote, \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d end quote. A real leader would never say those things. It\u2019s what\u2019s called a cult leader that would say, and the president seems to view the Republican Party as a cult that will defend anything he does or says no matter how lawless or reckless."

Unilateralism is not a viable option in a global age when we need collective response. No single country can deal with climate changes, or pandemics, or terrorism, or nuclear proliferation.
