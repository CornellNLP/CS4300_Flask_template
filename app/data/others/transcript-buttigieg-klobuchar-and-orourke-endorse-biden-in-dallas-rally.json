And that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president. And it is in the name of that very same goal that I’m delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president [inaudible 00:00:23]. And I do it with great pleasure knowing just how much we need to do, not only to win, which is so very important. And when I say win, not just win back the white house, but make sure we bring those vitally important house and Senate and local races with us. Yes we can yell for that. But also that we’ve got to do it in a way that starts to change the toxic and divisive nature of our politics right now we can’t go on like this. And we’ve got a politics right now that makes it sound like being loudest is tantamount to being right. We need a politics that’s about decency, politics that brings back dignity. And that is what we sought to practice in my campaign. That’s what Joe Biden has been practicing his entire life. So what we see right now is an opportunity not just to meet that imperative of getting a new and better president, but of doing it with a leader who will practice that way of rallying people together with ideas that are big enough to unite the American people of all generations. And if you think about it, on some of the most important issues affecting my generation and the next gender climate change, gun violence, Joe Biden has been delivering on those very priorities from taking on the NRA and winning to negotiating the Paris climate accord to shepherding the passage of the affordable care act. This is what has made it possible for us to achieve what has been achieved. And that is why I have such confidence that as president Joe Biden will take the ball further as it needs to go. But it’s even more than that. It’s the need to bring back dignity to the white house when we have a president [crosstalk 00:02:30]. And the country already knows without me having to say so. But I want you to know how unbelievably and unfailingly decent I have known vice president Biden to be from his visits to South bend while he was vice president to my visits as a mayor to the white house during the Obama Biden administration to perhaps especially the experiences that I have had getting to know him while competing with him. He is somebody of such extraordinary grace and kindness and empathy from taking time to talk to somebody who struggles to speak to taking time for a family that’s struggling with loss. He will bring the exact kind of empathy that is so badly lacking in this white house and along the way in his campaign will draw us together as we need a leader to do a. I commented last night and I’ve often said that politics at its best is more than policy. It’s soul craft and so it’s fitting that I am joining to support a campaign that speaks so often about the soul of this nation. I don’t believe the world is divided up into people who are all good and people who are all bad. I don’t believe that how you voted in the past makes you good or bad. I believe that each of us can have good things and bad things brought out of us, and that’s why leadership is so important. I’m looking for a leader, I’m looking for a president who will draw out what is best in each of us, and I’m encouraging everybody who was part of my campaign to join me because we have found that leader in vice-president soon to be president, Joe Biden.",

Longview, Texarkana, and East Texas? On behalf of every one of the 254 counties of this great state, we welcome Dr. Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden [Spanish 00:00:50]. Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, March 3rd, 2020, I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden. It’s the right thing to do. And let me tell you why. We need somebody who can beat Donald Trump. The man in the White House today poses an existential threat to this country, to our democracy, to free and fair elections, and we need somebody who can beat him. In Joe Biden, we have that man. We have someone who, in fact, is the antithesis of Donald Trump. Joe Biden is decent. He’s kind. He’s caring. He’s empathetic. I don’t know if you saw this last week. The vice president was at a town hall in South Carolina, and Reverend Anthony Thompson came up to the microphone and talked about losing his wife at Mother Emanuel AME in South Carolina in 2015. Joe Biden listened to him, in fact, with his eyes closed so that he could concentrate on every single word that that man said, and then he spoke back to him and to all of us from his heart filled with compassion and love and the power to heal. He wanted to heal that man. He wanted to heal Charleston, South Carolina. But as someone who lives in El Paso, Texas, which saw another white nationalist rampage, where 22 people were killed solely based on their ethnicity, on the color of their skin, on their country of national origin, I felt Joe Biden healing us. At a time that this country is so polarized, so deeply divided, we need somebody who can bring us together and heal us. We need somebody who can reestablish the moral authority of the United States. We need somebody who will fight for democracy here and abroad because democracy is under attack here and abroad. We need Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, I have traveled to each one of the 254 counties of Texas. I know this state. And I’ve got to tell you, the fact that you take the time to listen to us, to be here, to understand our concerns as well as our aspirations, means the world to us. This is a state that is dead last in the United States when it comes to the number of insured, which means that we have people dying of diabetes. The largest mental health care facility in the state is the county jail system in the state. Those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and clinical depression are getting arrested on purpose to get the care that they cannot find otherwise. We know that you are going to lead us to make sure that there is healthcare for each and every single one of us, every child, every man, and every woman. Mr. Vice President, you also know that whether it was Sutherland Springs or Santa Fe High School or El Paso, Texas, at that Walmart this last August, or Midland-Odessa in the same year, we understand the devastating toll of gun violence in America and in this state, and we need someone who’s going to make sure that, whether it is a mass shooting in a Walmart or in our school, or the shootings that far too often take those in our communities of color one or two at a time, who don’t even make the headlines or the front page or the news, we don’t even know their names, you’re going to stand up for each and every one of us and end gun violence in America with universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders, and an end to the selling of weapons of war in our communities. Keep that stuff on the battlefield. Don’t bring it into our homes. Mr. Vice President, this energy-rich state that has fueled the growth of America also wants to be the state that, with your leadership, leads the charge to confront climate change before it is too late. We’re counting on you.",

We won more votes than any Democrat had in Texas history. Young voter turnout up 500% in early voting. These were the gains. 12 new members of the state House, all Democrats replacing Republicans. Two new members of Congress, including the all-time great Colin Allred right here in this community. 17 African-American women elected to judicial positions in Harris County. Now is the time to finish the job, make sure that we win the nine seats that we lacked to take control of the state House for the first time in 20 years, end the racist gerrymandering in Texas, and move forward on the issues we care most about you. You, Mr. Vice President, as the top of the ticket can help us do that. I want to let you all know- I love you too, and we all love Joe. I am going to treat Joe and Jill right. We’re going to take them to a world-class meal tonight. There’s a Whataburger less than half a mile from here. But first, make this one promise. Make this one promise. I’m getting Whataburger orders shouted from behind me, okay? You, your family, your friends, your neighbors, your classmates, your colleagues, every single one of us is going to get after it and vote tomorrow. Are you with me? Are you with Joe?

And how fun it is, how wonderful it is to be standing next to him on a stage when it isn’t the debate stage. I actually, as you all know, announced my campaign for president in the middle of a Minnesota blizzard just so I could impress everyone in Texas, and in particular everyone in Dallas. So we didn’t let the snow stop us, we didn’t let the cold stop us. We did continue through that speech because that’s what we do in the heartland. We made a little in this campaign, in my campaign go along way. And our homegrown campaign with a tremendous staff that stuck together from the beginning and volunteers every way beat the odds, and that got me up here right now on this stage in Dallas. The most amazing thing was getting to know so many people across the country, and I know the Vice President knows this as well. The Vietnam vet who sobbed as he talked about losing his son to mental illness. The rancher who had voted for Donald Trump, but after he saw him give a speech in front of that sacred wall with the CIA stars of those that lost their lives in the line of duty, decided he wasn’t going to do it again. The immigrant mom who told me she works two jobs all for her kids. And through it all I said to them … and I believe this now standing with the Vice President, if you feel tired of the noise and the nonsense and our politics, and if you are tired of the extremes, you have a home with me. And I think you know you have a home with Joe Biden. So many people joined us, supported us as we carried forward with this simple but fundamental message, and that it is time for Americans to join hands instead of pointing fingers. It is time to turn back the division, and the hate, and the exclusion, and the bitterness. And it is time to work together to lift up those who are left out and to bring people with us instead of shoving them away. I believe … and it’s the reason I’m up here, that we are never going to out divide the divider in chief. We must, as Americans dream bigger than that. We have to be better than that because if we spend the next four months dividing our party and going at each other, we will spend the next four years watching Donald Trump tear apart this country. We need … Texans, we need to unite our party and our country, and to do it not just with our words, but with our actions. It is up to us, all of us, to put our country back together to heal this country and then to build something even greater. I believe we can do this together and that is why today I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president.",

He can bring our country together and build that coalition of our fired up democratic base … and it is fired up. As well as independence and moderate Republicans because we do not in our party want to just eat by a victory, we want to win big and Joe Biden can do that. As you know from all the work he has done that he will not just govern with his head … He’s got a lot of good ideas, but he will also govern with his heart. I know that you know here in this big State of Texas that the heart of this country is bigger than the heart of the guy in the White House. It is time America for a president that understands that service is not about self interest, it is about sacrifice. It is time for a president that represents all of America, including people in the middle of this country at a time when we see people in extremes that are trying to drown out people. And most of all, it is time … and this is what I feel so strongly about. It is time for a president that will bring decency and dignity back to the White House.",
