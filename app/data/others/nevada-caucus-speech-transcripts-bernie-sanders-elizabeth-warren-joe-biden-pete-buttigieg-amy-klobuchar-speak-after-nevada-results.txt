And in Nevada and in New Hampshire and in Iowa what we showed is that our volunteers are prepared to knock on hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doors. That no campaign has a grassroots movement like we do, which is another reason why we\u2019re going to win this election. In Nevada. I want to thank our rank and file union members."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "03:24", "text": "I want to thank Make The Road and all of the grassroots organizations that helped us win there. We are going to win here in Texas. We are going to win across the country because the American people are sick and tired of a president who lies all of the time.

They are sick and tired of a president who is undermining American democracy, who thinks he is above the law and who apparently has never read the Constitution in this country."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "04:37", "text": "The American people are sick and tired of a government, which is based on greed, corruption, and lies. They want an administration which is based on the principles of justice. Economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice. Now Trump and his friends think they are going to win this election. They think they\u2019re going to win this election by dividing our people up based on the color of their skin or where they were born or their religion or their sexual orientation. We are going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite. We\u2019re bringing our people together. We are bringing our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian, gay and straight."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "06:19", "text": "We are bringing our people together around an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not the one percent. All over this country, workers are sick and tired of earning starvation wages. You can\u2019t make it on nine bucks an hour or 11 bucks an hour or 12 bucks an hour. We are going to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. We are going to provide equal pay for equal work for women. We are going to make it easier for workers to join unions. We\u2019re going to create millions of good paying union jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.

And because we believe education, we believe that all of our people, regardless of their income are entitled to a higher education. And that is why we\u2019re going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And we\u2019re going to cancel all student debt in this country by imposing a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. 12 years ago we bailed out the crooks on Wall Street, now it is their turn to help the working families in this country.

Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.

In America, you should not go bankrupt because you\u2019re struggling with cancer. The function of a rational and humane healthcare system is to guarantee healthcare to all, not make 100 billion in profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies. And we are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. Under our administration, the American people will not pay in some cases, 10 times more for the same prescription drugs sold in Mexico, Canada, or in Europe."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "11:56", "text": "And when we talk about the major crises facing this country, it is a sad state of affairs when we have a President of the United States who believes that climate change is a hoax.

And our administration believes in science, not right wing extremism. And that is why together we are going to adopt the principles of the Green New Deal.

We do not want to continue a situation where we have more people in jail than any other country, including China four times our size. And the people in jail are disproportionately African American, Latino and Native American. And that is why we are going to invest in our young people in jobs, in education. Not more jails and incarceration. That is why we are going to end private prisons and detention centers.

Our gun safety legislation will be written by the American people, not the NRA."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "18:26", "text": "We will have universal background checks. We will end the gun show loophole. And we will do what the American people want and that is end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country. I am a United States Senator and I am on the floor of the Senate very often listening to speeches from Republican conservatives. And as you know their mantra, what they talk about all the time is that they believe in small government. They believe in getting the government off the backs of the American people. And what I say tonight to those hypocrites, if you believe in getting the government off the backs of the American people, understand that it is women who have a right to control their own bodies, not the government."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "19:45", "text": "And my promise to you is that I will never nominate anybody to the Supreme Court or the federal bench who is not 100% pro Roe v.

Now I don\u2019t have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know that 99% is a heck of a lot bigger number than one percent. So what this campaign is about is understanding that if we do not allow Trump to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born, or our religion or our sexual orientation, if we stand together, if we fight for an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. If we get involved in the political process, if we stand for justice, if we stand for compassion, if we understand that we are all in this together.

I believe we can defeat Trump and deliver for the American people by empowering the American people to make their own healthcare choices with Medicare for all who want it.
