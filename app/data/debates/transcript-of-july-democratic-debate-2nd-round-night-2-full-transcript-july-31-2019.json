Candidates, we’re about to begin opening statements but first, a quick review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to try to ensure a fair debate. As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion. You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification. The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect them and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time. A candidate infringing on another candidate’s time will have his or her time reduced. We again remind our audience inside the Fox Theater to try to remain silent when candidates are actively debating. The candidates need to be able to properly hear the questions and each other.",

We got rid of Stop and Frisk and we lowered crime. We raise the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour, yes, it can be done. Now tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats. There are good people on this stage, but there are real differences. Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president. Kamala Harris said she’s not trying to restructure society. Well, I am. For 40 years, working people have taken it on the chin in this country. For 40 years, the rich and gotten richer and they paid less and less in taxes. It cannot go on this way. When I am president, we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure it’s a country that puts working people first.",

This is a big, bold, ambitious plan for clean energy for a big, bold, ambitious nation. Middle ground approaches are not enough. We must confront the fossil fuel industry. I’ve been working on this for 25 years and now we know this, we’re a tipping point. And whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time.

Whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country. I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling and I know what that’s like too. I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood. But like many of you, I don’t want to make America anything again. I don’t want us to go backwards. We’re not going back to the past.

Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don’t believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you’ve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of America’s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what we’re doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone. The automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today. It is why Donald Trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people.",

We have always been prepared to fight for our ideals. We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are. And I’ll tell you, I come from fighters.

My sister Maya and I joke, we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults, who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice.

Responsive to their needs, understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy. I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan. So I devised a plan where it’s going to be 10 years of a transition. I listened to American families who said, I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare. Because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.

My heart is palpitating, because I’m worried that his throat will close. I am not worried about not having an insurance card, or a credit card in my wallet. I know whatever they’re going to prescribe, whether it’s an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it. The truth about healthcare in America today is people can’t afford it. They cannot afford, and these insurance companies, for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I’m sorry. They’re for profit companies. They have an obligation to their shareholders. They pay their CEO millions of dollars. They have to have quarterly profits. They have fat in the system that’s real and it should be going to healthcare. So let’s not lose the forest through the trees and last, let’s not forget what the Republicans are doing.

But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights. And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won’t need these awful detention facilities, that I’ve been to, seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children. This is not necessary. We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100% compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned. If they are, like the people I met in Juarez who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn’t even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values, and making ourselves less safe.",

That’s 12 or 13 trillion dollars that, from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire. We’ve got to stop doing that. And we need to invest in America again. For the money that we’ve spent, that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country. We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed. We could have fixed, not just Flint, but every- … Water system in this country. We could’ve made social security solvent for my children. But we did none of it because of self-serving politicians in Washington DC who voted for deals that were good for them. But not for Michigan or the American people.",

But then when you seek a mentor or an investor often they don’t look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one. In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitative and abusive jobs and relationships around the country. I’m talking about the waitress who’s getting harassed by her boss at the diner, who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is. What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses. And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands. It would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society. It will not change unless we change it.

So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country. To go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans. The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us. We were supposed to be going after Al-Qaeda.

Because I didn’t do anything wrong. These folks that always investigate me, they’re always trying to go after me. When it came down to it, they didn’t go after me there because I didn’t do anything wrong.” Conversely, if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook, we’re going to be able to say- “Well, sure.

I’ve taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and I’ll go to all the places in this country. I will fight for your family. Doesn’t matter who you are. It doesn’t matter where you live. It doesn’t matter who you love because that’s my responsibility. And I’ve done this before. I started out in a two to one Republican district. I won it twice. I’ve never lost an election since. And I not only bring people together electorally, but also legislatively. I get things done. So we need a president who is not afraid of the big challenges of the big fights. There is no false choice. We don’t need a liberal or progressive with big ideas, or we don’t need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters. You need someone who can do both. And that’s who I am. Please go to kirstengillibrand.com so I can make the next debate stage.",

They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia, and China, and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Now as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, you would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit. And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say incoming missile. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmongers hoax. There is no shelter. It’s all a lie. As president, I will end this insanity because it doesn’t have to be this way. I will end these wasteful regime change wars. Work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions. And take the trillions of dollars that we’ve been wasting on these wars and on these weapons, and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home. Things like healthcare for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure. The needs are great. As your president, I will put your interests above all else.",

This election is all about what kind of nation we’re going to become. You and I, we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices. People that fought in wars, and fought discrimination, folks that pick crops, and stood in picket lines. And they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today. Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty. And I’m not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion. I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation with one destiny. And our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest, and the most prosperous nation on earth. If you want to help me build that America for the future, I hope you’ll go to juliancastro.com. And on January 20th, 2021 we’ll say together, “Adios,” to Donald Trump.",

It was the fact that I wasn’t wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan. We’re up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality TV show. It’s one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our President. We need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common job jobs in America may not exist in a decade. Or, that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the Freedom Dividend, would put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult, be a game changer for millions of American families. If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com, and see what $1,000 a month would mean to your community. I have done the math. It’s not left.

And one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around. And Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us, or underestimate our worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause. That’s the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy that was a UAW worker. My grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundry mat right here in this city. That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that. But the dream of this country is under threat right now. Well, my mom’s generation, 80, 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. It’s now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crises in our country. And the crises is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump. I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor, and not the ceiling. The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him. He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room. It’s when we start focusing on each other, and understanding that our common bonds, and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before. It’s what’s gonna save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as President of the United States. Not just uniting the Democratic Party, but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God.

I’ve taken on the for profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. I’ve preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children. And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House. And I’m going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this, by their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards. What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years. And let me tell you, we’ve got a long rap sheet. We’re looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families. We’ve got a person who was put babies in cages and separated children from their parents. We have someone who passed his so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families. So we must defeat him. And then in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country. And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at three o’clock in the morning. And that is my agenda. The 3:00 AM agenda that is focused on getting folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the healthcare they need, and the future they deserve.

We’re in a battle for the soul of America. This is the most consequential election any one of you no matter how old or young you are has ever, ever participate in. Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration. Hard to overcome the damage he’s done, but we can overcome it. Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way. The America we know will no longer exist. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. And we choose. We choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything. This is the United States of America. We’ve acted together. We have never, never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was.
