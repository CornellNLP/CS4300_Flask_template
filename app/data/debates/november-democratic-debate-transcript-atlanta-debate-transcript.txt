Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically. Senator Warren, you have said already that you\u2019ve seen enough to convict the president, and remove him from office. You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also US Senators may soon have to take that vote. Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "00:45", "text": "Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first read the Mueller Report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle, no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it. But I want to add one more part based on today\u2019s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? This is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check a million dollars, and that tells us about what\u2019s happening in Washington."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "01:28", "text": "The corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they\u2019re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I\u2019ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don\u2019t ask to be an ambassador, because I\u2019m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who\u2019s running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say, we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder."}, {"speaker": "Rachel Maddow", "time": "02:05", "text": "Senator Warren, thank you, Senator Klobuchar, You\u2019ve said that you support the impeachment inquiry, but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president. After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?"}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "02:21", "text": "I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct, and I\u2019ve called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count, and make a decision. But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country\u2019s interest. And this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man, and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers, and our workers, to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day."}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "03:15", "text": "That is what this guy does. And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that\u2019s going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum, and on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect, and he said this, \u201cWe told the truth. We obey the law. We kept the peace.\u201d We told the truth, we obeyed the law. We kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a President of the United States."}, {"speaker": "Rachel Maddow", "time": "03:45", "text": "Senator, thank you, Senator Sanders, I\u2019d like to go to you. Americans are watching these impeachment hearings. At the same time, they\u2019re also focused on their more immediate, daily, economic, and family concerns. How central should the president\u2019s conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any democratic nominees campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "04:07", "text": "Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We\u2019re going to lose the election. Right now, you\u2019ve got 87 million people who have no health insurance, or under-insured. We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump\u2019s corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice."}, {"speaker": "Rachel Maddow", "time": "05:20", "text": "Mayor Budttigieg, let me put the same question to you. How [inaudible 00:05:24] campaign, how central would it be to yours?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "05:31", "text": "Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics, and it is not a part of the campaign, but the president\u2019s conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen, in the abuse of power that we\u2019re learning more about in the investigations. But just to be clear, the president\u2019s already confessed to it on television, but that\u2019s just part of what we\u2019ve seen. Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess, in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump Presidency comes to an end, one way or the other."}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "06:21", "text": "I\u2019m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up, and the Trump Presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever, and while doing it, address big issues that didn\u2019t take a vacation for the impeachment process, or for the Trump Presidency as a whole, a climate approaching the point of no return. The fact that we\u2019ve still got to act on healthcare, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold onto what they\u2019ve got."}, {"speaker": "Rachel Maddow", "time": "06:57", "text": "Mr. Mayor."}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "06:58", "text": "Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president, and will be at the heart of our campaign."}, {"speaker": "Rachel Maddow", "time": "07:02", "text": "Mr Mayor. Thank you. Andrea."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "07:03", "text": "Vice President Biden, you\u2019ve suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again. But right now Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you\u2019ve worked with for decades, are demanding investigations, not only of you but also of your son. How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "07:24", "text": "Well, look, the next President of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, that\u2019s number one. And number two, going to have to be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places, and get a Senate majority. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place. And secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the house, and in the Senate? And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned number one, that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee. That\u2019s pretty clear."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "08:06", "text": "He held up aid to make sure that while at the same time innocent people in [inaudible 00:08:11] are getting killed by Russian soldiers. Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t want me to be president. So I\u2019ve learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question, who is most likely to do what needs to be done? Produce a democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?"}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "08:38", "text": "Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?"}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "08:41", "text": "Well first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House, and there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment is justice is on the ballot. And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland, by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President, from what we heard today, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff. And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue."}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "09:21", "text": "And back to the question that you asked earlier, which is what does this mean for the American people? Because what it means when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America. The powerful people, who with their arrogance think they can get away with this, and then everybody else. Because here\u2019s the thing. For those working people who are working two and three jobs, if they don\u2019t pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don\u2019t pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody, and part of the reason I\u2019m running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people. And not just for some."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "10:04", "text": "Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter. If you were elected though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump Presidency, among other things. Do you see that divide as permanent, or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "10:24", "text": "So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us. And that is, that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks. You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets. Your first 50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you\u2019ve got to pitch in a few pennies more. Here\u2019s the thing, doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It\u2019s about saying you built something great in this country, good for you. But you did it using workers. All of us help pay to educate. You did it using, you\u2019re getting your goods to on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters, all of us help pay the salaries for."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "11:17", "text": "So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one 10th of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents, so everybody else gets a chance to make it. And here\u2019s the thing, that\u2019s something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about. Because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and [crosstalk 00:11:50] real change."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "11:50", "text": "Thank you Senator. Thank you. Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "11:53", "text": "Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats, and I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue. But here\u2019s the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth as well."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "12:26", "text": "When I stood in church recently, and asked folks in a black church, how many people here want to be entrepreneurs? Half the church raised their hands. If we as a country don\u2019t start, if we as a party, don\u2019t start talking, not just about how to tax wealth, but to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream. Because yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. But the people in communities I frequent, they\u2019re not aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities of opportunity. And that\u2019s what our party has to be about as well."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "13:06", "text": "Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "13:07", "text": "Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one 10th of 1% in this country, and we can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five. That is transformative. We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women who do this work, and we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities, and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who\u2019ve got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation\u2019s future."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "14:00", "text": "All right. Let me let Senator Booker respond."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "14:01", "text": "Sure."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "14:02", "text": "You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We\u2019re all united in wanting to see universal preschool, and I\u2019ll fight for that. We\u2019re all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for two parents that went to HBCUs. But the tax, the way we\u2019re putting the forward right now, the wealth tax, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s cumbersome. It\u2019s been tried by other nations. It\u2019s hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation. But again, we as Democrats have got to start talking, not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "14:37", "text": "Look at VC dollars in this country. 75% of them go to the three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas. If I am President of the United States, we\u2019re going to have a fair just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but dear God, we\u2019re going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. We\u2019re going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "15:03", "text": "Thank you, Senator, Senator Warren."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "15:03", "text": "We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "15:03", "text": "Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "15:08", "text": "So, just the idea behind what is fair, today the 99% in America are on track to pay about 7.2% of their total wealth in taxes."}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "15:20", "text": "I\u2019m not disagreeing with that."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "15:20", "text": "The top one 10th of 1% that I want to say pay two cents more, they\u2019ll pay 3.2% in America. I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it\u2019s time that we ask those at the very top to pay more, so that every single one of our children gets-"}, {"speaker": "Senator Booker", "time": "15:36", "text": "But everybody is tired of freeloading billionaires. Everybody\u2019s tired of corporations paying zero taxes, I\u2019m not disagreeing with that."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "15:43", "text": "Thank you very much. Senator Warren. Thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, you have said quote, I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point. The Republican party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office. So what would you do that President Obama didn\u2019t do to change that?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "16:01", "text": "Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we\u2019re in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues, that didn\u2019t exist in the same way even a few years ago. Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration, and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing. If we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on healthcare."}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "16:32", "text": "The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare, is that that is something that as a governing strategy, we can unify the American people around. Creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not. And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years as Senator Warren has proposed or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Mitchell", "time": "17:14", "text": "Thank you Mr. Mayor. Kristen Welker."}, {"speaker": "Kristen Welker", "time": "17:16", "text": "Let\u2019s talk about Medicare for all. Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all, Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care, protecting Obamacare. Democrats are divided on this issue. What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general elections?"}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "17:38", "text": "I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can\u2019t afford it. People didn\u2019t take the test the doctor recommended because they just can\u2019t afford it. So here is my plan. Let\u2019s bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can, as fast as we can. On day one, as president, I will do, bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. That\u2019s going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people."}, {"speaker": "Senator Warren", "time": "18:14", "text": "I\u2019m going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump Administration. And in the first hundred days, I\u2019m going to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four, income less than $50,000. I\u2019m going to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and longterm care. And then in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it, and taste it and live with it, we\u2019re going to vote, and we\u2019re going to want Medicare for all."}, {"speaker": "Kristen Welker", "time": "18:55", "text": "Senator, thank you, Senator.

Is President Obama wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "19:24", "text": "No, he\u2019s right. We don\u2019t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional. Now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we got 87 million uninsured, underinsured, in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada, or other countries. 500, 000 people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer, and that\u2019s a reason to go bankrupt?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "20:11", "text": "Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry.

I think now is the time. And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all, Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses.

Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense. We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. 160 million people like their private insurance, and if they don\u2019t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal. In my plan, drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But here\u2019s the deal. They get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies, they want no competition, and my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all."}, {"speaker": "Kristen Welker", "time": "22:01", "text": "Vice President Biden, thank you.

I\u2019m running for president to be the democratic nominee that rebuilds our democratic party, takes it out of their hands and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country, and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who were calling for an end to this ongoing Bush, Clinton, Trump, foreign policy, doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm\u2019s way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security, and have cost us thousands of American lives."}, {"speaker": "Tulsi Gabbard", "time": "23:21", "text": "These are Wars that have cost us as American taxpayers, trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs.

What we need on the stage on the November is someone who has the ability to win, and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition, and bring the party and the nation together, I believe I am that candidate."}, {"speaker": "Ashley Parker", "time": "25:02", "text": "Thank you Senator.
