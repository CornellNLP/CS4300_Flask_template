Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate’s experience, character, and vision for the future as they make this important decision. I’m the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city, and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts that favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the foreign relations committee, and I chaired the Middle East sub committee for four years. As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession, and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state, it happens to be Nevada, where we’re having this debate. I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I’ve always been honest, I have the courage to take the longterm view, and I’ve shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards. As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. I believe in prosperity through peace, I want to end these wars. I look forward to the discussion ahead. Thank you.",

Now, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day with the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. We’re looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been co-opted by it, and also who has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I’ve also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor. In government service, I’ve fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration. In the Senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veteran’s education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 GI Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the strategic pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected. I know where my loyalties are. My mother grew up in the poverty of East Arkansas, chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam, learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi. You may be sure that in a Webb administration the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.

My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William, and Jack, and like you, there is nothing we wouldn’t do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. After 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader. Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, The Dream Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation. I have learned how to get things done, because I am very clear about my principles. Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country’s doing better. We are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now, for there is a deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Justice does not solve itself. What I’m talking about is this. Our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70% of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families. Our economy isn’t money, it’s people, it’s all of our people. We must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all families, instead of saddling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. We must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. The question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do. That is why I am running for president, and I need your help. Thank you.",

The middle class of this country, for the last 40 years, has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top 1%. As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt, and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs, and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people. Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous, climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51%. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36%. It seems to me that instead of building more jails, and providing more incarceration, maybe, just maybe, we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids. What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have.

I have been proud and privileged to serve as First Lady, as a senator from New York, and as Secretary of State. I’m the granddaughter of a factory worker, and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. Every day I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available, not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time, my entire adult life, looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead. In particular, define the ways for each child to live up to his or her God given potential. I’ve traveled across our country over the last month listening and learning, and I’ve put forward specific plans about how we’re going to create more good paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science, and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. At the center of my campaign is how we’re going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more. Including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who help to make them. Then we have to figure out how we’re going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little, and the middle class pays too much. I have specific recommendations about how we’re going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle class families. I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it’s about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. During the course of the evening tonight, I’ll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I’ve done behind them. For me, this is about bringing our country together again, and I will do everything I can to heal the divides. The divides economically because there’s too much inequality, the racial divides, the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community so that we will work together and yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, “You too can grow up to be President.”",

It was because we had allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America. I ran and promised people that together, we could turn that around. We put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one crime, by more than any major city in America over the next 10 years. I did not make our city immune to setbacks, but I attended a lot of funerals. Including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor, African-American neighborhood, and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. We’ve saved over 1,000 lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together, and the vast majority of them were young, and poor, and black.

There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnics elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. The third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signal, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq. I fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy of focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. We need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because was the way they treat their own people. I would say this. I’ve been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this … Well, you’ve let a lot of people go over their time. I would say that … … To the unelected authoritarian government of China. You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens and in a Webb Administration, we will do something about that.",

We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world, but, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we’ve got to do more about the lives of these children. That’s why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential.

My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition.

We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.",

What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100% clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you’ve become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you’ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples.

That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion dollars in wealth disappeared. And although we’ve made progress, we’re standing but not running the way America needs to.
