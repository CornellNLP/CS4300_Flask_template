It is a critical test for candidates, and their campaigns, at a critical time for our country.

The truth is that our problems didn’t start just with Donald Trump, and we won’t solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision. Universal pre-K and universal health care. Unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy. A tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living. First, we have to win, and that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. That’s what Kennedy did. It’s what Carter did. It’s what Clinton did. It’s what Barack Obama did, and it’s what I can do in this race. Get back Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.

On August 3rd in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country. The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is. The cost and the consequence of his presidency. Racism and violence that had long had been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas. Where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured, by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place. Inspired to kill by our president. The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another, and try to make differences without distinctions. Mountains out of molehills. We have to be bigger. We have to see clearly. We have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That’s what I want to do for you as President of the United States. Thank you.",

She said, “Boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that’s all there’s ever going to be, but if you’re stubborn, and defiant, and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.” She was a church woman that said, “Without vision, the people will perish.” Well, that’s exactly what we did. We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people thought were impossible. That’s the story of America. At our best, we unify. We find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party. Not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. That’s why I’m running for president, and that’s how I will lead this nation.",

Good politics is supposed to be not about the day to day fights of the politicians, but about the day to day lives of Americans. We just marked the anniversary of 9-11. All day today, I’ve been thinking about September 12th. The way it felt when, for a moment, we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people.

You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you’ve not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says the sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. Here’s what you don’t get. What you don’t get is that the American people are so much better than this. We know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we’re registered to vote.

Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate. Both Senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for all. You want to build on Obamacare, and not scrap it. They proposed spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt, and they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs. Are Senators Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go, and where the country needs to go?",

Well, I’m for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way in which we add to it, replace everything that’s been cut, add a public option. Guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one. Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn’t cost $30 trillion. $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. That’s before it exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that’s happened. As far as my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. The senator has in fact come forward and said how he’s going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. There’s a lot of other things that need to be done. I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools, that are title one schools, from $15 to $45 billion a year. I go down the line, and each of the things we’re talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it’s better.",

I figure that’s a lot of seniors, and they should be allowed to get a better price. When it comes to our health care, and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor’s creed, which is do no harm. While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. On page eight, on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. That means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. That’s in four years. I don’t think that’s a bold idea. I think it’s a bad idea. What I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option.

We all fought against it, and then the late great John McCain, at that moment at about 2:00 in the morning, killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country. Fast-forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump’s administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have preexisting conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans, and frankly I think this discussion have given the American public a headache.

We’ve got to do better. In my proposal, Medicare for America, say everyone who’s uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare.

We have to be able to answer this challenge, and it is found in our education system where in Texas a five year old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended, or expelled, based on the color of their skin. In our healthcare system where there is a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there’s 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America.

But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside. So I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time. I created one of the first in the nation training for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system. Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not, but my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable, and finally, my plan is about making sure that in America’s criminal justice system we de-incarcerate woman and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact.

So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis, but in the prosecutor’s office they were handled with a grand jury. That’s how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Philips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it. When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Taisha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window. What changes did we make? Go after white collar crimes in a big way. Diversify the office in a big way. Work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID, and as a senator and as your President I will make sure that we don’t just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90% of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let’s reduce those sentences for non-violent offenders and let’s get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.",

When Dr. King was assassinated we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I’ve been involved from the beginning. As a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etc. The fact of the matter is that what’s happened is that we’re in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn’t be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime. When we were in the White House we released 36000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. I’m the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. So we have to change the whole way we look at this, and we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldn’t be in there for a misdemeanor. That should be a misdemeanor, they should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned. When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote, but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way. I’ve laid out a detailed plan along those lines, and the fact is we’ve learned so much more about- Thank you.",

There’s no difference in American between blacks, whites, and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs, but if you’re African-American you’re almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives. And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Bryan Stevenson says “Treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent”. So I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstratively now show that there are 17000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say “When I am President of the United States we will release them”, and let me be specific. I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass onto this president for criminal justice reform, that has already led to 1000s of people coming out of jail. If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didn’t make it retractive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17000 people, and I challenge you, don’t just say big statements, back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom.

Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period. And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.

So the if you’re among Latinos, and you know this is very real. So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country, immigration. Vice president Biden as a presidential candidate in 2008 you supported the border wall saying, “Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence.” This is what you said. Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in US history. Did you do anything to prevent those deportations?

This is the president has done a great deal, so I’m proud to have served with him. What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed. I would in fact make sure that we immediately surge to the border. All those people are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard. That’s who we are. We’re a nation that says if you want to flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come. I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum. And by the way, retrospectively, you know the 25th anniversary of the violence against women act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it.

Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fear-mongering and otherizing migrants, and that’s very different for Barack Obama. But my problem with vice president Biden and Corey pointed this out last time, is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, “I was there. That’s me too.” And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, “Well, that was the president.” I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama’s work, but not have to answer to any questions. I don’t get that. Let me just say- I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because I’m not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. I’m not going to back pedal. I’m not going to pretend like I don’t have my own vision for immigration. So we’re not going to give up DACA. We’re not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20th, 2021 we’re going to have a democratic president.

We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for economic and social dynamism.

In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went in to ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out because they never thought it would happen to him. In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow. And it’s why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America, includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs, but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city. The only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. It’s one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington to create city issued municipal IDs. So that people regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification. We have an opportunity to actually get something done. But we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines, often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values.

There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa. So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table. That’s what I would do. I wouldn’t have put all these tariffs in place and I wouldn’t have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces he’s going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13th he cuts it in half, a week later he says he’s going to reduce taxes. The day after that he says he’s not going to do it. The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation. And yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement like we’ve done in Northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting president Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit. So we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.",

I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff, and that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen. You asked earlier about China, it’s a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable. We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents.

You reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency, meaning that we’re going to put that country together. It can not be put together. Let me say it again, it will not be put together. It’s three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties … the three provinces in the east. There are not any part of the [inaudible 00:20:37] run it. I will go on and on. But here’s the point. The point is that it’s a counter-terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases, insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from, and to move against what we know. We don’t need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford’s a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we’ve had for eight years. With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that I should’ve never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing, to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof. I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way. There was no plan. We should not be engaged. We didn’t have the people with us. We didn’t have our aligned … We didn’t have allies with us, etc. And it was later when we came into office, that Barack, the president, turned to me and said, “Joe …” when they said we got to plan to get out, he turned to the whole security, and said, “Joe will organize this. Get the troops home.” My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand, and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from moving in. Now-",

What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future. In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe, is extremely unfair. I’ll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right. I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave. I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage, and that we expand the trade union movement. I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge, not in the media, and not in Congress. You got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies, and in the media.

And also, here in the United States, offer a temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans. That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do. For all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community, he has failed. I will not. I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st-century Marshall Plan for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And under my administration, we’re going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They’re our neighbors, and we have a lot of things in common.

In a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case, challenging how Texas financed its schools. I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more. That would recruit diverse ranks of teachers. That would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots. To uplift the quality of life. To invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED. Healthcare opportunities. Those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper. Those are the types of things we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They’re not. Well I’m not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.",

This means older books, less access to computers, and often worse outcomes. What is your plan to address segregation?

I think I’m the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as Mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools. We produce results. A lot of folks here talking about raising teachers salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey. We didn’t stop there. We closed poor performing charter schools, but dagnabbit we expanded high performing charter schools. We were a city that said, “We need to find local solutions that work for our community.” The results speak for themselves. We’re now the number one city in America for Beat the Odds schools. From high poverty to high performance. Strategies like investing in our children work. I’ll tell you this. I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from the other issues. That’s why my friend Secretary Castro is 100% right. We are in the reality we are right now because Vice President of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago just in my lifetime. That were redlining communities, disinvesting in communities. More than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation, and housing, and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they’re also struggling with environmental injustice. If you’ve talked to someone who’s a parent of a child who has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you’ll know this is a national problem because there’s over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan. If I’m President of the United States it is a holistic solution to education. From raising teachers’ salary, fully funded special education, but combating the issues of poverty, combating the issues of racial segregation, combating the issues of a criminal justice system that takes- … parents away from their kids.

It took … you know, Kierkegaard said, “Faith sees best in the dark.” Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured. I’d just been elected, not sworn in. I lost my faith for awhile. I came back. Then later when my son Beau came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later, a year and a half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul. The fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do.

You know, we’ve all been through that some form or another. It just takes … just for me, the way I’ve dealt with it is finding purpose. My purpose is to do what I’ve always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy.

My story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. I got a scholarship. Then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the university of Houston, and I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had four to six year olds. At the end of that first year I was visibly pregnant. Back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me … wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So, there I am. I’m at home, I’ve got a baby, I can’t have a job. What am I going to do? Here’s resilience. I said, “I’ll go to law school.” The consequence was, I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. It let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. The reason I’m standing here today is because I got back up. I fought back. I know what’s broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America. That’s why I’m here.",

What happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80% of the vote. What I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what’s worth more to you than winning. I think that’s what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about. This election is not about any of us up here. It is not about this President, even though it’s hard to talk of anything else some days. It’s about the people who trust us with their lives.

I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey in 2002, took on the political machine. Boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle, and we lost that election. Here’s a bit of advice to everybody. If you’re going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it because it made for an Oscar nominated documentary called Street Fight. But hen unfortunately, another setback, it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dag nab Penguins, for crying out loud. The people in my community of living in the projects told me, “Don’t give up on the people, and the people won’t give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions, and you’re going to win.” You know what? We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our city’s history. More than that, the lesson was there. We didn’t give up. We were taking on America’s toughest problems from crime to poverty. We transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. There’s more work to do, but I haven’t given up on the people. I still live in that community. This is the big lesson. My staff and my friends and my community told me, “If you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor’s race, but that’s not what life is about.” There’s an old African saying that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.” The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. The test of America right now, it’s not a referendum on Donald Trump. It’s a referendum on us and who we are and who we’re going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there’s nothing we can’t do together as a nation.",

In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the President of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that. The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country. We don’t see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength and to our security and to our safety. Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims. He’s the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girl’s soccer team of ten and 11 year old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He’s still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he’s still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team. Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica and Marcella, their wives, they exemplify resilience to me. When we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we’re defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.

That made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace. Then got married. My husband’s out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter. Our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we were going to have this perfect, perfect birth. She was really sick, and she couldn’t swallow. She was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half. But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out. I thought this could never happen to any other mom again. So, I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay. When they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyist two to one. When they said, “When should it take place?”, they all raised their hand and said, “Now.” That is what motivated me to go into public service. When I got to that gridlock of Washington DC and got to work and pass over a hundred bills … I know a lot of my friends here are from the Left, but remember I am from the middle of the country. I believe if we’re going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit.

Castro is my mother’s name and was my grandmother’s name before her. I grew up in a single parent household on the West side of San Antonio going to the public schools. Eventually my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals. When I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000. A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council. The city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year. So, everybody had another job, and my job was at the law firm. Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client. The client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn’t think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules, you can’t just go against the interests of a client. So, I was stuck. On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out. So, one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job and then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council. It was the first test that I had. I think back to that because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics is dirty or corrupting. I wondered before I went into it whether it would change who I was. I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There’s nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the President of the United States. This President has failed that test, but I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won’t. I won’t serve anybody except you and your family. Together we can create an America that’s better than ever. Thank you very much.",
