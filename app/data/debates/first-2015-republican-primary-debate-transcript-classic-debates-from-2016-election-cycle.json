I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It’s important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton’s going to be the next president, because she’s been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight. Here’s what this election better be about. This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn’t even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people’s lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don’t pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee. If I’m our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she going to lecture me about student loans?

It’s our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. I’ve written a book about this and this week I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic that people are dying because of the fact that local governments are not following the federal law. There’s much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president, and I hope to be that president, will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. And there should be a path to earned legal status for those that are here. Not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.",

The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that’s why you need an E-Verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we’re being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we are being taken advantage of. Let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. They’ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can’t get in. And they’re wondering, maybe they should come illegally. So these are important issues, and we should address it.

Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast essentially acted as an apologist. He said, “Well, gosh, the Crusades, the Inquisitions.” We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt’s President el-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.",

Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do. And every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife or husband did not die in vain. So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here’s the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left, Al-Qaeda was done for. ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died, we need to stop the Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.",

Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they’re the ones that are struggling. The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25%, just as we need to lower it for all businesses. We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare, and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs. Last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.

I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States. We’re not going to win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We’re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That’s how we’re going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.",

And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. I do believe in miracles. You know, I’ve had a lot of elections, but my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense, a movement to do things like provide economic growth, and a movement not to let anybody be behind. Today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We’ve got to unite our country again because we’re stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided. And we’ve got to listen to other people’s voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I’ve read in my lifetime, the lord is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong, he wants America to succeed, and he wants America to lead.

I hope people see it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over a hundred thousand protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.

We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn’t doing their job. It is outrageous they’ve only fired one person to date.

She thought that was a strange response. I said, “You see, when I take someone to the operating room, I’m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are.” The skin doesn’t make them who they are. The hair doesn’t make them who they are. It’s time for us to move beyond that because… our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states.
