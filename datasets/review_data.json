Built up as a super villain who radiates domination, he instead turned out to be a harmless rocker who switches between \"nice uncle from next door\" to \"bat swinging psycho killer\" whenever the script demands it.<br/><br/>Negan was supposed to surpass the Governour in terms of cruelty and malice, but in my opinion he doesn't even get close. The Governour had charisma, style, and above all, a real reason for all his experiments; his daughter. We still don't know why or how Negan came to be.<br/><br/>Season 6 was full of chest-pounding and inevitably doomed plotting by the heroes, but it was still fun to watch them descend into mass murder. Especially Carol had incredibly intense moments.<br/><br/>Season 7, after the reveal of Negan, turned out to be a super slow recuperation with the nice uncle coming over for spaghetti. They tried to show how he controls his people with rules and by burning them and so on, but overall it was a super tame story with \"Soon(TM)\" all over it.<br/><br/>Instead of fixing that in season 8, they now bury the show in one action episode after another. And its not the somewhat smart action we saw in earlier seasons, but 80's style A-Team nonsense action. Cars are bullet sponges, ammo is thrown around like its World War II, a .50 caliber machine gun mows down 50 people with ease but can't hit one dude in a Jeep, and there is no stopping to all the shooting. Even when people are having a quiet moment to talk, you hear often hear shooting in the background.<br/><br/>We rarely have those epic Daryl moments anymore, Rick has become a a hollow shell of a leader, Carl seems to be on vacation.

First off, the scenes in downtown Atlanta were incredibly visual and the scenes that took place in more rural areas were very scenic. The undead in the first season had great makeup and special effects too, the zombies had defined faces that really make them feel they were once human. If I had to pick one thing that was great about the first season, its has to be the cast... Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal make great, bad ass lead actors that also have the ability to project a range of emotions. Laurie Holden is also radiant in this season and the surrounding cast of Jeffrey DeMunn, Steven Yeun, Irone Singleton, and Norman Reedus all showcase a great character that can be easily become a fan-favorite to any.

Like an aging boxer this show doesn't really know where to go and what to do anymore. So it keeps trying to do what it did in its youth but to lesser effect. Is it time to hang up those gloves?<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with the story 'TWD' is about a group of people trying survive a zombie apocalypse.\nIt soon becomes apparent that you should fear the dead but fear the living even more.\nIt's dog eat dog, or in most cases human eating human!\nThe show started out very promising and over its eight seasons developed a bunch of characters that you will truly begin to care.\nUnfortunately the show seems to have lost its way and has become almost as clumsy as the dithering dead that walk the Earth.\nDuring the shows entire run ( I'm currently watching season eight as I write this) there has been some truly magnificent television. Some great storytelling, nail biting, riveting moments that shock and keep the audience hooked.<br/><br/>Characters come and go and the long run time of each season helps us get to know each individual thoroughly. The cast become almost like family members. So when one of them does meet their demise it's upsetting. There's been some great villains and foes along the way too. The Governor and Negan being most memorable. Negan played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan is probably the best thing about the more recent seasons. There's characters that have conflicting views. Shane played by Jon Bernthal being a good example. This show tugs on all the emotions. There's pain, anger, fear and despair. There's also the well timed piece of humour here and there to show that despite all that has happened to them these people are still human.<br/><br/>The production value of this show is of very high quality. Only the odd piece of CGI occasionally lets the side down. Particularly the CGI flames used instead of practical effects. This is odd as the practical and makeup effects in this show are second only to Game of Thrones. Prosthetic makeup effects are Oscar worthy.\nCan a TV show get an Oscar?\nI don't know but if it can this show definitely should get one.\nZombies are brought to life, if that makes any sense by some truly wonderful makeup design. Animatronics are very realistic giving the whole show a level of authenticity usually associated with a high budget Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>One criticism I do have is that the show doesn't look and sound as good as it should. As a High definition experience the picture is often grainy with no vibrancy. Possibly this is intentional to show the grubby broken down world that the show is set in.\nSound doesn't seem to immerse as well as it should. While I'll admit that it isn't bad, it just doesn't sound as involving as some other big budget TV shows. Overall 'TWD' is a superb show. One that will go down as a classic.

I LOVE zombie movies. Dawn of The Dead is my favorite. Back in the early 2000 there were several great zombie movies. Nowadays they are awful. More guns, empty characters, and explosions plus bad scripts than anything else. How in the world TWD transformed into a Steven Seagal movie? I remember the beginning was so thrilling \u0085 suspenses, a story, characters that you cared about, scary zombies. But after season 3 or 4 everything turned into guns and people fighting people. Cheap scripts, retarded dialogues, poor CGI. Take any episode from season 4 on and you can broadcast it on a cheap TV station as \"action\" movie. No one would tell the difference.<br/><br/>Right now you cannot care about any character. Bad actors that play as much as the trees in the background die by the dozen by each episode. Flashbacks and \"emotional\" (dumb) dialogues want to make us care about someone. But you can't. Zombies do not matter anymore, only rarely when they suddenly matter. It is either this image of them as \"pests\" most of the time, or lethal killers out of a sudden. I am sick of watching a cheap action movie that has nothing to do with a zombie movie. A zombie movie was a zombie movie because of the thriller surrounding this worldwide catastrophe of people turning into these creepy and horror things. That was the MAIN factor. TWD has nothing to do with that anymore.<br/><br/>If TWD would have kept 4-5 main characters and presented their struggle to live in this horror world full of zombies, then that could have been a great series. But even that has to stop. The only reason TWD continues is money. That's all. They make more money off the show. Why do you think the action happens in forests and zombies are mainly seen in packs from distance? Because it is cheap. No need to pay for shooting in a town and pay for complex CGI, a forest is perfect.<br/><br/>So. I loved this series but now I think it is the cheapest garbage out there. Honestly I don't care what happens anymore so I'll finally give up. Last episode \"Some Guy\" did it for me. I just could not bare anymore.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. However, that being said I have to disagree with the reviewer.<br/><br/>So here are the reasons I like the show.<br/><br/>First, character development, this is not usually a very big trait in the Zombie genre. If you only watched 3 episodes, this is a big part of what you watched. They take the time to give you a slight background of the characters, a chance for you to get to know them. For those of us that are big fans of the Zombie genre it gave us a chance to think \"Who would I be?\" in this situation.<br/><br/>Second, the story doesn't follow a straight line. This was a point of contention in the other review. I personally like the multiple story lines. It keeps things interesting and keeps it from becoming a boring show where I can foresee how everything is going to turn out. And before anyone says it\u0085YES I know this is based off a graphic novel. I haven't read it and will refrain from reading it for a while.<br/><br/>Third, the zombies look and act pretty bad ass. The make up is done great, not a bunch of CGI which is so common in today's world. So anyway\u0085if you aren't a fan of the zombie genre to begin with then yeah, you probably aren't going to get why so many of us love the show. However, I think most fans of the genre will love this show. <br/><br/>So in closing, for those of us who love the genre, It's a weekly dose of zombie apocalypse. <br/><br/>For those that aren't fans of the genre, when the zombie apocalypse happens and you don't know what to do\u0085don't come crying to me and my friends\u0085you'll just slow us down.<br/><br/>On second thought\u0085you may come in handy in case we need to make a hasty retreat", "rating": null, "helpful": "449 out of 710 found this helpful.", "date": "7 August 2011"}, {"title": " Best new series 2010?", "content": "First heard about this show a few weeks back.

I'm a big fan of SAO and this series is right on par with part 1 of SAO (if you're reading this and Haven't seen Sword Art Online, I would very highly recommend it- definitely one of the best anime I've ever seen.)<br/><br/>**Here's a quick note- if you aren't sure whether or not you'll want to watch this, here are some things that could keep you away. There IS gore in AOT, and while it lessens up later, the first few episodes are particularly gruesome compared to shows like Naruto or One Piece. If you're interested but not big on the gore, try watching Psycho Pass. It's a great anime in its own right but it's also not afraid of some blood. If that show has too much Gore for you then you probably won't like AOT. Also, if you get scared easily, these Titans are extremely creepy. Like, Evil-Clown level creepy. In the end, wouldn't recommend for early teens.**<br/><br/>Some reviews have given confusing accounts of what Attack on Titan is about (I'm looking at you blackmamba99971) whereas others have given much more concise sums (fanis-gav has a good one) but basically, it's a Medieval-looking time period and humanity lives in the spaces between 3 separate circular walls (Great Wall of China sized walls) one inside of the next. These walls were put up to protect humanity from the Titans, humanoids with no \"junk\" that go in sizes of 5, 7, 15, and 60 meters (A tall human is 2 meters by the way). No-one knows where the titans came from or how they survive/reproduce or even how they can be killed for awhile. All they know is that Titans eat humans simply because they enjoy it. After \"100 years of peace\" living within the walls, the Titans break through a part of the Outermost wall where a young boy named Eren lives. To put it shortly, he sees some people killed right in front of him and vows to \"wipe out each and every Titan.\"<br/><br/>Now here is where the show really sets itself apart. In most anime, the main character has some secret power or something that allows them to live up to their challenge. Naruto had a ton of chakra, Luffy had the Gum-Gum fruit and Ichigo had an intense Spiritual Pressure. All these MC's have something exceptional about them that makes anything seem possible.<br/><br/>This is anything but the case for Eren. When we meet Eren, he's a scrawny little punk that can't even take on others his age, much less an adult or Titan. The idea of Eren taking on a few of the lower level Titans is laughable. Even after a 5 year time-skip where Eren and other kids have become young adults trained to kill Titans with the Recon squad (a unit of the Army that goes outside the walls to fight Titans and has little to no success at this point), they look like as big a threat to Titans as a toddler with a wooden gun. And you see it in every episode too; the feeling that no-one is safe and the desperate plight that the characters are in really permeates the entire show. There's no \"Last-Second-Save\" like in most other anime, and the twists come every week. You get to know a whole cast of characters but you never know who's safe or not. This adds a gravity, a realness to the show that brings you in and really allows you to connect with these all too fragile, human characters.<br/><br/>Besides that, the artwork is fantastic, the soundtrack gets better each episode, the character and plot development is top-notch and there's still a ton of room to grow with where the Titans come from, what Eren's dad injected him with (we still don't know), what's in the basement and how the Colossal Titan keeps appearing. If you can deal with a bit of gore and are looking for a great new show, it's a fantastic piece of work well worth the look.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "222 out of 269 found this helpful.", "date": "26 May 2013"}]}, "/title/tt11937816/": {"title": "Who Killed Sara?", "reviews": [{"title": " A fun ride", "content": "I think some other reviewers who were quick to call this series awful are unfamiliar with the undying influence of the telenovela on dramas from Latin America.

With the great success over smash-hits, \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Lost\" they also picked up a few shows over mid-season hoping for more success. They got \"Jake in Progress,\" \"Eyes\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" - but \"Grey's Anatomy\" is definitely considered the best out of those three.<br/><br/>Grey's Anatomy stars Ellen Pompeo (who has starred in a few movies but was never really noticeable) as the narrator - Meredith Grey. Her mother is the famous surgeon and she is trying to follow in her mother's footsteps. The story revolves around her time as an intern and the people she meets and sort of is portrayed as \"survival camp for medical students.\" The minute she arrives at work, she meets Christina Yang (Sandra Oh - flawless in her bitchy supporting role), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight - one word: breakthrough performer), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heighl - very, very believable as a model who is more like the girl-next-door), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers - plays sort of a not-so-likable person). Most of all, there is Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey - very attractive), the man that Meredith had a one-night stand with - he just happens to be her boss.<br/><br/>This is a show that wants to be liked. It just sort of screams in your face \"Love me!\" with all its interesting characters who are very different from each other and a nice plot that you just have to be addicted to. The supporting work is clearly a winner. It has a very lovable supporting cast with T.R. Knight as the sweet and sort of the \"average guy\" as George O'Malley and Katherine Heigl who is very likable in her role - even Sandra Oh is a clear winner on top. And my personal favorite is \"the Nazi\" - Dr. Miranda Bailey who is played by Chandra Wilson. Very, very well done.<br/><br/>This is sort of a soapy spin on \"Scrubs\" and \"ER\" but with light comedy/romance and serious and intense drama where character build up the plot. Some of the characters may get a bit annoying for your taste (ex. Meredith Grey) but the acting is just superb and you can't help liking it. It has a guilty-pleasure feel to it and you just can't help but stay up late for this show. This show is definitely not about \"medicine\" - when it has to deal with medicine, it has a clear soft side to it. The doctors play heroes (pretty clich\u00e9d, but yeah - this IS a hospital show) and save lives or care or has to live up to certain defeat. Just to be aware: This is a show about relationships-within-a-hospital and the life of each person that works there.<br/><br/>The show breaks all the \"bad\" mid-season shows record.

As the follow-up riding on \"Housewives'\" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as \"Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs.\" But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that \"Ally\" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.<br/><br/>And good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like \"Arli$$,\" if not to save it.

We were along for the journey with these young Doctors as they began their professional careers as well as their personal struggles with friendship and love. Fourteen seasons later, Grey's Anatomy has become a completely different show as we the audience has also changed. I am now married with children and at a similar time-line as some of the current cast members. It is for this reason that I am no longer a devoted fan. Having seen every episode since its pilot, I have finally questioned why I am still tuning in every week to watch the continuing adventures of Meredith Grey and her circle of friends and fellow doctors. Simple, it is no longer the same show I began to watch 14 seasons ago. Most of the character of the original show have left if not been killed off. The hospital has been set on fire, blown up, and taken hostage multiple times. We have seen love, lost, passion, promise, joy and sadness from multiple story lines throughout its run. Grey's Anatomy has reinvented itself so many times that we have seen its central figure (Meredith Grey) change for good and bad. <br/><br/>From the single girl, the devoted daughter, the young doctor, the passionate girl friend, the on again off again good / bad friend, the angry daughter living in her Mom' shadow, the newly-wed, young mother, widower, lost adult and now, for lack of anything else, a supporting character to the show that graces her name. <br/><br/>For this reason and the loss of so many of its prior cast members, I have found myself question time and time again when Grey's Anatomy \"jumped the shark.\" <br/><br/>Grey's Anatomy by default has inherited the generational audience of fans from such shows as St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope and ER. The hospital drama has a home with Grey's Anatomy. When the show began, it was a home to a young cast of young professionals that were in multiple \"sexual\" relationships as they juggled their careers and side stories. Also, the show has taken a life of its own by juggling a much more diverse cast then it set out originally. With good and bad results, the solid fact remains that the current show does not reflect anything that the original show set out to be 14 seasons ago. <br/><br/>While the show has created a multitude of amazing stories and moments for its audience to enjoy, I have lost that love and feeling many years ago. Now, I fear that after many years of hoping, wishing and praying, the show will not return to what it once was. It has tried several times to revive its cast to showcase this but has failed. Even during its second and third wind of new medical arrivals, only a handful have made the cut to the current cast while the large majority have disappeared if not written off the show. However, I am not angry at the overall show. Grey' Anatomy has (had) produced many good characters and stories back in the day. Thank you for the good times, which were many many seasons ago. Now, audience members have to make a tough decision. <br/><br/>With that said, the show has struggled for an identity while holding onto several different aspects for a show.

Grey's Anatomy hour meant NO TALKING hour!! I was so in love with the series that to this day I watch older seasons on Netflix once or twice a year! Up to the middle of the 9th season that is....<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>We were all sad when they killed Denny, though he wasn't a main character, he would have made a good one, I think we all loved Izzie and Denny. And we were ABSOLUTELY DEVSTATED when George died! Those were okay though, we could got through those and it was great in between and I didn't care even a little bit when Burke left, I never cared for him.<br/><br/>BUT THEN.... The plane crash!! What an amazing couple of episodes, until you got to the end of them and realized that up to this point they had killed off 40% of the main cast AND your favorites none the less!! Lexi and Mark!! REALLY!! They were just getting ready to get back together! It was simply too much.<br/><br/>Killing off so many main characters didn't do the series any favors, and adding the characters that they did, it RUINED it. Amelia? Ugh she's so annoying, her character has a daddy/big brother complex that she cant seem to get over so she's constantly in a power struggle with men. Its nauseating, I dislike her character very much. Meredith's sister though, I hate her so much I cant even remember her name, she's HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE actress, HORRIBLE, character, HORRIBLE for the show!! Just single handedly dragging the series the bottom. Not to mention killing Jackson &amp; April's baby!! WHAT!!

I'm giving it a generous 6. Now it used to be a strong 10 and the only reason it still gets a 6 is because of how amazing it USED to be. If I was going by the last 2.5 seasons alone.... I regret to say it would have only a 2.<br/><br/>After last nights 4/23/15 episode I am LIVID!! How could Shonda Rhimes make such a big mistake!! I Guarantee this will be the last season because nobody is going to watch it anymore now that she has killed 97% of the original cast/main characters! Not to mention our favorites!! I'm giving up seeing this one through. Last night was the final episode of Grey's Anatomy that I will ever watch, old or new. What an epic failure.

Cable has provided some great options but we were running out of things to watch so we started searching out for TV shows from other countries. What we have found is many of the dramas from places like England, Ireland and even Iceland are very well thought out with intricate stories.\nThis show is one of the best I have ever watched regardless of where it is produced. There is some action but this show really shines in two areas.The first is the stories. They are very well conceived. One thing we noticed when watching the show was the gray areas with all of the characters. I think one of the themes of this show is not to see people in terms of good and bad with no in between. That everything is not black and white and that human beings are more complex than many TV shows portray them to be.\nFor people who enjoy shows like NYPD Blue or Bosch, this is in that same category.\nThe second area that shines with this show is the acting. These actors offer a broad range well beyond what you might normally see in TV shows. Great actors from series like NYPD Blue (Dennis Franz) or The Americans (Matthew Rhys) are part of what made those shows so compelling and here there are so many standout performances I don't know where to begin.

Gripping from the start, it never really let go and even if the conclusion was slightly unsatisfactory in my eyes, in that pretty much all the bad guys got away with it and justice wasn't seen to be done, but in terms of plotting and character development, it was riveting throughout.<br/><br/>The subject of police corruption and the workings of the internal affairs unit has to be handled sensitively but realistically and here I was convinced from the outset. What made it more interesting and watchable was that the central character under investigation, DCI Tony Gates is presented to us as an award-winning cop, a family man who even stops crime on his time-off, foiling a petty robbery at a restaurant where he's eating in the first episode. Unfortunately in so doing, he absent-mindedly allows the restaurant to not take payment for his meal (in this day and age, it's an offence for the police to accept gratuities, even when off-duty) and worse, he's in the company of his lover, rich girl lawyer Jacqui, both of which come back to haunt him as he becomes the subject of an investigation for 'laddering\", the practice of only solving easy crimes and getting multiple offences tagged onto the crime sheet, thus boosting his efficiency figures.<br/><br/>Things get far deeper and murkier from there as Gates finds himself at the mercy and under the control of an underworld kingpin, only heard in the first four episodes by his rasping Glasgow accent, messages passed to him on disposable mobile phones by a tear-away ten year old boy, who later participates in a particularly disturbing torture sequence involving Gates' investigating nemesis D.S. Arnott.<br/><br/>The direction was excellent throughout, involving and exciting, with the ensemble acting likewise of the highest order. I wasn't quite convinced, as I wasn't in the otherwise excellent \"The Forsyte Saga\" remake some years ago by Gina McKee as a femme fatale, but in particular Martin Compston and Vicky McClure as the pursuing investigators, the latter undercover, made for an effective team, with thankfully not a whiff of romance in sight between them. As Gates, Lennie James played a difficult part, engaging the viewer's sympathy and anger by turns, before making the ultimate sacrifice at the end.<br/><br/>I'd like to see Compston and McClure reunite to fight more corruption, along with Adrian Dunbar as their wily boss pulling the strings behind them and hope the series did well enough for more episodes to come.

Perhaps the greatest problem is that Lennie James' protagonist is a hard man to connect with: an almost-clean copper brought down by a bad friend, he remains a hard man to like, and while he appears to be driven by his own private sense of ethics, this moral code seems completely self-centred - he's torn when he fails to live up to his own expectations of himself, but it's hard to see why we should care. And the portrait of feral kids on the local housing estate seems both lazy, and again relatively loosely connected to the more serious crime in the background - if you're looking for the forensic detail of 'The Wire', you won't find it here.

The convincing characterizations and the tension that mounts for the viewer, as the lives of often good people, who makes bad decisions, slowly unravel, is not always easy to watch. <br/><br/>This is an engaging series, that works well.It keeps the viewers attention with storyline(s) that are, for the most part, believable.

A ring from a glass left on a table, for example, taken by a compromised officer is inexplicable. As is, false claims, regarding a relationship, whilst knowing full well, that text records from mobiles, including intimate ones, are readily available. Any experienced detective would realize, in some instances, truth is less damaging than lies and may, in fact, better hide a bigger lie. <br/><br/>The other shortfall, is how cold and often, unlikable, a good portion of the characters are. Injecting a little human warmth, into this series, would actually increase the impact on the viewer, when things turn sour. This, I think, is what stops Line of Duty from being an exceptional series, like the much loved, classic detective series, in the same vein, Cracker.

I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocents. It was actually laughable. Needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over it. Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage. Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. There are some good moments but very few and far between. Have to appreciate effort by cast, directing and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole.

After season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value.\nWhere at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything that is bad in mainstream media.<br/><br/>All of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is). Thanks for your disservice!<br/><br/>It needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines.

I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.<br/><br/>While certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.<br/><br/>Special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.<br/><br/>All and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>After watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.<br/><br/>In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).<br/><br/>Top form, HBO.

I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.<br/><br/>There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.<br/><br/>It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.<br/><br/>Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.<br/><br/>The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.<br/><br/>After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison.

I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. <br/><br/>So when I saw the preview for \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. <br/><br/>I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. <br/><br/>If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. <br/><br/>Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. <br/><br/>A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching!

Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson.

It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \"good cop, bad cop\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \"Rage,\" and \"Rooftop\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \"Law &amp; Order\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \"Coerced.\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter).

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.<br/><br/>The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.<br/><br/>Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).<br/><br/>The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. <br/><br/>9 out of 10", "rating": null, "helpful": "123 out of 166 found this helpful.", "date": "25 January 2005"}, {"title": " Downhill", "content": "Law and Order SVU was a staple show the wife and I looked forward to each week.\nThe key work here is \"was\".

It doesn't have distinctive, stylish features. Into its 3rd season, The Blacklist survives, it thrives despite its being no Breaking Bad, or Mr. Robot, or Fargo, or The Knick. How is this possible? Just what is its appeal?<br/><br/>James Spader as Red Reddington is the answer and the sole reason this show is so watchable. He's not only the captain of the ship, he's the crew and the ship as well. In short, his performance is everything that makes this show great and I suspect he's somehow improved the template like performances of his supporting actors over time. The man is just a joy to watch and makes an improbable character--govt spy turned international criminal mastermind-- delightful and believable. Every actor on that show ought to thank Spader for allowing them the opportunity to make money on a show that would have been cancelled its first year--perhaps mid-season--if he were not on it. It's the darndest thing, the difference one actor can make. <br/><br/>Still, I wish that the creators had chosen a different actress to play the part of Elizabeth Keen, the FBI profiler that Red Reddington is inexplicably fond of. Someone like Zoe Saldana would have been brilliant casting and added dimension to the mystery of the Keen-Reddington relationship. And perhaps better casting for that part would have inspired the writers to shape her role more credibly and sent the show into the stratosphere. While Megyn Kelly may be a solid actress, she does not yet have the chops to make something of the oddly inconsistent writing for her role. Too late to change this up now. <br/><br/>I'm hardly the only fan who tunes in to enjoy Spader's performance, marveling at how the dreamy young actor with long blonde hair evolved into this very charming, balding older man who can act his *beep* off.

But the twist here is, he's an alien from space.<br/><br/>Without humanity ever fully experiencing an other-worldly encounter, it's all speculation on how such a creature would act when attempting to adapt to the human environment, even with camouflage abilities. Many shows and movies have attempted this, few have been truly \"successful\", despite how subjective that term is. \"Resident Alien\" can now be added to that list.<br/><br/>It brings a crisp new humor to television, with witty lines and creative situations. Personally, while I haven't seen a lot from Alan Tudyk (he was amazing in \"Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil\"), I honestly was expecting this to be a bit of a flop, but he delivers in this show, so well in fact that this will most certainly give his career a massive boost. Think if one of the good aliens from \"Galaxy Quest\" tried to pass off as \"human\" on Earth, and had a lot of the personality and intelligence of Sheldon from \"The Big Bang Theory\". That would be Harry.<br/><br/>Some aspects of the show are displaying early signs of cliche and redundancy. The supporting female character is rather two-dimensional, the plot is already a bit predictable, and yes, we're all aware of the thousands of shows portraying aliens attempting to pass off as human, and/or live amongst humans. Where this show shines so far, are in the details, and the main character. The mystery presented to the audience was even creative and engaging.<br/><br/>So far so good! I can't wait to see what goofy thing Harry tries to do next. 9/10<br/><br/>EDIT: Now a few episodes in, and while a few jokes are forced and fall flat, overall it holds its own. There are some good twists, fresh jokes, interesting plot developments, but also some major plot holes. Still, it's quite enjoyable and good for several authentic laughs. And you gotta give some credit to the amazing makeup and prosthetics applied to Alan Tudyk. 8/10\nFURTHER EDIT: After watching episode 8, it's clear the show is already starting to go downhill a bit. Too many coincidental and unbelievable events, annoying \"filler\" scenes with childish characters, and overall, the forced jokes are mounting while the creativity is slowly diminishing. The writers are trying too hard to be funny, and some actors are a bit too exaggerated. I've become quite \"aware\" that I am watching a tv show, as the story is no longer as engaging as it was starting out. Still a funny show, worth watching, but I'm down to 7/10 now.<br/><br/>Further edit: What's up with all these one-line reviews?

Investigators DCI Cassie Stuart and DS Sunil 'Sunny' Khan are initially unsure if the case is worth investigating as they have no idea how old the body is and no obvious way of identifying it. The only clue is a rusting car key\u0085 amazingly this leads to the car which leads to the identity of the victim and a book containing a list of names. The body belonged to a young black man who went missing in the seventies and the names belong to a variety of people; all of whose lives are about to be thrown into turmoil along with the lives of those around them.<br/><br/>These include an Anglican priest who'd had a relationship with a fifteen year old girl, a woman who is now married to a black man but was a member of a racist group in the seventies, a man about to be given a peerage who was an enforcer for a London gang and a disabled man whose wife is suffering from dementia. Over the course of the series the police find possible motives for each of the person on the list and as they investigate dark secrets emerge; even those who are innocent of this crime have other long-held secrets which emerge; some of them will find redemption but some lives will be destroyed forever.<br/><br/>Murder mysteries are one of the staples of television; even ones involving cold cases are hardly new but 'Unforgotten' manages to bring something new to the genre. While there is the question of who killed the body in the basement that isn't the only thing of interest\u0085 in fact the other secrets that emerge are just as interesting. Given that the original crime took place in the seventies it isn't surprising that much of the main cast in is quite a bit older than one finds in most programmes. The cast does a great job; Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar impress as the two leading police officers, it was refreshing to have cops who just get on with the job rather than having their own personal issues. Those playing the suspects and their families were fine too; most notably Trevor Eve, as the ex-gangster and Tom Courtenay and Gemma Jones who played the disabled man and his senile wife although it seems unfair to only pick out a few as the cast was uniformly good.

To begin with, I find this an amazing series, very well played by the actors. The series, in my opinion, lets see how the influence of the past throws the shadow over the present, even for old people... It's a story of a so called cold case team. I wondered how it is in England, I am from Netherlands, at some time, 18 years, the crime is \"verjaard\" here. I think it is called \"limitation\" in UK. So no persecution is possible. So I was surprised to see arrests... But that is not the point, all people somehow involved in the victim's life see their present life disrupted, they have tried to put their involvement to the back of their minds, but that never had success, and now the police come to rattle it up... Its also about change, can you really change from skinhead to tolerant? Are you really different from the person yo were 40 years ago? The main question from the detective is also crucial, \"should I do it or shouldn't I?\" Its 40 years ago, let it go, no!, \"I want to solve the case and punish the perpetrator\". Heartbreaking is the confrontation between detective and mother of the victim.<br/><br/>Now the racists aspects. It is a well known fact that in the 70ties gay bashing was not unknown and hatred against \"coloured\" people also existed. So not a strange move to keep that possibility open in the investigation. In fact there are a lot of references at racism, the boy who gets angry at his protector, who means well, the victim being \"chocolate\", the husband who protects his wife even after he knows the facts of her former life... So, Patherton, why on earth should one go counting who is white and who is black in a series? And who is bad and who is not? That says something about you, doesn't it?<br/><br/>According to Patherton: 1/ Detective is female, what a political correct fact! 2/ Assistant is Indian, another one! So we have now a female detective with an Indian assistant and they go along very well, well, that's enlightening... 3/ All the bad men were white! What a joke, It just happened to be so. If you ever watch American series, all black kids are in gangs and all are involved with weapons and drugs. No, not this series. 4/ A woman who marries a black man and helps a black kid with his chemistry exam, is also political correct? Maybe she really regretted the phase of her former life, being member of National front? And whats wrong with political correct? What is political correct anyway? Had the series been better if there was a black murderer? If so obviously Patherton has no idea about the intentions of the series...<br/><br/>So, go see this, its a very good series that make you think... Very clever and emotional filmmaking.<br/><br/>At the moment I am watching season 2 and that is as good as season one. In the beginning we see stories of people of which we ask ourselves, who are they? and what is this? As the series goes on we see all the stories are entangled with the story of the victim. Fascinating stuff! Again, solving a murder that happened a long time ago, does involve different kind of people. And again some aspects of today's society are mentioned. Like the woman with the headscarf who likes to be the school headmaster, or 2 men who live together and like to be father of an adopted girl...

What I love most about this show is it's raw nature. The camera is kind of shaky yet still brings the best scenes...something that I had never seen before in a TV sitcom. It may seem less professional but adds real life, personal touch with the TV show and the characters in them.<br/><br/>Obviously, Michael Scott is one of my favourite character. Jim, Andy, Dwight, Pam, Erin, Kevin, Oscar, Angela, Creed and even the camera crew include in my favourite list.<br/><br/>What I learned from this show is that it's okay to be weird and different ,that you won't be welcomed as you wanted it to be ( remembering Michael Scott attempts ), that you can't wait and expect things to happen for you, that it's okay to be hated and feel hate to others....it's all dependent on time.

Am absolutely in love with this series, the characters, the writing, its a wholesome pack, especially the character played by Steve Carell - Michael Scott, man he is a pure genius. Steve Carell can take the scene from funny to palm face to pity in matter of seconds, he was like an emotional wheel.<br/><br/>Also the characters PAM, Jim, Dwight and Andy played respectively by Jenna Fischer,John Krasinski, Rainn Wilson and Ed Helms were the life of the show, even after Steve Carell left they managed to keep the show lifted and to its standard.<br/><br/>I am so glad I never saw the original UK series and now probably I would never end up watching it, for the pure reason of not to end judging either of the shows.<br/><br/>I think the two most emotional and heart touching moments were the one where Michael says goodbye and the second being the finale.<br/><br/>If I had to rate the top three episodes they would be:<br/><br/>1) Good bye Michael.

What a well written episode,and a perfect way to say good bye to Steve Carell and his character Michael Scott.<br/><br/>2)Finale: Again wonderfully written, played with our emotions and brought all the memories of the shoe back.<br/><br/>3)Business school: I rate this episode merely for the scene at the art gallery where PAM was about to leave with her paintings and Micheal comes and appreciates her and her paintings for how good they were.

I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. <br/><br/>This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show. <br/><br/>But the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. <br/><br/>I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. <br/><br/>As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. <br/><br/>This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there's so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "1,431 out of 2,158 found this helpful.", "date": "15 January 2007"}, {"title": " A pleasant surprise....six years later.", "content": "I am a huge fan of the British version of the Office.

Besides all that, The Crown , have made me look with another eyes to the royal family, specially Queen Elizabeth, to be honest i did not know much about her personal life . The series shows the struggle of the royal family, and make us realise they are all people in the end, with their problems and feelings. <br/><br/>I truly hope they will make another season, to continue this extraordinary show.

Though there were some moments where it seemed a little bit exaggerated but considering its genre as a TV series, that is reasonable.

It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.<br/><br/>Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.<br/><br/>The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.<br/><br/>The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends.

I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. \"I don't care how good their cooking is.

But I'd like to think that I was objective enough to judge it on its on merits, and not simply that it's different than what I'm used to.<br/><br/>Since, as many have pointed out, the script is nearly word-for-word identical, the difference lies mainly in how the actors portray the characters.<br/><br/>So I'm going to give my character-by-character head-to-head appraisal of UK vs. US. I'm going to use the character names rather than the actors' names for simplicity. Starting from the youngest...<br/><br/>Little Debbie: UK wins this one hands down. No contest. She steals every scene she's in. Who can not fall in love with this girl???<br/><br/>Carl: This one's close, but the UK one is (at least in the first season) a little more deranged and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Ian: Another close one, but this goes to UK, too. US Ian is somber and good looking, but UK Ian always seems a bit panicky, and the wide-angle closeups of his face make him look pretty bizarre. <br/><br/>Lip: This is solidly with the US. I like US Lip's darkness. He seems more responsible and intelligent. UK Lip is just kind of impish and unsure. You can depend on US Lip and he offers some of the only real family support to Fiona.<br/><br/>Kevin: Dead heat.<br/><br/>Veronica: Very different performances by each, but in the end, I like them the same.<br/><br/>Fiona: This was a difficult one to call, but I'm giving it to the US. And this is probably because I saw them first. I just like her better. Hard to put my finger on the reason.<br/><br/>Frank: Sorry, UK, but I just don't like your Frank. I understand the character is usually drunk, but he seems that way even before he starts drinking. He seems clinically stupid. US Frank (Macy) is equally as obnoxious, entitled, selfish and deluded, but he only seems drunk when he's drunk. At other times, his pontificating is fun to listen to. You feel good about hating the guy, because he's like this by choice. With UK Frank, you have to pity him.

I wasn't sold on the characters and the direction seemed directionless. In fact, it wasn't until the third ep that my eyes were opened. It's as if the actors have found their mark and the characters have come to life. <br/><br/>While the ensemble cast is solid, and Macy is at his irascible best, it is the performance of three of the actors which makes Shameless something special. Emmy Rossum, as the 'adult' glue that holds the family together, has rightly received the most press. Her role requires a combination of strength, resolve, humour and vulnerability - qualities that would thwart a lesser actress. Rossum is able to convincingly bring it all together with fire and sexuality in addition to her other qualities. <br/><br/>Equally effective in his role as the younger brother Lip, Jeremy Allen White brings a world-weary innocence to his character. Blessed with a malleable physiognomy, White is at once rascal and protector of the brood. White makes us want to know Lip better. That's rare.<br/><br/>In a smaller role but probably my favourite is Emma Kenney as little sister Debbie. Her deadpan wisecracks supply the laugh-out-loud moments while her heartbreaking scenes of longing for parental love bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened soul. She can act toe-to-toe with Macy and still steal the scene.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is almost as good. Their performances would be wasted, however, without a tight script and fluid - but not frenetic - direction. The third episode brought all these pieces together in a fascinating show.

Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.<br/><br/>This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. <br/><br/>Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. <br/><br/>Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).<br/><br/>You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \"ask nicely.\"<br/><br/>Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)<br/><br/>A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \"edited for time and content\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.<br/><br/>And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys.

What was an epic story morphed into an epic cluster____ of pointless events, battles and internal squabbling to the point where I don't care who wins or loses anymore.

There is Viking tradition, there are interesting social and cultural differences between Northmen and others, there is vibrant Viking society and mainly, there is Ragnar; cunning Ragnar, who would \"give far more than his eye to acquire knowledge\". He is a man of progress, whose logic and wit wins against rigidity and stupidity. He is the man, who comes up with new ideas and surprises everyone who wants to defeat him. Finally, he is the only one capable of carrying this show and pushing it forward. <br/><br/>The third season is also pretty good, although it had slowed down a little bit, dragging the story slowly around, but who cares when Ragnar is going to raid the Paris whatever the cost! <br/><br/>As much I like the first three seasons, there is one thing that kept bothering me throughout second and the third one especially. Every time Ragnar kills some of his enemies (earl Haraldson, king Horik), he creates some kind of vacuum in the society he is not able to fill. Yes, he becomes earl and than king nominally, but he doesn't quite behave like one! I mean as Haraldson had been an earl, he had counselor Svein for the dirty stuff and his guard, he was a judge (in fact), blessed children etc. and all in all there was a lot of things happening around him in Kattegat. Not so with Ragnar; he is just kind of there, not ruling whatsoever, and sometimes it just feels like anarchy there, which I find not entirely plausible. Additionaly, as I have mentioned, there is a feeling of emptiness because of this, emptiness, which I am not quite able to describe. Maybe it is happening, because the second and third series already follows more story lines and can't concentrate on Vikings more, which is in my eyes a threat for this show.<br/><br/>Season 4 takes the good things from its predecessors - throws them away - and builds on flawed stuff of the first three seasons - which is emptiness, story distraction and fade-away from Ragnar. Starting with the most serious issue - Ragnar, it was perhaps the worst decision in the whole show to screw him up. For the entire season 4a, he feels old and tired, doesn't have any desire to explore and raid, doesn't care for his people and children much, and as if it wasn't already too bad, we have to watch him as he becomes a drug addict. This alone is just enough for me. The writers basically take the character majority of viewers cares about most and flush him into toilet. I know he must die eventually, but instead of seeing him suffering for about 9 hours (!!), it would be better to kill him off at his zenith.<br/><br/>Another issue, that hardly appeared in the first three series - there are many meaningless scenes which just kind of fill the time. Consider the whole Wessex feminist thing with Judith - so much time is wasted on her becoming tough and independent, but I don't see a reason why - this is something suitable for 20th century, not 9th. On the other hand there is not much explanation on key events such as why Rollo gave up on his manhood and turned into french nobleman and loving husband so easily.<br/><br/>The emptiness and anarchy I was talking about is really apparent in season 4. It is no more the king Ragnar and his people or the vibrant society from early seasons, it is a mixture of random characters with no depth being around. Typical ruling day of king Ragnar consists of throwing knives, ignoring everyone, doing crazy stuff and taking drugs in the shack, stalking on the rooftop and making a foreplay with that Chinese girl. Bj\u00f6rn tries to look as serious as possible, which makes his character so flat it makes me wonder about Ragnar's successor's ability to lead the show (I doubt any of the sons is capable of that). Than the whole thing with Erlendur's revenge is wasted, as everybody knows from the start Bj\u00f6rn will not die and Erlendur has even got no plan; when Kalf was still alive, there was a chance to take advantage of it, but now he wants to kill Bj\u00f6rn and then will see what's next, probably.<br/><br/>I totally agree with others that it has become a soap opera. Consider king Finehair's arrival. It peaks at the end of an episode, when he basically says in front of everybody he wants to overthrow Ragnar, but that situation is not expanded in the next episode, which is typical for soap operas. Speaking of new characters, they are very uninteresting, and especially Yidu is a complete waste of time, and besides I find presence of a Chinese in the fjord disturbing, she just shouldn't be there; her only purpose is to be a drug dealer anyway. Then there is lot of uninteresting talking about family, children (everybody is with a child now, hearing this gives me an allergic reaction) and how it is being a father, which is just boring. And I can't help myself, but the families look like projections of 21th western family values - different from earlier seasons where we could see more freedom in sexual life and less sensitivity about children and death. Overall the episodes are too talkative and while basically nothing happens in most episodes, everything must have happened in the last one and it created a big mess, but I will not comment on that.<br/><br/>For me, Vikings end with the season 3 and the 4a just does not exist.

Whilst I am not sure I'd consider \"Vikings\" to be amongst the very top tier of shows I've watched in my lifetime; I've certainly enjoyed my time with the Norsemen.<br/><br/>Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is a farmer and raider who becomes a legendary figure amongst the Viking people by establishing consistent navigation techniques and leading successful raids on the various Kingdom's that would become Britain.

There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel's shoulders and he's really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel's wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name. His sons each derive some aspect of him, Ubbe played by Jordan Patrick Smith is the explorer he wanted to be, Bjorn the noble King, Hvitserk, played by Marco Ilso, is the sufferer and addict and Ivar the vicious warlord.

Difficult to praise a US sitcom any higher than saying it's actually funny, when there are so many that fail.<br/><br/>My issue with Superstore, though, is the casting of Dunn as Garrett. He plays his part excellently, that can't be denied, but why cast him as a guy in a wheelchair? Why not get a disabled actor, it's not as if the character ever starts walking at any point. It happens a lot in casting, but I think that's absolutely fine if 1) there is some sort of a scene where the character isn't in a wheelchair, or 2) the actor is a big name and draws an audience. Neither of these are the case, someone else could have been cast easily without any detriment to the audience.

How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do.

I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.<br/><br/>Saying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound clich\u00e9 enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \"funny\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.<br/><br/>As for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.<br/><br/>This is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \"characters\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while.

I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. <br/><br/>The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.<br/><br/>Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.<br/><br/>If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre.

First of all the acting is the best I've seen in any television show and it remains consistent for every season. Being a fellow brit, I thought the accents where quite good, a little hard to understand sometimes which it would have been at the time period. The only persons accent i have a problem with is the leader of the billy boys, I can't remember his name, his accent was dreadful. Now, season one and two where my personal favourites, the pacing was excellent and knew when it had to speed up and take a break from the action which was so brutal and compliments the show so very well. The characters are were the show shines, the interactions they have between each other are son interesting and entertaining. The dialogue for every season, besides season three which I will get to, is extremely satisfying. The camera work is nothing too exciting but is grounded and works well for the nineteen hundreds were the show takes place. Also, my oh my was the villain great. Every single action he did was so horrid and made me hate the character with all my heart, which is what you want for a show like this. It's all due to the incredible performance by Sam Neill. Somehow the show makes you root for the alcoholic gangster murderers instead of an Irish police officer, it really takes a different perspective from any other television creation. Season three on the other hand was a bit lacklustre. The show tried to grow too fast, the peaky blinders all of a sudden had ten enemies and a hundred different problems to face and it all became a huge mess, sometimes becoming difficult to follow. The show also took a turn towards more buisnessy affairs which I didn't enjoy as much. Besides all this it was still great. Oh yeah, Tom Hardy randomly showing up for a small part was amazing, he's amazing in this show I just wish there was more of him. Season four picks it back up with a simple revenge story, and it works excellently. The villain is pretty simple, nothing too special with an overall bland and clich\u00e9 performance from a-list actor Adrien Brody. Season five is pretty good as well, the start of the season is really strong and has the Shelby family in a feud but the show very quickly forgets about this and moves on to other, more boring things. The very ending is alright, it still makes me want to watch the next season or film whenever it comes out. I realise that I have been quite harsh in this review but the show is really good and has and will inspire plenty of other shows in the future.

But this is perhaps due to a good character, played by a good actor, that is irritating. Above all though, the vast majority of the music irritates me; could they not blend music of the time while retaining Nick Cave's intro and randomly chosen outros?

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). <br/><br/>I loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. <br/><br/>From the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.<br/><br/>I know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels.

There is some criticism about the pace of EP1, I agree that it felt a bit slow. Viewers who feel it's too slow, please note that the book is about 800 pages long! Additionally, Starz bought 16 EPs rather than the usual 10, so that RDM has time to develop the story line and the many characters that appear in the book. The voice over takes some getting used to, since it's not a common practice today. So I refer back to the book again, because the reader is let into the lead character's thoughts most of the time - it's not all dialogue. You don't have to read the book to enjoy the show and I believe new viewers who give it a chance over the next several EPs as the action in the story picks up won't be disappointed and will appreciate what all the fan fuss is about.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "151 out of 224 found this helpful.", "date": "10 August 2014"}, {"title": " Deserves 20 stars", "content": "Claire and Jamie share the most compelling chemistry of any two actors that I've ever seen on screen.

On top of that she is so extremely selfish, especially in season 2. After her husbands (Jamies) brutal rape by the main bad guy Jack Randall, there is a point in the second season where she is furious with Jamie because he couldn't have sex with her (as he hadn't gotten over the trama). Then when Jamie decides he's going to dual and kill Randall for what he did, she is once again furious because Randall is her first husband (Frank's) ancestor, and guilts Jamie into letting him live by saying he owes her... Seriously.... After he has saved her time after time and taken harsh beatings and several brutal rapes to save her from it all. And he owes her... For some dumb reason he agrees, until walking in on Randall raping a child. And still she insists that Randall must live... Just so Frank can be born...

That's why writers turn it up to 11 in medical dramas: to make medical careers seem like an endless stream of intense situations, with life-changing moments with patients occurring every single day. I know that you can't be 100% true-to-life realistic in a show, that fiction is always present.<br/><br/>But I think they overdid it with New Amsterdam. First I'll focus on what the show does right:\n* New hospital director is very dynamic, innovative and not afraid to get his hands dirty, he is persuasive and has a solid presence, and he speaks Spanish!\n* Plot twist: he's got cancer! It's not your average medical drama huh?\n* Characters are interesting and well-written, the pacing is great and it keeps you watching - the whole thing is entertaining, which should be the main goal of ANY show<br/><br/>However, there is an unfortunate number of things that stand out - and at first you try to turn a blind eye, not pay attention... but they start piling up, and for me, the stack collapses when you hear the psychiatrist say in a completely serious tone: \"you're extremely gifted at Twitter\", to a 16yo trans kid that tantrum-cancelled him on twitter for not green-lighting a sex change surgery. The kid literally slandered a doctor, potentially ruined his reputation online and there were zero consequences. None. Nada. And of course, the surgery was green-lighted (a year after the episode).<br/><br/>The show tries way too hard to portray this idealistic, ridiculous idea that there is always a happy ending. The \"moral of the story\" messages I've got from this show are as follows: If you're the boss, you can do whatever you want and change whatever you please with no consequences. If you're persistent enough and believe it hard enough, everything will be just fine. There are no sad moments, and if one slips in, it doesn't last too long - good vibes only! Everything always has a closure. Flings aside, every workplace is super healthy and there is no envy or jealousy. Everybody plays along well with each other and nobody tries to sabotage you, make you fail or seek an opportunity to replace you and your well-paid position. And most importantly: everybody loves the boss as long as he smiles and plays it cool. They will be super worried about you if you collapse due to having cancer, despite only knowing you for what, a month?<br/><br/>Like I said, the show has plenty of good moments and is entertaining enough, but boy is it corny.

Without giving too much away, she's been victimized by her own poor choices as much by her husband. Moreover, the manner in which she treats other people makes her neither likable, nor sympathetic. She doesn't come across as brave, strong, or noble, but instead, selfish, stupid, and hypocritical. To be fair, none of the other characters are much better; with a cast comprised mostly of other equally unlikable weirdos, with a few caricatures of popular stereotypes filling in the gaps like so much background noise.<br/><br/>In the end, whatever this show could have been gets lost amid a storm of poor plot construction and inept character development. You can't identify with any of the characters, so you don't really care what becomes of them.

Each character has been thoughtfully written out and played to perfection by a slew of actors who take your breath away. A family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family - present or future - from their actions, morals, decisions and values.<br/><br/>It's a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour; where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner; where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an Asian girl; where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family; where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life; where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support him/her to become their own person.<br/><br/>What the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing - who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. The only this that does is the purity of our hearts. That is it. One episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence.<br/><br/>Despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. It is witty - much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. The writing is spot on. It makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them - one episode at a time. It's made me pause the show because I had to laugh so bad. It has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. The families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. The only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices - that's what I learn from this show - every day.<br/><br/>It's unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did.

Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh  and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This  show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the  listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly,  clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.

The show was five episodes in, so I caught up on the action online. And I must say that the acclaim is well-deserved. The show is nothing like what I'd imagined when I read about it. It is not a typical three-camera sitcom and it actually IS as gut-wrenchingly funny as people say.<br/><br/>With any modern TV comedy, people are going to compare it with \"Arrested Development\", which is highly regarded as one of the greatest shows ever by many. \"Modern Family\" is not quite \"A.D.\", but I can see why some people may compare the two.<br/><br/>\"Modern Family\", like \"Arrested Development\", is a comedy about a wacky extended family that is filmed in a quasi-documentary style, similar to \"The Office\". The characters don't acknowledge the camera, but they do contribute \"talking head\" segments to supplement the action. The show is less cartoony and surreal than \"Arrested Development\" or \"30 Rock\", but the comedy can still get pretty off-the-wall.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is great. There are three branches of a single family. The patriarch (Ed O'Neill) has re-married, bringing a Colombian-born wife and her son into the fold. The daughter (Julie Bowen) and her husband (Ty Burrell) have three kids. The son (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner (Eric Stonestreet) have just adopted a Vietnamese baby. The show focuses mainly on the parents and how they raise their families and interact with each other in today's society.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Phil (Burrell), who plays the dad who tries to be \"hip\". He means well, but he's really kind of a wimpy husband. Phil's always putting himself in awkward situations (without always realizing it) and some of his lines are hilarious. He tries so hard to be the \"cool dad\". Next I like Cameron (Stonestreet), who's gay and proud of it. He's sensible and sensitive and he has some great lines, too.<br/><br/>Although I haven't really connected with the show like I have with some others (just a matter of personal style), there's no denying that \"Modern Family\" is an above-average comedy. It's written well, with humor sewn throughout the fabric of each episode, and each episode packs some laugh-out-loud moments. And I say this as someone who rarely actually bursts into audible laughter. (Occasionally, with shows like \"A.D.\" or \"30 Rock\".) This show does it, though. Phil, in particular, has me in stitches.<br/><br/>To give you a comparison, I'd say \"Modern Family\" is like a cross between \"The Office\" and \"Arrested Development\". Presented more like the former, with humor and content drifting more toward the latter. More grounded in reality than \"A.D.\", though, and without some of the triple-entendres and zingers.<br/><br/>The show finds windows to sneak in some wholesome family morals like togetherness and acceptance, but the episodes always end with a laugh.<br/><br/>But the rumors are true. \"Modern Family\" IS a very funny new comedy. Check it out on ABC or ABC.com if you don't believe me. (Or wherever else it's available.)

There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns. Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold.

Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities. He embarrasses himself on more than one occasion but this causes people to underestimate him and his wit which he uses to actually solve crimes. This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. <br/><br/>Overall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa...

While successful police dramas have ruled the airwaves for decades, the same cannot be said for cop shows that aim for laughs. There are some noticeable exceptions such as \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and the very short-lived \"Police Squad\", but for the most part, it has been hard for show-runners to make crime a funny topic on TV. \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" could have ended up being super broad like \"Police Academy: The Series\" or \"Reno 911\", but luckily creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur have made the decision to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality, allowing for viewers to relate to the characters without them becoming complete cartoons. In casting Andy Samberg as the lead, there was the risk of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" coming across too goofy. However, Samberg is at his career best here as Jake Peralta, a childish and immature detective who just happens to be very good at his profession. Samberg is great at delivering the most ridiculous and silly lines of dialogue without mugging for the camera in the way that some might expect a former \"Saturday Night Live\" performer to do. Half of what Peralta says is either completely juvenile or inappropriate, but because it never reaches cartoonish or mean-spirited heights, he remains likable and easy-to-root-for. The show may eventually reach a point where it may seem absurd that the character is able to keep his job, though that hasn't occurred yet.<br/><br/>If \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" had just been a vehicle for Samberg, the show might have become stale after a few episodes. Wisely, the decision was made to make an ensemble series. It's typical for an ensemble to have one or two characters that aren't quite as funny or interesting as the others, but amazingly, every single character on \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" is excellently performed. Andre Braugher, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, and Terry Crews are all perfectly cast in their respective roles and each have moments where they shine in every single episode. Crews is absolutely hilarious as squad leader Terry Jeffords, especially when the writers are able to make great use out of both his physical strength and priceless facial reactions. In addition to the main ensemble cast, the reoccurring duo of Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller as Detectives Hitchcock and Scully, the two worst detectives in the department, are responsible for some of the best jokes of the series thus far. It's also worth noting the writers have made nice use of its guest stars including Craig Robinson, Andy Richter, Stacy Keach, and Dean Winters. Guest stars on sitcoms can be tricky and can often overshadow the episodes as a whole, but \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" almost always makes its guest stars fit organically into the plot in ways that never feel gimmicky or forced.<br/><br/>Although there have only been a dozen episodes so far and there is always the chance that the broadness the show-runners have been so good at keeping down may eventually kick in, the series now remains as strong and frequently hilarious as any comedy on television at the moment. There isn't a particular formula that the show gets hung up on every week and more often than not, there seems to be an effort to get in a decent amount of character development by sitcom standards. If Fox is smart enough to keep \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" on for a while, it will almost certainly develop a cult following. If the ratings don't improve and only one season gets produced, at least the series will probably hold the distinction of not having a bad episode in the bunch. 9/10", "rating": null, "helpful": "102 out of 146 found this helpful.", "date": "9 January 2014"}, {"title": " Noice!", "content": "My all-time favorite TV series!

The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! <br/><br/>The producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed! There's a bit of a Naked Gun feel to it as well, what with the vaguely idiotic running gags and horseplay, but Jake Peralta is sharper (and more competitive) than Frank Drebin - leaving Charles to play the fool for him. When Peralta solves crime, it's not accidental - but neither can you take it very seriously, as even the arrest is more of an SNL skit than a semblance of a cop show arrest.

They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, \"I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out.\" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.<br/><br/>There certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.<br/><br/>I don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.<br/><br/>People who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.<br/><br/>Obviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.<br/><br/>In the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clich\u00e9s of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "111 out of 168 found this helpful.", "date": "19 September 2013"}, {"title": " Shows a lot of promise - a very likable new sitcom.", "content": "I'm confused by the reviewer (whose comment was featured on the IMDb page just now) who seemingly despised this program and wrote it off, apparently, because he or she felt Andre Braugher deserved better.<br/><br/>I find this review odd, because \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" - if nothing else - comes across as a very likable show. <br/><br/>Thankfully spared of talking-head interview segments that have dominated the American comedy scene since The Office, this show also thankfully features no laugh track. Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a \"cop show\" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.<br/><br/>The cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the \"star\" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in \"Parks and Recreation,\" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws. Very few comedy shows are at their best in their first seasons.<br/><br/>I'm enjoying this quite a lot so far - it's not must-see-TV or anything of the sort, but it's likable, entertaining and shows a lot of promise.

After seeing this and then looking for more information about it, I came across IMDb and instead of finding intelligent reviews from intelligent people, I find a few that scream of ignorance. <br/><br/>It is pretty easy to understand why.<br/><br/>As the 20th century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more enlightened, civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down of society began to occur. How did this happen? Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest and in which the weakest or not-so-intelligent were culled, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Evolution began not to reward intelligence, but to coddle and save the weakest. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left \"Intelligent Man and Woman\" to become an endangered species. One need not look far within these comments to see that in effect. It's not that hate which is shown in some of these reviews that is killing the world. I think that up to a certain point all of us possess some level of hate. It is not having the mental acuity or aptitude to recognize it within ourselves, and to not let ourselves be led by it. Some of these so-called reviews are downright scary when you stop to think that is the actual mentality of the person who wrote them. One guy decrying interracial couples and gays to the point of not watching a television program that has them. A woman who says this could not happen and in the next paragraph goes on to detail how it could happen, only not as Christianity.

There is nothing in my previous sentence that is not true. Let me type it again. The Handmaid's Tale is a series that presents what could happen were women's rights reverted or taken away. Is it an extreme depiction? Let's study that for a moment. In a Puritanical society, the Bible was the sole authority. Puritans believed it applied to every area and level of life. The Salem Witch Trials are one such example of Puritanical beliefs in action. Were it not for historical documentation, you would have people negating those as well. So, as to the question of whether it could or couldn't happen, the people most decrying it and stating that it could not happen, are the ones that most believe it can.

The other major problem is that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was a masterpiece of understatement and brevity.

Birth rates are plummeting. An ultra religious cult see it as their God given mission to 'save mankind'. They seize power by staging a fake terrorist attack against the US government, impose marshal law and set about rebuilding American society.('War On Terror' anyone?) They use The Old Testament as their blue print, but with some totally wack interpretations and distortions. Fertile women become the property of the state. Brain washed and farmed out to the new ruling elite as baby makers, slavery and subjugation is all they can hope for. <br/><br/>Margaret Atwood, Canadian hero, social commentator, environmentalist, activist, feminist, tech inventor, business woman and visionary always maintained that this isn't sci-fi, but 'speculative fiction', things that have a chance of happening in the near future. Written in the '80's it's probably more profound now; the Neo Con Christian's have become a powerful force in US politics. Could there be a Tea Party without the ultra religious Republicans? Probably not. Maybe it takes a next door neighbour from Canada to really see what's happening with the totally dysfunctional family next door? It has always been a source of debate about how a country so entrenched in the ideas of freedom and liberal philosophy can also be the home of such obvious bigotry and divide? Surely teaching Creationism instead of proved science in some State's schools is a warning sign? Maggie may well ridicule this dogmatic un-thinking, however it's far from funny when she points out the possible end game and consequences for society and women in particular.<br/><br/>The book, although heavy going at first, is one of those you can pick up every few years and just dive right in (thanks to Una for making me read it back in '87). I was worried that this TV adaption wouldn't do it justice. How wrong I was. It's slightly different, and relies on a lot of flashbacks like the original narration; however this narration helps to smooth over the cracks nicely. So it still sticks faithfully to the principles and main events of the story, albeit in a roundabout 'more up to date' way. The subtle creep up and takeover of government and power has been well handled so far. I am enthralled, totally impressed and on tenterhooks with Bruce Miller's adaption. The direction is also smart, (the hanging scene seen from the back of a van was powerful stuff). Every image is a perfect composition, nothing is wasted, it's real art in the hands of skilled camera operators. <br/><br/>The feminism is subtle, not the clumsy and overt 'all men are bad, all women are good little victims' like of some of the more hardcore feminist literature. Maggie recognises that some women can be bad too, and some men will die to do the right thing, as you will see. Her book made a point that this could only happen if most women were willing parties too, and that a 2,000 year old book of moral tales can hold a massive amount of power when deliberately abused in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>It's also highly commendable that the cast are just 'normal folk', no super skinnies, models, hunks or pretty boys are in sight. This makes it all the more believable, it could happen to you and me. The lead, 'Offred' (Elizabeth Moss) absolutely nails it. No spoilers, but she will impress you with her canny nouse and determination to survive despite many obstacles and traps. I haven't seen one bad actor in here so far, they've obviously got bags of talent and emotional range. The design and resurrection of 'The Shaker Movement', as in the book, harks back to an American and European age of persecution and religious fervor. <br/><br/>Adhering to Maggie's descriptions of the colour coded dress, the production designer's subtle placement of now highly valuable Shaker furniture here and there helps; the muted drab colours, even in the opulent wealthy homes, take us sub consciously back to the times of Salem, witch trials, mass hysteria and life devoid of 'modern vices' like free speech, self determination, free love and modern relationships.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see how this progress', although I know how it ends (can't tell you, but get ready for some shocks!).

No one could ever blame Kaley Cuoco for wanting to shed her BBT image, but this limited series was, well, limited.<br/><br/>To be fair, there were a couple of good things. If you wanted to hear Cuoco drop the F-bomb, this was your show! And you got to see some of her tattoos hidden on BBT. But TFA was also filled with cliches and annoying features.<br/><br/>First, does every villain have to have a British accent (and one with sort of a Scottish accent)? Victor, Miranda, and Felix were all \"serious villains\" because of their accent? Of course, TFA is not the only show/movie to fall back on this tired trope, but it seems cliche and lazy in 2020.<br/><br/>So if you have British-type villains, you must have incompetent US law enforcement, especially police and FBI (at least the white males). TFA delivers here too. Only the \"grizzled\" female FBI agent and the unknown gay black CIA agent seemed to be on the ball. These unnecessary stereotypes detracted from the plot.<br/><br/>Third - I'm sorry, but I just didn't buy Cuoco as a \"functioning alcoholic\". And how could anyone still earn a living being that drunk on a daily basis? Yes, there is always a certain amount of \"suspension of disbelief\", but TFA pushes the envelope beyond reason. What airline would employ such an irresponsible person?<br/><br/>Fourth, the pacing of the entire run seemed padded - like they had 4 OK episodes but had to fill 8 shows. So there were a LOT of mental flashbacks, many of which seemed meaningless. Also - at least from my perspective - TFA contained a couple of production choices that were particularly annoying. This includes the overuse of split screens a la 1960s (as annoying as JJ Abrams' penchant for lens flares). And the unison soundtrack by producer Greg Berlanti's favorite composer (Blake Neely). Neely's work on TFA sounded more like John William's soundtrack for \"Catch Me If You Can\". Neely has done better work before, but it wasn't on display here.<br/><br/>Fifth, the \"deus ex machina\" in episode #8 introduced the unknown character (CIA), which was presented almost amateurishly. Yes, he had been a peripheral character and went with Cassie to Alex's funeral (and hooked up with a male catering staffer). And he conveniently shows up at the end to battle the villain and save the girl? This was lazy story-telling.<br/><br/>There were some lost opportunities too. Was TFA really filmed in Rome, Bangkok, and other exotic locales? Maybe not, since we mostly only saw airport and hotel interiors. There were some street scenes, which could have been shot in some areas in North America, along with some stock footage. Now, if TFA was really shot in those far-off locales, what a missed opportunity for some interesting scenes. Another lost opportunity was the failure to involve more of the male lead's family. The confrontation scenes at the funeral were good and TFA needed more of that tension.<br/><br/>Except for the sort-of \"cliffhanger\" ending with the Megan character, there really is no reason for a Season 2 of TFA, unless it is treated more like \"True Detective\", where subsequent seasons introduce new lead characters and story lines. Star and producer Cuoco successfully shed her Penny character (which will live for decades in syndication), but she needs to make better choices for subsequent material.", "rating": 5, "helpful": "64 out of 99 found this helpful.", "date": "18 December 2020"}, {"title": " Wow...", "content": "How are we supposed to take a character seriously when she has the emotional depth of a drunk toddler.\nCass acts so unbelievably stupid in the days after the murder.

You can be forgiven for that.\nIf you want to argue that what you're writing is 'fiction' so you're entitled to write whatever you want - fine. It's true. You can.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>If you do, if you proceed to go where angels fear to tread, then you had better make damn sure the 'fiction' you're writing is amazing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this Bridgerton adaptation by Shondaland is anything but. It has all the 'amazing' of beige wall paper in a beige room with beige furniture. You just get slapped in the face with all the disappointing beige.<br/><br/>Shondaland has completely rewritten the best parts of \"The Duke and I\" and turned it into a generic shadow of its former glory. All that remains of the original story are bare bones.<br/><br/>Just focusing purely on the story - the shows writing is uninspiringly generic, with tired old storylines introduced.<br/><br/>Why???\nIf it ain't broken, why fix it?\nThe original story is amazing. It needed nothing. No fixing. And instead, Shondaland broke it.<br/><br/>Pretty is all well and good on camera, but it's not enough to make a great show. A great show needs more. Where is the humour? Where the sparkling dialogue? Where the personality?\nMuscles, beauty and gratuitous sex do not chemistry create. Personality is sexy. Originality is sexy. Humour is sexy. Sexy things the book has in spades. Things this show has not been able to reproduce.<br/><br/>But the worst atrocity Shondaland has committed?\nThe characters. They lack character.\nThey have been recreated as barely there shadows of what they are in the books. Almost all of them.<br/><br/>Anthony: Unrecognisable. His treatment of Daphne, his surly immature moodiness, and his wanting to run off with an opera singer. Not Anthony. Anthony always put his family first in the books because he thinks he's going to die young like his father did. He would never have forced his sister to marry anyone. Anthony was charming, confident and kind.<br/><br/>Daphne: In the books she was never \"a diamond of the first water\". Daphne had been out three seasons already. She was a very likeable, down to earth, easy to get along with, dark haired girl - not a clueless insipid vain blonde. Her friends were the wallflowers. All the gentlemen felt comfortable with her.<br/><br/>Simon: In the show Simon is a bland generic hero. All muscles no brain. No real conversation. No humour. Simons famous lisp makes no appearance whatsoever, except as a child. Simon in the books is reserved but passionate, super smart, longing for family. He is thoughtful. In my opinion this actor had no emotional range. He was wooden. He actually made me yawn.\nSimon and Daphne together in the show are also uninspired, lacking real chemistry. In the books they sparked. They were funny. They made you love them as a couple.<br/><br/>Colin: In the books Colin has a way of seeing into people. He is probably the sharpest and most insightful of all the Bridgertons. Colin in the show is a clueless puppy. And his hair is terrible.<br/><br/>Violet: Where was Violets sparkle? Her moxie? In the books she is admired and adored by all her children. Violet has a sly sense of humour, especially when it comes to match making. She outwitted her children. She knew what she was about. She is a respected leader in society. She made things happen. Violet is not the worried lip-biting unsure mother the show has given us.<br/><br/>Lady Danbury: In the books Lady D is sassy, opinionated, and scathing. She says things to throw people off balance. She's feared in general. She's a menace with her cane. The shows Lady D is too refined, too tactful, too nice. Lady D did not openly play match maker with Violet.<br/><br/>Lady Whistledown: She is witty - never truly mean or cruel, which turns out to be Penelopes saving grace in the end. We loved reading Lady Whistledowns humorous observations in the book. The ton eventually see it as a right of passage in society to be mentioned by her. But in the show, they paint her petty, cruel and hated.<br/><br/>Bridgerton Family: The family in the books is loud, boisterous, irreverent, loving and fun. They joke, tease, talk, play and are fiercely loyal to each other. They are all friends, which makes them differ from the usual ton families. In the show, that family makes very little appearance. The family of the show is (for at least 6 out of the 8 episodes), shallow, vain, fraught, disjointed, uncommunicative, distant and, to be honest, a bit annoying. This is not the Bridgerton family of the books.<br/><br/>In short, many of the 'read the books once a year for years' fans, will, like me, be very disappointed with this series. Some adaptation is always expected - but an almost complete rewrite?\nMake no mistake about it, Shondaland has rewritten, dismantled or removed the majority of the best parts of 'The Duke and I' for this show.\nLet's hope they do better with season two.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "733 out of 1,094 found this helpful.", "date": "3 January 2021"}, {"title": " Netflix Torture Of English Regency Genre", "content": "This is white trash meets Jane Austen.

From the outset I was irritated by the almost farcical nature of the setting, the choice of actors for the various roles and their somewhat limited acting skills. I was prepared to overlook the innacuracy and the clich\u00e9d PC approach to the portrayal of the Regency period, as I knew that it was intended to be purely fictional entertainment. However, what really spoilt it for me was, after reading the glowing compliments on the standard of the costumes, noticing the spike heels of the queen's dancer 18:10 minutes into episode 2. Seriously? Yes, period romances are known for the sumptious and often extravagant costumes, and in most cases, every effort is made by producers to get these as accurate as possible and in keeping with the time period, as this is what sets it apart and creates the \"period piece\" identity for this genre. Using spike heels, which were only invented in the 1950's, in a period piece set in the very early1800's, would in my mind be a faux pas on the same level as using a cell phone or other modern accoutrement. To top it all, my irratation turned into disgust upon hearing \"classical\" renderings of music by modern artists like Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Celeste etc. in the background. I mean really? The producers couldn't even give the series a semblance of period accuracy by using music by great Regency era composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Rossini, Schubert, Liszt or Mendelssohn, to name but a few. I was so put off, irritated and critical after the abovementioned, that I barely made it through to the end of episode 5, before deciding that it is an utter waste of my time.

The plot goes nowhere, and it becomes cartoonish and silly. Eventually, they end up inside of a bunker that looks like a mixture of Cheesecake Factory and the Enterprise from Star Trek TOS. The world building is sloppy, and honestly, flimsy. There's a point, where the monsters start look like stuff from a Nickelodeon cartoon. There is no consistency. The later seasons look like a completely different TV series.<br/><br/>The X Files had some genuinely well written episodes and memorable side characters and monsters. I can't say that about Supernatural. There are no memorable monsters or side characters. It all blurrs together and is easily forgotten. During the early seasons, Sam's psychic powers go absolutely nowhere, and go away quickly, and the reasoning for it, never makes any sense. I enjoy psychic characters, so that was rather disappointing, but not unexpected.<br/><br/>Death has no meaning in this show, and there is no character development. Death is a thing that happens, and they just walk away from it, over and over. Every single season is about stopping an apocolypse, and the rest of the world is weirdly daft as to what's going on. (The Scooby Doo episode was entertaining and amusing, at least.)<br/><br/>Also, the characters become unlikable and annoying. At one point, Sam is mad that he was brought back to life again. This grudge went on for that entire season, while Dean sat around brooding. Each season has Sam or Dean, keep a secret from each other, a secret that would resolve tension if the two characters weren't so stagnant. This show kept going, in my opinion, because of money, fandom, and the eye candy leads.<br/><br/>I enjoy paranormal stuff. Really. It's fun stuff! However, paranormal shows suffer, when they drag on for too long. The X Files also went off the rails and became an unwatchable convoluted mess towards the end, and Supernatural isn't any different. Watch the first five seasons, for some brainless fun, don't expect anything other than b movie cheese, and pretend the rest doesn't exist.<br/><br/>PS Knocked off another star. Those last two episodes are so bad, I barely got through them, and I watch b movies. Like The X Files, this show fizzled out. I'm giving it 2 stars for the first five seasons. In those last episodes, they even pandered to shippers, which was annoying and out of place. The writing and acting went so far down hill, it was on par with a Party City ad and the Live Action Sailor Moon TV show. Only the Live Action Sailor Moon Show was actually amusing and self aware of its cheesy qualities. To be honest, the last few scenes looked like something from a corny Lifetime movie. Dean dies after falling on a rusty nail, because Sam doesn't bother to call an ambulance. Also, Sam dies of old age, and looks like he's wearing Spirit Halloween make up to look elderly. Then, they're reunited in heaven at the end. Also, Castiel died randomly too, which angered a bunch of people in fandom. Castiel, in my opinion, was a one note character, who after awhile, acted like Patrick Starfish from SpongeBob.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this show.

They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.<br/><br/>Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.<br/><br/>In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.<br/><br/>The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.<br/><br/>So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.<br/><br/>By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.<br/><br/>And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works.

The subtle difference between \"reproducing\" Star Wars and \"recapturing\" Star Wars. Why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right", "content": "It's one thing to bring back elements, characters, settings and stories, and to flash them in front of the audience to cash in on the nostalgia and/or recognisable memorabilia but without using it to further the plot and other to do exactly the opposite. It was about time that Star Wars directives understood that it is too unique a product to be lend to corporate filmmakers. Star Wars needs to be understood and its uniqueness has to be acknowledged in order to make the new stories feel like they belong. This may sound too obvious but if you ever wondered why the new SW movies are so controversial this may be the reason.<br/><br/>Like with \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse (2018)\" and their comicbook-industry experts participation, the creators behind The Mandalorian were experts of the industry, connoisseurs of the Star Wars Universe and even long time fans. So they were able to not only recapture the aesthetic of the grimy, battered Star Wars but also build upon it taking the most \"subtle\" things into account. Things like the predominancy of puppets and practical effects over CGI, settings you can feel and touch over green screens and the abundancy of not only known elements previously seen in Star Wars, but a whole batch of new creatures, designs and overall plot elements that felt like they belong to this universe and had always been there.<br/><br/>Exceeding expectations are not only the visual aspects but the narrative too. It might be too late for some story elements now, but it is of great importance that from now on you try to watch the unraveling of the story unspoiled. I was lucky to have seen the premiere of the show before the \"memefication\" of a certain \"element\" that went viral and became one of the biggest highlights of the show. But for me I saw the reveal of this element unspoiled and I was pleasantly shocked, a memory I'll always carry with me. The ability of these creators to generate such shock value and deep moments it's often baffling to me. This is proof that the creators behind the narrative are fully aware of the complexities of the universe they are tampering with and like an experienced surgeon, they are able to tweak, traverse and call back any Star Wars element as they please and with astonishing results.<br/><br/>It seems to be obvious that series creator Jon Favreau turns to gold everything he touches, from his influence in the MCU with the first Iron Man (2008) movie (still regarded today as a favorite among the infinite Marvel movies) to the remarkable and commercially successful live-action Jungle Book and Lion King Disney movies. He seems to understand how to treat a franchise not by exploiting the nostalgia aspects but rather use them to fuel new stories and \"revive\" the experience. Not to mention the contributors to this amazing show hype up the expectations and the quality of the show, from beloved names like Taika Watiti to legendary Star Wars showrunner Dave Filoni. The show today is in the most capable hands possible and away from the corporate meddling of Kathleen Kennedy.<br/><br/>Despite everything it does right, I have found some things that distanced me from it. It is merely one small and almost inevitable aspect I don't think a huge lore such as Star Wars can escape from. Something that makes the world-building so real: the subtle callbacks and references found on names and other elements. This is an aspect that non-Star Wars Lore fans (in which I have to identify myself as even though I have read and know some of the deeper lore) will not like or get as they are cast aside for not picking up or straight up know these references. If people don't know what a Gungan is they won't get the \"you are as ugly as a Gungan\" joke, for instance. But as for the rest, the story can be followed and understood because it feels self-contained and you don't need to know much about the SW status quo at the time other than (in simplified terms) an Empire ruled over the galaxy and now it's over, in this world there are mercenaries that adhere to a code among themselves, there's a magical energy flowing through all of us called The Force, there's a group of Force-wielding knights that fight with light swords, and that's about it. Anything else you need to know it is presented in the story or explained through exposition, which in a huge universe that is Star Wars it is a must in order to be able to tell a story worthy of SW.<br/><br/>\nAs for the show itself, these are some of the most predominant reasons why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right (reasons I believe stand out among many others the show has) -- WARNING: MILD MILD SPOILERS AHEAD OF SEASON 1:<br/><br/><ul><li>The treatment of the Force -- long gone were the days when the Force had nothing new to teach us. It seemed we have seen it all and had witness it being reduced to a \"superpower\" the Jedis use to move objects. But perhaps the biggest aspect that seemed to bring controversy is the treatment of the force as this quantifiable and immutable force presented in the Prequels. However, the most successful Star Wars stories have not treated it as such, despite the fact that this new addition was provided by its own creator, George Lucas; in fact, the most successful Star Wars stories have expanded on the capabilities of the force still considering it a mystifying and intangible energy that lives in all of us and the binds the universe together. The Mandalorian takes place post Empire, which means the force has started to be known across the galaxy thanks to the Legend of Luke Skywalker, auguring the return of the Jedi Knights. Therefore, treating the force used by the so-called \"baby yoda\" as a powerful and non-understanding power but in fact recognised by some who have heard of it is a genius move as it makes it magical and uncharted still, a long lost ethereal power that exists beyond our comprehension. The force should be something we don't fully understand yet nor people in universe will fully understand either. By allowing the force to be pure and uncharted, there's room for more creative uses of it that when done right can provide of elevated moments. This are shown especially on episodes 7 and 8 of season 1 where by using terms like \"a group of sorcerers called Jedi\", \"I have heard of this power\" and \"i have seen him move things with its mind\" makes the force more mystified and bewildering.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The puppets -- say whatever you want about the incredible alien, prop and set designs of other Star Wars main stream media (TV shows, video games, movies with some really good exceptions of course) but I am one to believe that generally the main reason why none of the later Star Wars media released after the OT were really embraced by everyone as part of the universe is because the \"feel\" of the world we were seeing was not the same. Star Wars stood out from sci-fi like Star Trek and other more \"clean and smooth\" worlds by building a grimy, run-down and almost post-apocalyptic set and prop design with a huge contrast of advanced technology. So when The Mandalorian brought it back, not only by imitating the set and character designs and such but by expanding upon those by using new imagery and creating new alien species that fit with that new world, it was a display of world-understanding beyond any new incorporations Abrams, Johnson and even good ol' George Lucas had ever brought post-OT. By bringing back puppets and practical effects and make up it shows and it gives you the satisfaction of knowing in 30 years it will still hold up because they are physical things, tangible by the actors and even though \"baby yoda\" moves and when grabbed looks like a sack of potatoes, you don't mind because you know it exists, it is there, you can hold it. I'll take your fully-functioning puppet over the best CGI because truth is, in some years, the CGI will have improved so much you'll start to see the cracks when looking back.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cinematic Special Effects for a TV show -- this may be known for those who keep up with Star Wars news or watch the Mandalorian documentaries in Disney+, but the innovative tech used for the background and other special effects is almost revolutionary and provides a high quality that resembles that of a cinematic film. Needless to say, the special effects, real-model sets design and other props allows the universe to exist and be tangible instead of rendering a scene that with tim we'll notice it doesn't really exist</li></ul><br/><br/>END OF SPOILERY STUFF --<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, The Mandalorian is a worthy sequel to the OT, maintaining the same aesthetic, themes and recognisable elements but providing new and incredible ideas that amount to the incredible universe that is Star Wars. If they are able to keep it up it'll become one of the best SW media to come in its history. Disney Star Wars seems to know what it's doing now after stumbling a couple of time and I commend them for it. SW isn't an easy franchise to expand and continue despite the amount of stories that are left to be told. You know the saying \"Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans\".

It returns to the origin of the medium of moving pictures, storytelling. Beautiful, delicate, morally challenging and consistently human stories. <br/><br/>Technically the show is artful and precise, with a seemingly authentic, almost anthropological portrayal of a society that is generally inaccessible. Drama seems to arise slowly, patiently, through competent composition of scenes, performances that posses each character flawlessly, and again, stories that speak to the heart of who we are and how we relate to each other. Perhaps it takes a society that has not been swept by time as much as most, to demonstrate a few timeless truths that we can all relate to. <br/><br/>We live in the golden age of quality television, no doubt.

How intelligent people can do stupid things, etc. I just finished the episode in Season 2 in which - for a truly magical -and sad - few seconds - Kive, on a bus in Jerusalem, looks out the window and sees the snow falling in Antwerp.

Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. <br/><br/>Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.<br/><br/>The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. <br/><br/>And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. <br/><br/>To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.<br/><br/>I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?<br/><br/>Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.<br/><br/>I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later.

Sure, in it's nature, that's what the show is. But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.<br/><br/>The acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world. <br/><br/>The humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through. <br/><br/>The music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).<br/><br/>Gilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show. This widens the whole show's time-frame, instead of just being self-contained. The brief flash forward to the fragmented Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad was amazing. I really hope that the writers continue to play around with time, shifting between past and future guises of Saul Goodman.<br/><br/>Better Call Saul has a lot of promise to extend itself beyond its Breaking Bad spin-off status.

Kevin Bacon and Aldis Hodge are both in amazing form and the pair could not make a better combo of two people who hate each other, but have no choice other than to work together.<br/><br/>The chemistry between these two leads is very believable and nothing is more satisfying than watching Kevin Bacon's Jackie Rohr using his dirty cop tactics to chase fame for a good cop bust, whereas Aldis Hodge's Decourcy Ward believes in fairness and justice, and he particularly is opposed to Rohr's reckless methodology. However, equally satisfying is the fact that Rohr's dirty tactics do work effectively in practice, and it is just so refreshing to watch the criminal justice system fall apart so naturally. At first, Ward sees how unethical Rohr's actions are, but later Ward realises how resorting to dirty tactics against a dirty enemy may be necessary, but still despises Rohr due to personal conflict.<br/><br/>The character development progresses each episode as does the plot, albeit more slowly. In fact, City on a Hill is much more of a slow burner, focussing instead on the interactions of and between Rohr and Ward, rather than the plot. The plot is always there in the background, and it does take a few episodes to start developing, but it appears much more realistic as it feels that not a moment in these characters lives are missed. Ultimately, the result is the perception of a criminal justice system that has failed its people, one in which cops are just as unethical if not worse than criminals, a war in which Decourcy believes he can instill peace and justice in, and a war in which Rohr believes is necessary to keep waging in order for basic human survival. And yet, the two have no option but to work together due to their respective professions. Talk about some great tension, along with an armored car heist plot that keeps you guessing what's gonna happen right till the very end!!<br/><br/>City on a Hill was a real treat for me.

Tried being the key word, because having the lead voiced by Justin Roiland, doing a slightly more curmudgeon take on Rick, I think was a major misstep for the series. I just can't get \"Rick\" out of my head every time the character speaks, it hurts my ability to differentiate the show from its sibling, and not in a good way, because far more jokes in this series seem to fall flat, by comparison.\nAnother major gripe I have is the voice acting of the children characters, the girl's voice is basically impossible for me to listen to.\nThe grub / dog or whatever goes on some little \"cute\" adventures that don't add much (baby Yoda he is not) to the story, it's yet another throwaway character in this show.\nThe bright spot that I've seen others speak of, is the mini human subplot that takes shape 1/2 thru the season. It's \"good\" enough, but isn't it telling when the best part of a series has nothing to do with the main characters??\nSpeaking of them again, the main alien characters seemed interesting enough at the start, but again, their adventures (even maintaining the same exact Rick and Morty dynamic of one \"smart\" alien and one \"dumb\" alien) tend to just feel like watered down Rick and Morty B plot lines.\nAnother small point, I'm not a prude by any means at all, I don't mind \"sex\" in cartoons, or any genre, but Justin Roiland just can't write sex funny. Even his sex jokes in R+M are the weakest part of those episodes, and that trend continues here. The sex in this series just feels so forced, and unnecessary, and dumb. Having people say shocking stuff just for shock value adds nothing.\nI love Rick and Morty, the writing is smart and routinely \"surprises\" me. I wanted to love Solar Opposites too.

Generally speaking and after observing it for two days, it managed to do it and even a little more...So much that it could be considered as an enjoyable \"Interdimensional Cable\" version of Rick and Morty.<br/><br/>Although Season 1 had a somewhat bumpy start in terms of plot development and execution, given the fact that the story gets separated into two arcs from the second episode onwards (The Aliens arc and \"The Wall\" arc), they manage to stand in solid ground at the mid-season.

You're going to give a show that you supposedly loved 1 star just because you didn't like the last 4 minutes? God forbid a show actually make you use your brain to get answer instead of spoon-feeding it to everyone. Please do yourself a favor and google \"sopranos ending explained\" and read the first article, it's long but you'll appreciate the show much more. Showing Tony actually getting whacked would have been tasteless, boring, and wouldn't have left us with anything to talk about. If you really pay attention and look at the fine details everything is there. Plus we had already seen Tony get shot on several occasions, and the fact that people spent 6 seasons cheering the guy on and then want to see the series end with him bleeding out on the table in front of his whole family. Some things are better left to the imagination, and when you put all the pieces together it's really pretty amazing what David Chase pulled off.<br/><br/>For anyone that thinks Tony's fate is up for debate, it's not. Some people say that it just meant that he was going to be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life (wrong). For starters, the finale opens with a shot of Tony asleep in bed and is supposed to resemble him dead in a coffin (and there is churchy sounding organ music playing). Then one of the few flashbacks in the episode is Bobby telling Tony \"you probably don't even hear it when it happens.\" Those are just a few hints out of many.<br/><br/>More importantly, the entire final scene was set up from Tony's point of view. It opens with him walking into the diner, they show him, they show the table where he will be sitting, then they cut back to Tony, and then there is a jump cut back to him sitting at the table. It's a strange looking cut, but it makes it appear that Tony is looking at himself (like an out of body experience).<br/><br/>During the final scene, you hear the bell ring 4 or 5 times, each time it cuts to Tony's face, then shows the doorway to the restaurant, and then cuts back for Tony's reaction. They use the bell to create a Pavlov's dog type effect, it makes you expect to see certain things each time the bell rings (shot of tony looking up, followed by a shot of what he sees from his POV). So the last time you hear the bell ring, you see Tony's face, and based on the established pattern the next thing should be what Tony is seeing (Meadow walking into the restaurant). But instead there is a smash cut to black, why? Because Tony is dead and you are seeing his point of view, he is no longer seeing or hearing anything. Chase wanted to do 30 seconds of black originally, and if it had just been the end they would have faded out the music instead of stopping it immediately. So You know that he got shot in front of his entire family, Meadow walked in at the last minute and witnessed it too. Carmella and AJ were looking at their menus and wouldn't have had a chance to warn Tony. And if Meadow hadn't been late then the shooter wouldn't have had a clean shot. To me that has much more of an impact than seeing him bleeding all over the table. The guy in the Members Only jacket going to the bathroom to get the gun was a throwback to the Godfather when Michael Corleone went to get the gun from the restaurant bathroom. They show each of them eating one of the onion rings that Tony ordered, which is supposed to symbolize taking communion. Tony had done too much messed up stuff to get off scott-free, and everyone knows that in the mob you either die or go to jail. <br/><br/>Whether you understood the ending or not, The Sopranos is one of the best TV series of all-time. It's a show with so much depth and complexity that you can watch it over and over and still find new stuff every time.

It's one third of what I like to call the \"holy trinity\" of TV dramas, the other two being the much loved Breaking Bad and the critically acclaimed The Wire. It's such a great TV series that even a 20,000 word review would struggle to explain every single thing about the show that works, and I know you're about as willing to read a post that long as I am willing to write one, so I'll try not to draw this one out too much. That being said, there's a lot about this show that I want to say, and a lot of praise I'd love to throw its way, so here goes.<br/><br/>The Sopranos works on so many different levels it's staggering. It's a complex character study, a tense crime drama, a relatable family drama, and sometimes it even feels like a weird, twisted sitcom. There's moments of brutal and shocking realism right alongside surreal dream sequences and scenes ambiguous in nature. There's suspense, black comedy, surprising deaths, and even the odd tear-jerking moment.<br/><br/>Every character is fascinating, as barely anyone is purely good or purely evil- almost every character is a different shade of morally ambiguous grey, and this is what makes almost every character, major or minor, so interesting. The stand-out character of course is Tony Soprano; the show is about him after all. He is absolutely flawlessly played by James Gandolfini, who has done other stuff in his career, but never anything as memorable as his role as the lead in The Sopranos. Here is a character who feels like such a real person it's damn near scary- I feel like I know Tony better than some people I see in real life on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. This is perhaps one of the most fleshed-out and well-developed characters in the history of entertainment. Throughout the 6 seasons we see dozens of Tony's therapy sessions, with each one adding something to the character. We see many of his dreams too, with these sequences putting the viewer directly into his head and allowing us to see his most personal thoughts and feelings. He interacts with countless other characters too; in fact, almost every character in the show interacts with Tony on at least one occasion. It's a credit to both Gandolfini and the writers that the character of Tony Soprano felt so real throughout the show's run.<br/><br/>That's not to say Tony's the only well-developed character on the show, because that's not true at all. Almost every character has depth and is interesting in their own way- personal favourite characters of mine include Livia Soprano, Tony's delightfully crabby mother who's obsessed with control, Ralph Cifaretto, an absolutely horrible colleague of Tony's who is so much fun to despise, and Adrianna, a character who starts out as being there mainly for fan service, but becomes one of the show's most sympathetic and interesting characters further down the line. I would like to talk more about the characters, but honestly, to do so may cause this review to move into spoiler territory, because like I said before, nobody on this show is ever really safe from death. One character may appear to be the kind of person who'd last all six seasons, but may well be \"whacked\" after just a few episodes. On the other hand, there's characters who could only be seen in the background occasionally throughout the first season who become significant characters in later seasons. What I'm trying to get at is that the show's unpredictable and I don't want to go into discussing specific plot-lines or characters too much because you're really better off going into this series knowing as little as possible in order to get the most enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>And by the way, try not to read too much about the show on the internet either before or while you're watching it, as it's an old-ish show, and that means people are generally less cautious about displaying spoiler warnings prior to discussing potentially \"sensitive\" material. The internet is a dangerous place to be while you're watching a show that's already aired, so just remember to be cautious.<br/><br/>The use of music in this show is also something that really needs mentioning. The show uses music frequently, and also uses a great range of music throughout its run. David Chase and the others who worked on the show clearly have a talent for selecting music that just works so well for particular moments. Special mention has to go to a few songs/scenes in particular:\n<ul><li>Alabama 3's \"Woke up This Morning,\" which is used so perfectly in the show's unforgettable opening sequence, which never fails to get me psyched for the episode to follow.</li><li>A lesser-known Rolling Stones song called \"Thru and Thru\" is used unbelievably well in the final montage of seasons 2's finale, \"Fun-house.\" (\"Fun\" fact: Funhouse is not only my favourite episode of The Sopranos but probably my favourite TV episode of all time. I think it's so good I might even write a blog post specifically for the episode, as I can't really go into why it's so good in this review without outlining the general plot-line).</li><li>Then there's the song \"Wrapped in my Memory\" by Shawn Smith used at the end of the classic episode \"Long-term Parking,\" which is season 5's penultimate episode. The way this bittersweet sounding song is used is phenomenal- a perfect way to end one of the most well-known episodes of the show</li><li>And I don't want to forget the use of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" in the show's notorious final scene. Most people seem to associate the song with Glee, but The Sopranos used it first, and so much better too. Like the episode Funhouse, the final scene of The Sopranos could use its own blog post also, but I probably won't ever talk about it because it's already been discussed to death all over the internet. Generally every episode of The Sopranos ends with a piece of music that plays over the final scene, and continues to play over the credits, and it's staggering how often this piece of music reflects either the style, tone, themes, or even the general plot of the episode it closes. I'm an absolute sucker for a good soundtrack, and The Sopranos, I'm pleased to say, completely nails it in the music department.</li></ul><br/><br/>The writing and the directing in The Sopranos is sharp as hell too. The writer's inject so much wit, tension, and pathos into this show (sometimes all at once) it's mind-blowing. The show has so many different moods and feelings, but somehow the writers manage to tie it altogether into something that feels very cohesive. Many, many quotable lines and catchphrases too. This show has some serious style too, and the look and feel of the show honestly looks almost movie-quality at times. This can be credited to the show's directors and cinematographers, who give the show such a unique and memorable style that really progresses and becomes more pronounced as the show goes on. There's a reason this show was so revolutionary and acclaimed when it first came out- no other show before it had ever looked quite so cinematic. I personally found myself forgetting at times that I was watching a TV show (worth mentioning is that the acting from some cast members is movie-quality too).<br/><br/>Mind you, The Sopranos is not a show for everyone. It's got some very adult content, and there's the fact that it's quite a strange show too- there's literally at least three episodes that are almost 45 minute long dream sequences inside Tony's head, and a sense of ambiguity is often present thanks to the characters' general sense of moral murkiness, as well as their often strange and ambiguous motivations that aren't always spelled out. Almost no character is ever easy to decipher and understand- there's few stereotypes on this show- and while this could frustrate some people, I personally like this aspect of the show, as it makes everyone feel a bit more \"real\" and compelling. And then there's that ending, which isn't going to be for everyone (I loved it though).<br/><br/>I also want to say that this show requires some patience to really get into. I don't think the first season was phenomenal, as the writers and cast members were still trying to work out the best way to portray and develop these characters, so it gets off to a slightly shaky and uncertain start. Mind you, I still thought the first season was very good, but it took me to the end of the second season before I started loving the show, and it was about a month after I finished the final season before I realised that The Sopranos was probably my all-time favourite show. The show will grow on you, but it'll probably take some time, so be patient. Pretty much every HBO show is like this (see Game of Thrones and The Wire in particular). Also, there are a huge number of characters, and it will take by my approximation at least 10 episodes before you'll remember most of their names (unless you've got a great memory or something). This can make early episodes a little difficult to get through, but if you stick with it it'll become something you get used to.<br/><br/>So if you're an avid TV watcher, I highly recommend giving The Sopranos a watch. It helped popularise the sense of grey VS grey morality that is so prevalent many recent shows, and also pushed many boundaries in regards to what kind of adult content a TV show could depict, as well as how cinematic TV could look. It's amazingly well acted, written, and directed, has an astoundingly diverse soundtrack, and features in my personal opinion one of the most deep and interesting characters off all-time- Tony Soprano. I see it as required viewing, and even though you personally may not love every aspect of it, I'm sure most of you will be at least able to develop a great sense of respect for the show. Don't be put off by its age, or the fact it ended 13 years ago- this is still must-watch television that has aged and will continue to age gracefully.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "31 out of 34 found this helpful.", "date": "23 April 2020"}, {"title": " The greatest of all time.", "content": "This is the greatest show of all time.

The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br/><br/>James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying, loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious, greying consiglieri who is often very funny. <br/><br/>While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi, and to an extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore, other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. This is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. <br/><br/>The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives, which makes the whole thing more interesting.<br/><br/>Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini, for envisioning, television's most complex and enigmatic character. <br/><br/>Simply exceptional.<br/><br/>10/10", "rating": 10, "helpful": "114 out of 143 found this helpful.", "date": "18 March 2008"}, {"title": " The Classic TV Drama", "content": "First time watching the Sopranos all the way through and all I can say is grab some gabagool, start up the GrillMaster 9000, and call your Goomah cause this is thick, authentic Italian art; and I'm not talking about Tony.

I never underestimated this show, because I heard great stuff about it, but also bad stuff. And that's okay, because it is not a show for everyone. If you enjoy mafia movies, even on a small level, you are definitely going to enjoy this. If you don't enjoy mafia movies, then you're probably going to enjoy it anyway. The reason why I am comparing this to movies, is because it is a movie on some level. It is a cinematic show. Before The Sopranos, shows such as Friends, Seinfeld, etc, all shared the same thing. A 20 minute episode, they weren't necessarily connected to each other, but people still enjoyed them. Now The Sopranos, it has been said by many that it is basically a 13 hour movie. That is because each season has 13 episodes (except for the last one). I imagine what a challenge it must have been for David Chase (the creator) to get a television to pick the show up. Naturally, he got turned down. It would have been impossible for The Sopranos to be part of a network television. I believe that the limit in network tv, is about 42 minutes per episode (then you have the commercial breaks and other things). Luckily, HBO decided to put the show on the air. An episode is around 52-60 minutes, and it was this show, that put HBO on the map (later producing shows like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Westworld etc). When the first episode aired in 1999, it started a new age of television. The viewers were introduced with the concept of an anti-hero, being the protagonist of the show. This shocked a lot of people, because they were used to seeing bad guys in movies, then getting killed at the end. Having said this, The Sopranos was immediately revolutionary. I imagine how people felt when watching it, thinking \"a show about a bad guy\"? It was never done before... But after the first season, people realized that it was special, and the reason for that is because it was different, unique. The greatest thing about this show, except the story line and structure, I have to say that it is the casting. It is not one of those shows where the lead actors are good, and then the extras are there to just do the part. Every single person withing the shot, is so spot on. I have to give credit to David Chase, who I know pays a lot of attention to detail. It is crazy how you can't imagine other people playing those characters, and that is because no one could play them like the cast did. James Gandolfini's performance is probably the most powerful performance on TV. I have watched a lot of shows, and I have never seen such brilliant acting. I hate it when people compare his performance to Bryan Cranston's on Breaking Bad. Don't get me wrong, it is also one of the best performances, but you have to know that if it wasn't for The Sopranos, there wouldn't be Breaking Bad, or Walter White for that matter. The Sopranos opened the doors for many shows, such as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, etc. The other great thing about the show is the writing. Every character has its own arc. You can see how they develop during the show. Except for the anti-hero concept, I think that it was also the first show to introduce character development. There's something about how the characters are written. Just the main idea of the show, the professional and personal life of a mobster, struggling with his work and family, is brilliant. It treats subjects like illness, the importance of it, loyalty, love, trust, hatred, death, and many others. You see characters change, evolve, you start to like them, you start to dislike them. It is the best written show to this day. It is dark, witty, cynical, and most importantly, addictive. David Chase decided to do what no other director did before. He showed violence, drugs, sex, and other elements that no one thought of putting in television. It pioneered cinematic television, it took mental illness seriously, it changed how we watch TV. I am not reviewing the episodes and story line, because I don't want to spoil this masterpiece, but I have to say one more thing... Whatever you're doing, stop!

Based on a typical mob story the Sopranos goes one step further (many steps infact) and not only provides probably the clearer social commentary on modern America but also delivers the most well written show in the history of Television. It serves as the profile of a man who-in his existential crisis- tries to understand humanity, violence and the meaning of true love. Tony Soprano is a ruthless mob boss but also an extremely loving husband. The whole show builds it's flawlessness and genius around that line: the violent monster and a wonderful human being. The Sopranos mastered the term of an anti-hero to a degree that cannot be surpassed. Obviously James Gandolfini's monumental perfomance is the strongest point of this show but everything work together so well that you can't just lay your eyes away.<br/><br/>The raw strengh of all this deeply affects the viewer, personally it changed the way I see things in a lot of ways. All the violence at times is extremely disturbing, the amoralism of the crime world has never been more believable and depraved. As I said, David Chase has mastered the term of the anti-hero. All these main characters are basically monsters, unethical violent killers but still so likeable, so believable and so trustable. Chase is trying to understand what a sociopath really is, involving psychology, and after one point the viewer starts to really understand the weight of these gangsters actions. Weird thing is the most you are shocked by those the more you want to see this show, the more you want to explore the darkest aspects of human life. I've been so moved by another show, it is really groundbreaking.<br/><br/>And then there is James Gandolfini who gives probably on the most momumental perfomances on camera. He has such a unique, charismatic aura in every frame he is in he simply is masterful. He can amazingly infuse anger, confusion, depression, love all on that same frame without making it less believable or overacting. He bases his perfomance with his eyes, heis simply jaw dropping in every minute of this show.<br/><br/>Then you got all the luben side characters, who all are so unforgettable, you think you really know them from one point forward. Paulie, Silvio, Furio all are classic to the mob universe, true gems.<br/><br/>This deep bond with all the characters make every dark decision they take so much more painful, you really start to feel the rage, the guilt, the grief and the existential crisis the characters are going through.<br/><br/>But besides all the nihilism there is love. Family, friendship, forgiveness. All these values have never been stronger in Television. It truly is Family Redifined. The nuclear American family is under attack here, constant analyzing with supreme social commentary on post 9/11 crisis and much more. Under all the hate this family keeps going through, never stops to fight for something better and as we can see in the final shot of the show it was really about family. Love, forgiveness, trying to understand each other, the basic values of every family are being presented with uch realism and fairness.<br/><br/>Hope is what holds Tony Soprano together, what keeps every human going. It's not about mob and gangsters. It's real life on camera.<br/><br/>Finally, under all it's gruesomeness hides the most beatifully realistic portrait of America and a wonderful teacher. Because David Chase makes it clear he doesn't have any answers. But though all the issues he addresses he pushes the viewer to find his own meaning whatever that may be and if there is one.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "15 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "26 March 2020"}, {"title": " The best mob show ever made and played by one of the best", "content": "Everything about this show is amazing.

I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: <br/><br/>Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:<br/><br/>It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: <br/><br/>Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:<br/><br/>It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:<br/><br/>They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.

When you watch friends, you just don't watch it, you live it.<br/><br/>It is not about how perfect you have to make your life.. it is about how every moment , good or bad , together makes life perfect. <br/><br/>No matter what kind of person you are, you can always relate to its story line. Unlike most of the contemporary serials, this one does not have a narrow perspective. There are no fart jokes, no clich\u00e9s, no stereotypical bullshit - just original day-to-day incidents and the fun and laughter and quarrels associated with it. There are no jokes for joking sake. And it would blow your mind to think how anyone can create six characters like Chandler Bing, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Phoebe Buffay, Rachel Green and Ross Geller.<br/><br/>Hands down - \"best thing ever and not just on TV\"", "rating": 10, "helpful": "32 out of 40 found this helpful.", "date": "23 September 2015"}, {"title": " the most lovable show ever..", "content": "FRIENDS is the best sitcom ever made. It is one of the things which made my growing up years special. This is the first TV show I watched and absolutely loved. It taught us friendship, love and loyalty. It has the most adorable characters and one can never get tired of watching reruns. FRIENDS is just pure joy which leaves inside you a warm fuzzy feeling, lifting your spirits and instantly brightening your mood. It is the only show which can make you laugh, cry, fall in love even after all these years. It inspires. The dialogues make me laugh and cry even though I have already watched and heard them countless times. It is timeless. It still feels so difficult to watch the last episode because you do not want it to end. I love this show and I am so sure I will love it even 30years from now. The most beautiful, funny and inspiring show ever. I just wish there were more seasons, though they ended the show as beautifully as possible, I loved the show too much to see it ending.
