0,The Venture Bros., My Favorite Adult Swim Original,"This action-comedy spoof of sixties Johnny Quest-style super-science, evil nemeses, and supernatural happenings is by far, the best original Adult Swim program to date. The story follows The Venture family, Dr. Venture, a forty-something pill-popping scientist who never managed to step out from his father's shadow, his two sons, Hank and Dean (both rather Leave it to Beaver-like in their refusal to swear and constant wearing of sweaters and pants), Brock Samson, their James-Bond-on-steroids bodyguard who apparently works part-time for the office of secret intelligence and refuses to carry a gun, favoring of his serrated bowie knife. Most of the hilarity stems from The Monarch, the self-declared arch-nemesis of the Venture family, a weaver of ridiculously circuitous plans against them, an employer of hilariously incompetent henchmen, and a man who harbors an unhealthy obsession with monarch butterflies and an over-wrought sense of self-importance. His melodrama usually falls on the deaf ears of his girlfriend, Dr. Girlfriend, who, in complete contrast to the Monarch, is professional, take-charge, and inexplicably husky-voiced. The cast of supporting characters is of equal quality, including a well-meaning but dim-witted robot named Helper, a necromancer renting out the Venture family's garage apartment named Dr. Byron Orpheus (doctorate in communications, minor in women's studies), whose propensity towards unnecessarily dramatic changes in pitch and dire warnings of disruptions in the spirit world offer the Monarch's only competition in the melodrama department. Baron Underbheit, the tyrannical and oppressive ruler of Underland, who sports an Arnold-like accent, enormous (and anatomically complimentary) armor, and a metal lower jaw, is another arch-nemesis of the Venture family, blaming Dr. Venture's inattentiveness when they were college lab partners for the loss of his jaw. There's a myriad of others, ranging from fake ghost pirates to the forbidden love of a fugitive and a sasquatch. Check it out; you won't be disappointed.",81 out of 83 found this helpful.,,6 June 2005
1,The Venture Bros., Best cartoon I've seen in years.,"This cartoon blasts every other modern cartoon right out of the water. It's even better than Family Guy (another great show, but which tends to get too sporadic, and even just plain dumb at times). It has hilarious characters and plot lines, and a razor wit. I love how the characters get put into all these horrible situations, and they each react in their own unrealistic but hilarious way.<br/><br/>The jazzy music and voices are also top-notch. Unlike many other cartoons, the voices are funny without getting unbearably grating. Speaking of which, when I first saw this, Brock Samson sounded really familiar... turns out he's none other than Patrick Wharburton (aka David Puddy). They could not have picked a better actor for the part.<br/><br/>If you like dark humor, satire, and overall zaniness, it doesn't get better than this.<br/><br/>9/10 stars.",92 out of 99 found this helpful.,10.0,8 December 2004
2,The Venture Bros., Adult Swim Redeemed,"Adult swim's shows have gone off the deep end of fairly entertaining nonsense to just pure absurdity. I do not see the appeal to any of them anymore and I do not often watch the programming block anymore. <br/><br/>Venture Bros. However stands apart from the rest and provides truly intelligent, well thought out, over-the-top and hilarious entertainment. The show is a perfect balance between tasteless humor and really clever subtleties. The homage/lambasting of early adventure animation/comics is spot on. The characters are full of depth and they're engaging. Brock Samson could pwn Chuck Norris any day of the week. What more could one want?<br/><br/>When I first saw this show I thought it was one of the more ******* up shows I'd ever seen. I was surprised just how graphic it was with particularly disturbing images(guy getting his eyes gouged out, watching a henchman struggle with his last breaths as he's strangled to death by Brock, poll vaulting off henchman's jugular...etc.) <br/><br/>I was not turned off though because aside from the surprising imagery, the jokes and references were all spot-on. I was laughing the whole way through and intrigued around every corner. <br/><br/>Truly, my only real gripe with the show is that it has a hard time taking itself seriously and often resorts to fairly flippant endings and/or resolutions that sometimes I feel aren't necessary. I think the show could support itself just fine with a persistent story arc, which I think we are starting to see more of in the new season anyway, so that's good.<br/><br/>And again, Brock Samson, there could hardly be a better cartoon character.<br/><br/>Check out this show, it's well worth it. I hope that it continues for a long time.",105 out of 119 found this helpful.,10.0,5 July 2006
3,The Venture Bros., Go Team Venture!,"This show is hilarious! The Venture Brothers, Hank and Dean, think, act, talk and live like they're in the 60's (though the show takes place in modern day.) They're the sons of Dr. Venture, a world renowned scientist who can't stand them. Dr. Venture pops pills like candy and reeks of failure and unrealized potential. Their family bodyguard, Brock Samson, is a former secret agent who responds to all possible crises with relentless brutality. Always The Monarch is always having evil plans on Dr. Venture instead of doing bigger plans like take over the world or something like that. I laugh at every single funny part in this show! The one thing I wonder about this show is why does Dr. Girlfriend have a man voice? Who knows? This show premiered in August 2004 on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim line-up, but the pilot episode premiered in February 2003.<br/><br/>User Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: GO TEAM VENTURE!",44 out of 50 found this helpful.,,8 November 2004
4,The Venture Bros., Pseudo-Retro High Adventure Parody,"In the 1950s and '60s, the heady space age was fully upon us. Sweeping, magnificent Art Deco buildings and designs were all the rage. New manufacturing techniques meant that the rectangle was out; circles and curves were in. We looked forward to flying cars, commercial passenger flights to the moon, moving sidewalks, and push-button automation everywhere. The future never looked brighter (not to mention cleaner) and much of the media of the time wasted no opportunity to remind us of this. Common examples of the period include just about any James Bond film, the Flint movies, and animated series such as The Jetsons and Jonny Quest.<br/><br/>Forty years and two very cynical, jaundiced eyes later, we now have The Venture Bros., which liberally and hilariously skewers the, shall we say, irrational exuberance of the times. The most obvious target is Jonny Quest, but little from the period escapes the series writers' acerbic wit.<br/><br/>Son of Jonas Venture, Dr. Venture is sort of how you might expect Jonny Quest to have grown up -- forever living in the shadow of his father's greatness, leaving him insecure, sarcastic, and in a semi-permanent state of midlife crisis. Alas, Dr. Venture's own brilliance was not passed on to his boys, Hank and Dean Venture, who are in all major respects self-absorbed, easily distracted, and not too swift. In other words, normal adolescent boys. They are watched over by their hired bodyguard, Brock Samson, a chain-smoking seen-it-all paramilitary type from the Office of Secret Intelligence, whose extraordinary competence and calm under pressure is exceeded only by his -- as another poster put it -- relentless brutality.<br/><br/>The Venture Bros. is full of the obvious jokes (dim-witted villains surrounded by even dimmer-witted henchmen), but it also makes funny observations about the incongruity of its inspirational sources.<br/><br/>Example: Like Dr. Benton Quest, Dr. Venture is a super-scientist, making advanced gadgetry as easily as we might make a TV dinner. But what do you do when your lab becomes crammed with unwanted or no-longer-interesting inventions? Yup. Hold a yard sale. Try not to be surprised when all your arch-nemeses show up.<br/><br/>Another example: In episode three, we are asked to cast our minds back to the 1970's series The Six Million Dollar Man and wonder: What were Steve Austin and Sasquatch *really* doing chasing each other through the woods?<br/><br/>The music in Venture Bros. is also magnificent -- not just the signature tune, which takes its roots from the brassy modern jazz of the period, but also the background music throughout the episode. The music's sheer bombast is a perfect complement for the overblown, exaggerated characters, especially the villains.<br/><br/>Though a bit uneven in its execution -- it might actually benefit from being shorter -- there's plenty of funny stuff here to keep modern cynics laughing out loud.",54 out of 63 found this helpful.,,12 October 2004
5,The Venture Bros., A must watch!,"The Venture Bros. is the funniest animated show to debut since South Park in my opinion. If you've ever watched Johnny Quest or read any Marvel Comics(the writers seem to be fans) you will get all the jokes. I have yet to find a character in the entire show who is uninteresting or unfunny. Brock Sampson is just a badass, and the Venture Bros. themselves are hilarious. Throw in some very funny villains and great references and you just can't go wrong with this show. Much better than any other of the Adult Swim offerings(although Sealab 2021 is pretty damn funny sometimes).<br/><br/>User Rating 10/10",41 out of 47 found this helpful.,,16 December 2004
6,The Venture Bros., One of the funniest shows around...,"Without a doubt, this is probably one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. The characters themselves are unforgettably hilarious. First up, we have Dr. Venture, a selfish and fame seeking ""scientist"" who lives in his famous father's shadow. Next, we have the Venture brothers themselves, Hank and Dean. Both are naive and sometimes downright stupid, yet have the best intentions at heart...usually leading them straight into danger with hilarious results. Which brings us to the next character, Brock Samson. He is the powerhouse and enforcer of the group, and is probably the highlight of the show. Never one to hesitate running headfirst (with trusty bowie knife in hand) into danger, he is the protector of the family. Imagine Race Bannon from Jonny Quest, but add Arnold Schwarzenegger's muscles, a libido the size of Texas, and a mullet, then you've got Brock Samson. Definitely my favorite character.<br/><br/>The show has all the elements of a Jonny Quest episode, but with a humorous (and sometimes raunchy) twist. I sure hope this series makes it out on DVD sometime soon.",36 out of 41 found this helpful.,,19 February 2005
7,The Venture Bros., A Brilliant Blast From The Past!,"If you grew up watching Johnny Quest get ready to bust a gut on this one, and it's hilarious even if you didn't. Every cliché is ripped through like bodyguard Brock Samson going through henchmen. There's even a scene in there of him painted purple like Aqizio, and watching him snap is always a highlight of the show. The Brothers, Dean and Hank, rather then being Wonder Boys, are the complete opposite of Johnny Quest, and are a couple of goobs, regular teens, who take all the Super Science in stride. Dr. Venture himself is something of a failure in life, and yet he is the envy of all the other Super Scientists, because he has so many Arch-Enemies. The show is outstanding, though there is room for improvement. Some of the gags in the first season are hit and miss, but when they hit, they hit you like like Brock Samson! So there is sure to be a second season. Now grab the handle and push the button. Go Team Venture!",29 out of 33 found this helpful.,,21 November 2004
8,The Venture Bros.," RELEASE THE BUTTERFLIES...okay, whose job was it to feed the butterflies.","This is a favorite of mine on adult swim, but then there are only a few shows they make I don't care for. This one is sort of a Johnny Quest and other cartoon's of that era parody, but it isn't just a parody cartoon. It is also one of the few shows that adult swim makes that is not just a short fifteen minute show, but a full fledged half hour one so it usually has time to set up a hilarious plot each and every time. The characters are great as Dean and Hank Venture anchor the show and the father and his body guard Brock Sampson are definitely the super funny ones. Then there are the villains, most notably the Monarch, there has never been a character on film who was more evil and diabolical ever presented. Seriously, this show is great...if they aren't fighting the Monarch they are tackling the mystery's of the sea, going to arctic bases where a sort of fantastic four family lives, and having the occasional yard sale where even the arch enemies are welcome. For pure comedy entertainment look no further than the Venture Bros...GO TEAM VENTURE.",40 out of 49 found this helpful.,,24 July 2005
9,The Venture Bros., Perhaps the most perfect cartoon ever.,"I'm having a hard time imagining people actually voting for this below an 8. It may very well be the most perfect cartoon I've ever seen.<br/><br/>When I was vacationing in America, I had the chance of seeing The Venture Bros. on Adult Swim. After watching only one episode I already decided to buy the DVD. I've been in love with the series ever since.<br/><br/>The humor is everywhere. It's in the dialogue, it's in the story, it's in the characters. The show contains many and many parodies of movies, comics and other cartoons. Sometimes there are even straight rips. And yet, The Venture Bros. cartoon manages to stay unique and original.<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone.",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,8 January 2008
10,The Venture Bros.," An oasis in a bland, predictable TV world","Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer are entertainment geniuses. There is nothing about this show that is predictable. Each episode surprises with it's characters, plot, comedy and outcome. In a world where no matter how ""good"" a show is, they end up doing the same thing every other show has done, with the same rehashed plots and jokes, or just pull plots from the newspaper headlines, this show is fresh. And that's hard to achieve when you start as a parody like it did. But at this point it's advanced far beyond parody. This show is so faithful to it's universe, the world Hammer and Publick created in season one, with such well drawn characters that continue to develop, each distinctive and layered with real personalities despite their comical stereo-archetypes, and with so much going on in 22 minutes, this show should be studied by all aspiring TV and film writers to understand the state of the art in screen writing.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,30 September 2008
11,The Venture Bros., A diamond in the rough...,"After the wake of horribly incomprehensible cartoons that followed in the success of Aqua Teen, a show with continuity and humor that doesn't rely on catch phrases and absurdity emerges. The humor and characters can be a little forced and juvenile on occasion, though, but it doesn't affect the overall feel or drag it down.<br/><br/>Hank and Dean, in their naivety, work perfectly as counterparts to the bodyguard, Brock Samson, and middle-aged, scientist father, Dr. Rusty Venture, who constantly have to look after the boys well being even though they have extra ""copies"" of them. Though, in my opinion, the real driving mechanism of the series has to be The Monarch, at least from a comedic perspective, especially in episodes involving the love triangle with Dr. Girlfriend and Phantom Limb. In the end, we have a gaggle of characters that seem as though they were created by a bored junior high student during a free period who are all woven into a parody of Johnny Quest that is surprisingly enjoyable and better than most of the Adult Swim lineup.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,5 February 2008
12,The Venture Bros., Venture Licious,"I was skeptical when a friend/co-worker let be borrow his Venture Bros. DVDs. I was absolutely hooked while watching ""Tag Sale, You're It"". The Depeche Mode conversation between Dr. Girlfriend and The Monarch is about the funniest thing I had seen ever.<br/><br/>I was a little concerned about how they would top Season 1, because that set the bar extraordinarily high. I was not disappointed as Season 2 was AWESOME. <br/><br/>Brock: Hank, no!

Adult Swim hits the bullseye again with another sure to be hit show... its funny, its weird, its randomly violent, and it doesn't let up until the end... it definitely shows parodies to Johnny Quest and other old TV shows... I mean, I like it, and you're sure to like it too... unless you're a grouch who doesn't like to stay up past your bedtime... or if you just don't have a good enough sense of humor... yeah... if you like all the other shows on Adult Swim, this will fit in nicely...",47 out of 71 found this helpful.,,28 August 2004
14,The Venture Bros., It was the highest ranked cartoon here,"This is one of the best animated shows ever made, so it is kind of sad to see that its score on this website has gotten lower over the years. It's still ranked as one of the best and it deserves it. What makes this show great is probably the wonderful cast of characters with tons of great jokes and voices. Seriously, this show has some of the most suiting voices I have ever heard. They all sound hilarious and suit the appearances of the characters perfectly. This show tells the story of a guy named Dr. Venture and his two sons who regularly get their home attacked by the Monarch and various other villains.<br/><br/>What's great is probably how a lot of these parody shows would make the villains more interesting than the good guys. That's not always a bad thing, but the awesome thing here is that the good guys are just as funny and entertaining as the villains. It's just great seeing them all play off of each other given how different their personalities are. It's dynamics like these that make for a great cast of characters. As one of the greatest adult cartoons ever made, it's also great that it doesn't go too far with its obscenity or violence.<br/><br/>Some adult cartoons like modern ""Family Guy"" just try to disgust their audience to show how edgy they are. True, we get into some pretty dark territory in this show every now and then, but it never really goes too far. It portrays the characters realistically and never has them try to gross out the viewers. We really do see character development and more of a story go on. Every character has their own quirks that it's hard for me to pick a favorite one. Maybe Henchman 21? He went through great character development. While not as good as ""Rick And Morty"" still awesome. ****",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,8 May 2017
15,The Venture Bros., The Venture Bros deserves a proper finale,"Shows like The Venture Bros don't show their full potential from the start: The first episodes are fun to watch, but it considerably improves from season 3 onwards.<br/><br/>Not only the animation starts getting better from that point, the plot and characterization becomes more complex also, with a lot of focus on continuity.<br/><br/>It would be a shame one of the most interesting shows Adult Swim ever had was left without a proper finale, and I really hope the series continues in one way or another, at least to tie up the loose ends left by the last season.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,8 September 2020
16,The Venture Bros., Hilarious!,"This show is probably the best mix of action/adventure and comedy for Adult Swim. The Venture team consists of brothers Dean Venture and Hank Venture, along with their father the once noble scientist Dr. Rusty Venture and their insane, tough as nails bodyguard Brock Samson. These four star is probably one of the funniest shows I have ever seen Adult Swim put on the air. Throughout the series so far they have fended off such hysterical villains as Baron Von Underbite and the always hysterical Monarch with his butterfly henchman. The episodes are always met with some high intense animation action and then some of the hugest laughs of all time.

You have to watch further... which is what I did.<br/><br/>The storyline is great, the characters are well put together and (aw hell, I better just say it or it'll back up on me)...

18,The Venture Bros., plain review,"The show is a parody of 60's cartoons and their seriousness, the format adopted from Johnny Quest...an excellent humanistic portrayal of people who live too much of their lives in their imagination (a huge theme running through the show). A really funny show for fans of comics and or cartoons that can see the depth of them and would enjoy a candid look at what these things might be like if they were a reality. Very funny dialog composed well within the plot when good, and forgivable when it misses, excellent imaginative characters and rich personalities permeate the show, with much of it yet to be uncovered (as of august 2006). Shows the random incidents and moments that make up life, translated into a superheros world, making for some moments of real hysteria.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,12 August 2006

The animation, which draws from classic cartoons such as ""Johnny Quest"" is polished and easy on the eye. All in all, the show has a little something for everyone. Complete with nostalgia, violence, and hilarious wit, both older and younger viewers will find something to love. As the title says, more people should see this show.

25,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Some reviewers don't seem to get it.,"First off, I NEVER give anything a perfect score -- there is always room for improvement. I grew up watching Scooby Doo in reruns, because I'm not old enough to have seen it firsthand, and I'm a huge fan.<br/><br/>This incarnation is a reboot -- something which many viewers/reviewers don't seem to understand (especially the above reviewer, ctyankee1) -- and often goes into a darker, more serious storyline. It's not the same one from the 60s or 70s &amp; it's not trying to be. I love it because of its ""neo-retro"" (modern &amp; oldschool at the same time) look. Everything is connected, from one episode to the next &amp; I think they did a fantastic job paying homage to the original series (from canon flashbacks to past villains).<br/><br/>After reading some negative reviews, I can tell that most of the reviewers don't really watch the show or have only watched an episode or two -- which is sad.

The stories are great and I'm glad to see Matt Lillard voicing Shaggy. Casey Casum will always be the best but his voice has changed too much.

Put simply, this is Scooby-Doo living up to its fullest potential.<br/><br/>I know my Scooby. I grew up with all the incarnations of the show, and while it's generally held a place in my mind as being fun, I probably would never have considered myself a true fan. I didn't doodle Scooby on my class notes.<br/><br/>But some genius came along and changed the rules. This show is true expansion, not a retelling of the original story. Not a remake. It's not trying to be hip, or modern. It's trying to be iconic; it's trying to be bold. They flashback to scenes straight out of the original series, and build their universe brick by brick, staying true to the core elements of Scooby (including the ridiculous slapstick), while introducing intrigue, fear, tension, development - and humor, like you've never seen in Scooby before.<br/><br/>I think the moment I realized that I might be watching something incredible came along when Velma was giving a tour of her family's Spook Museum, and casually resting in the background was the opening monster from the Scooby-Doo live action film. It never came up; it was just *there*.<br/><br/>That was a tell-tale sign of a groups of creators that loved their material - both good and bad.

It has a huge plot line, character development, and the monsters are actually really scary. This show leaves you wanting more each week. It's so amazing! I love basically everything about this show. The only thing that bothered me about this show is the relationship in the beginning with shaggy and Velma. It just felt wrong in my opinion, But *SPOILER* you only have to see moments with them together for like two of the episodes and it's easy to ignore it for those two episodes. However, everything else in the show was perfect.

29,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated," New ""Mystery Incorporated"" starts out on a high note.","Finally, character development for the Scooby-Doo Gang. Despite the fact that Fred and Daphne are back in their old late 60's outfits, new life has been breathed into Scooby's supporting cast. Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers and his pet Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, have always been the most developed of the five characters and display their usual hijinks and slapstick, with one exception...Shaggy has a secret involving one of the members of the gang. Freddy Jones, the son of the town's Mayor in this story line, no longer has the Mr. Perfect persona, but is a precocious and eager yet likable teen who loves the thrill of mystery solving to the point that he gets carried away. Daphne Blake's personality is very sweet and endearing. Her character is more reminiscent of the original Daphne from the sixties only this Daphne is a cheerful optimist when it comes to her friends but is easily dishearten when it comes to Fred's cluelessness of her affections. The real surprise is Velma Dinkley! Her appearance seems to be modeled after the live-action version as her features looks more feminine. Although she's still extremely short in stature, Velma has more of a slender build making her noticeably busty. And though Velma still wears the usual outfit, her turtle neck sweater plunges slightly lower, revealing her neck. She now sports a fluffier hairstyle with small hair ribbons. As for her personality, she is sarcastic, opinionated, slightly quick-tempered, and (surprisingly) flirtatious. This new change in her character is well suited for the flow of the show and rounds out the cast quite nicely. Even with all the changes, ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"" takes you back to the original Scooby-Doo roots, with enough of it's own originality to bring it up to date. However, with more attention directed towards the lives of the characters rather than the mystery, it leaves the story of how the mystery was executed half explained. Still, the writers seem to know what their doing and if they keep to this format, this show has the potential to be almost as popular as the classic ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"".",51 out of 62 found this helpful.,8.0,12 July 2010

In my opinion that is a good thing, it dares to break free from the former chain of reboots that are all the exact same episode after episode. So if you were a die hard fan of the original Scooby show when you were a kid, then this show may not be for you. Please do not form an opinion one thing just because it isn't like something else, that is not an opinion.<br/><br/>Okay, now on to my actual thoughts on the show. Mystery Incorporated immediately changes up the Scooby-Doo formula by having an ongoing plot from episode to episode. You might be able to watch the first half of season 1 with no context but when watching the second half of S1 and most of S2 you will need prior knowledge to understand what is going on. This not only brings the story a serious feeling, (the show has some really dark undertones and themes) but gives opportunities to create new characters never before seen in the Scooby-Doo franchise. The original 5 are still here slightly more likable than before but mostly the same. The original 5 help show off the new characters, and the new characters are great in my opinion. Mr. E, Angel, Sheriff Stone, Hot Dog Water, Brad and Judy, Mayor Jones, Vincent Van Ghoul, Skipper, and especially Professor Pericles all feel so natural in this world. Plus constant recurring characters that will come back later because they have some sort of importance. The writing of the show show is good for the most part but it can have its kind of awkward moments with an overused joke or two. Another reason I love this show as a Scooby-Doo show is because of the plot. The plot of this show (Late S2 especially) is so complicated and twisted just to explain why Scooby can talk. I think this works really well in ways and poorly in other ways.<br/><br/>Now what do I not like about this show. In many cases the animation can look odd. When moving 3D models are used against the 2D characters the overall look feels very unpolished. The animation doesn't look odd at all times just once maybe every 5 or 6 episodes. My other problem would have to be sometimes it's tone is all over the place. For example when nova starts talking about her ancestors it's a little challenging to take seriously. I don't think these problems at all ruin the entirety of the show though.<br/><br/>In all Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated is, in my opinion, the best Scooby show out there. With a good story, good characters, and breaking free from 10+ shows before it that all followed the exact same formula every single episode, this show is well worth a watch.",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,20 March 2020
32,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, It's the best since the original ...,"I am surprised by some of the negative reviews on here. This is the best incarnation yet of the original show. The Scooby Doo Mystery ones with the special guests were pretty horrible, the Scooby/Scrappy show was a disaster, and the most recent ""What's New Scooby Doo's"" were decent but a little too trendy and trying to be hip to the 2000s. Therein lies the beauty of this show. It is a new show, with new stories, new relationship drama, and new villains and mysteries. However, it keeps the old look &amp; feel too. The show is darker now than it's been since the original series (when almost every episode happened in the creepy night time) and you feel that darkness when you watch it. It's spookier than the hackneyed villains of ""What's New"" and certainly far less goofy than the ones with the special guests. I cringe when I see those awful episodes with The Globetrotter and Phyllis Diller. Sure, the relationship stuff is more ""adult"" than the past but for those of you pointing out that the costumes are 70s again ... that's cool! So is Fred playing an 8-track on a record player ... that was funny, and meant to be! You've got to get the joke. Look, no one likes change all that much. I'm a marketing exec and I know this more than anything but change, when presented with elements that make us still feel comfortable, is great. Kudos to the writers for this fresh take on a great show that still makes me feel at home. (Oh, and I love the ""Mr. E"" stuff. It's a nice creepy sub-plot that now has me tivo'ing the show for myself, not just my kid!)",48 out of 61 found this helpful.,9.0,9 November 2010
33,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Best incarnation of the classic series,"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated is my favourite Scooby series. Whilst the original SDWAY is irreplaceable, Mystery Inc. is, in my opinion, the strongest entry in the franchise so far. Here's why I think so.<br/><br/>As well as staying true to the main essence of the show, with monster-of-the-week episodes, humour, action, and likeable characters, MI introduced an over-arching story/mystery. Handled much more capably than in 13 Ghosts, the over-arching plot here is intriguing to follow and watch unravel as the show progresses. With the ball rolling from the very first episode and spanning the entirety of the 52 episodes, this aspect of the show is without a doubt one of its main strenghts.<br/><br/>The characters of Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and of course Scooby-Doo, and the journey they take as individuals, and also as friends, is another great aspect of the series. They are fleshed out much more than in early seasons, especially Fred and Daphne, and each member of the gang is given family members who we get to learn more about throughout the show. Also explored are the romantic relationships between Fred and Daphne, and Velma and Shaggy. As someone who is a lifelong Scooby fan, the ""Fraphne"" relationship is one of my favourite elements of the show and I was so glad for it to finally be explored in depth. Velma and Shaggy's relationship is also developed, and the impact of such on Scooby, but you'll have to watch to see how that pans out.<br/><br/>Moving forward, I simply love the art style of this series. It is noticeably darker than say WNSD or BCSD, and I just love it. So much care is taken to form gorgeous backdrops, and the character designs are my favourite for a series since the original SDWAY (retaining their classic outfits, but with a new twist regarding the look of the characters). The animation is near perfect, and is just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'll just touch on a few other things. The opening theme is short but sweet. Very catchy and original. I actually like just an instrumental theme, it suits the tone of the show well. The monsters in the show are actually pretty scary, with episodes to match (if you don't believe me just watch ""The Creeping Creatures""). Whilst there are no musical chase scenes, the action sequences are just as good. And finally, there are plenty of nods and references to the franchise's long history, e.g. the exhibits in the Crystal Cove Spooky Museum, the character of Vincent Van Ghoul, as well as THE HEX GIRLS!! (Lol), and much more.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this series to anyone, Scooby fan or not. It is such a great addition to the franchise, and definitely earns the title as one of the best series in the Scooby franchise.",19 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,26 February 2018
34,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated," Zoinks &amp; Jeepers, this rocked!","What a great reboot. Like ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Batman Begins"", Scooby Doo gets re-imagined in a way that just really freaking works. The writing is a great mix of serious, funny, scary, silly, spooky, and even with some amours shenanigans thrown in. It's also like watching ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Farscape"", or a John Carpenter movie, basically a great blend of dark, serious adventure with some funny and touching moments. The art and production design would make Iwao Takamoto proud, and with a style like some great cinematographer shot it through a 1970's lens. <br/><br/>But as much as I've referenced others, there's also some great originality to the writing and art as well. Every character personality gets quality time, and there are some nice quirks thrown in (Velma's sarcasm is the best). And the overall look of the show is amazing.<br/><br/>I love that the largest influence out of all of the previous incarnations seems to be ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"". And there are just enough great references to previous incarnations as well. Daphne trying to get into the storage closet, Don Knotts standing in the crowd, the museum with mostly the classic monsters but also that phantom from the first live action movie in the background, the Vincent VanGhoul movie, and probably a dozen others I have to go back and watch for. It'll be cool if they keep that up (just as long as Scrappy doesn't get too much reference time).<br/><br/>So glad someone decided to take Scooby Doo seriously. Looking forward to more.",22 out of 28 found this helpful.,10.0,17 July 2010
35,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, I can see why there are diverse opinions,"I happen to quite like this series (thus far) as does my family and yet I can see why some people have a problem with it. First a bit of background: both my wife and I grew up with Scooby-Doo and our kids independently decided they liked the various instances of the show as well so, for good or bad, I've seen probably 99% of the Scooby oeuvre.<br/><br/>Certainly it should first be noted that this series is a ""reboot"" and not inherently placed in temporal or any other relationship to previous series. On the other hand, it is also often parodies what has come before. This has been done to some extent in the live action movies and the direct to video animated movies but in the present case, the basic world that the characters inhabit is more of an alternate reality. In the original series the chief fantastical element was that Scooby could talk; the present series supposes a town where monsters are big business and the kids get in trouble for SOLVING mysteries, for example. Structurally the show is more about action and character arcs with the mystery element largely on the second tier. In could be argued that the mysteries in Pup Named Scooby-Doo were a bit less obvious than some in S-D:MI (but the obviousness is also part of the parody, e.g., the gator episode).<br/><br/>As to the characters, Fred, Daphne and Velma all are pretty different from previous incarnations, as is Scooby who evidences far more social insight and complex dialog. Shaggy has never really varied much series to series and nothing much changes here (One has to go back to his very earliest existence to find him more adept and only mildly fearful). In general, these are not realistic or even particularly functional characters; great role models, they are not. If you are looking for that, the direct to video movies will be more your cup of tea. But if you are open to a different mythology with a more oddball yet somewhat more adult approach, you might find it a cool take.<br/><br/>I personally like the animation style and think the direction is on par with the upper echelon of current animated action shows. There's a bit of an irony in that the original Scooby-Doo was created in response to parental pressure against violence in animated shows of the 60's (e.g., Space Ghost, Jonny Quest) while this show is probably the most dark and violent Scooby yet. I guess things have come full circle.<br/><br/>In summary, I'd say give it a chance for a few episodes but if it isn't to your liking and you want something more classic/less dark/more realistic, I believe they are on a schedule of at least one new direct to video movie each year. Further, it appears we can probably count on new series productions for another 40+ years so you can always wait for the next one...",23 out of 30 found this helpful.,8.0,18 October 2010
36,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, One of the better Scooby Doo incarnations...,"I say this as a big fan of Scooby Doo. I watched Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated not expecting much, and I was shocked at how surprisingly good it. To me while not as good as the classic Scooby Doo! Where Are You?, Mystery Incorporated is one of the better Scooby Doo incarnations, and much better than Shaggy Doo: Get a Clue!(the worst of anything to do with Scooby Doo) <br/><br/>If there is one thing that I wasn't crazy about, I did find at first that Velma's personality here took a while to get used to. However, I loved the animation, the colours and backgrounds are very colourful and stylistic while having a glossy sheen to them. In general Mystery Inc look similar in design to the other incarnations, except for Fred and to a lesser extent Velma, and they are convincing. Plus I found the villains funky in look.<br/><br/>The music is great as well, the main theme is memorable and the background music sometimes has a cinematic feel to it. The writing is funny and moody and in one episode poignant too(when Fred finds out about his father), while the stories are set up quite nicely with the darkest atmosphere of any Scooby show since the original, something refreshingly new in idea to mixing some elements of what made the original work so well and trying something different and one of the least predictable and hackneyed of any show to do with the iconic character.<br/><br/>The characters are great. Velma as I have said takes some getting used to, but I loved the development to Fred, I liked how they made Daphne stronger and more resourceful here and Shaggy and Scooby still make me smile and laugh. In terms of villains, most are great, but some are disappointing, especially the Creepers/Gators who were very predictable and obvious. The voice acting is fine too, the new voice actor for Shaggy does a very worthy job in particular and Frank Welker is still going strong.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't expecting to like Mystery Incorporated, but I actually love it. It made the most of a good idea and got/is getting stronger. 9/10 Bethany Cox",22 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,24 July 2011
37,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Do the Doo,"The Scooby Gang is back, and boy are they better than ever. Please excuse my clichéd statement, but there's no other way around it. The Scooby Gang is back, new and improved.<br/><br/>The original series, made in the 70s, had a very simple formula. The Scooby Gang, comprised of character archetypes, would ride around in their mystery machine, go to a scary place, and have to convince Shaggy and Scooby to aide with the mystery solving with the help of the promise of Scooby Snacks. The gang would spilt up, Velma would find clues, Daphne would always open the wrong door, or get kidnapped, and Fred would come up with a plan to catch the supernatural culprit, Shaggy and Scooby would be funny.<br/><br/>Over the years, the formula had been retooled, or abandoned all together. Sometimes only Scooby and Shaggy have made an appearance with the occasional inclusion of Scrappy Doo. I actually like Scrappy Doo.<br/><br/>Recently there was the hit live action movie, it's sequel and the prequel (which included a brunette Fred and an Asian-American Velma) along with the newest animated incarnations, What's New Scooby Doo and Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue.<br/><br/>I thought the live action movies were funny and well written, and Miss Sarah Michelle Gellar played Daphne in two of them so I kinda' had to watch them. What's New Scooby Doo was also cute, but I felt more could've been done with the Scooby Doo formula, especially when the re-tooled animated series came out afterward.<br/><br/>Now we've got Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated. A new series airing on Cartoon Network. The new series focuses more on our beloved Scooby Gang as people rather than caricatures. What used to be hinted at in the original series when it came to character relationships, is now push to the forefront. Daphne makes it really obvious about her affections for Fred; Shaggy and Velma have a few surprises of their own.<br/><br/>The voice work in this show is excellent, as is most productions from Hanna Barbara. Fact's of Life's Mindy Cohn, who played Velma in What's New Scooby Doo, reprises her role here as our favorite girl geek. The legendary Frank Welker does his double duty as Scooby Doo and Fred Jones. Fan favorite Grey DeLisle voices Daphne flawlessly. I almost thought she was the original voice actor Heather North. I was most impresses with Mathew Lillard's Shaggy. Being cast as Shaggy in two of the live action movies, he was a highlight in that he really just let himself get absorbed into the part. This man IS Shaggy. Aside from original voice actor Casey Kasem of course, who's voice also makes it into this series as Shaggy's father. Also includes celebrity voices Vivica A. Fox and Patrick Warburton.<br/><br/>I've only seen the first episode, but I am already excited for the rest of this new series. Aside from the drama our classic characters are having with each other, they're going to have to solve a huge mystery that is too big for just one episode. The show now has some continuity in it that was missing in previous incarnations.<br/><br/>This is definitely a show I will be watching weekly along with my regular viewings of Glee and Desperate Housewives.<br/><br/>Check out my movie review site: http://neonboy619.blogspot.com",27 out of 37 found this helpful.,10.0,9 August 2010
38,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated," I didn't like the original show that much, but I actually like this","OK, so maybe it was just a product of its time, but I have some problems with the original show. It was corny, Freddy and Daphne had no personality, Scooby and Shaggy were just there to be comedic relief and Velma was kind of a Mary Sue that could solve anything and didn't even need the rest of the gang.<br/><br/>Though there were concepts I liked. Especially how it was pretty much the only show to ever try and teach skepticism to our younger. Some might argue against it, but in my view imagination and wonder is good, but you better know how to evaluate everything you hear and see.<br/><br/>But this show, it gets it right. I like how they kept the skeptical theme. When Zombie Island finally did real monsters (outside of a crossover) it was actually quite surprising and nice, it caught people off-guard, and it was done competently as well. Then every Scooby-Doo incarnation since had to have supernatural and science fiction (the less said about the hippie aliens, the better). And worse, they became progressively dumber... then somewhat decent.<br/><br/>And then this. Now I finally actually like Fred. He is a man of very specific interests... that is, a geek. He always had this jock build so it was weird he and Daphne seemed to be put in the same category of the gang as weirdos, but now this is justified. He likes mysteries, tactics and, above all, traps. He really, really likes traps. And those interests just overflow so well to everything he does as a character, it finally is an actual character trait instead of just a generic leader archetype. His obliviousness also makes a very endearing flaw.<br/><br/>Velma is not the magic clue-solving machine that has no other purpose or much of a personality trait over ""she does't like to lose her glasses"". She is this sarcastic and vulnerable teen, who is not only intelligent but clever as well. She still solves the mystery most of the time, but now it finally looks like the rest of the gang is helping in the process of mystery-solving instead of just being glorified clue-finders (or rather clue-stumblers).<br/><br/>Daphne is probably the most shallow, being this doe-eyed girl who is mostly following the gang so she can be with Fred, who she shares a somewhat Platonic Love for thanks to his utter obliviousness (Shaggy is more perceptive to Velma's much more subtle advances). Still, she manages to actually put some effort into it instead of just being the damsel in distress every other episode. She grows on the gang and on the spectator.<br/><br/>Shaggy and Scooby, while only being the comic relief, were the most developed of the original cast. What in this case only means they actually had stablished personalities, even if just of hopelessly but easily coerced (or bribed) cowards with a penchant for food and a bit short of straws in the head-box. But now they actually interact with the gang and we they react to their goofness. Pretty much everything I've ever asked the show to do.<br/><br/>So, overall, this show is great with superbly stablished characters. Good to know some people actually know that if you're going to resurrect an old franchise instead of creating something new, the least you can do is actually improve on it instead of just doing the same thing over or just pointlessly changing it to the point it is unclear why not just creating something new in the first place. 9 of 10.",22 out of 32 found this helpful.,9.0,21 January 2012

40,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Darker with a more Interesting Plot line,"The reason this is my favorite Scooby-Doo show can be summed up in one word: everything! Unlike others of the franchise, Mystery Inc. has a linear story to it, the only series to do that. More developed characters, better side characters, and better monsters make this one the best. In addition, it has an underrated score that works well with the horror ambiance of the cartoon. Speaking of which: it very cleverly parodies many horror movies such as the Shining and Saw. Although this show is much, much darker, that's what makes it great. While the old ones were fun and goofy, this was somehow a breath of fresh air into a franchise that had a streak of bad shows.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,3 November 2017
41,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated," Revamped Characters, Haunted Atmosphere, and Totally New Approach","In spite of some serious negativity from other reviews, I can honestly say that I watch through both seasons 1 and 2 without ever having any problem with the way this show was handled or developed. In a word, it's brilliant, and the good parts of this masterpiece of storytelling far outweighs any trifling personal issues I have with some specifics. Still I'll get the bad stuff out of the way beforehand to clear the air of any problems one can expect to run into with the show.<br/><br/>My first very slight yet tempered issue is with the bad guys. They are certainly well designed, but there isn't always a really solid mystery to follow. 70% of the time the bad guy is way too obvious, or totally unguessable. However, the times when it is obvious, the choice still makes sense for the storyline. And every time it's totally unguessable the show comes up with highly imaginative explanations for the bad guy's motive. The real kicker is the 30% that it's guessable but not always completely obvious, and these episodes are the real gems.<br/><br/>The biggest problem this show ran into in my opinion was the relationship between Velma and Shaggy. Personally, I would have liked to see these two really hit it off and eventually make a compromise between their very different personalities. The relationship is rocky to say the least, and never really pans out to a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>If these aspects of the show were just slightly better tweaked, I would have no problem giving the show a 10, but it had its hiccups. Rant over, now onto the good stuff.<br/><br/>Where was I, oh yes, the characters. Some have mentioned that the show is less Scooby focused. This is true, but to the show's strength not it's detriment. There's only so much you can do with a scaredy-cat dog that likes to eat. The other characters are more fleshed out.<br/><br/>Scooby is still his usual comedic ham of a self. Shaggy's slackerish tendencies are more modernized, but he is more or less the same. He does have some interesting ways of sneaking around food. Velma has higher expectations of herself and the gang in this incarnation, and she plays the role of the more grounded skeptic who requires a logical explanation for everything. Daphne is the youngest daughter of a rich family where she lives somewhat in the shadow of her older more successful sisters. Fred is perhaps my favorite. He can be characterized as more of an idiot-savant. He's not too bright and out of touch with his emotions, but is obsessed with and an absolute genius at setting up traps.<br/><br/>The group is more dynamic in this show. While they are most certainly friends, they go through some drama. In my opinion, this makes them far more realistic that their previous counterparts. Even though they argue and have their issues, they always manage to show that they truly care for each other when it's most important, and they fix their problems in time to capture the bad guy, or at least are willing to shelve them for a more opportune moment to talk it out when the bad guy shows up out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Another high point of the show is the new animation style along with the atmosphere the show puts together. The music definitely fits, and all the synthesizers are high tech and well programmed. It's worth checking out a copy of the soundtrack at some point. The drawing is much darker compared to most of the show's earlier incarnations. Toxic greens and rage-filled reds illuminate the screen at various points in the show. The animators almost certainly took a page from the book of the programmers from World of Warcraft, if you are familiar with that game's color scheme. It makes for a magically charged haunted atmosphere.<br/><br/>The show also has a new design as far as the storyboard goes. Episodes have their villain of the week, but the show does a fantastic job of having a much larger overarching story that takes place in the town of crystal cove. Previous mystery enthusiast groups have had their problems here as well, and the classic Scooby gang has to overcome obstacles in order to not repeat the same mistakes as their predecessors. Much can happen between ancient artifacts and other dimensions, and the bigger mystery is one you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>Other high points include: Recurring side characters, throwbacks to older scooby shows, downright zany Rube Goldberg style traps, and an ending that ties everything off with an odd yet fulfilling sense of closure. I'm crossing my fingers for a sequel series.<br/><br/>Overall I'd give this show an 8.7, but for the purposes of rating I'll round that up to 9.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,11 July 2013
42,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Funny with a chance of Horror,"Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, now ended in the US, has been something of a roller- coaster, and that is understood by many, I believe. And now, I have a chance to compliment its superiority, because it is simply that. <br/><br/>To begin with, it is a pure homage to the original series with cameos of numerous monsters from the very first selection of episodes. It also features Hanna-Barbera characters and other animated individuals, the continuity references are endless. And with this collection of characters, it has given us, as the audience, a sofa to sit upon. Then, it gets better. The character development is something to be recognised because it gives a change to the dullness and simplicity of the first series and gives an overview of life in reality and why relationships can be the toughest things to handle even when monsters and villains roam the streets. And that, all in all, is what pushes this series ahead. <br/><br/>Moving on to the story now, this is what I acclaim highest. It is simple yet complex. By that I mean the writing is simple, but the story and concept is sweetened by complex storytelling. It gives me the feeling that these writers have planned and scraped for objects and characters they can use and slot them in to some particular episode. Right from the beginning, in episode one, we are given something that will stick with us throughout the series (two in fact), a phone call from Mr E and a golden locket, with that oh-so majestic tune. And then by the end, we are given an answer, something that was at first so small it could barely be spotted, to a point where the fiction has become something so incredibly gigantic, it is momentous. And then the ending is emotional, we see everybody, as they were as they never were, all the monsters and villains that Mystery Incorporated unmasked and all the characters they met...all gone. That poignant and very significant end, is something that not many series can do and it forces audiences to say - ""Wow!"", because it is that good. <br/><br/>But not only that, the animation has exceeded itself, the voice actors are incredible, the direction is original, the sound effects and music are immaculate. Everything that makes this show has been somewhat breathtaking, because of its substance and the enthusiasm and thought that has gone into making it. The horror is so brilliant, one can almost believe its reality.<br/><br/>This is not a series of pictures rushing past, this is brilliance in the truest of senses and all wrapped around a cartoon character who is loved by millions of children across the globe. And the song that this story has sung, will never stop singing. <br/><br/>P.S. Whoever decided that this series was right for seven-year-olds, they were absolutely wrong! I'm warning you parents, people die in this story, and it is something a child must never see until they are mature enough to understand what the concept entails.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,7 April 2013
43,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Cartoon masterpiece,"I've been a Scooby Doo fan since I was an unborn babe and I've seen every iteration, film, comic; you name it. I'm there. 
And out of ALL of them, this is most definitely been the best.<br/><br/>The characters are finally fleshed out;
Everyone makes little mistakes, develops and end up being so much more than just a catchphrase and a cliche.<br/><br/>The animation style took a little of getting used to for me but, you can absolutely tell that everyone adored doing this far more adult take on an absolute classic, with references to Galaxy Quest, SAW, Terminator and so many more; and not to mention subtle nods to the Scooby feature films and the original cartoons. <br/><br/>For some vague insight into specifics without spoiling anything; they had the nerve to KILL characters off. It has raised the bar of my expectations for Scooby features. <br/><br/>The best part is, the whole story is completely original. Even though it nods to all the classics (as previously mentioned), it gives you more an in-depth retelling of why they are who they are, with a stellar voice cast (I mean, as soon as I heard Patrick Warburton's voice, I was sold) and animation team. 
Even some of your questions that you've always had about the show get answered! <br/><br/>I cannot really put into (a small amount of) words just how amazing this turned out to be. But I really would urge you to sit it out and watch the lot, as the show really kicks off in season 2, for it's staggering grand finale. <br/><br/>Please for the love of god if you like Scooby even a little.

Daphne's got more spunk and she pines for the oblivious Fred, but over the course of 8 episodes, there's actual character development!! Velma's much girlier than she used to be, and way more sarcastic (ie, funny) and Shag and Scooby are their usual selves. How's it working so far? Excellently. While they solve a different mystery each week, they also get tantalizing clues from the mysterious Mr. E, who tell them ""this has all happened before"", and each week the larger mystery unfolds a little more. Great! The animation's top notch, with all kinds of fun stuff tossed in the backgrounds, like a grown up Pebbles and Bam Bam showing up at the beach, and longtime Scooby fan Matthew Sweet provides a creepy, haunting theme music. It's much funnier than the classics, better animated, and a worthy part of the legacy of Scooby Doo. Why 9 out o 10? I loved the few feature films that actually featured supernatural stuff, not just guys in masks.",12 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,3 September 2010
49,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, The best Scooby Doo incarnation yet,"I love this series !<br/><br/>The animation is great, the mystery's are much more scary and logical, and FINALLY we have character development in a Scooby show.The voice acting is also great.I'm very happy that Mattew Lilard replaced Kasey(I have a big amount of respect for him but in the last 10 years he didn't sound like Shaggy anymore).<br/><br/>Almost every episode is strongly tied to the plot and every recurring character has purpose.The gang lives in a town, go to high school and have parents.Every character has a unique personality and a different lifestyle.The interactions between the characters are great and there actually are romantic relationship between some of them.All of those things makes the members of the gang feel like real people and is increasing our interest for them and for the story.<br/><br/>All the mystery's are different from one another and the villains are scary and dangerous.This is what the creators of the the first show originally intended to do but nobody would let them because back in the '60-'70 you couldn't do any animated show that was too complex or too scary for kids.<br/><br/>This show has a lot of interesting thing going on while it still looks and feels like Scooby Doo.The modernized the world of Scooby Doo and still keep the retro look and feel about this show.We have few recycled villains and more original ones.The recurring characters like Mayor Jones, Sheriff Bronson Stone and Angel Dynamyte received some character development and they are actually very tied to the plot.<br/><br/>They paid a lot of homages to some of the old Scooby Doo shows and many other Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoons like Jabberjaw, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, Speed Buggy, The Funky Phantom and Jonny Quest.I even spotted a Yogi Bear and a Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm cameo.<br/><br/>I wanted to wait till the end of the season to see how this series is evolving and it got better and better.The ending was very surprising and I really hope season 2 on the way.This is the best incarnation of the Scooby Doo franchise and it has a lot more to offer.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,16 June 2011
50,V, Very Different To The Mini-Series And The Final Battle But Still Very Good,"This series of V was very different to the Mini-Series and The Final Battle episodes. The original series was action packed but it was an allegory of the problems in Germany in the 40's when the Nazi's were stepping on people. The original series explored a lot of issues such as the fight between good and evil and the destructive nature of man.<br/><br/>This series did away with most of the above and instead concentrated on producing action, chases, explosions etc.<br/><br/>Old favourites such as Willie, Ham Tyler and Mike Donovan were back. And of course, the wicked Diana was back (looking beautiful than ever). Joining the show were the likes of Lydia who was a rival to Diana and the mysterious Charles. <br/><br/>The shows were very good producing loads of action. It was a good show if a little short-lived. Let's hope a follow up is done one day because the final episode did leave a lot of loose ends to be tied.",26 out of 30 found this helpful.,,24 August 2002
51,V, Worthwhile because of it's scope,"This series had a lot going against it - plot holes the size of meteor craters (why don't the visitors just condition Rev. Turney into giving up the location of the rebel camp?, for instance), some of the cheesiest dialogue heard outside of a Kung Fu movie, special effects that where horrible even in 1984. So how come it captivated me so? It was charming. I felt, when I saw it, that cast &amp; crew alike really had a good time doing this show, and those things rub off. But more important, the series had SCOPE and ORIGINALITY. The creators weren't afraid to take on really heavy topics, and they did it in a way that hasn't been seen before, nor after.",29 out of 34 found this helpful.,7.0,24 May 2006
52,V, The Visitor's Voices - Where'd it go??,"I just got my copy of V The Complete Series. I had forgotten about all the 80's make-up and Diana's crazy variations on the standard Visitor uniform. Now don't misunderstand me, I still love anything to do with the Visitors, even down to the ridiculous deus ex machina that is the StarChild. But there is one thing about The Complete Series that aggravates the crap out of me. Suddenly, NONE of the visitors have the strange voice, and I mean none - not even a trace. I have always felt that you can detect the early rumblings of decline of this series about 10 minutes into Final Battle. The Complete Series takes the decay up to quick rot. Martin in plaid flannel and a hunter's vest!? Because NBC(?) wouldn't allow Kenny Johnson to take the time he needed to produce another mini-series that probably would have been fantastic, they took the idea and fobbed it off on less talented, cheaper people.<br/><br/>So....back to my original point- is it just me, or is there simply NO voice?

53,V, It's a million times better then Independence Day,"V and V the final battle is 8 of the best sci-fi hours on video anywhere. Yes it's long but any shorter and it would lose something. All the characters, all the inter-weaving stories and the entire plot are just perfectly executed. The underlying anti Nazi message and WW 2 under tones give the story a depth that make it even better. The special effects are very good for an 80's mini-series. The acting is good. But watching it you're glad they don't cut anything out. The best scene is the birth of the twins. Great sci-fi. If you think Independence Day was good you ain't seen nothin' yet.",32 out of 43 found this helpful.,,18 March 1999
54,V," I loved the Mini-series, the TV Series and The Final Battle!!!","When I first saw the mini-series, I fell in love with all of the characters and the story. From the beginning, the way they kept the whole thing a secret until springing it upon you what the Visitors were here for was pure genius and have of yet to ever be topped. When you finally find out that the real reason that the visitors are here is for water and food and the food they prefer is humans is still unnerving and gives me goose bumps still to this day. Then to have one of the main baddies be a female and hot on top of that made it even better. The way we find out that the visitors are some humanoid reptile still can't be topped and many others have tried and failed badly. Even the series, which sadly only went for 19 episodes, were far superior to any other SCIFI series at the time. Not only was the story just as good as the story told in the mini series but the special F/X could not be compared to any thing else either unless you went to see a movie. I still don't know why this well written and well-acted series never went more than just 19 episodes, it may have just been some added storyline before they aired ""V"" The Final Battle and help tie that one with the first V. I don't know. I would like to add though that everybody involved with ""V"" should be commended on the fine job that has been done. Since ""V"" one of my favorite of all time actors now is of course Michael Ironside, who's career I have followed and make a point to watch every project he has ever done since, Marc Singer who did and awesome job in V and one of my personnel favorites ""If You Could See What I Hear"" but of course he will always be remembered as ""The Beastmaster"" by far the character and job he has ever done and many other shows and movies have badly tried to duplicate and have never come close, Faye Grant &amp; Jane Badler as beautiful as they are talented. I can't wait for ""V: The Second Generation"" (2007) (mini)(taken from IMDb) and see the whole gang again and get a whole new generation hooked on ""V"" all over again.",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,,25 September 2005
55,V, A Series That Started Out With A Lot Of Potential.,"I am a big fan of V The Mini Series and V-The Final Battle. I was a pre-teen when the movies came out and was blown away by the plot as well as the cast. I knew that after V- The Final Battle a series was soon to follow, a movies about lizard people invading earth with sinister plans for us. The movies were too good not to have a series follow up, plus the ending to V-The final Battle left viewers with a well what happens next. I purchased V The Series through Amazon and finished watching the complete series last night. I don't remember many of the episodes from growing up because of my involvement with basketball in Junior High and missed most of them do to games and practice. The first 12 episodes I have to say were good, due largely to the cast. I especially liked Lane Smith as Nathan Bates, he played both sides of the fence; but knew what could happen if Diana wanted him out of the way. I knew once Bates was killed off, the series was in Jeporady. In episode 13 when Bates was killed off, the series didn't make a lot of sense. If you remember in episode 2 I believe Bates told Diana, he wears a pulse-oximeter in case she tried to eliminate him.If his pulse would stop she and her race would perish because the red dust would be released. In episode 12 Mr. Chang shot him at point blank when Kyle was trying to help his father leave Science Frontiers. The series just didn't make that much sense after Bates was killed off; plus most of the cast left. I do give them credit for trying especially bringing back Frank Ashmore as Philip, Martin's Twin. The series had too many different writer's; and that probably caused it's demise. I hope this review was helpful to you, the series is still worth to buy especially at Amazon, I only paid 4 dollars and for those who enjoyed the movies the series was not the best; but some of the episodes were actually good especially the first 12.

56,V, V:The Complete Series,"I remember watching the original mini-series in the mid eighties and how it caught my imagination and sense of wonder about the real possibilities of humanity's first contact with an advanced civilization.This mini-series was just amazing as was the second mini-series.Then this came out and it was definitely a diminishing of quality across the boards.I don't think I even made it through all 19 episodes back then in 1985.<br/><br/>It's now 2005 and I only invested in the DVD collection because I've been reading books by David Icke who is this conspiracy theorist who believes our planet has been ruled for the last ten thousand years by a race of shape-shifting reptilian beings from another galaxy who are posing to this day as humans and that they are mostly the ruling elite in all fields of human society.It was in his books that he suggested I watch ""V"".So I purchased the series and have just viewed the entire 19 episodes.<br/><br/>Irregardless of David Icke's theories I have found V:The Complete Series the most fun I've had in years.Yeah, the series is badly acted and the characters are pretty one dimensional and in the case of Diana and Lydia absolutely campy, but so what? The original Flash Gordon serial is campy and the effects are laughable but I can still enjoy that as much as the first three episodes of Star Wars. V:The Complete Series is 1980's television at it's most fun.I suggest just putting your brain aside while watching this series and you'll be just fine.",20 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,10 May 2006
57,V, Eighties TV Camp Classic,"Premiering in the Fall of 1984 (NBC, Oct.26, Fri 8-9p), just a few months after the mini-series sequel, 'V - The Final Battle', 'V' was now in the form of a weekly hour long sci-fi/action/adventure series.<br/><br/>In mid-season, (Feb. 1985), NBC re-vamped the sci-fi/soap opera, and moved it to a later time slot, yet it did little to save this embarrassment; any resemblance to Kenneth Johnson's original 1983 classic had been vaporized.<br/><br/>The most expensive and violent show on television at the time, 'V - The Series' was a critical and ratings disaster that will leave the viewer bewildered and in disbelief, yet strangely mesmerized.<br/><br/>Unintentionally hilarious and incredibly 80's, all nineteen episodes have a unique inane charm and many memorable moments. Every episode will entrance the viewer, largely based on sloppiness and the over-abundance of flaws.<br/><br/>True camp that's super-melodramatic and very funny, be on the lookout for 'Oswald', the (alien, or 'gaylien') gay-stock character, debuting in episode fifteen.<br/><br/>Quite possibly the worst sci-fi series, if not series, ever produced, one cannot help but to enjoy this train wreck.",31 out of 48 found this helpful.,10.0,28 August 2004

59,V, The humans continue their battle against the lizards,"The original mini-series was intelligent, engaging and a television event of the 1980s that cleverly melded refreshing science fiction with a dark chapter of human history. The second mini-series was almost just as good and demanded much patience from the viewer. Then came this ongoing series. While most of the characters returned, the budget and intelligence in the writing didn't.<br/><br/>The one and only season of ""V"" followed the story of the human resistance trying to survive while the lizards continually struggled with their own in-fighting. Most of the characters from the first two productions returned, the ladies with their big eighties hairstyles and the men pulling weak but amusing fight scenes.<br/><br/>Occasionally we were treated to a new alien weapon or a new character who promises to bring change to the ongoing story but some episodes drag on with long and slow moments that seem out of place. Unfortunately, the series ended on a cliffhanger when it was axed, so many things were left open and the viewer may feel short-changed by the closing credits of the last episode.<br/><br/>Still, if you want to see more adventures of Donovan and co. then you can watch this, but don't expect too much.

The special effects were really bad considering this was made 7 years after ""Star Wars"" but I just don't care. The story was great and I loved the characters. Is there anyone who didn't love the old grampa who survived a Nazi prison camp? Elias was awesome and Ham Tyler was just too cool. I really got the feeling that if something like that ever happened, people would behave the way they did in the movie. It seemed very realistic on an emotional level with heroism and treachery but mostly just a lot of people who were afraid to take a stand on either side. If you love movies with strong emotions and great characters, I highly recommend both movies.

63,V, Unlimited potential; Limited exploitation,"I first saw ""V-The Series"" when I was only 8 years old. As violent and gruesome as the critics thought it was, my mother let me watch it because it really wasn't all that bad. The series captivated me, as did my favorite movie at the time: ""Return Of The Jedi"".<br/><br/>24 years later, I watched ""V"", ""V-The Final Battle"", and ""V-The Series"" on DVD. If the first two mini-series were nothing short of excellent, I cannot say the same about ""V-The Series"".<br/><br/>From the blatantly obvious use of stock-footage from previous episodes, to the awful ""acting"" by such ""stars"" as Marc Singer and Michael Wright, it's no wonder the series was canceled after 19 episodes. The special effects were terrible and some plot elements made no sense. Many gun fights looked so fake, it's hard to believe one would have the nerve to put them on film.<br/><br/>But, guess what? None of this mattered to me, for when I put away the DVD box set after viewing the complete series, I realized one thing: ""V-The Series"" had great potential. I think the series could have gone a long way, had it not been for plot flaws, budget restraints, poor acting, and such competing shows as ""Dallas"". It's actually quite sad that NBC chose not to put the big bucks required to create a multi-season series of shows. Also, the fact that some very important characters were pulled out of the show around mid-season certainly didn't help.<br/><br/>Still, watching the series on DVD brought back so many good memories, I really enjoyed it. I actually caught myself having a bizarre rush of adrenaline at some point. Also had a good laugh here and there. Amongst the sometimes corny dialog, lie a couple of timeless quotes.

64,V, V: The Series was a victim of the times,"It started out with a lot of promise: the aliens from the two mini-series had returned, but a shrewd businessman had negotiated a ""free city"" -- an area where humans could go about their business with the illusion of being their own masters, very much like Casablanca in the movie of the same name.<br/><br/>While the first few episodes were a little flat as they set up this premise, the middle episodes were terrific. We had the pretense of this safe haven, while the aliens did their best to manipulate things behind the scenes, and the resistance continued to work at stopping the Visitors and their plans.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the ratings were not good, so the show began to focus more and more on what was going on inside the Visitor ships, which turned out to be a lot like what was happening on Dallas and Dynasty, two popular shows of the time.

I was disappointed he was written out midway through the series. It was like losing a loyal friend who knew what to do in any crisis. <br/><br/>Also when I saw Robert Englund's name in the credits in the earlier mini-series, I wondered if that was the same Robert Englund in Nightmare on Elm Street, released the same year???!!! It was!!! Willy was so different to Freddie big time, but that's a testament to Robert's incredible acting skills. I remember seeing an interview with Robert when he said that at an autograph session, many eager V fans turned up to meet him, and then a bunch of leather clad bike club type folks turned up and asked him to autograph their gear...they were Nightmare on Elm Street fans!!!<br/><br/>Ironically, Diana (Jane Badler, who was in the reboot of the Mission Impossible TV series) marries Charles - get it??!!!

71,V, A Good Start That Ran Out Of Ideas,"V: The Series was a very odd television show. First, The Final Battle ended and it was a very satisfying end to the 10 hour miniseries. We really didn't more to this story. However, this weekly series did actually made some interesting points to the ongoing story but it was soon abandoned as well as most of the originally cohesive cast.<br/><br/>The series starts out about a year later and we soon see that Diana and the fleet wants revenge over the red dust. As we soon find out, the dust loses its effect and really can't be used anymore, so the visitors patiently wait for the dusts effects to cease. This sets up many good episodes about the visitors regaining control. However, gone is the Nazi allegory and it therefore goes for power and corruption plots all the while the resistance is back to fight the Visitor's once again.<br/><br/>I found myself really enjoying many episodes. It was a little uneven at first but it began to pick up. Yes, it was filled with ""cheese"" (especially the first 2/3 of the seasons opening credits music) but it was often engrossing. The FREEDOM NETWORK added a sense of continuity to the show and it was a nice touch. The acting was solid, Diana was as nasty as ever and they took chances and killed off regulars and that added to the dramatic impact. The Nathan Bates subplots were actually interesting and you really began to hate Mr. Chang. Michael Ironside was also very fun to watch. And the ""soap opera"" of ""Charles and Diana"" was also very entertaining.<br/><br/>However, as it went on toward the last 1/3 of the season, the series started falling apart by the seams. While the series was starting to find its groove, they took too many chances and kind of dug themselves in a hole and they ran out of creative juices. The idea of the resistance always winning and episodes ending with showing Diana dejected began to run thin. And poor Willy. They just beat us over the head with his butchering of the English language and making him the buffoon which was a shame, because he was such a charming character and performed well. The special effects were reused over and over again. The campiness factor of eating rodents was way over done and all originality that they could have tried for just went away.<br/><br/>Then, when we get the new (and improved) credit sequence, the show pretty much became a chore to sit through. Gone are some of the better and well acted characters. And the plots became paper thin and were filled with ""filler"" scenes where you just feel they were making it up as they went along. Add in ""romantic flashback"" scenes, illogical situations, cheesy actors making guest appearances and you can see that because of the daring chances they took with the series at the first, they were left with pretty much nothing. The acting also suffered, especially Faye Grant, in which she gave very uneven performances toward the end, especially in the dreadful episode ""The Secret Underground"". That episode was the worst in the entire run. The show ended with the Episode ""The Return"" and it actually felt like it would redeem itself but by then, it was too late. There was no saving ""V.""<br/><br/>This DVD collection of V: The Series is no frills. They put episodes on both sides of the DVD, making this a 3 DVD collection. Box is nice looking with good shots of some of the cast but nothing extra comes with it. The picture and sound quality of this collection is about as good as you would expect from an early 80's show.<br/><br/>I had a good time with this series and it was fun to see how it played out up to the unresolved cliffhanger. If you are a V fan, this is still a must have.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,10 February 2013
72,V, excellent sci-fi series for those who don't like sci-fi,"When I first saw this series growing up in South Africa I was blown away and to be honest when I watched the series last year here I was still impressed even though in general I don't like sci-fi. Marc Singer and Michael Ironside as well as Jane Badler and Faye Grant all gave consistently good performances and I don't think they ever slipped up even though the script writers did go OTT sometimes. I felt and still feel the special effects to be good, though obviously not up to todays standards. For example the alien motherships, their fighter aircraft, the alien weaponry. One thing I wondered whilst watching it was where are the alien tanks? Surely they would need these so as to help human resistance in the cities and country. They just drove around in jeeps with a laser cannon on the back.<br/><br/>Another very interesting aspect was the World War 2 theme which ran strongly through it and the aliens were cast as sort of Nazi invaders. Look at the alien flag (it's like a swastika), look at the helmets and uniforms of the alien soldiers (a lot like German uniforms of WW2). There was also the issue of the 'V' symbol which was used in occupied Europe as an anti-Nazi symbol in the 40s. There were also human collaborators who helped the aliens and were reviled as in occupied Europe. The resistance of course were the central anti-alien force just as in France for example in 1940-44. It was all cleverly done, with a good atmosphere of an occupying army portrayed (there always seemed to be menacing alien patrols walking around in the background, etc., just like German troops in occupied Europe). There were also 'good' aliens like there were, dare I say it, 'good' Nazis (like Schindler) who tried to undermine a brutal regime. The fact that Badler played the sort of Himmler role (not the head honcho by any means) was strange also.....you'd have thought the writers would have made her an all powerful 'Hitler' figure.<br/><br/>The theme of survival was very important too in the series, the struggle was in a sense one of survival.....the human race would be eliminated if the aliens succeeded and so the resistance had to fight back. Similar to the Nazi era whereby the German people felt themselves to be threatened almost as a race and thus fight back, leading to destruction and tragedy. The aliens are also like this, they have come from a dying world and feel themselves to be in danger of being destroyed as a race and so attempt to eliminate the human enemy for their own ends. Very existentialist ideas indeed, reflecting on man's own nature of self-destruction and brutality.<br/><br/>The first part of the series I felt was also the best part, when the humans welcomed these seemingly human visitors from another planet....it was an intriguing period as the two 'races' intermingled and happiness and mutual cooperation gave rise to the inevitable mistrust and hatred. The later episodes did though I felt go awry. For example the creation of a cross-breed, Elizabeth, who had special magical powers, that just annoyed me quite quickly. What perhaps really would have happened if the two species 'mingled' would have been no cross-breed at all or perhaps one like the first 'ugly' alien that quickly died after Robin Maxwell gave birth. All in all though I thoroughly enjoyed the series and wish they would make a movie perhaps out of it or another series.....excellent stuff.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,,26 April 2001
73,V," ""The Wage Of Being Cheap Is A Rapid Cancellation""","This series, and that rotten, minus-Johnson travesty, _V: The Final Battle_ were two of the lousiest shows in science-fiction history.

74,V, Dont waste your time or money,"Let me start off by saying i loved the original miniseries and often watch it back on dvd. I recently thought id purchase the later series and the difference is both night and day! Firstly the budget is so poor they couldnt even afford the technology to change the aliens voices so what you have is everyone speaking in a clearly obvious human tone. If that wasnt bad enough then the poor acting and editing is gonna stick the knife in and twist it. Add to that the shoddy script and poorly executed plot and whats left is basically unwatchable!
If like me you saw the dvd was available and you read the glowing reviews let me warn you dont bother and keep your memories of the original intact.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,3.0,19 January 2020
75,The Big Valley, Best Western,"It's hard to believe that a mid-1960's western could be the favorite TV show of a preteen boy in the 1970's but it's true.  This was in reruns at 4:00pm daily and I could not WAIT to get home and see it.  My sister felt the same way.  I know, based on www pages out there, that I am not alone in my love for ""The Big Valley"", but I have to admit that it's a strange thing to be addicted to.  There's something about the camera-ready cast, the quality of the stories and guest stars, the majestic opening theme and background music in the episodes and the overall aura of ""The Barkleys"" that is just irresistible to me.  The series was just one of many, many TV westerns, but what sets this apart is the female slant and the striking use of color.  Was there ever a bluer shirt than Victoria Barkley's?  Hair more golden than Audra's?  Leather more black than Nick's?  Watching reruns of ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza"", they really look like dusty, brown, more authentic (especially with ""Gunsmoke"") presentations.  ""BV"" started out that way, but soon progressed into an almost surreal blend of authentic locales mixed with '60's styles and colors.  How else to describe Lee Majors' sideburns, the clean lines of the womens' riding gear or the ladies' false eyelashes?  But I wouldn't change any of it for the world.  The Barkleys' world is a world I'd want to live in.  Everything is beautiful and they stand for truth, justice and the American way!  They are defenders of right and will suffer to preserve integrity.  (Kinda like The Super Friends, but with less wacky costumes...)  The blend of types in the show is expert.  You have scholarly, level-headed Jarrod, tough, explosive Nick, sensitive, handsome Heath, thoughtful, gloriously beautiful Audra and stern, fair, in charge Victoria (...oh, and then some poor kid who was let go right off the bat and never heard from again.  That's the breaks, Eugene!)  Together, in any combination,  or separate, they are a captivating lot.  Certain images burn the memory......Victoria cocking her rifle and ordering outlaws away, her croaking Audra's name when the girl has stumbled into trouble, Heath anytime he removed his shirt, Nick raging through the front door, Audra's black riding hat with chin string sitting atop her mane of the most beautiful hair in Hollywood......  Some of the stories were rehashes of other previous works (including Stanwyck's own movies!  See ""Jeopardy"" some time!), but most of the time they were compelling and always they were filmed with skill and class.  This is one of the best TV shows ever made.",56 out of 56 found this helpful.,,11 July 2002
76,The Big Valley, Why The Big Valley means so much to me.,"I began watching The Big Valley back when I was seven years old. That was thirty years ago. Little did I know then that the show would become something that would help me. I went through years of abuse through two different family members. If it weren't for the show The Big Valley I probably would have committed suicide at an early age. Instead of turning to drug or alcohol abuse, or other forms of hurting myself, I focused instead on the cast of this amazing show. The affection and love they had for each other made a big impression on me. I longed to be part of a family that cared for each other like the Barkley's did. They became so real to me at times that it blocked out how bad I was feeling about what I was going through and it gave me something positive to focus on instead of the pain and shame of living with what was happening to me. I am grateful to the entire cast of the show for giving me a way out of a bad situation and focusing on something good, something that wouldn't hurt me or anyone else. They mean a great deal to me and always will. I hope that sometime I will get to see one of them with my own eyes. I don't have to meet them personally. Just to see them will be enough. The show gave me a feeling of peace just to watch. It always made me laugh at times when I really needed it, and thrilled me at other times. The men on the show were the best looking men I have seen on any show (then or since) and I've yet to see a television show that shows a family that cares the way that they did on The Big Valley. It gave me such joy to be able to come home and watch the show. Certain episodes stayed with me from the time I first started watching it. One in particular showed what a caring man Nick was. In the episode ""The Prize"" where Heath brings home little Joey. The scene where Nick is trying to get to sleep but can't because Joey is teething and very fussy I still remember to this day, even though I haven't seen the episode in over twenty-five years. When he referred to himself as ""Uncle Nick"" and Audra was watching from the doorway I thought was one of the best scenes in that series. Another episode was ""The Iron Box"" where Nick and Heath were arrested for cattle theft and put in a chain gang I thought was incredible acting by Peter and Lee. I have hoped for years that someday a Big Valley reunion will be filmed. I know that Barbara and Richard are gone, but I think it would be great to see Peter, Lee and Linda reunited in a Big Valley reunion. This series will always hold a special place to me. It's been a part of me for as long as I can remember and will always remain a big part of me.",66 out of 67 found this helpful.,,22 January 2005
77,The Big Valley, Boy Howdy!!,"I am really greatly relieved to read the previous reviews, knowing that I am not alone in being a huge fan of this great series!! There was just something about this show as a whole which really appealed to me - in a big way.  I loved all the Barkley characters. Victoria was played to perfection by Stanwyck. The widow Barkley was a curious but convincing mixture of gracious elegance and guts: her Victoria Barkley is practically a cult figure of female characters of the Western genre.  Richard Long was genuinely likeable as the level-headed eldest son, Jarrod, who provided a nice balance between the tough, egotistical Nick and the more sensitive half-brother Heath.  Linda Evans was astonishingly beautiful as Audra (she alone kept many male baby boomers tuned in!).  But there was so much else ""right"" with this show - artificial though it may have looked to those critical of Stanwyck being ""Ben Cartwright in a skirt"".  The storylines were well-written &amp; original and the shows were well-directed and well-acted. Most every episode was colourful, tasteful, upright &amp; moral - but rarely dull, somehow: there was a larger-than-life quality to the series which appealed to its particular fans: the colour is beautiful to look at, and the score by George Duning is beautiful to hear.  The series boasted many interesting  guest stars: Julie Harris, Cloris Leachman, Colleen Dewhurst among many others.  An embarrassing confession: as a kid, Heath Barkley was my sole hero: I thought Lee Major's playing of the half-breed illegitimate son of Tom Barkley was really inspired. Majors made Heath a really likeable character.  Although Majors did many more successful TV roles, it is for his playing of Heath Barkley that I most fondly identify him with to this day.",41 out of 42 found this helpful.,,12 February 2003
78,The Big Valley, 'What A Show'',"''The Big Valley''has been my favorite TV show for over thirty years. Although I had seen it from time to time when it was running in prime time, it was'nt until 1973, when it was shown locally, that I really got into it. Barbara Stanwyck was one of those rare golden age actresses who grew more beautiful with the passage of time. As Victoria Barkley, she was playing a woman close to her heart, and mine. Linda Evans, Richard Long, Peter Breck and Lee Majors were perfect support. And those guest stars! to name a few, Anne Baxter,Julie Adams, Coleen Dewhurst, Bradford Dillman,Susan Strasberg,James Whitmore, Julie Harris, Andrew Duggan, John Anderson, Jeanne Cooper, Diane Baker, James Gregory.....

79,The Big Valley, Charles Briles - Eugene Barkley,"Having worked at ABC and ""Saga of the Big Valley"" was one of 'our shows' we coordinated between production companies, advertising agencies &amp; network .. as I recall, Eugene's character was not brought back because  the story lines worked well with the characters who were always in it .. Peter, Breck, Linda Evans, Richard Long, Barbara Stanwyck, etc. .. there was so much to do with their characters that 'Eugene' was not needed and perhaps there was a contract problem as well . I do not really remember .. it was so long ago . most enjoyable show .. Usually, when you have many 'stars' in a series .. each is set to do X# out of total shows for the year .. back then we were doing a lot more than 22 shows a year as they do now and took less time to make them as well.. sometimes it comes down to money too .. but it also cost a lot less to film shows back then and 'stars' did not get anywhere near the money they make today ... thus less episodes and more commercials today!",32 out of 35 found this helpful.,,28 August 2002
80,The Big Valley, What did Eugene do?,"I read all the comments and no one answered the question. I don't remember him doing anything. He just went off to college and never came back. Didn't the actor get drafted? I think someone mentioned that. The Big Valley was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. For me it was Barbara Stanwick, the strong woman and Lee Majors, the odd one out that brought me back. Heath and I had a lot in common and I wanted to grow up to be all that Barbara's character represented, strong, confident, admired and rich didn't hurt. I think I grew up with the characters on TV for my role models sense I found the adults in my world so sadly lacking. If she were alive today I would like to thank her for the strong woman she portrayed. In that time of of upheaval, when a woman's role was changing she showed me a woman could be strong and smart and still have a family to love and nurture. Thank you for Victoria, Jared, Nick and Heath. Thank you for the beautiful innocent Audra, and thank you for the forgotten Eugene. Thank you for Big Valley",16 out of 17 found this helpful.,,9 January 2005
81,The Big Valley, Barbara Stanwyck's Own Western,"I just read a biography of Barbara Stanwyck and one thing that was made abundantly clear, the woman really liked westerns. She loved doing them from the earliest time in her career right up to her stint with The Big Valley. In fact one of the great disappointments in her life was not doing a film with John Wayne. Who knows why that didn't happen because the two of them were in sync politically.<br/><br/>But she did a bunch of them with co-stars like Joel McCrea, Ronald Reagan, Walter Huston, Barry Sullivan, Ray Milland, etc. So when it came time to choose a television project, Barbara went west.<br/><br/>The Big Valley cast her as Victoria Barkley, matriarch of the Barkley ranch with three sons and a daughter to hold the fort against all comers. The pilot of the show introduced her husband's illegitimate son into the household played by young Lee Majors. Her children were Richard Long, Peter Breck, Linda Evans, and Charles Briles.<br/><br/>Briles got dropped after eight episodes as the youngest, Eugene. They just sent him off to college in the east and he wasn't heard from again. Reading the IMDb notes on him, I find he got himself drafted. All I can say is BUMMER.<br/><br/>Richard Long as Jarrod was also college educated, an attorney, which was a good plot device allowing the show to get off the ranch and into town. Peter Breck was Nick, who was a tough son of a gun. I met Peter Breck a few years before The Big Valley. His family lived in Rochester, New York across from my grandparents house and he was visiting while starring in another shortlived series Black Saddle. My siblings and cousins got to meet him then. A very gracious and nice man.<br/><br/>Of course Linda Evans and Lee Majors both had really great careers after the show. Linda as Audra was a sweet and innocent child, not anything like Crystal Carrington. And Lee Majors got to be The Fall Guy and The Six Million Dollar Man after he was Heath Barkley. I would love to have that man's residuals.<br/><br/>Richard Long did Nanny and the Professor and tragically died right after the run of that show. He was always a player of great class and I enjoyed seeing him in anything he did.<br/><br/>The Barkleys ran into all manner of people and were constantly helping them out of their various predicaments. They were pretty rich of course, as rich as Bonanza's Cartwrights. But I really think they outdid themselves even more than Ben and his sons. Every episode seemed to end with some financial assistance to help somebody get on their feet. I'm surprised Jarrod didn't run for office with all those potential voters available.<br/><br/>With Lee Majors, Linda Evans, and Peter Breck still with us and even Charles Briles, I'm not sure why a Big Valley reunion hasn't been attempted. I'd like to see the Barkleys ride the range into the 20th century.",23 out of 26 found this helpful.,8.0,27 August 2006
82,The Big Valley, Fascinating series!,"I was not a big fan of Westerns, but this one really stands out.  I liked it back in the 1970s, and then again lately with its run on the Hallmark Channel.<br/><br/>If this show was not an authentic Western, who cares?  The show had enough chutzpah and special qualities to make it so likeable.  One episode, ""Miranda,"" which aired 15 January 1968, had one scene that made me take notice.  The title character, a Mexican revolutionary played by Barbara Luna, asked Napoleon Whiting, who played the African-American servant Silas, if slavery had been outlawed.  The exchange between those two characters was a sort of icebreak, because of the stereotypical roles African-Americans had played in the movies and television for so long.  At last, this concept is being questioned!  This is the same year that ""Julia"" (1968) debuted.<br/><br/>The cast is fun.  I liked Barbara Stanwyck, and I remember seeing Richard Long in 1970's ""Nanny and the Professor.""  He is definitely missed.  Peter Breck is also great, and I also like seeing Lee Majors in this role instead of ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""  It is too bad that the series lasted only four years.

I also loved their house and have often wondered where it's located, what it was originally used for and if it's still standing today.<br/><br/>I liked the cast and the fact that most of them were in most episodes, although Audra seems to be missing from many episodes near the second half of the last season.

88,The Big Valley, I loved this show,"I really loved The Big Valley when I was growing up. I admired Victoria Barkley's spunk and strength, and over the years I had crushes on each of the Barkley brothers, finally settling on Nick (Peter Breck). Some of the plot lines were formulaic and laughable - you always knew that anyone that any of the ""kids"" fell in love with was either going to die tragically or end up being a con artist.<br/><br/>Probably the best ever episode, in my opinion, was the one where Victoria was declared insane and placed in an asylum - getting her out of the way so that some nefarious plot line could advance. Barbara Stanwyck did an excellent job of playing a frantic, hysterical woman who is sane - but who is so frantic and hysterical that even someone well-intended might wonder about her sanity.<br/><br/>Lee Majors as Heath Barkley really grew in the role - starting out as the bastard son of Victoria's deceased husband, but becoming an accepted member of the Barkley clan.<br/><br/>But Peter Breck was the best of the actors portraying Victoria's younger son, Nick.

92,The Big Valley, The Big Valley,This was a wonderful show that had an all star cast. The writing and directing were also well done and that made the show a western classic. Barbara Stanwyck was perfect as the head of the Barkley family. She was petite but she could be mean when she had to be. Richard Long was her oldest son Jarrod. He was an attorney as well as being more citified. You could see that he didn't care that much for the day to day workings of the ranch. Peter Breck was her younger son Nick. He could brawl with the best of them. He and Jarrod could argue and never stop but if something happened to one of them the other one knew it. Lee Majors was Tom's son. He made the show interesting in exploring unfaithfulness in a television show. Linda Evans was her daughter Audra. She didn't seem to have very good luck with men. Charles Briles was the baby Eugene.

93,The Big Valley, The Big Valley was a major part of my life!,"My husband recently gave me the 1st season on DVD for my 50th birthday present. What a surprise and a treasure! I grew up on a small farm in Pennsylvania and The Big Valley came into my life around my 9th birthday. It never left me! I always loved horses but loving the show opened up a wholesome, healthy world of pretend and play. Our big old barn was transformed (in my mind) into the gorgeous Barkley home, and I usually played Nick on Coco. When I look back to how much time I spent playing with my horses, and bringing my friends and siblings into my Barkley world, I'm so thankful. I remember creating new story lines and acting them out. I often recruited other kids to be the rest of the Barkleys, and also Fred the Sheriff, Silas, and other neighbors. Those who wouldn't ride were usually Audra and Victoria. When some kids went on to become interested in not-so-safe ventures, I began writing screenplays and stories, some of which I used as reports for English Comp. class in High School. I have so many good memories of this wonderful show. I believe my own kids watch it out of kindness to me, but I know the underlying moral issues of the stories may take root in their minds too and someday they will appreciate it too. How thankful I am to everyone responsible for bringing this wonderful piece of my personal history to life, and a special thanks to Victoria, Jarod, Nick, Heath, and Audra.

98,The Big Valley, A Step Forward In The 60's Western Genre,"Are there spoilers in here? Perhaps, I guess, though I'll try to keep them small. . . . With the decade of the sixties awash in westerns of virtually every stripe, it was easy to find the good, the bad and the ugly, as well as the overrated ones like Gunsmoke and Bonanza/Ponderosa. This entry into the genre was more daring and original than most. Set in the era immediately following the American Civil War, it featured a matriarch instead of a patriarch and a lead character that was illegitimate, which back when this show aired was a big deal. The Big Valley started out with so much promise; it was well-cast, well-acted and well-directed. Though it lacked the authenticity of the later series The High Chaparral, this show had heart.<br/><br/>Barbara Stanwyck lit up the screen as Victoria Barkley, the clan's motherly leader. She was a starchy actress wearing her role like a second skin and was convincing as a woman who could be both feminine and tough as nails. Eldest son Jarrod, the calm and suave lawyer, was wonderfully portrayed by Richard Long. The thankless role of hotheaded middle son Nick went to Peter Breck, who handled it well and made the flawed character likable. The third and most sensitive son, the bastard Heath, was acted by the normally wooden Lee Majors, who actually managed to convey some real feelings. Beautiful and high-strung daughter Audra was played perfectly by young and lovely Linda Evans. (The actor playing the youngest son Eugene vanished after only one season---turns out he was drafted, too bad.) With a great cast, good music(especially the theme song), solid direction and production, all that remained to keep The Big Valley great was the writing. At first fine, the scripts began to decline in quality, becoming too formulaic. Victoria soon became more of a prop than a person, what with her constantly being kidnapped or vanishing somehow. Audra's spirited character was watered down to wimpish, as if a girl couldn't be both pretty and strong. Nick and Heath's initial friction wore down too fast and too soon. It would've been nice to see a more gradual growth in their relationship from strained to brotherly, since their early clashes provided the conflict needed for good drama. Jarrod remained generally unchanged and didn't seem to grow much as a character. The youngest boy Eugene left without much fanfare, regret or explanation, which was a pity, because he was good for the show and perhaps deserved a better send-off.<br/><br/>The stories' decline was gradual and there were some good episodes that dealt with racial issues, mental illness, the trauma and horror of war, and day-to-day problems of living in the only partly settled American West. Many fine guest stars abounded, such as Barabra Luna, Marty Allen and Martin Landau, though the regular cast was strong enough to carry the show without much outside help. Unfortunately, the writing's weakness was The Big Valley's Achilles' heel. Even when handled by such a solidly professional cast, the scripts were becoming increasingly lame and the great feeling of angst that had been part of the original show evaporated. Still, decline aside, this program remains one of my favorite Westerns in rerun land. Though not as strongly crafted or consistently good as its later cousin The High Chaparral, The Big Valley was superior to Bonanza/Ponderosa and had far more energy than that venerable dinosaur Gunsmoke. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give this show a seven.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,3 February 2006

100,Samurai Champloo, Hip-hop stir-fry samurai action..,"Samurai Champloo is the long-awaited next project from Cowboy Bebop director Shinichiro Watanabe. His two short films in the Animatrix compilation (Kid's Story and Detective Story) give American audiences a sneak peek at the phenomenal art style of this series, but they barely hint at the jaw-dropping action and unorthodox blend of history and music contained therein. <br/><br/>The similarities with Bebop end at the fact that the series has three protagonists: the vagrant swordsman Mugen, the rogue samurai Jin, and the tea-shop waitress Fuu. This unlikely and volatile trio begin a road journey through post-shogunate Japan (ca. 1780), brought together by circumstances best seen to be believed. <br/><br/>""Champloo"" means mixed-up or stir-fry, and that's what this series is: a stylish blend of old school values and situations, meshed with more modern sensibilities, fighting styles, and visual design. Over the lush, dynamic art, a soundtrack of some of the best hip-hop from modern Japan plays. Though it's a noticeable device in the first few episodes, it doesn't take long before the music feels like second nature despite the anachronism.<br/><br/>Champloo is many things: a mature drama, an action series, an uproariously funny comedy and a visual feast. Watanabe-san demonstrates here that the success of Cowboy Bebop was uniquely his, and no fluke - fans of that series will not be disappointed, despite how radically different the two story lines are from one another. <br/><br/>As the title card of the first episode of Samurai Champloo says, ""Just shut up and watch.""",89 out of 91 found this helpful.,,7 October 2004
101,Samurai Champloo," Lightning I don't know about, but genius sure can strike twice.","Let me begin by saying I am a huge Cowboy Bebop fan. Spike Spiegel is my hero, okay? So as much as I was dying to see this new work from the mind of Shinichiro Watanabe, I was apprehensive from the standpoint that I didn't want to see any subsequent work destroy any luster or afterglow that Bebop left behind in its wake. I was downright scared, I mean, how can you mix samurai action with hip-hop? I know Bebop's atmosphere of 1940's noir and 2071 spaceships didn't seem possible at first, but I was proved wrong by that. Maybe Watanabe-san had stepped too far outside the box this time.<br/><br/>I'll just come right out and say it: Shinichiro Watanabe can make anything he dreams up work. ANYTHING.<br/><br/>Samurai Champloo is one of the absolute coolest series I have ever seen. And by ever I mean live-action, animated, whatever. ""Ever"" ever. If you like anime, this is required watching, a new classic for the medium. If you don't like anime, watch this and you just might start to.<br/><br/>The story centers around two rogue samurai and the girl they're somewhat assigned to protect. Fuu, the young damsel who always seems to get in and out of distress; Jin, the serious samurai, and Mugen, the samurai who's seriously un-serious. The three travel around Edo-period Japan in search of the mysterious ""Sunflower Samurai"". And if I told you any more than that, I'd ruin so much of it for you. Just know this - the first episode will hook you like Tyrone Biggums to crack.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of anime or Cowboy Bebop or just really bad-ass shows/movies in general, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. You can pick up the DVDs or just check it out Saturday nights on Adult Swim.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you watch Adult Swim regularly and haven't caught Samurai Champloo yet, shame on you.

102,Samurai Champloo, Absolute Anime Brilliance!,"I was at Best Buy one time checking out the anime section, there I found Samurai Champloo for sale. I am a big fan of samurai anime so I took a look at it. Two things made me want to buy it: the dream team of director Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop &amp; The Animatrix), designers Kazuto Nakazawa (Kill Bill Vol. 1: Chapter 3: The Origin of O-Ren), and Mahiro Maeda (Last Exile &amp; Blue Submarine No. 6), and an awesome, hard-hitting hip hop soundtrack! There aren't many animes that have rap soundtracks, so I had to check this out. Samurai Champloo is one of the best new animes. Brilliant animation, memorable characters, laid-back kinetic atmosphere, great music, and kick-ass Hong Kong, Akira Kurosawa style fight sequences. The story revolves around two highly skilled ronins and a girl: Mugen, a violent, buck wild swordsman whose style emphasizes one hand kendo and Capoeira. Jin, a mysterious, calm gentleman swordsman that masters traditional, straight-forward Japanese Swordsmanship. And Fuu, a young, beautiful ditzy waitress. After Fuu saves them from being executed, Mugen and Jin agree to temporarily set aside their differences and help her in her quest to find the ""samurai who smells of sunflowers. Jin and Mugen are the perfect examples of the yin-yang concept. These unstoppable, independent warriors are complete opposites, but their skills are equal to each other. Fuu plays a perfect mediator between the two. This series has strong ties to Watanabe's previous classic, Cowboy Bebop: same style action and atmosphere, but with a hip-hop soundtrack instead of Jazz. And Mugen, Jin, and Fuu could be compared to Spike, Jet, and Faye. But what makes this series original is the hybrid combination of a feudal Japan setting and philosophy with modern fighting, urban street flavor personality, and off-beat comedy, hence the title ""Champloo"", meaning stir-fry. The verbal exchanges between the three heroes are amusing and great to watch. They series also utilize rap DJ record style scratching to switch between scenes perfectly. Overall, Samurai Champloo is an anime bond to be a classic, and raises the level for anime. If you are a major anime fan, check this out, it will be an excellent addition to a collection.<br/><br/>***** (5 stars) Ryojin20 favorite!",77 out of 80 found this helpful.,,15 March 2005
103,Samurai Champloo, Kickass anime neoclassic,"With 1998's ""Cowboy Bebop"", one of the most acclaimed anime TV series ever (go read the comments index for it here on IMDb if you don't believe me!), Shinichiro Watanabe became a creative force to watch out for. The innovative energy, drama and beauty of ""Bebop"" are carried forward in his second original series, ""Samurai Champloo"". Fans have been quick to look for similarities between ""Bebop"" and ""Champloo"" (even the titles have clear parallels), and it's true there are some: the assembly-of-rootless-loners cast of characters, the dramatic and cinematic visual style, and especially the importance and integration of music into the storytelling mix--in SC's case, everything from hip-hop beatboxing to Ainu and Okinawan folksong. But ""Champloo""'s differences from ""Bebop"" are much more interesting than its likenesses. ""Bebop"" is drenched in melancholy and regret, dreams of the lost past and the future that couldn't be. ""Champloo"" is all about facing the future, the wave of change, the onrush of history that can't be stopped, and how three kids from widely diverse backgrounds--not even friends when they set out-- find themselves right on the crest of that wave. We're in Edo Period Japan; since 1638 the Tokugawa Shogunate has banned contact with all countries except China and Japan, a ban that lasted two centuries. The outside world can't be kept outside forever. Even the long-respected samurai class is losing its power, and there's restlessness in the land plus accompanying pressure from the Shogunate on all sides. Through this uneasy landscape (rendered in lushly beautiful watercolors that might remind you of Miyazaki) wander our cast of characters: outlaw ronin Jin, a gifted swordsman, stoic, disciplined and heartbreakingly gorgeous, devoted to the bushido code but exiled for killing his sensei; Okinawan wild-boy Mugen, orphan, former pirate and brilliant innovator, whose fighting style mixes everything from Brazilian capoeira to break-dancing, and whose feral-child innocence faces the toughest tests in the series; and teahouse waitress Fuu, spunky, compassionate and packing a lot of secrets, who rescues the two swordsmen from the executioner's block and enlists them on her quest to avenge her mother's death. On their long walk from Edo to Nagasaki they'll see a lot, face a lot of trials, starve, quarrel, save each other's lives, break up, re-bond, and become inseparable. Except that Jin and Mugen still swear they'll fight to the death one day, and no one (not even Fuu) is saying anything about the Sunflower Samurai, the object of Fuu's quest.<br/><br/>Have I made this sound like a straight historical drama? I ought to mention that it can be hysterically funny as well as vividly bloody, contains knockout fight scenes and anachronisms by the carload (the aforementioned break dancing and beatboxing, Jin's Armani glasses, the appearance of landmarks not built till the 1900s...), has made me cry more times than any anime since ""Bebop"", and has sharp things to say about the heavy hand of authority and tradition on groups as diverse as gay men, married women, foreigners, aboriginal natives and illegal aliens. It's unfailingly beautiful to look at (well, 95% unfailingly) and listen to, delectably well-written, and simply brilliant. When it gets to America, go find it.",88 out of 96 found this helpful.,,20 October 2004
104,Samurai Champloo, Excellent Anime,"Mugen is a fairly dim, self-taught swordsman who doesn't know how to hold back, Jin is the perfect samurai: cold, calculating, every move flawless. They could be no more different, and in fact one would gladly kill the other with the chance, but they are both reluctantly recruited by the ditsy teahouse waitress Fuu after she saves them from execution.<br/><br/>Samurai champloo is the story of Mugen, Jin and Fuu, as they journey across Japan trying to find ""The samurai who smells of sunflowers."" All the way they meet all sorts of people, get into trouble, and try to make money. As the show progresses, the mysteries of the characters pasts are slowly revealed.<br/><br/>Samurai champloo is an excellent series from the people who made Cowboy Bebop, the animated sequence in Kill Bill, and a few sequences in the Animatrix. The music is good, offering a wide variety of genres, the animation is excellent, and the dialog is kept to a bare minimum. Oh, and the comedy is great, too.<br/><br/>If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you will probably like Samurai Champloo. One's set in the future and has a lot of jazz music, the other's set long ago in Japan and has a lot of rap in the scene transitions. But the character types in both are pretty much the same, and in both the characters must come to terms with themselves.

106,Samurai Champloo," Watanabe You Bastard, You've Done It Again!","The story is about Jin a traditional very skilled samurai, Mugen a innovative equally skilled samurai, and Fuu a girl who worked at a tea house. When Jin and Mugen get caught and are about to be executed, Fuu saves their lives and in return she makes them promise to help her find the Samurai Who Smells Like Sunflowers. It may sound stupid but trust me its not.<br/><br/>The animation. The animation on this show is Bebop quality. The animation is just incredible. The fight scenes are kick ass, beautiful and often times bloody. The backgrounds are very lush and detailed. You will be amazed and how good everything looks.<br/><br/>Now on to the best part, the music. When I first heard about Samurai Champloo the first thing that came to mind was ""Well its made by the same dude that did Cowboy Bebop so its got to be good."" ,the next thing was ""Well what does a Japanese man know about hip hop?"". Even though I'm still wondering about the second question, it doesn't matter because all the music works great. Just like with Bebop the series wouldn't be half as good if it didn't have the great music that it does. The opening theme song to Samurai Champloo is a ""rap"" song. I put rap in quotation because none of the lyrics rhyme so its not a true rap song, but its still great.<br/><br/>Bottom line. If you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop you have to see this. In fact if your a anime fan at all you need to see this. This will go down in history as one of the greats along with Cowboy Bebop.",46 out of 54 found this helpful.,,22 October 2004
107,Samurai Champloo, incredible animation and hilarious/serious story,"first of all, you have to understand that samurai champloo was done by Shinchiro Watanabe, creator of Cowboy Bebop. <br/><br/>now that it's outta of the way, u can obviously tell this show will have hip-hop fusion along with great animation. Watanabe has done it again. This time, he heads toward the samurai-era with 3 wonderful characters. Jin(the passive, quiet, stern and traditional samurai master), Mugen (the hyperactive(jumps a lot), violent, and agile criminal/samurai), and Fuu(the calculating, crafty, and often persistent girl). Fuu saves Jin and Mugen's life and as a debt, they have to help her find a ""samurai who smells like sunflower"". it may sound average but believe me, this show is extraordinary. the fights are animated so fluidly(Kill-Bill-animation), the story is funny a s hell, and the music is ""interesting""(rap opening).

108,Samurai Champloo, masterpiece,"""Samurai Champloo"" is perhaps one of the best shows in the animé genre that I've ever seen. It is the masterpiece born from the artistic mind of Shinichirô Watanabe (famous for his work in ""Cowboy Beepbop""), Kazuto Nakazawa, and Mahiro Maeda.<br/><br/>Set in Japan's Samurai Era (1200's-1800's), this show tells the tale of three people: Jin, Mugen, and Fuu. Jin is a ronin (wandering samurai). Calm, cool, and skilled in the art of the sword. Mugen is hot-tempered and has a short temper, the exact opposite of Jin. When these two warriors are nearly executed, they are saved by a tea shop waitress named Fuu. In return for her help, the two warriors promise to help her find ""the samurai with the smell of sunflowers."" The two agree with Fuu, and they go on this journey, beginning an exciting adventure as well as long and fateful friendship.<br/><br/>""Samurai Camploo"" is one of the best animations taking place in Japan of olden times, not to mention among the best in its genre. The animation is gorgeous. The lightning and shading is mesmerizing. Also, the painted backgrounds are lush and draws the viewer in. Watanabe really shows his skill as an animator in this one. The animation is one of the best features in this show. It has one of the best stylizations in anime. The atmosphere rocks.<br/><br/>The story lines, too, are great. Set in feudal Japan, this show does a great job of showing the life and times of ronin samurai at that time. From the the peasants, to the prostitutes, to the gangsters, to just about everyone, this show has a graphic depiction of Japan during its Samurai Era, when the warrior was the dominant force in everyone's lives. The show even goes to show what type of clothes they wore, what houses they lived in, and what food they all -- all accurately. Only the Japanese know how to portray their history graphically.<br/><br/>Speaking of graphic, this show in realistic in terms of real. It includes some profanity (although minor) and goes deep into the underground world of the brothels. In Japan, animation is for everyone, not just kids, and this show in very mature. Its story lines are very complicated. Its issues are deep and meaningful. At times, some episodes are dark, even showing death scenes and bloodshed, but this is exactly what makes this show cool.<br/><br/>Now, the soundtrack. ""Samurai Champloo"" features a hip hop and RnB soundtrack and incorporates some traditional songs. What makes ""Champloo"" so unique in anime is that it combines the modern with the olden, and this is why the show is cool. The hip hop beats in this period piece are nice to listen to and blends in with the Fuedal Japan setting. The word ""Champloo"" means mix, and this anime mixes the modern with the olden, from Jin having glasses, to the language of the characters; the people here (in the English version) speak in modern American slang and vernacular. And rather than downplaying the ancient feel of this show, this show still retains its olden times aspects.<br/><br/>""Samurai Champloo"" is a must-see for all fans of this genre and animation in general.",25 out of 28 found this helpful.,,12 October 2005

112,Samurai Champloo," A great story, but the ending feels off.","A great story, but the ending feels off.<br/><br/>Firstly, I am not a Cowboy Bebop fan... but this does put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Samurai Champloo is a good anime. From the very start, characters and the story are well defined, and the idea of mixing 19-century samurais with hip-hop culture is rather well executed. The dynamic between Jin, Mugen and Fuu is very interesting and funny to watch, with the two swordsmen constantly being each other's opposite. The development of the story is quite fascinating: the main goal is always to find the Sunflower Samurai; however, everything that happens to the trio on the way is a result of them trying to find some food and get some rest. Some of the plotlines felt too real, as the matter of a fact, and the themes of violence, slave trade, gambling and promiscuity definitely provide the show with an appropriately dark undertone.<br/><br/>On the-not-so-bright side of things, the last few episodes could have been done better. The show is all great and realistic up to the twentieth episode when I-do-not-know-what happens; and the baseball filler kinda ruins the tension we are supposed to get at the climax of the story. The character development is also a bit lacking; we know what Jin and Mugen are like from the very start, but little do we get to know them throughout the whole series. Also, how many cuts and bullets can one samurai take before they die? No spoilers here, but that question ruins the ending for me personally.<br/><br/>All in all, give it a go - if not for the story in general, then for an entertaining and realistic way the 19-century Japan is presented.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,7.0,26 July 2019

And I was not disappointed in the least! The artwork: stylish, lavish, colorful, detailed, and beautiful! As in Cowboy Bebop, this show isn't full of hot-bodied women with ridiculously childish features, cut-and-paste still frame fight scene accentuated with speed lines as in Yuyu Hakusho (I still love that show, however); it had a very realistic, emphatic feel about it. Another poster commented on the well-done fight scenes, and I wholeheartedly agree! As a participant in kendo and iaido classes, I recognized that almost every move in the fights were accurate and practical, true to real sword fighting.<br/><br/>Characters: every single character was original, endearing! They each had their funny little quirks, their own personal issues that really makes you empathize with the characters. The voice acting is superb, both in English and Japanese.<br/><br/>Overall: I love the way Samurai Champloo employs modern day hip-hop beats and certain personalities, entwining them with a feudal era Japan.

On the way they get in a lot of weird situations everything from to playing baseball to pay for a restaurant bill and fighting villains. I also like the way the series use things from hip hop such as Tagging, beat boxing and rapping. I think this is the best mixing of hip hop and samurai stuff since the underrated film Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai. I think this series is much better than shows like Naruto and Inu Yasha, the reason that I like Champloo better is that it doesn't go on forever and it is something that ends and the characters got more feelings in Champloo and the show is not that childish, but don't get me wrong I love this types of anime to, but Champloo is so darn stylish and I have not seen any anime series this awesome.

115,Samurai Champloo, Anime with a Different Beat,"Most people come into Samurai Champloo thinking it's going to be another Cowboy Bebop-esquire anime. But while it has many similar elements, the story line, character direction and over-all feel of the show are completely different from that of Shinichiro Watanabe's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Samurai Champloo, despite its few serious tones, is fairly light-hearted and very comical. We follow Mugen, Jin and Fuu from Edo to Nagasaki, encountering several prominent figures not only from the Feudal Era of Japan, but also popular Japanese television (Episode 8, for instance). Unlike Cowboy Bebop, the show centers around the three main characters rather equally, and the episodes do not dwell so much on their individual histories so much as their progress.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most stunning element of the series is their sometimes subtle and sometimes not so subtle incorporation of hip hop culture into the music and themes of each episode. From Mugen's break-dancing style of fighting to beat-boxing heralds to old-school tagging, it's not only comical but engaging to see something so culturally diverse blend seamlessly (and very, very humorously) with the Edo Period.<br/><br/>All in all, the series is very enjoyable, kind of a joyride or breath of fresh air in its uniqueness and ingenuity. The characters are fun and energetic, the music...well, don't even get me started on the music, and the animation, like its cousin, is flawless. Highly recommended on this end.

117,Samurai Champloo," enjoyable, but i don't get why everyone is praising it so much","i don't see where all this ""best anime ever""-style praise comes from. to be sure, ""samurai champloo"" is an enjoyable piece of lightweight entertainment, but its also seriously flawed.<br/><br/>the good thing about the series is, of course, the animation, which is just gorgeous. especially the fight scenes are flawless and its worth watching the series for those alone. the character designs are quite cool too, with sexy mugen stealing the show. the sets and backgrounds are beautiful, too. the show is one amazing eye-candy.<br/><br/>but the story is rather weak and slow. every episode has a little adventure or mystery which is enough to carry the episode itself, but those little adventures never have anything to do with the overall plot. and said overall plot, the search for the samurai who smells of sunflowers, is not only rather boring, but doesn't seem to progress at all. therefore, there is no suspense or momentum, no sign that the series is headed anywhere.<br/><br/>so, is ""samurai champloo"" worth watching? it sure is - its pretty and its fun. but i don't think its the masterpiece everyone seems to have seen.",18 out of 33 found this helpful.,6.0,2 September 2006
118,Samurai Champloo, Amazing anime with wild fights and awesome story.,"""Samurai Champloo"" may not have the same ring to it as ""Cowboy Bebop,"" yet it is a title that has a similar function: to illustrate a combination of multicultural pulp fiction sensibility. Where Cowboy Bebop was a past + future fusion of jazz, rock, and blues, spaghetti western, kung fu, and noir cinema genres, and a setting equating outer space to the great frontier, Samurai Champloo is a more wildly anachronistic mélange of Edo-period history and contemporary hip-hop and bohemian culture. ""Champloo"" itself comes from the word ""chanpurū,"" Okinawan for ""something mixed,"" and a source of Okinawa's pride in multicultural acceptance. Cowboy Bebop was a trend-setting marriage of anime traditions and Tarantino- inspired cultural hodgepodge — it could be said that Pulp Fiction influenced Cowboy Bebop as much as Cowboy Bebop influenced Kill Bill — and Samurai Champloo continues in this meta style, taking it even further.<br/><br/>Of course, Cowboy Bebop was not Shinichiro Watanabe's first foray into resonant crossover in anime: Macross Plus was a monolithic amalgamation of Top Gun's hot-headed romantic drama and sci-fi tropes including a pop-idol hologram version of 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL, in turn influencing the famous cyberpunk writer William Gibson to write Idoru, a novel about a Japanese virtual idol and her marriage to a real- life rock star. Of course, all of this was before the invention of the Vocaloid, though I suppose the future imagined by Watanabe and Gibson was, in a way, not so far off.<br/><br/>Anyhow, now that I've finished my little history lesson — which I feel is relevant, as having such a perspective may deepen your enjoyment of Samurai Champloo as much as it did for me — let's continue on to the review. In light of all the prescient futurism found in Watanabe's other works, it's rather interesting that he decided to shift his focus to the past and present. Of course, the world's future is always in its past... and what we have here is, in a nutshell, Edo-period Japan: the remix. Baseball, tagging/graffiti, Van Gogh, zombies, and Catholicism are tossed into the ""chanpurū"" with a whole lot of revised Japanese pseudo-history. As such the medley of influences and tangential tale-spinning occasionally smacks of filler, but one would do well to understand that this show is simply all /about/ the filler — and this is all for the better, because Samurai Champloo is at its freshest and most hilarious when it's veering off the rails. It even has the single most entertaining recap episode I've ever seen. Even with all this episodic improv, Fuu's journey in search of a ""samurai who smells like sunflowers"" provides a compelling core to the story, much like a steady hip-hop beat giving structure to the mix of samples and freestyle verses. Her ronin traveling companions Mugen and Jin mingle like oil and water, and there we have the perfect cast for hilarity and drama.<br/><br/>Samurai Champloo is one good-looking show, with its thick linework giving an impression of manga blended with graffiti style. One episode even takes a quick trip into the psychedelic, with a sudden burst of colorful hallucination, Mind Game style — courtesy of episode key animator Masaaki Yuasa, of course. A wide variety of such notable animators were brought on board and thus the style occasionally varies slightly from episode to episode or even scene to scene, but it's always pleasing and completely in tune with the show's theme. Rural Japan has never looked so urban; almost any given scene in Samurai Champloo would be right at home spray-painted on the side of a city building or underpass.<br/><br/>The music, likewise, blends hip-hop, rhythm &amp; blues, and traditional Japanese shamisen. Music often plays second fiddle to the look and quality of the animation when it comes to my enjoyment of anime, but in some cases it becomes just as important. This is one such anime, where the music contributes so greatly to the feel of it that it defines it and sets it apart from other anime — much like the soundtrack by Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did for Cowboy Bebop. It's also worth mentioning that rap and beatboxing sometimes enter the dialogue, and it's always amusing. Admittedly, most younger people these days are far more familiar with hip-hop than they are with the jazz, blues, and big band genres; nonetheless, in the realm of anime this feels a bit groundbreaking, especially with the theme songs featuring Japanese rap lyrics. The world is getting bigger and smaller every day.<br/><br/>Samurai Champloo is a show for everyone. Plenty of great sword- slashing action, clever comedy, and a good share of moments that will tug at your heartstrings — often all at once. If you enjoy anime, this is one you can't miss. show less",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,8 April 2015
119,Samurai Champloo, A True Classic,"I'm not really drawn in by many animes, they all seem (no offense, anime lovers) a bit nerdy, however i really liked Cowboy Bebop and Hellsing. Life after Shinichiro Watanabe after Cowbow Bebop? Samurai Champloo. Samurai Champloo follows the distraught, weird and sometimes tragic lives of Mugen, Jin and Fuu. What instantly makes you take a liking to these characters is their styles, Mugen , the crazy, dirt-mouthed warrior, Jin the master samurai and Fuu, the annoying girl. The series is full of twists and turns as Fuu struggles to find a samurai who smells of sunflower and Mugen and Jin's blurry past, which is slowly revealed throughout the series, which brings me to another plus; the story. I found this story to be one of the most progressive stories ever, keeping you on your toes and revealing a little bit about the character every episode.<br/><br/>The animation style is great, it's got violence, humor and a nice hip hop soundtrack to go along with it. A must for all (except the kids)!",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,15 November 2007

Jin is a disciplined and meditative character while his counter part Mugen is a reckless, wild, bastion who wields his sword and tongue like a hurricane wind. Fuu and the two samurai are on a path to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, the series follows their journey. <br/><br/>The artistry of the show is incredible, and as a full time artist (www.ecstaticexpression.org) I was drawn in and kept looking forward to watching the episodes.

121,Samurai Champloo, For connaisseurs of anime mainly ... but still a major accomplishment,"First some disclaimers. I came to anime late in life, not completely understanding the power of this art form in the right hands. I have since compensated for this untoward behaviour by watching about 50 of the genre, both full length and series, sequentially, in a very short period of time. Like, days. I am currently not sure what year it is, or what country I am living in, but I know for a fact that anime is no less an art form than the stuff you stand in line for at the museums. Second disclaimer, after watching this series, I made a beeline for Cowboy Beebop -- oops sorry for the pun -- but could not get past the first in the series. (This may or may not lend credibility to the other IMDb reviewers who maintain the two series are as different as they are similar?) Disclaimers aside, this is a wonderful treat, fun, action-packed, great music, fascinating themes, and a lot hidden irony (and other treats) buried deep in the dialog for those with very sharp ears. The characters, who form a brilliant ensemble cast, are as good anything in mainstream media. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE English AUDIO. The hip-hop sub-theme is fun, never too distracting. Highly recommended. FOOTNOTES: After watching a highly concentrated mix of Japanese and American anime, my conclusion is that the Japanese product is better crafted to an entirely higher order of magnitude. My favorite so far is APPLESEED, which, no coincidence, had, I believe, the strongest story line and script to support the wonderful animation. My criticism of Japanese anime generally is that the stories tend to be considerably weaker than the animation, leaving the viewer with an ""A/V high"" that last for a few hours, and then you forget why you liked the product in the first place. (oops) American product is better written, period. I consider the LAST AIRBENDER series, and the feature OVER THE HEDGE, to be two of the best productions ever done in America, regardless of genre.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,3 November 2013
122,Samurai Champloo," A crazy mix of every genre that surprisingly works, but not for everybody","One of the most universally popular and admired animes of recent years was Cowboy Bebop, a futuristic western with complex, entertaining characters and an amazing jazz and blues soundtrack. The movie version was even given a modest theater release in the states. So the creators of that show has to do something to either top themselves, or go in a completely different direction. With Samurai Chemploo they actually try to do both, strangely enough. Fuu is a young girl working in a tea shop somewhere in Japan during the 19th Century. A series of converging events land her in the middle of a duel between two rogue samurai, traditionally trained Jin, and the violent thug Mugen. She strangely manages to recruit them in a long journey to find a specific man, a samurai who smells of sunflowers. Along the way they encounter a variety of people and situations, and kind of gives a historical look at the Japanese culture of the time, involving the Shogunate and the influx of western influence. But there is no mistaking this as a historical piece, as it routinely breaks into modern rap and hip hop style music and dancing, with some animation exaggerations that make it comparable to the Looney Tunes. But the comparison to Cowboy Bebop is unmistakable. All the characters are unique creations, not archetypes or retreads, but distinct human beings who always behave as their personality dictates. Jin is a minimalist, saying what is needed to be said and anything else is punctuated by a soft, 'Hmmm.' Mugen is probably the star of the show, yet he is a loudmouth, speaks his mind, which is usually a swear word, and is actually an efficient slacker. Fuu is a very peppy and energetic girl, who manages to cope well in the foreign situations she is put in, and can talk her way out of and into anything very subtly. Another distinction is the way the music is integrated. The episodes in general have a more classical Japanese music soundtrack, the rap is usually in the more comedic episodes. But often a point will be given by a long period of no dialogue and only a distinctive song is played while characters go on with their lives. You learn what everyone is thinking, and it gives the audience time to let it settle in. The action is also a significant highlight. Every battle is distinctive, smooth, and perfectly paced. They move with superhuman speed, but is still grounded in real life and battle tactics. Mugen is especially enjoyable to watch, as he utilizes break dancing-like moves and often doesn't even need to use his sword. As a whole, the show is a treat to watch under different reasons. The quirky humor will thrill some people and turn-off others. That is the reason many Americans do not appreciate anime, because the visuals and comedy are sometimes culturally specific and very strange to foreigners. But the action is crisp and the characters can hold their own separately. What more can you ask for?",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,7.0,25 May 2006
123,Samurai Champloo," As A Jaded Anime Fan, I Must Admit That This Was INCREDIBLE!","I wouldn't really consider myself a big fan of anime, having only seen about 50 titles to date (mostly theatrical films). I have enjoyed a majority of the ones I've seen (especially the Studio Ghibli line), but most of them haven't blown me away. I'm one of those blasphemous fiends who finds great enjoyment in anime that *real* fans of anime don't like very much. You know, stuff like ""Vexille"" (2007), ""Appleseed"" (2004), and ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" (2005) – movies that everyone likes to rip apart even though they're far more entertaining than most of the artsy fartsy stuff that finds its way onto everyones top lists. I've also disliked and even hated a number of highly acclaimed titles. You know, stuff like ""Akira"" (1987), ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" (1995), ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (1998), and ""Princess Mononoke"" (1997) – titles that get endless reverence for reasons that I simply do not understand. For myself personally, anime is like a mine field because I really have no idea whether or not I'm gonna hit a pretentous, irritating mess.<br/><br/>This past weekend I had no Asian dvds to watch, which is a rarity. So I did some online research and came across a series by the name of ""Samurai Champloo"" (2004). Like every other anime series, it got really high ratings and everyone went on and on about how awesome it was – yada yada yada. I rolled my eyes. Then I noticed that it was created by the same team that brought us ""Cowboy Bebop"" (1998), an anime that I recently finished and enjoyed very much. On that fact alone I decided to take a chance. I purchased the Complete DVD collection at a local store, and ended up finishing the entire series (a 10 hour project) in one day.<br/><br/>Fuu, a waitress who works in a teahouse, rescues two master swordsmen, Mugen and Jin, from their execution to help her find the ""samurai who smells of sunflowers."" Along the way they meet a lot of people and get involved in various conflicts. This is one of the few anime that I've seen that exhibits superior quality in every single aspect of film-making. The animation itself is stunning, with incredibly beautiful environments on constant display, and the Japanese voiceacting is top notch. The two biggest positives, however, are the character development and the swordfights.<br/><br/>With regards to the former, I must give some serious props to the scriptwriter, who crafts some fantastic characters here with very distinct, engaging histories. These are expertly developed characters who come to life. As much as I enjoyed ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex GIG 1 &amp; 2"" (2002, 2004), I always felt that the characters were too dry and textbook. Not so in ""Samurai Champloo"", which introduces its characters in a very warm, endearing manner while using a hefty amount of witty comedy that bonds them with the viewer as well as each other. It was also an excellent decision to have a very slow, methodical bonding process that basically takes the entire runtime before culminating in a family-type relationship. This makes perfect sense given their cynical histories, and comes off as entirely convincing. By the end the viewer will have no choice but to be emotionally invested in their lives, which maximizes the impact of the final 6 or 7 episodes when they confront some formidable opponents.<br/><br/>That brings us to the swordfighting scenes, which are without question the greatest I've ever seen in an animated film or show. The quality of the action choreography is high throughout, but the last 6 or 7 episodes will completely blow you away. We're talking multiple showdowns with bad guys who are so intimidating that one questions the well-being of the protagonists, who are considerably talented in their own right. What results is what I call ""superlative awesomeness"" that will have the viewer on the edge of their seat for virtually every single second. If you thought the swordfights in ""Ninja Scroll"" (1993) were good, you've GOT to see this! A truly magnificent, exhilarating experience.<br/><br/>I still have much to see in the realm of anime, but it's gonna be tough to top ""Samurai Champloo."" I'm completely and whole-heartedly in love with this the same way I'm in love with ""My Sassy Girl"" (2001, South Korea) as a romantic comedy or ""Kairo"" (2001, Japan) as a horror movie. A must see by any common definition of the term.<br/><br/>10/10",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,6 July 2010
124,Samurai Champloo, The Bomb,"since hip-hop's beginnings, there has always been a deep respect within the rap community for Asian culture, specifically that of the samurai, this is evident in the music of The Wu Tang Clan, shows like Kung Faux, and films like Ghost Dog.<br/><br/>now the table is turned with Shinichiro Watanabe's new venture, Samurai Champloo, this is a fine example of the mutual embrace of cultures between American hip-hop and Japanese samurai fiction.<br/><br/>the plot is pretty basic and remarkably none-convoluted for an anime: a tea-shop worker named Fuu falls into the company of two warriors, a samurai named Jin, and a slacker named Mugen, they go on a journey to find someone known as ""the samurai who smells of sunflowers."" pretty standard fair, right? well not always true, for instance, these three are not necessarily friends, in fact Mugen and Jin are both determined to kill each other at some point. for samurai fiction, there's a lot of wink and nudge at the audience. this show never takes itself too seriously, but that doesn't stop us from caring about the characters and the events they are put in.<br/><br/>like Watanabe's previous effort, Cowboy Bebop, the mood of the show is incredibly eclectic, one episode can contain moments of heart-wrenching drama and the next moment, pure hilarity.<br/><br/>as previously mentioned, this show is an amalgamation of Japanese storytelling and American hip-hop, the shows theme song is a strange but very cool rap by Emcee Fat Jon, and the show itself features many scratch-instances, usually used to shift the plot in another direction for a moment. hip-hop also reigns as a pacer for many of the extremely cool fight-scenes. Jin's rote and clean shogun style is a great counterpart for Mugen's wild Capoera and break dancing moves, and all the battles are bloody, excessive, and a riot to watch. even the little text blurbs and notes that constantly pass across the screen are written in graffiti and often include ironic slang messages.<br/><br/>the animation is reminiscent of Watanabe's work on Kill Bill, however it is less sketchy, more cleanly defined and colored.<br/><br/>if you're looking for another Eva clone, with a deep and continuous plot, then you're sh*t out of luck here, however if you just want a good time, that is immediately palatable and easy to get into, then look no further.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,27 June 2006

As corny as it sounds, it's very funny once you watch it.<br/><br/>It's not just the plot thats funny, but the characters are a big part of the comedy. Cookie is half-cyborg and often uses his technology to get in some sort of trouble while Ned comes up with strange ways to escape a bully, study for a test, or avoid failing. And then there's Moze, who thinks of ideas to get new girl friends, ""scares"" her friends, makes interesting school projects, and tries to ""defeat"" her rival Susie Crabgrass.<br/><br/>I suggest watching this show if you want something original and amusing.

128,Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, A Nice Little Treat (if You're Around to See It),"I have only seen about one and a half half-hour segments of this Nick show; but based on what I've seen, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide is good if you're in the vicinity of a TV and have nothing else to do. My brother loves this show, and records it on our DVR. There are a few good reasons why.<br/><br/>For starters, instead of one entire episode per show, there are two twelve-minute segments, each covering a single topic. This helps immensely in the pace of action by not having strung-out, boring scenes that go on and on. It also means there are no commercials guaranteed for an entire episode (unless you need to use the bathroom desperately). If there are any other good characteristics from cartoons like SpongeBob or Fairly Odd Parents that share this characteristic, they apply to this show as well.<br/><br/>Second, the show is not preachy. It does NOT make the entertainment value second-nature to the morals. The tips Ned does give naturally flow with the on-screen action and are not shoved down your ears. Compounded with the fact that it doesn't seem take itself very seriously, watching Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide felt a bit like watching Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry - good if you like Nickelodeon's sense of humor.<br/><br/>Third, the three main characters are very likable if you are in to these kinds of shows. Personally, I believe Ned is one of the better main protagonists to come around lately.<br/><br/>Taken, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide is the most light-hearted school drama/comedy to come around in a while - not only in the humor or range discussed topics, but also in its playful presentation. Perhaps it's in many ways the perfect guilty pleasure show? Whether or not you'll like this show depends on taste; but, in short, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide succeeds in excellently manifesting itself into what it's supposed to be: a school comedy.",29 out of 33 found this helpful.,,6 November 2005

One of those sick days I caught an episode of Ned's Declassified school survival guide. I was hooked ever since.<br/><br/>The premise is simple one boy (Ned) and his two friends are trying to create a guide to surviving middle school. Each show made up of two fifteen minute episodes. Each episode focuses on one overall heading of ""the guide"" mentioned in the title.<br/><br/>What I like most about this show is the resemblance it bears to the Nick sitcoms when I was kid. The humor is young but not stupid, much like Clarissa Explains it All and Salute Your Shorts. Also, like Clarissa used to Ned talks directly to the camera, explaining ""guide tips"" and situations inside of the plot. Of course there are gags (it is still aimed at kids after all) but some of those gags are actually better for older kids and adults, like the vice principal who dresses like the guys from Miami Vice.<br/><br/>All in all this is a pretty good show, not great, but there are definitely worse out there, heck, there are even worse on Nickelodeon...like Zoey 101.",20 out of 23 found this helpful.,,3 May 2006

Older viewers are catching allusions that the younger, junior high audience would probably miss. I will tune in to it every Sunday @ 6:30 and I encourage others to do so. The show is off to a fantastic start. I expect it to be a success. <br/><br/>COOKIE continue to ROCK DUDE!!!",15 out of 25 found this helpful.,,18 September 2004
138,Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide," okay, a bit weird.","I think this show is okay.At first I thought it was just gonna be another pathetic show about teens getting through life. But I actually find this show very amusing.The characters are very realistic and can relate to many teens.Ned's just your average student who's in between being popular and unpopular.There are probably thousands of teens who are exactly where he is on the social ladder.I like the situation with Mozely being friends with two guys and looking for a best girlfriend to talk about other things the guys can't understand. Cookie's just plain funny although he can be annoying at times.I thought it was funny when he wanted to try out for cheer leading.The episodes are good as well.The episodes all have a middle school problem and helpful tips to get through it.I'd like one episode to be based on Parent/Teacher conferences.That would be hilarious.The characters I dislike are the two cool kids who Mozely and Ned have a crush on.Seth is just plain stupid and overly obsessed with his basketball and Susie's shallow like in that episode when they were at the dance and she kept dumping Seth for small problems like how he brought her least favorite drink.The teachers can be weird at times but hey,in school almost every teacher can be weird.I rate this show a 7/10.",18 out of 32 found this helpful.,,12 April 2005

But still, this is a great kids show. It's original. The comedy is wonderful, and the actors are talented.<br/><br/>By far, my favorite character is the janitor Gordy, who also happens to be the voice of Cosmo from The Fairly OddParents. He seems to take some characteristics from Cosmo and uses them for Gordy! The plots are usually about school, but they take the idea and run with it as far away as they possibly can! They find clever ways of making it funny without being too over the top.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful show that I would like to see released on DVD! This show deserves more than what Nick gave it. In fact, they don't even show re-runs anymore! What's up with that?

143,Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, Absurdist comedy for kids. (spoilers),"Managed to catch this show on TV the other day, and, having never seen it before and catching it in the middle of the show, the characters were talking about basketball tryouts. When one dorky kid starts whining that he didn't make the team and then starts crying while the other one starts telling him about all the greats and glory of Michael Jordan, who perceived in the face of failure and doubt, I half expected one of them to stop and say, at least you could save 15% on your car insurance and then cut to a Geico label.<br/><br/>Sticking with the rest of the show after being amused enough by this point, I found this to be a pretty good, albeit cheap, stupid humor show that is much more sarcastic than Disney's 'Even Stevens,' and may be more comparable to 'Scrubs' type humor, only within a show about kids. It's great to see Nickelodeon taking a risk here and pulling away from the conventional school age programming about usually obnoxious kids and their overly-sentimental or altogether ridiculous moments. Well worth seeing if you appreciate these types of comedies.",5 out of 9 found this helpful.,,13 March 2005

145,Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, One of the most underrated TV shows of all time.,"I absolutely adore Ned's Declassified. It's not just the best live action Nick show, it's one of the best TV shows of all time, period. That's some lofty praise, and I'm going to do my best to articulate why I think this show is so fantastic.<br/><br/>A good place to start is the presentation. I'm a big fan of presentation. There have been many tween/teen sitcoms that break the fourth wall like Saved By The Bell, but those shows have very standard presentaion that doesn't set them apart from the pack. Ned's Declassified is so unapologetically bonkers and over the top, with a ridiculously fast breakneck pace. Everything is so intentionally cartoony and unrealistic, with the dramatic and comical music cues and wacky sound effects. The science teacher is always seen in a white lab coat. Lisa Zemo uses allergy nose spray in every single scene she's in in the first two seasons. The nerds wear khakis and coke bottle glasses, the bullies wear black leather jackets. The vice principal wears a siren hat! This may come off as juvenile or lazy to some, but I think it fits the shows tone perfectly, as it's from the perspective of middle schoolers who, though probably not as imaginative as elementary schoolers, can still have active imaginations. The style is so insane, it makes you overlook logical inconsistencies and accept the way this universe works. You can tell some of the same people who worked on the Fairly Odd Parents worked on this too. The fact that the show is shot from many different angles helps maintain the illusion that the sets aren't really sets and keeps you immersed in this world, as opposed to the traditional sitcom setup where it's obviously three walls on a stage. With 11 minute episodes (and one 45-minute series finale), every second counts so not a moment of screen time is wasted. Without this presentation, this show would just be a male Lizzie McGuire.<br/><br/>Another important aspect is the characters. The writing on this show is great. Through all three seasons not one character has a single out-of-character moment. It's a school survival guide, so very few episodes take place outside of the school, eliminating the risk of being bogged down with too many subplots and keeping things tight and focused. There's nothing I hate more in family films and TV shows than one dimensional bullies, but even all the bullies in this show are fairly well developed. They aren't just antagonists, they're often seen interacting with other students and teachers normally like many real bullies. I like how they try to keep the extras consistent throughout the series, with many of them being characters with speaking roles (and even though they're not doing anything in that scene, I love that added attention to detail). The acting is great across the board; depending on the character and what they're going for, everyone is either just the right level of over the top or reserved. There's no less than 6 love triangles (Ned/Moze/Seth, Ned/Moze/Loomer, Ned/Moze/Faymen, Ned/Suzie/Loomer, Cookie/Lisa/Vanessa and Cookie/Lisa/almost every other boy in their grade). Normally having such a convoluted love subplot would bog a show down, but it's surprisingly easy to follow, not too forced, and all resolves in the end. I think the mix of elementary, middle, and high school problems makes it more relatable to a wider audience, making the rumored high school spin-off series unnecessary in my mind. I appreciate how the series ends with Ned and Moze getting together, and they decided not to continue the series with the two best friends in a relationship (unlike Kim Possible).<br/><br/>The most important aspect of this show is that amongst the chaos and wackiness, there's still a relatable, down to earth element to it. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it's so unrealistic yet so realistic. The chemistry between the students, how kids bond with certain teachers better than others. Almost every character is a stereotype, but they all have distinct personalities and allow the audience to find a little bit of themselves in each of them.<br/><br/>Ned's Declassified is a show unlike any other I've seen. The creator tried to emulate this same style in Big Time Rush, but it simply didn't work as well because this style could only work to specifically capture the mindset of the students and faculty at the manic, colorful, and innocent James K. Polk Middle School, not the cynical world of stardom and the pop music industry. Besides being funny, well written, tightly edited and paced, uniquely presented, and with a lovable cast of characters, it's a show that kids will find relatable (in not immediately obvious ways) and adults can still find thoroughly entertaining. It may be because I'm a crazy person, but this is one of my all time favorite TV shows and I genuinely believe it's one of the best and most underrated sitcoms of all time. Absolutely a 10/10 from me!",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,31 March 2019

The structure is two subjects in Ned's guide per 30 minutes episode. To add more wackiness, the show ends with outtakes of the episode. It is fun. The cast is lovable.

150,The Larry Sanders Show, Television's Great Masterpiece,"The Larry Sanders show may be the finest American television show. The comedy always has the perfect precision and they take such great care to small details. In one episode, Larry visits Hank's office, which he rarely does, and Hank puts his jacket on to try to look his best, that's the level of detail you don't see in most crap sitcoms. No American show since has held no punches and has been so bitterly cynical yet hilarious.<br/><br/>The three main actors really make the show. Garry Shandling as the good natured but selfish and cowardly Larry Sanders really plays the perfect vain talk show host. Jeffrey Tambor as Hank Kingsley really fleshes out the talentless asshole sidekick who you still root for, similar to George Costanza. Rip Torn masterfully portrays the over the top obsequious producer with a dark streak. The simple pleasure of seeing these three men interact is entertaining enough on its own.<br/><br/>The show is actually based on talk shows, you see all the politics and show biz phoniness unvarnished. The ugliness and hypocrisy in Hollywood will really surprise the uninitiated viewer. One wonders how much of Larry was in Johnny Carson and how much of Hank was in Ed McMahon.<br/><br/>This show is a true gem that is not nearly as popular as it should be since it doesn't pander. Any fan of intelligent programming owes it to himself to watch this.",19 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,20 July 2007
151,The Larry Sanders Show, Flipping hell,"The Larry Sanders show was the best, nastiest, and funniest comedy program on either side of the Atlantic during the 1990s.  Filmed without a laughter track, it features Garry Shandling as TV talk show host Larry Sanders (motto: ""No flipping!""), who we follow on and off camera.<br/><br/>On camera, the Larry Sanders Show is slick, professional, and vacant, as celebrities appear pretending to be best of friends with Larry and delighted to be on the show when all they're really doing is plugging their latest product and when everyone in the paranoid entertainment industry actively hates everybody else.  Exactly like real talk shows, in fact.  As a parody, Larry Sanders is extremely subtle, aided by the fact that many A-list celebs from real life appear, showing a surprising willingness to send themselves up (David Duchovny, for example, features in one episode where the main storyline centres on his crush on Larry!).  It's bad, but not obviously: you can really imagine it on air (in sharp contrast to Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge, who in real life would never make it even to hospital radio).<br/><br/>But the funniest material comes backstage.  The leading characters (Larry, his loser sidekick Hank, and his alternately tough-talking and sycophantic producer Artie) are all so horrible, the main joke is basically that everyone continually behaves in a manner both in character, and yet also worse than you could possibly expect.  The sheer unpleasantness of these individuals is jaw-dropping... you continually wonder ""did he really just say that?""  Hank, for example, after his agent has been hospitalised and he hasn't been allowed to visit, comments: ""It's so unfair! I mean so much to him!"" then immediately starts phoning potential successors.  The character of Hank is perhaps the best of all, his role on the show is to appear talentless and genial alongside Larry, a role he fulfills with partial success because he is naturally talentless but not in the least genial!  But all the cast (including many regulars) are wonderfully portrayed, Shandling is great but at the end of each brief episode you almost wish you had seen more of the others... in fact this is probably just another sign of the show's strength, instead of wheeling out our favourites each week for a familiar laugh, this show is always looking for fresh ways to make us uncomfortable.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a very un-American program (there's not an ounce of sentiment, or a hint of redemption for its characters).  In the UK, Peter Kay's ""Phoenix Nights"" is perhaps the closest thing to a successor. But the Larry Sanders show remains a major loss from the late-night schedules.",55 out of 62 found this helpful.,,26 May 2003
152,The Larry Sanders Show, A brilliant take-off of the late night TV scene,"For years we've all heard the stories of behind the scenes powerplays, ego, contracts, manipulation etc. among the late night hosts and networks. Ever since Johnny ""clicked"" with American TV audiences on NBC we have watched a steady stream of after 11pm hosts of variety type shows. Post-Carson we have seen Jay, Dave, Conan, Arsenio, Pat Sajak, Chevy Chase, Craig Kilborn, Bob Costas, etc. vie for the late night dollars. A movie entitled ""The Late Night Shift"" was made depicting the infighting between Jay Leno's people and David Letterman's group to take over The Tonight Show when Johnny retired.<br/><br/>Now Gary Shandling and HBO have devised a character and show to weave between reality and fiction all in the form of Shandling's alter-ego Larry Sanders. Much like Billy Crystal's creation, Buddy Young Jr., Sanders has taken on a personna of his own. However, what Shandling and HBO have done takes it to new heights of excellence. The stories are witty, funny, provocative, and probably lend more truth to insights into show business then even the most skeptical of us could have imagined.<br/><br/>With an absolutely great supporting cast this show embodies the idea that comedy can be intellectual, cutting edge, and somewhat bitter sharp without excluding portions of the audience. Of special note the performance of Rip Torn, as Larry's veteran producer (Artie), is shear greatness. Torn has fashioned his character after Fred DeCordova who was Johnny Carson's Executive Producer.Artie ""knows when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em"". He knows when to f__k with the network and when not to and he insulates Larry from anything that would compromise Larry's ability to be on the edge for a great show. He loves Larry like a brother and loathes him for his insecurities, childishness, ego and all that Larry can be that's infuriating.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Tambor is terrific as Larry's Ed McMahon sidekick Hank Kingsley. A sniveling, insecure, limited talent based guy Kingsley is well paid and likes to throw around power. Trouble is his power base is Larry and those staffers that work on the show only do for Hank what they absolutely have to. Tambor plays this character to a tee!<br/><br/>With real celebrity guests poking fun at celebrity, TV, movies, and themselves at times the program almost seems to allow the entertainment industry to safely poke fun at itself in a somewhat scathing manner.<br/><br/>The show ended it's run about a year and a half ago but it replays on the HBO channels each week and is well worth the time to view.",25 out of 30 found this helpful.,,30 August 2001
153,The Larry Sanders Show, Very funny show about late night talk shows behind the scenes,"This was a smart,funny and very cynical show that showed Hollywood behind and in front of the cameras. This show may have been about Larry, but some of its funniest moments were all about Hank. Hank Kingsley was one of the most hysterically funny characters in TV history. Hank had such an underlying sense of poignancy and humanity that you had to feel bad for him. One of my favorite scenes from the series is when Artie put Hank into a headlock to keep him from speaking at Larry's roast. Hank actually sat back down at the roast after the headlock as if nothing had happened - imagine the low self worth the man must have had to not just storm out of the banquet hall. Another funny episode is where Hank insists on having Phil write up a script for ""Hank's Hot Potato,"" a backwards, confusing game of Hot Potato. After Phil writes something that includes the audience shouting out a profanity at Hank, all Hank can do is comment on the fact that the audience wasn't supposed to have a line. My favorite episode has to be the one with ""Hank's Look Around Restaurant"". The tables moved around so you have a different view every few minutes. Everyone knew it was a bad idea, but Hank wanted it so badly. When Larry is eating there, the tables creak and wobble and the glasses tip over...it kills me every time. To quote Artie, ""That's great television, my friend."" And of course, Rip Torn was superb as Artie, the producer whose years of experience in Tinseltown had made him bitter, over-aggressive, disenchanted to the point of being total sullen, and perhaps more realistic than anyone else in that environment.<br/><br/>Also, as an aside, if you buy the entire series don't let season one throw you. The characters struggle trying to find themselves, and Larry is even married during that first season, still I'd highly recommend the entire series as quite hilarious.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,25 July 2015
154,The Larry Sanders Show, Hilarious talk show satire.,"Larry Sanders has a broad range of humor. When on camera, the humor comes from how unfunny these characters actually are in front of the camera and how funny the audience finds it. Anyone who watches late night talk shows can relate to the ""mock show"" portion of each show. The behind the scenes, which makes up most of each episode relies on the situations as well as the dialogue which is usually very funny and well written, like something that would actually be said.<br/><br/>The characters were all very different and well written. Larry Sanders, played subtly and brilliantly by Gary Shandling. Larry is always smiling, whether he's happy or not. He's self centered, but not too much of a jerk. His manager Artie (Rip Torn) is more over the top rude and loud, but he's not an unbelievable character. Then there's Hank (Jeffrey Tambor) who plays second banana to Larry and the talk show, but on this show, often steals the episodes, taking many of the main plot lines, and he is hilarious as the alternate universe Ed MacMahon. Along with these three, there are many other less important characters, all very funny.<br/><br/>Overall, Larry Sanders was usually hysterical, but when not, it was still one of the most brilliant shows on television.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,13 January 2008
155,The Larry Sanders Show, Absolutely the best,"Hands down - this is my favorite television program, ever. For me, it replaced ""Columbo"" (especially the earlier ones) in this regard. Built around Garry Shandling's delightfully diverse character - the extremely-talented on-air Larry, who is equally-neurotic in his personal life, it presents everything one could want from any piece of entertainment. With Jeffrey Tambor and Rip Torn perfectly-cast in their sidekick and producer roles - there is a legion of talented others in terms of supporting cast, and a horde of A-list celebrities appearing as themselves, both as guests on the fictional show and in Larry's personal life.<br/><br/>Whatever the assigned characteristics the writers have provided the supporting cast and guests - sneaky, smarmy, confrontational, naive, insincere, unpredictable, etc,, etc. - it seems that everything, every characterization, every situation is carried-off without fault and is thoroughly amusing. Where the situation or drama had more serious elements, these were also well-done, without detracting from the show's overall humor.<br/><br/>A major affirmation of this show's appeal, for me (if I needed one) is that even where a guest appeared who was far from a favorite of mine (Rosanne would be the best example) even that person was engaging in the role within the program.<br/><br/>This program also was one where the ""salty"" language, which occurred in abundance, always added to the quality of the programming and stories, never seeming at all gratuitous. And another confirmation of the quality of this series is that in its subsequent re-runs, especially on local outlets, where many words are ""bleeped,"" the programs are still completely entertaining.<br/><br/>Certainly everyone will have certain favorite episodes. However, this is a show which one can enjoy whenever seeing it again, whatever episode(s) are viewed, and irrespective of how many times they may have been seen before.<br/><br/>I know the participants have gone on to other separate endeavors. But I, for one, would love to see, say, a mini-series where HBO would present ""the network"" luring Larry, Artie and Hank ""out of retirement,"" and having them do a series of retrospective ""Larry Sanders Shows"" as part of celebration of some sort of network milestone.<br/><br/>One of my local stations used to run two episodes late each Saturday night. I was able to see a few when aired, but made certain I taped all of them to see within the following few days. I'm surprised that I haven't already bought all of the series available on VHS or DVD, but intend to do so in the near future. These shows are the type which, even after multiple viewings, are more entertaining to see again than most alternatives available for the first time",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,31 October 2006
156,The Larry Sanders Show, Brilliant Writing,"The Larry Sanders Show is one of the greatest television shows ever.  The best description that I can come up with for TLSS is that it's a free-form pre-scripted reality show.  The writing sparkles, the characterizations are wonderful, and the plotlines are engaging.  TV Guide recently said that Seinfeld is the greatest tv show of all time; that might be true for a network program that you can skip for a few minutes while you yell at the kids or go make a sandwich, but TLSS requires your full attention.<br/><br/>Garry Shandling plays Larry Sanders in this mock-talk show.  Larry is the neurotic straight-man surrounded by crazy characters and situations.  Famous celebrities wander the offices, waiting in the green room or shagging in the prop room.  Larry takes everything in stride, shooting off an acerbic remark for everything that doesn't go his way.  <br/><br/>TLSS is shot on video for the talk show portions, the part that is ""broadcast"", while the behind-the-scenes reality parts are shot on film, giving you a line of demarcation for what's ""real"" and what's ""the show"".<br/><br/>Three actors make up the triumvirate of drama:  Garry Shandling, Rip Torn, and Jeffrey Tambor.  Torn is dead-perfect as the show's producer, Artie. With his weathered face, odd expressions, blustery voice, and bulldozer personality he barges into rooms like he owns the place.  Torn's performances are brilliantly conceived.<br/><br/>Tambor plays Hank Kingsley, the insecure sidekick to Larry Sanders.  With his subtle, simmering delivery and steel-eyed glare, no one but Tambor could play Hank.  From show to show, you find yourself alternately loving and hating him.  On one show, he guest-hosts TLSS and believes that it is a stepping-stone to his own program.  He becomes a raving egomaniac and threatens to take over the show.  On a consecutive night of hosting, however, he stumbles and falls on his face.  <br/><br/>The writing crackles like lightning.  When Artie tells Larry that he needs to throw anxious network honchos ""a bone"", Larry retorts ""why don't you fake-throw and see if their heads move?""  In another scene, Hank comes up to Larry and Artie, sits down, and begins to ask a question that Artie guesses even before it's out of Hank's mouth.  ""I'll bet you want to have your wedding on the show.""  When Hank says, ""My God, how could you possibly know that?"", Artie retorts ""You should know by now that I can see...into...your...mind.""  I watched that scene five times.<br/><br/>The only flaw in TLSS is that in every episode there is a butt joke.  Sure they're funny once in a great while, but if it comes to the point where you're anxiously waiting for it so you can get it out of the way, then something is wrong.  I'm surprised that the writers would insert such childish, immature jokes into an otherwise brilliantly-written program.<br/><br/>Despite the show's above flaw, this series is a masterwork of humor and drama, a fly-on-the-wall view of the production of a talk show.

Rip Torn was great. Shandling (who more recently played the tortoise in OVER THE HEDGE) was superb. It was a one of kind show and had a loyal following.

Brilliantly written, superbly acted and hilarious, it took the documentary style comedy of Spinal Tap and re-tuned it to define a new sitcom style that inspired many other shows including Brit comedy The Office.<br/><br/>It ran alongside Sienfeld during the 90s but seems to have been overlooked by the mainstream and is in danger of slipping into obscurity.<br/><br/>The series follows the days in the lives of everybody involved in the production of a popular late night American talk show. The action centers around the three main characters, Larry Sanders the star and host of the show, Rip Torn's hilarious producer, Artie and the wonderful Hank Kingsley, Larry's sidekick.<br/><br/>The action is split into two styles, the behind the scenes docu-drama and the actual broadcast talk show. The two formats cleverly cut to tell the story of the characters. I don't know how they do it but the show is subtle and understated but at the same time fast moving and in your face.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the American version of The Office yet, but I strongly suggest that you don't even bother with it - just watch this instead. There are at least 7 or 8 series of it and you have to watch them in sequence too, because the stories cleverly develop and come to almost apocalyptic climaxes.<br/><br/>Do it!",21 out of 33 found this helpful.,,2 June 2005
160,The Larry Sanders Show, One of the all-time great shows...,"...and I say that as someone who thought Shandling's earlier show on Showtime, ""It's Garry Shandling's Show"" was pretty bad. Because this series was on HBO in the 90's rather than on one of the three major networks, I know that not very many people got to see it. I heartily encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to do so. I very rarely laugh out loud watching TV shows, but I did numerous times throughout it's run. Because it was on HBO, the language is R-Rated, so if you're offended by that, I guess you shouldn't see it. But I thought that's what made it so good, because you got stars playing themselves talking in a way that you wouldn't hear them on talk shows or on publicity tours. And Jeffrey Tambor as the insecure sidekick may not have leading man looks, but has superb acting chops instead.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,5 April 2018
161,The Larry Sanders Show, Smart &amp; Engrossing Satire,"Yes, late-night talk shows really are that calculated.  They actually plan out the jokes that seem spur of the moment.  It was interesting to learn these things in a documentary about talk shows recently, but more fun to see this reality skewered on the Larry Sanders show.  Unfortunately, although it mocks late-night talk shows, it also falls into a few of their conventions. The show usually stops short for about a minute or so while the 'musical guest' on the show-within-a-show performs a song, and sometimes we have to sit through the lame monologues as well.  Usually it's in the name of satire, sometimes it's puzzling.  Anyway, this was much better than Seinfeld - to which it bears comparison for the similar reality base- because it was allowed to be more real and was definitely more engrossing, never relying on shtick.  Plus, Gary Shandling REALLY knew when to quit - way before there was any drop-off in quality.  By the time Seinfeld signed off just about everything that had made that show what it was had already faded away. Catch it on HBO Comedy if you get that channel, where it airs nightly.",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,,24 May 2001

We get to see actors such as Jeff Goldblum playing themselves, and just as the show that we watch parodies the Hollywood film and television industry, so the actors parody themselves, revealing themselves to have the quirks, neuroses, and flaws that make us all human and funny. While all the characters are funny, for me, the funniest character in the show is Hank Kingsley. He worships the ground that Larry walks on, yet carries around a repressed anger and frustration at the levels of sycophancy he can't help but stoop to. He is essentially a nice person, yet can express howlingly incorrect attitudes towards women, with absolutely no insight into why women might be offended, for example when he asks Drew Barrymoore to lift her blouse for the camera. My favourite moment, of all time, was when Hank met the Wutang Clan, and tried to engage them in an urban conversation, but got the ""cool"" handshakes and lingo all wrong. This was simply one of the funniest comedy moments ever.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,22 May 2005
163,The Larry Sanders Show, No flipping on this one.,"Good news villagers, rejoice, for The Larry Sanders Show is now syndicated on our local NBC here in Detroit and on Bravo from 10-11 with the replay at 12-1 every night, huzzah. Wait, what is the Larry Sanders show you ask? Well, I shall tell you.<br/><br/>The Larry Sanders Show is a show about the production of the most generic late night talk show possible, if you're wondering why a lot of people are saying the show is brilliant but the ""show within a show"" portions suck, that's what they're intended to do. The show exposes how pre-fab and bad talk shows really are, and makes us feel bad for ever tuning into one. It's a form of satire that made me appreciate That's My Bush and it's knocks on sitcoms.<br/><br/>The characters are what make this special, even though a lot of the supporting players changed over the years. Larry is neurotic and unstable and is, as one episode put it, ""out of the loop"", he always seems to get everything last. Hank is Larry's TV sidekick who greatly overestimates his own worth and constantly makes a fool out of himself, it's hard to decide whether to feel sorry for him or to laugh at what a fool he is, Tambor plays his role absolutely perfectly and it's always funny to hear one of the celebrities screw up his name or to hear his laments about his position on the show. Artie, the producer, is a two faced jerk who you can't help but love, he spews profanities and insults out of one side of his mouth and sucks up incessantly out of the other.<br/><br/>Real celebrities appear on this show and the ""show within a show"" portions are shot on film, as to provide for more realism. Oh, and if you ever wondered what the celebrities and the host talk about when they cut away for commercial break but still appear to be babbling away, this show lets you in on a bit of that with some rather hilarious conversation.<br/><br/>The show is not only excellent satire, it's well acted and incredibly funny. My favorite episode is Hank's Contract which is the funniest episode centered on Hank and what respect the rest of the cast and crew hold him in.<br/><br/>The profanities are edited out of the Bravo version with audio deletion in lieu of bleeps, which i was very very very disappointed about. I don't live and die around cuss words, but it totally destroys a character like Artie's diction, this show, however, would still be better than 99.9% of what's currently on TV if it had half it's dialogue deleted.",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,,17 December 2002
164,The Larry Sanders Show," If you like ""Friends"", you'd better skip this entirely.","TLSS is easily the best U.S. sit-com, if one can call it that, of all time. Only ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" come close. TLSS has everything that garbage like ""Friends"" and ""The Bill Cosby Show"" haven't got: subtle humour, rich characterization, intelligent story-lines, great laughs, an almost perfect cast, and unlike those two miserable sit-coms TLSS does not cater to the worst/dumbest demographic viewing groups, hence its lack of broad appeal to the masses of morons who seek banana-peel humour when they switch on their TVs.<br/><br/>And very importantly: no laugh track.<br/><br/>At the core of the series are Larry, Arty, and Hank. Larry is insecure, talented, self-obsessed, and paranoid. Arty is tough, no-nonsense, determined, direct, and full of energy. Hank is slimy, egotistical, arrogant, sycophantic, talent-free, and generally quite pathetic. All three actors playing these three people are brilliant, in totally different ways, but if I had to pick one character that is the most fun to watch it would have to be Hank, of course. After all, pathetic characters in comedy shows usually get most of the glory. As far as comic timing goes, Shandling's is as perfect as anyone I've seen anywhere. The side-characters are very good, too, even the otherwise annoying Garofalo is watchable.<br/><br/>The many guest stars only make the series more interesting, especially since there was very little effort to glorify these morons; quite to the contrary, many of them agreed to make themselves look foolish for the good of the show. Most of them pull it off well. Dana Carvey is perhaps the most successful in adding quality to the already flawless cast, whereas someone like Regis Philbin was embarrassing to watch, even though that particular episode was good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have seen only about a third of all the episodes, but from those I would pick out the following as the stand-outs (keeping in mind that I haven't seen a single anything-less-than-very-good episode): ""Party"", ""Hank's Sex Tape"", ""Next Stop Bottom"", and ""Hank's New Assistant"".",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,,9 November 2007
165,The Larry Sanders Show, An original show,"This was originally an HBO show, but you can catch slightly edited reruns on Bravo, and extremely edited reruns on some local network television stations.  <br/><br/>It's about the fictional Larry Sanders (Garry Shandling) and his late night talk show.  Behind the scenes are the suck-up Artie (played by the hilarious Rip Torn), cranky Paula (Janeane Garafolo), insecure Hank, smart Beverly, and many more.  Each character is quirky and important to the overall show. <br/><br/>
There are lots of guest stars on the show, since it emulates a real talk show.  Elvis Costello was by far the best guest star...he was on twice.  The second time Hank bought his car which fell apart shortly thereafter.  That episode made it on TV Guide's list of the top funniest television episodes of all time.<br/><br/>The humor is subtle...there is no slapstick or one-liners.

This was, no make that is, the most consistently funniest show I've seen on TV.<br/><br/>The material really spoke for itself, the actors excelled most of the time, and you never felt that they were shoving the comic moments up your mush just to make sure you knew it was funny, or trying to be smart alec with the script for the sake of it. It didn't need a laughter track.<br/><br/>The comparison with Seinfeld is pertinent, and I have to say that Seinfield left me cold, a very bad case of ""Emperors' New Clothes"". I could never understand all the plaudits, but maybe its just not to my taste. I think it was very good in the sense that for many, it pulled all the comedy levers by the book, but because of that it was just too obvious. It needs saying though, if only because Seinfeld has become the byword amongst the masses for classic comedy writing over that period.(I think this kind of commentary is apt given the material in the LSS show).<br/><br/>TLSS was THE show about the shallowness of TV and film business personalities, even down to the real life LSSish saga of Gary Shandling falling out and suing his one time friend and manager, Brad Grey for $100m.<br/><br/>So then, if you've never seen Larry Sanders, try it - truly a work of art.

167,The Larry Sanders Show, Back Again on HBO...,"I rarely watch the late night talk shows. Growing up in the 60's &amp; 70's saw Carson (and Merv &amp; Mike Douglas occasionally in the afternoon, not much else on at times) with regularity, but by the 80's when cable arrived I found other things more interesting to watch the formulaic late night talk shows. Plus I don't find stand- up comedy monologues particularly funny (exception Rickles, Dangerfield and Carlin.) But ""The Larry Sanders Show"" a sit-com about the genre, may be the funniest show ever done, a masterful satire about the pretentious and egotistical creatures who inhabit the TV and entertainment world.<br/><br/>At the heart of it is a trio of very funny comedic actors. Garry Shandling as Larry, Jeff Tambor as Hank ""Hey Now"" Kingsley, the announcer and sidekick and screen vet Rip Torn as Artie, the producer. Larry Sanders is a completely neurotic and self- absorbed comedian who has made it to the pinnacle of his profession. His main concerns are staying there and also getting laid by hot looking women and if they happen to be celebrities, so much the better. Hank is a virtually talentless asshole (at one time he had been the MC on a cruise ship) who is blessed with a superb voice and an absolutely massive ego. Artie is the producer, with 40 years of being backstage in the TV business. His specialty is kissing ass with the network suits, the guests and most importantly Larry's, while kicking virtually everyone else's. The key to the chemistry of this is that Shandling actually lets Torn and Tambor get the best story lines and consequently some of the funniest dialogue. <br/><br/>A word of caution to the snowflakes or anyone who may be easily offended. TLSS is loaded with hilarious repartee and situations that may be considered sexist, racist and homophobic by those who can't appreciate rich, earthy and realistic dialogue.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,17 October 2016

174,The Larry Sanders Show, Shandling bares his soul,"As the creative force driving this brilliant comedy, Garry Shandling skewered the foibles and insincerity of talk shows (with the willing collaboration of many A-list stars) but also exposed his own neurotic and complex personality.
It was a strange and unique balancing act and explored with brilliant honesty in the documentary The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling, a must-see companion piece for fans of the show.
The series is hilarious but also poignant as the three flawed principals - Larry, sidekick Hank Kingsley (Jeffrey Tambor) and producer extraordinaire Artie (the divine Rip Torn) create a ""family"" whose lives center on the show.
At the center, of course, is Larry - a funny and talented man of contradictions who craves approval but is terrified and draws away when it is offered. He hates the phoniness of the process but dutifully watches the show every night after taping. It exhausts, frustrates and consumes him.
The Larry Sanders Show set the high standards for other HBO classic productions like the Sopranos, which came in its wake.

~~~~~
+ The jokes are on-point, plenty of out louds and snickers, (no crying gut-busters though), even some innuendos, (see Mudsy from episode two at the dinner, total snagglepuss expy)
+ Voice actors could be way worse to legends in the field, (Frank Welker, John Dimaggio, Tom Kenny, Billy West, est.), really putting their all in to garner as close to the classic VA experience one can, definitely didn't scrimp
+ Utilization of minimal budget to create a visual aesthetic, (those background tones are gorgeous, with a rough hand-drawn hues to them), that brings me back to early Hanna-Barbara, but without the constant use of stock footage
+ Intro that will send you in a nostalgia trip, with top notch background music from musicians who did their homework
+ Enough to sink your teeth into for long-time fans who are on the pulse, (see episode two for a good jab at the scooby clones)
+ Great direction of the guest stars, where they have acted before or not. The directors and animators are using them aptly, integrating them into an episode better than half of the recent WB scooby movie plugs<br/><br/>CONS
~~~~~
<ul><li>Audio Special effects are missing here and there for emphasis, takes the wind out of some punch lines</li><li>Some of the aesthetics of older cartoon vibe feel can go a little far, as mention the lip syncing is off. Makes one, when noticing, if its done on purpose or due to budget. But due to the show being more of the on-point with the animations than off, makes me think of a missed point in a last draft. Minor nitpick though</li><li>Due to the imitation of The New Scooby-Doo Movies rather than Where are You, plot can end up being solved as 'because we must' rather than being able to follow the logical progression of the characters. A weak point, due to scooby doo cartoons being predictable, the joy was being able to follow how the characters can solve the mystery in a logical format, and why I lower it versus other contemporaries in the format.</li></ul><br/><br/>VERDICT

182,Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?, A return to form for the Scooby Doo series,"The last Scooby Doo TV show, ""Be Cool, Scooby Doo"", was poorly received and really lowered the reputation of the SD series, even though I personally think it isn't that bad and most of its flaws stemmed from behind the scenes drama. This show, ""Scooby Doo and Guess Who"", is a vast improvement over that series and is a great throwback to the classic show.<br/><br/>The show's animation is really crisp and has a vibrant color palette, but it also manages to capture the look and feel of a typical Hanna-Barbera show from the 60s. It even uses classic tactics such as the ""wheel o' feet"", and uses stock sound effects from the Hanna-Barbera library. It also references other Hanna-Barbera shows such as Magilla Gorilla, Speed Buggy, and the Funky Phantom. Unlike, BCSD, which tried to be comedy-focused, SDAGW focuses more on the story and characters, as well as the guest stars, and restores the characters back to their original personalities.<br/><br/>Speaking of the guest stars, the show usually does a really good job of inserting the stars into the story, and they work well off of the Scooby gang. They all seem like they're having the time of their life. However, sometimes they're underutilized. Like in the Abraham Lincoln episode, where he only appears for a few minutes, and most of the attention is on the Funky Phantom characters. My personal favorite stars that appeared were Wanda Sykes, Wonder Woman, Batman and Weird Al. I definitely recommend their episodes. Ricky Gervais ain't bad either, his dialogue is well-written and he never hesitates to make a snarky remark.<br/><br/>If you miss the classic Scooby Doo, this show is for you.

195,Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?, A rough start that keeps getting better,"So it's no mystery that the first episode isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser. But if you can get passed that you will find a diamond in the rough with this reboot.<br/><br/>The animators really took into account the fact that the previous series was a Family Guy parody series and decided to give the fans what they want: a very good animated series that honestly can contend with the animated movies (not Scoob). While not as fluid as the movies, it definitely is eye pleasing.<br/><br/>The jokes and format is definitely a callback to the original Guess Who. But instead of clevver dialogue jokes it goes for a lot of visual gags which is not bad choice. I am actually surprised with how much it gets away with.
Some episodes are definitely better than others and the fact that each episode is 22 minutes long instead of the original show that was 55 I believe, you can feel it in the pace: everything feels a little rushed. If it had like another 8 minutes, you could have more time to know your celebrity or antagonist, or mystery. More minutes can definitely help this series.<br/><br/>The one thing that sort of vexed me is that not every episode is a as good as the others, often times it's episodes where stars are complete and total parodies of themselves instead of just playing it straight. Like the episode with SIA, I honestly couldn't find any laughs in those visual jokes. Maybe because I don't know at all who Sia is except the singer with the funny hair. I am pretty sure people who know Sia in person on a personal level had a great time with that episode because they knew her as funny person, but I and most of the 99,9% of the audience don't know her that well and we end up scratching our heads as in: is this another person named Sia? Don't know....
Episodes that have actors like that should definitely avoid becoming a bad parody of the actors it interprets. Like if I have a huge funny celebrity in the room like Steve Carell in this I am definitely expecting some funny gags that define Steve Carell's career, I am definitely not into discovering that singer Gwen Stefani has a incredible passion for hand-puppets and is doing a play for children's hospital. No, have Gwen Stefani trying to organize a music concert for a children's hospital or something like that is the way to do it. Stick to your lane.
One episode that is definitely doing it right is the Ben &amp; Teller episode. One of the best this series had to offer. It did everything right. That is what this series needs to do as much as possiblem.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,9.0,19 December 2020

197,Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?, 70's Scoob - in a good way,I've just watch Scooby-Doo and Guess who? Batman! I started watching thinking that this was an old 70's cartoon but the crisp animation on a modern TV made me suspicious. And then Velma pulls out a smart phone. This has all the plotting and style and jokes of the classic old Scooby-doo but brought into the 21st century - and is all the better for it. Plus Kevin Conroy and (spoiler alert) Mark Hamil. Oh and the 60's Batmobile. Great fun. Definitely watching the rest of the series.,1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,17 September 2020

199,Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?, A Neat Cartoon That Returns To Basics,"Scooby-Doo's 50th anniversary has been a rough one. With the DTV film Curse Of The 13th Ghost getting mixed reviews (with some criticizing it for not being true to the show it was supposed to give closure) and the new DTV, Return To Zombie Island, getting the same results (with some criticizing it for repeating the same mistakes 13th Ghost made), it seems that it may not be a good anniversary for the great dane that has solved mysteries since 1969. However, Scooby-Doo And Guess Who? is the one gem of this rocky anniversary.<br/><br/>With this, Warner Bros. actually brought back the original designs, ditching the horrendous cartoony designs used for Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! (which only lasted for two seasons). What makes this show great is that it revisits the concept done in The New Scooby-Doo Moves: each episode, the Mystery Inc. gang is joined by a special guest to solve the mystery of the episode, which consisted of real-life celebrities from the time like Don Knotts and the Harlem Globetrotter to fictional characters like Batman &amp; Robin and Josie &amp; The Pussycats. However, this show uses more recent stars, like Weird Al Yankovic, Kenan Thompson, and Penn &amp; Teller, to fictional characters like Wonder Woman, Sherlock Holmes and even Steve Urkel.<br/><br/>While the episodes are thirty minutes long, it feels like the Scooby-Doo cartoons back then. The fictional characters are kept in-character (especially Steve Urkel, who is still a nerd and annoying). However, some episodes can be hit-or-miss (like the Wanda Sykes episode, which some people hated because of how Magilla Gorilla was done). But it is a good show that fixes a lot of mistakes done in Be Cool and manages to capture the feel of The New Scooby-Doo movies, even with thirty-minute episodes.",5 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,7 September 2019

206,Big City Greens, ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS AND WONDERFUL CHARACTERS!!!!,"I'm SOOOOOO glad I see more 10 star reviews than any other number!! These characters are some of my favorites in Disney Shows. Creative and fresh plot about a small family adapting to a new and harsher community. The show does well tackling subjects such as having a parent being in prison.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about characters:
Cricket- Our main character who is a rambunctious 10 year old boy. He's a good character but isn't the best one in this show.
Tilly- Cricket's hilarious and innocent older sister (slightly older). She is probably tied for best character. Her lines are so funny and original.
Bill- Cricket and Tilly's kind-hearted father. He is a farmer who doesn't adapt well to the new community and who cares for his crops and family.
Grandma/Alice- Cricket and Tilly's hilarious grandmother (Bill's mother). She is tied with Tilly for best character hands down. She is soooo funny and fresh.
Remy- Cricket's best friend who is a rich and innocent little boy. He doesn't know how to fend for himself, but wants to grow up. His parents keep him from having fun until one episode where they let him. He's a pretty funny and well written character.
Nancy- Cricket and Tilly's imprisoned mother who is divorced with Bill. She finally comes back in one episode and remains in the show. She is a good character and tries to be the best parent she can.
Gloria- Cricket's co-worker at a coffee shop (which Cricket works at because he trashes it and must pay off the debt). She's really funny and has a good little character arc. She's in most of the BEST episodes.<br/><br/>Overall, this show is a wonderful and refreshing treat. This Amphibia and Raven's Home are the only good shows left for Disney. If you're looking for episodes that show off a good light or just some great episodes, here are some:<br/><br/>Axin' Saxon
Coffee Quest
Uncaged
Urban Legend

The show has a very simple premise about a small country family moving into the city, and they have to learn about the every day life of city folk. This makes for a simple yet hilarious show with so many future plot opportunities, as well as leaving plenty of space for character development. Big City Greens has a very nice character lineup as well, the Green family all deeply care about each other, and I love the overall joyful atmosphere of the show. The character designs are also quite interesting, usually characters without noses don't look too good in my opinion, but this show makes it work very nicely.

I can tell the people who work on the show all care very much for their product and just want to entertain and show off their creativity!

216,Big City Greens, A Great Disney comedy,"Only the first half of season 1 has been released so far, despite that I find myself intrigued with what the show has to offer. Cricket Green, our main character, is a troublemaker. However, he always learns his lesson which makes him a very likable character. Tilly Green is the main protagonists sister. She is the most quotable character in the series. She makes the series more enjoyable by just being on screen. Their dad Bill is a great father, which is surprising considering the father is usually the dumb one in these kinds of shows. The Grandma, Alice, could be annoying at times, However she after around episode 6 she turned from a stubborn, mean old lady, to a funny loving character. My favorite character, Gloria, is the next door neighbor of the Greens. She is Crickets Co-worker. She starts of as the Squidward of the series, but later on she becomes Cricket's friend. Overall the show is amazing. From Comedic episodes like ""Blue Tater"" and ""Paint Misbehavin"" to heartfelt episodes like ""Family Legacy"" and ""Phoenix Rises"".

228,Sonny with a Chance," A Legitimately Funny Show With Ironic Camp--A ""30 Rock"" for Tweens!","I do not want to see this show die on the Disney Channel. I think it's one of the few shows in a good while which could have a good influence on young people... also, it's pretty darn funny!<br/><br/>Recently I found myself in a state of dissolution with the Disney Channel. Whenever I find myself flipping to the channel all I see were increasingly younger and oversexed teens (and even preteens) on shows that feel like they are written by people with the same condition. I am extraordinarily happy that I happened to turn on the television during the shows premier.<br/><br/>I found ""Sonny with a Chance"" completely refreshing.<br/><br/>The sketch with-in-the-show was immediately funny with ironic camp and legitimate humor--bringing back the simple and funny physical comedy ""tween"" shows have been lacking these days without feeling forced or dissonant.<br/><br/>I was not surprised to find the producer of the show was also the producer of the sketch show ""All That"" which aired on Nickelodeon. As has been frequently said, ""the best comedy comes from the truth."" Thus this show isn't filled with over dramatic prepubescent boys and girls trying to attract the opposite sex with sexist or otherwise offensive pick-up lines. It's a simple comedy that does it's job exceptionally well and doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Just as ""All That"" was an SNL for tweens (which as I recall I found much funnier than SNL at the time), I see ""Sonney with a Chance"" being the ""30 Rock"" for the tweens of today (though doubtfully will be better than ""30 Rock"" at any time.)<br/><br/>I believe all of the actors do still need to find their groove, but that's actually true of every show I've ever seen. At the time of writing this, three episodes have been released. I'd recommend watching at least the first two and hanging on to the show from there to see it improve from what I think is already a show more than ""solid.""<br/><br/>A note, I have mentioned this as a show for ""Tweens"" but I, myself, am rapidly approaching my 19th year.",50 out of 63 found this helpful.,,15 February 2009
229,Sonny with a Chance, Greatest Disney show ever!!!!,I can't thank Disney enough for making this show. I love to watch Disney shows because they are really the most descent for kids and teen. But it does bother me a lot its cheesiness sometimes.... which is easy to see in overrated lame shows like HM and WOWP.<br/><br/>Anyway.... SWAC was supposed to be nothing new. Actually it was Disney brand new hit that made me a true fan of this channel and kept me waiting every week for the new episode.<br/><br/>I got to admit season 1 was really much better than season 2 (except for some few episodes) and has much less Disney cheesiness but.... still season 2 was very pleasing to watch.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the show's 3rd season. I hope Disney will bring back the show's charm and perfection in it again. I even wish the show to last for more than 4 seasons. It is the only reason that got me stuck to Disney channel.,8 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,20 February 2011
230,Sonny with a Chance, I was pleasantly surprised,"I found SWAC one night when I was bored out of my mind and felt like watching some Disney Channel shows off Netflix. I found season one of Sonny With A Chance and decided to check it out for laughs and as a time waster. The first episode did just that, I didn't enjoy it anymore than I enjoy Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, or any other ""good"" Disney Channel shows. However, I chose to watch the second episode and soon found myself suppressing laughter to keep my parents from waking up. I ended up watching the entire season one and the first three episodes of season two in one night. I enjoyed it greatly and, though I was exhausted from getting very little sleep, I spent the next day reliving the episodes. Although i do enjoy SWAC, there are some areas where it could use a bit of help. The part of Sonny is played by Demi Lovato. She plays a smiley, bubbly girl. Her acting covers this easily, but wavers when it comes to the more serious, less comedic aspects of the show. Luckily the show is a comedy so Demi is generally good. Nico and Grady, played by Brandom Smith and Doug Brochu, are two classic Disney characters. They love money, girls, and food. They're the Disney Duo that we've seen in so many Disney shows. Like Demi, their acting is mostly good but does have a few flaws here and there. Zora, a strange and crazy character played by Allisyn Ashley Arm, is a 11 year old that stars on So Random! the SNL for teenagers that the characters act on. Although Zora can get a bit annoying at times, I usually don't mind her. Allisyn's acting isn't perfect in any respects, but she's a young girl and we can only expect so much. Sonny's rival So Random! star is Tawni, a blonde that's...well, a blonde. She and Sonny have a couple touching moments, regardless of their slight dislike for one another. Tawni is played by Tiffany Thornton. In my opinion, Tiffany is the best actress on the show. She's understandable, believable, and very funny. I usually don't enjoy her sort of character, but Tiffany really makes me smile. Chad Dylan Cooper, Sonny's love interest, is played by Sterling Knight, whom I'd hardly heard of until SWAC. He, like Tiffany possesses plenty of talent. His character is self-absorbed at times and yet really sweet at other points. His dynamic with Sonny is so incredible and cute, and their relationship isn't the normal Disney ""boy meets girl. They're perfect for each other, but can't be together due to some secret (popstar, wizard, psychic, etc). Finally the girl comes clean and they live happily ever after"". Instead both Sonny and Chad are in denial about their feelings. It's cute. In the end, SWAC surprised and delighted me. Looks like Disney finally found a good show.",16 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,4 April 2010
231,Sonny with a Chance, Big applause to Sonny With a Chance from Egypt,"Well, many of my friends kept telling me about how amazing this show is and I did not want to believe I would enjoy a cheesy Disney production anytime. Anyway I decided to try so I went to SonnyWithAChanceLand's Channel on the ""You Tube"" as my friends told me and I have to say I wasn't just surprised I was actually shocked. I couldn't believe it is a Disney show. I even went to its Wikipedia page to read more about it and was pleased by the high No. of viewers and the wild popularity of the show. Then I came here using the link and I can't believe I am writing a review about it. Disney has done a great job in hiring all these new kids to their payroll. They really have some quality people working there. This show does not only have talented cast, clever scrip, hilarious jokes, shinny set, it also has a breathtaking romance between the very cute Sonny Munroe and the extremely handsome Chad Dylan Cooper. I am so proud to say I am the biggest Disney fan from now on. I might even start to watch its new shows like ""Good luck Charlie"" and ""Shake it up"" although they don't really look as charming as this one. To be honest, I already have watched some episodes of the famous Hannah Montana and Wizards of Waverly place on mbc3 TV channel before. Both weren't bad but weren't good enough either to keep me watching. They have made me get the wrong idea of Disney cheesiness ever since. But still as I said they not bad at all for kids. Finally, this show will amaze you in every aspect except for its 1st and 3rd episodes. They were average.

My favorite thing is the Chad/Sonny thing going on. This is the first original Disney Channel show in a while. This is also the first show with what seems like an ongoing romance. So, in a nutshell, this show is amazing :) It's about time Disney comes out with a show that doesn't have anything to do with keeping a secret (Wizards of Waverly Place, Thats So Raven, Hannah Montana). With every episode, it keeps getting better and better. I found myself counting down days until the next new episode. So yeah, go SWaC!",19 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,16 April 2009
233,Sonny with a Chance, A revival to Disney's turn to bad shows,"Finally, Disney is coming up with more original ideas for their shows, and incorporating better actors. Well, the title is pretty cheesy, Sonny is the main character, so like all Disney shows, it has to be in the title. The reason that i gave this show an 8 is because it comes off as a little rushed. On the first episode Sonny's all ""O.M.F.G i can't believe i'm here!!!"" but then in the second episode she acts like she's been there for a couple years and got used to it all. But, discarding that, it's a great show, showing that Disney could be fully revived someday. With that said, this show show is a great addition to the franchise.

235,Sonny with a Chance, The Best Disney Show Out There!!!!!!,"This is a very excellent show! I really enjoy it. Unlike a lot of the shows today on Disney, this one is actually funny.

They really have some quality people working there. It is also <br/><br/>Not only is this the best show on Disney Channel, it is the best show on television. It just goes to show that a show can be funny without the sex and drugs and cussing.

I find myself laughing out loud frequently during every episode. The whole rivalry between the two shows is hilarious--the different characters are so over-the-top that it makes me smile. This is the best show Disney Channel has brought out since Hannah Montana. On the plus side, Sonny isn't overly sassy like some of the Disney Channel characters (Hannah/Miley isn't always respectful to those around her, though I still like the show). The skits from So Random are hilarious, too (I especially liked the Poo-merang).",25 out of 31 found this helpful.,10.0,2 March 2009

239,Sonny with a Chance, I'm obsessed with this show!,"I gotta admit, I really thought I wasn't gonna like this show. But after watching the first two episodes, I became obsessed with it. I really like the idea of a ""show-within-a-show"" theme, and So Radom (the show that they're on) reminds me of All That (which I loved). And one of my favorite parts of SWAC is their ""rival"" show Mackenzie Falls, and it's really hilarious watching the two shows fight. The cast is great, Demi Lovato is adorable as Sonny, Tiffany Thornton is great playing the diva actress Tawni Hart, and the two guys playing Nico and Grady totally remind me of Drake and Josh. But I have to say my favorite character/actor is Sterling Knight who plays Chad Dylan Cooper. Chad Dylan Cooper reminds me of one of those guys who at first just pretend to be self-centered but are really nice and sweet in the end. Sterling Knight is funny as his character and he portrays it well. And if he and Sonny don't get together soon i'm going to be really, really angry. SWAC may not have had the best pilot, but it's better and better every episode, so watch it!",26 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,16 February 2009
240,Sonny with a Chance, Sonny with a Chance...has a chance!,"At first, I thought that this would be another very, very bad Hannah Montana rip-off. However, after watching two of the first episodes of SWAC, I must say that the outcome was quite surprising. It had potential to become an actual, decent Disney channel show for both kids, teens and adults alike. The first episode, I have to admit though was quite boring and basically very typical...Disney. The first episode was very predictable; the character moves in, feels very excited, meets strange new people, some good, some bad,a bad person did something mean to her, she feels very insecure about herself, she wants to give up on her dreams,she remembers to believe in herself, she triumphs!!<br/><br/>Though don't let the suckishness of the first episode get into you. If you held on until the second episode, you could see that the storyline got way better. The lines were a lot funnier, the scenes were way more original, and the actors were somehow better.<br/><br/>In general, I have only one advice to give for the people working on SWAC (actors, producers, writers etc.)and that is to be consistent. They have to keep the episodes funny all throughout and try to avoid leaving out awkward moments . There were parts where I would literally laugh my head off, and there were some parts where the jokes were so cheesy I would seriously go, ""What the heck was that?"" The same thing goes to the actors. Demi is a really good actress, and she could really pull most of the jokes off. But there are some parts where I feel that she is overacting (this applies to the actress who plays Zora as well).<br/><br/>So far this show is onto a good start. I have already seen the episode guide for SWAC, and I have a feeling that this thing is just gonna get better and better...hopefully.",23 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,14 February 2009
241,Sonny with a Chance, I can't live without SWAC!!!!,"Sonny With a Chance is the only Disney series that you can count as a hit since ""Even Stevens"" and ""That's so Raven"". I actually thought that it was going to be another miss for Disney (WOWP and HM). I was completely wrong. It became my best Family show ever. I believe that it's going to go far!!! I loved the part where they show the live studio audience most of the time. It's a good touch to the show.<br/><br/>Demi Lovato is such an adorable rising star. Sonny would never be the same without her playing the role. Sterling Knight is simply amazing in this show. They both made the best chemistry I ever seen on television. Tiffany is very pretty and talent. Her interactions with Sonny is hilarious. Brandon and Doug are really funny characters. I love their adventures. Finally, Allisyn Ashley Arm is funny in a weird way.<br/><br/>Well, beside the acting.... the writers have done an amazing job creating this series, the storyline is interesting, the scripts are clever, the set is colorful and shinny and finally the jokes are so darn funny.<br/><br/>I really really love this show but I wish Disney don't rush in writing its episodes like what happened in season 2. Season 2 was funny but not as hilarious and charming as the 1st.<br/><br/>Dying for season 3 premier.... I can't live without SWAC.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,20 February 2011
242,Sonny with a Chance, amazing show,"i think that this show is one of the best I've seen on Disney in a long time. tiffany or tawni is an amazing character; i love how her and sonny pretend to be enemies but in reality they have become the best of friends, its also thrilling and suspenseful to see what they say next shes a very complicated character but its fun to try and catch up to her. demi is very radiant and exciting in this show, some people say that she could do much much better but i say that she makes her character become herself and not a lot of actors and actresses her age can do that; its a pretty awesome gift to have if you ask me. nicos kind of the kid who gets all the girls in his dreams haha but in reality he tries to get as many as he can but many times does not succeed. gradys kind of refreshing he lightens up the scenes with his personality hes one of those chubby kids that always seems to put a smile on your face. sterling knight aka chad Dylan cooper is my personal favorite and i bet a lot of young teens could relate to him. he's a pretty sensitive guy but since he doesn't want anyone to know the soft side of him he acts like a jerk. he tries to deny that he has feelings for sonny but everyone who watches the show can tell he does. its amazing and a ton of fun to watch this show and watch these young people grow. the only thing that this show could use more of is new episodes maybe a new character or co-star and they need to get chad and sonny together all ready. who ever says this show needs more than it already has obviously has no idea what a good show is about. this is the perfect series for any age. the stiffness of the acting just adds to the excitement. everyone from sonny with a chance, keep on rocking that stage don't let any review tear your show apart; i for one have faith in you they're just bitter :)",20 out of 25 found this helpful.,,22 June 2009
243,Sonny with a Chance," favorite show, ten stars !","I'm not going to deny that I REALLY underestimated this show. When I first saw the previews for it in January/February, I figured ""alright, since Demi's in it, i'll give it a shot."" (I'm a HUGE Demi fan(= ) But after giving the show a chance, I have become ridiculously obsessed with it! Even excluding my bias opinions about Demi and Sterling, I honestly think it's the best and funniest show on Disney channel. It has both funny and cute moments (cute moments between Sterling's character, Chad, and Demi's character, Sonny.) And any show with those two things in them is usually good for me. But what really got me interested in the show was the show - within- the - show thing. It seemed to catch my attention the most. And as season one has progressed, the episodes, in my opinion, have gotten much better. You can see a better bond between the cast, and it's really helped the episodes! To be honest, i'm wayyy to obsessed with this and I know a lot of stuff about the show that people don't find out until a while later. So, if you want to know anything, I can probably help you out:) If you don't really watch this show, and stopped watching it after the first few episodes, I'd start watching it again. The first episodes are no where near as good as the newer ones: Sonny in the Kitchen With Dinner, Sonny In the Middle, etc.<br/><br/>SONNY WITH A CHANCE ROCKS!",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,8 September 2009
244,Sonny with a Chance, Better than Hannah Montana,"The pilot was horrible. Period.<br/><br/>However, Disney has a problem with that...maybe that's why they show 2 episodes at once. So I hung in there for the next episode.<br/><br/>It was funny. And unpredictable- I honestly did not expect the Sterling Knight to be the type of character he was, nor did I expect the show to end like it did. Usually Disney gets all their conflicts resolved by the end of the show, but obviously SWAC is going to be different.<br/><br/>And honestly, it was a thousand times better than the most recent season of Hannah Montana.<br/><br/>Here's hoping for more improvement from Sonny With a Chance!",39 out of 53 found this helpful.,7.0,14 February 2009
245,Sonny with a Chance, Sonny With a Chance- Really good.,"Sonny With a Chance is one of the best shows on Disney Channel. I personally think it is better than Hannah Montana and Suite Life on Deck. I watch both of these shows, but I think that this show is the funniest. The pilot is a slow start to the show. It basically introduces the main characters and sets the scenes for the other episodes. The rest of the show afterward, however, is very entertaining. Although some of the humor is a little cheesy, overall, the show is great. Give the show a chance. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Demi Lovato plays Sonny and her acting is great. Her faces are hilarious and her character is enthusiastic and peppy. My Favorite, however, would have to be Chad Dylan Cooper, played by Sterling Knight. He's a mix between Cody Linley's Character in Hannah Montana, Jake, and Chad Michael Murray's old Gilmore Girls character, Tristan. He's confidant and cocky, with a good side to him. He's funny, but he has an attitude. Sterling does a great job playing this character. He and Demi's character have great chemistry, as enemies and love interests. I especially look forward to their interactions and their relationship growing in future episodes.",35 out of 48 found this helpful.,9.0,28 February 2009

The acting is not that bad. It could use some work, but I've seen much worse. The jokes don't seem that forced. Some of them are unfunny, but I did find my self laughing at some of the jokes in the second episode. The show in itself is a cute idea. It reminds me of the Amanda Show. The characters have potential. I thought they were cute and somewhat original. I'm not saying the show is perfect, but it isn't as bad as people say it is. I give it a 7.",30 out of 42 found this helpful.,,12 February 2009
247,Sonny with a Chance," Not the best, but not horrible.","""Camp Rock"" and ""As The Bell Rings"" were the only things I had ever seen Demi Lovato act in and I anxiously awaited the premiere of ""Sonny With A Chance."" I didn't set any expectations, I didn't want to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm going to have to give the BEST ACTRESS award to Tiffany Thornton who plays Tawni. I think she is probably one of the better actors in this series, she has great comic timing and she is very pretty, too. I don't have many complaints about her, if any at all.<br/><br/>And despite a personal love for Demi Lovato's singing and her person in general, I was not particularly fond of her acting. I think she is a wonderful actress but I believe she could be much, much better. She has specific scenes when she is a top notch performer, and others when she really needs help to make it believable. Her character is funny, though, and has a lot of great lines.<br/><br/>As for the character of Grady, played by Doug Brochu, I believe that he is very funny. Brochu is a wonderful actor and has seemingly good timing.<br/><br/>Sterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper is also a great actor, but I believe he could do better. I think that the Chad Dylan Cooper character could be written in to be funnier, because the show is a comedy.<br/><br/>The actress who plays Portlyn, Jillian Murray, is very, very funny and I hope she appears in more episodes, although she doesn't play a major role, I believe she is a good addition to the show and to the shows comedy.<br/><br/>Brandon Smith, as Nico, is a good actor and his character is very funny. But I believe he could be better, though. His character is very much a stereotypical Disney guy, same as the guys in Hannah Montana or Cory In The House. He's a guy that kind of gets really obsessive when it comes to girls, a bit obnoxious, if I might add. However, despite that, I think Smith is a great actor and Nico is a good character.<br/><br/>Allisyn Ashley Arm, Zora, is somewhat an obnoxious character. I think she is somewhat unnecessary when it comes to the show in general, but she is still a decent actress. She's somewhat hyperactive which can become very annoying after a while, but her lines are very funny and her delivery is excellent.<br/><br/>The show in general is very funny. It has great lines, along with some decent, yet mediocre, acting. I believe the writing, as well as the acting, could be more sophisticated and it was guided towards the younger crowd, which was something I wasn't expecting considering the actual plot of the show. The rivalry between the two shows, So Random and Mackenzie Falls, is somewhat stereotypical, one that you would see in any other television show when there is a rivalry between shows, and is somewhat predictable. I think the show's writing is very simple and they need to be more complex when they are writing. But it wasn't a bad show. It wasn't the best show in the entire world, but it wasn't horrible, either. I hope that the show evolves more and becomes a bit less predictable and more directed to all audiences, instead of just the younger crowd.",33 out of 49 found this helpful.,7.0,8 February 2009

I do not understand the negative critics and how this show is rated in the mid 6s, it should be at least averaging in the high 7s. I'd hesitated watching this for a longtime due to the imdb ratings, but so glad I ""caved"" - I decided to just test the first episode and ended up doing a binge watching, that I thoroughly enjoyed. Each episode has its own stand alone story that had me several times per episode laughing and saying « did she/he really just say that? ») but season 1 also pulls the viewer into a few longer/deeper story arcs: Stromare's guilt about somehow being responsible for the death of his stunt partner (Reeves), the development of the Glans/Stromare partnership/friendship (with Sun achingly wanting to be part of this family), Stromare trying to rebuild a relationship with his adult daughter. While Reeves character is essential and he plays him with sufficient tongue in cheek, he is not the standout performance. Glans and Stromare's characters are the most developed/mult-dimensional and their acting and chemistry make the show.

I've waited for so long for them to be on screen and as a fan im disappointed. Again I like the show but it should have been called something else,31 out of 44 found this helpful.,9.0,4 December 2020
276,The Hardy Boys, A Good Update and Should be Watched: Overall an Enjoyable Mystery Series,"I have been a Hardy Boys fan since I was ten and bought The Tower Treasure in 1956 at our local department store. In the first few Hardy Boy books, the boys rode motorcycles and carried 45's. As I continued to read the series, the boys became somewhat more wholesome. And younger, in the first few books Frank was 18 and Joe was 17; suddenly they were 16 and 15. Strangely, the age shift didn't bother me as the adventure kept me in thrall.<br/><br/>I like this version even though the city name is wrong, it should be Bayport; and I'm not happy with the age difference between Frank and Joe. The story here is good with some genuine mystery and menace. It's as much Hardy Boys as any and better than any of the other TV series that borrowed the name. I hope for a second series, but I fear a few of the actors will age out quickly.<br/><br/>I used to write fan letters to F.W.Dixon in care of the publisher. Someone always wrote back, and the letters were signed, F. W. Dixon. My son read my collection of books. And now I am hoping my grandchildren will read the books and become fans. Maybe watching the Hulu version of The Hardy Boys will spark an interest.<br/><br/>I do have few problems with this series. The story is good and the acting is fine. However, I have some casting issue. Rohan Campbell, who is 23, looks 30 and is too old for Frank Hardy. Alexander Elliot, Joe Hardy, looks 16 and not 12 and should be Frank. And Bea Santos, Aunt Trudy, who is 30 and looks 20 and should be dating Frank. Other than that, I do like the series. It has a nice noir quality to it that helps create just the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>And for the truly ancient, like me, watch for grandmother Gloria. She is played by Linda Thorson, who had the unenviable job of replacing Diana Rigg, Mrs.Emma Peel, on The Avengers. The TV show staring Rigg and Patrick Macnee as John Steed. ""Mrs.Peel, we're needed.""",22 out of 32 found this helpful.,8.0,5 December 2020
277,The Hardy Boys, Brings back memories,"Growing up in 1960s Britain FW Dixon's (nom de plume) Hardy Boys books were not recommended by teachers, who considered them vulgar. Just the information we needed to secretly read them ALL, along with Blyton &amp; WE Johns. So it's delightful to see the Hardy adventures at last dramatized for a more diffuse market, though these stories will always principally be for a younger audience - and correspondingly tactful in the portrayal of sensitive issues, which is commendable. Compared with 1960 Children's TV or Odeon/Gaumot Saturday Cinema Club (aka the flea pit) this production's not bad, but it'll probably not get an Oscar either.",18 out of 27 found this helpful.,8.0,5 December 2020
278,The Hardy Boys, Fantastic mystery show not to be missed!!!!,I have been a huge fan of hardy boys since age 10 and was thrilled to hear a tv show based on them. Whilst the age of characters have been changed the story is updated with a great sense of mystery and a 80s like setting that makes working in the mysteries even more enjoyable where now days people rely on tabs and phones for indie nation which really takes the fun out of mysteries.

284,The Hardy Boys, Low Effort,"I loved these books growing up, and still own quite a few of them. When I heard a new series was in production, I was cautiously optimistic. I suppose I should have known better.<br/><br/>Not a single facet of this show resembles the source material in any particular. It is so far removed from the novels that I can only surmise the producers were deliberately going out of their way to spit in Frank Dixon's eye, and in the faces of his fans as well. Such deviation from the books might have been bearable if what was served up instead was at least reasonably good television, but apparently that is too much to ask.<br/><br/>The production values for this show are abysmal. The sound editing is so poor that the dialogue is inaudible at some points, which doesn't mean much, as the dialogue is mostly nonsensical even when you can hear it.<br/><br/>The show is full of useless side characters and irritating main characters, who share their names and nothing else with the characters who populated Dixon's books. It provides its audience with a ""mystery"" wrapped in an enigma, but it was wrapped by a five-year-old, and the enigma is ripped in a dozen places so you can see what's coming. The only thing with more holes in it is the plot. The writers attempt to tantalize us with threads that go nowhere and clues that serve no purpose other than to generate useless side plots to fill certain episodes while doing nothing to advance the main story.<br/><br/>If the writers had simply stuck to the source material, there is enough of it to have provided several seasons of reasonably good television. Instead, they abandoned it in favor of trying to spin a season-long story arc, which is of course the fashion for binge-model television. It's too bad they lack the skill or creative resources to pull it off.",19 out of 35 found this helpful.,1.0,6 December 2020

286,The Hardy Boys, Up to ep two...,"...and I'm trying NOT to binge-watch so I can make this last as long as possible. I've read all the rewritten blue spines &amp; a good chunk of the original texts, along with many of the Casefiles &amp; the current ""Adventures"" series; I loved the Disney serial &amp; the 1990s Nelvana adaptation, and I'm a huge fan of the 1970s series.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS NEW ADAPTATION.<br/><br/>This series is also done by Nelvana, and like the 1990s show, the writing is sharp, the mystery engrossing, and the casting is awesome. Frank &amp; Joe act like real brothers; the Hardys, like a real family. The current eps feel like an origin story - how did two normal kids get into solving mysteries? In all the other TV adaptations, the Hardys' mother Laura is written out, or ignored, or mentioned only in passing; in the books, she's a non-entity, there just to bake cookies &amp; occasionally worry over her boys. Here, she's an integral part of the Mystery, with her death kicking off the plot, as the brothers get pulled deeper &amp; deeper into the whys.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of sly references to the books - ep 1 has Frank &amp; Joe recreating the iconic cover of ""Secret of the Old Mill"" as they eavesdrop on their dad - with a mix of tech and styles that make the new series feel timeless. The Brothers ride bikes that look straight out of the 1950s, they play video games that look like first generation 1990s Nintendo, the local grocery doubles as an old-fashioned malt-shop, Fenton wears a by-gods trenchcoat &amp; fedora right out of the 1940s pulp era, they use modern smartphones, the cars look torn from the 1970s, etc. Even better, they've brought back the diversity of cast/culture of the original texts, updated to 2010's standards.<br/><br/>In other words, this is a true ""whole-family"" show: aimed at the middle-schoolish &amp; YA readers of the various book series, with plenty to engross &amp; capture older fans of the Brothers.

The mother dies early in episode 1 and the father, before they even put dirt on her grave, decides to further traumatize the boys by moving away for the summer. While just a summer break, the house already has a for lease sign. This is a small example of ridiculous writing to advance a storyline to nowhere.

299,The Hardy Boys, 80's needs to be done correctly in order to sell the illusion.,"So far I am enjoying the show but there are a few issues with the 80's set dressing that needs to be corrected. The story takes place in the 80's but there are pieces of technology in the set design that break the illusion. In episode 1, the boys and their dad move to their aunts home in Bridgeport. The TV in her living room is an early 2000's Samsung Dynaflat CRT TV. In her attic there's a early 2000's VHS-C camcorder in the background of one of the shots. Also in the attic the boys use an RCA VR546, silver, center loading VCR from 2002 to watch some old home videos. All CRT TV's from that era have a very distinctive bump in the front and flat CRT's didn't arrive until the early 2000's. All VCR's from the 80's (if front loading and not top loading) always loaded from the left side of the VCR and not the center. A simple google search by whoever is doing the set dressing could help them avoid these mistakes. Overall if you can overlook these and some other errors the show is entertaining.",9 out of 21 found this helpful.,7.0,6 December 2020
300,All That," The old cast was perfect, the new cast is simply terrible","Back when this show started in 1995, the cast, mainly the players like Keenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denburg, and Kel Mitchell, were all very talented and extremely funny, which made All That one of my favorite shows on Nick.<br/><br/>However, fast forward to 2005....and it's simply not the case. What was once a smart, funny show has now been replaced with a bunch of talentless teens running around on stage, pretty much saying ""Look at us, we're funny! Laugh at us!"" I watched an episode of All That on tape from 1995, then caught a new one from 2005. The differences are vast and very big. The 2005 All That episode was filled with unfunny sketches, and actors and actresses who were basically trying waaaaaaaaaay to hard to be funny and not succeeding in the least. (It's pretty much the same thing as the god awful ""Amanda Show"".)

309,All That, 1994-2000: The Golden Years; 2001-????: The Humiliating End,"From 1995-2000 ""All That"" was a guaranteed good experience, and you were almost guaranteed at least 2 good laughs throughout the entire show. It showcased new comical talents such as Lori Beth Denberg; Kel Mitchell &amp; Kenan Thompson; and Danny Tamberelli. The actors and actresses of the first 6 seasons truly seemed dedicated to the comedy aspect of the show, and were not timid of making fools of themselves for the cause of a smile on the audiences faces.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2001 through the present years I feel that ""All That"" currently is just the final episodes before the humiliating end. Although certain talents show promise (ex. Giovonnie Samuels) the actors and actresses are not well enough developed to pull off the sometimes intense comedy. The thespians are not developed well enough, and are not devoted entirely enough to pull off such great comedy as the past season. Although I do believe that the thespians are well enough to blame for the recent downfall of this classic comedy sketch show, they cannot vary well carry this show without good writing. When the original cast was completely fired, all the writers and Kevin Kopelow left, foreseeing the end. New writers and an executive producer were hired and the series continued as it is.<br/><br/>So I conclude by stating that the Golden Years of ""All That"" are over, and what we are left with in the little time that the series will probably continue is the humiliating end to a once classic show.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,,16 December 2005

It was only until recently The N started to re-run All That. I thought that was great because the last time I watched it I was 10 years old (4 years ago). When I was younger I thought this show was very funny. I loved almost all the characters (except the new ones, i.e Jamie Lynn Spears). It was until I was 10 years old I stopped watching it because of new characters, and I didn't like to adapt to new things. I watched the first few minutes of an episode, and I was shocked. I just couldn't laugh! It was not funny at all! I watched Pete and Pete, Ren and Stimpy, and Rocko's Modern Life and I thought those shows were great! But I was surprised at how lame and washed out the skits were. I couldn't sit through the whole show . I felt bad that I couldn't laugh because I wanted to, but my humor has changed dramatically. My humor hasn't changed towards any other Nickelodeon show. Even the movie Good Burger was funny and I believe it was written by the same person. So if you are older than 10 years old than don't bother to watch.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,5.0,11 July 2008
315,All That," Didn't watch it in '95, but wish i had","I never watched All That in 1995, but I really wish I had. Now, i see repeats from the good ol' days with Lori Beth Denberg doing vital information that was usually funny, and i would be graced with the presence of a Goodburger Skit. I loved what they would do with the awkward little bald guy in the beginning. I think his name was Kevin. Can't remember, I was like 5, but i do remember that the skits were very funny, and the material was fresh. <br/><br/>Now, it is nothing but total crap. Then, there was Kenan Thompson, (who can be seen now on SNL because he was funny!!), Kel Mitchell, Lori Beth Denberg, then later, Amanda Bynes and Danny tamborelli. Now, I am forced to watch an endless purgatory of Kyle Sullivan, or Jack DeSena being a retarded butthead who is afraid of the color orange. <br/><br/>The skits today are the same thing from 10 years ago, except instead of people who were naturally funny, they are played by annoying kids trying to scream for attention. I think the only reason they hired them is because they would act for minimum wage. The randy Quench moron with the fake Brooklyn accent is just a remake of Kel Mitchell's REPAIRMAN MAN MAN. And what about Christina Kirkman? It's pretty bad when the only reason some one is on TV is because they won a contest. <br/><br/>I may be wrong, but doesn't it seem like they were trying to replace the real performers with people that look and act kind of like them? Kyle Sullivan reminds me a lot of Danny Tamborelli. Jack DeSena reminds me of Josh Server for some reason. It makes me sad to think that a once good show could sink so low. I enjoyed the 100th episode. It was perfect. The Players from the mid 90s and the players from the late 90s went together perfectly. It was a last hurrah for All That.<br/><br/>If you liked All That 10 years ago, turn to SNL. You can see Kenan Thompson, Jason Sudeikis, Tina Fey, Horatio Sanz, and like, 15 other people. And the skits are still fresh, not like the dried out, overused cliché's from All That.<br/><br/>1995 rating: 10/10 2005 rating -2/10.

316,All That, The original All That from 1995-1998 are the best!,"In my opinion, The Original All That from 1995-1998 were the best years for Nickelodeon! It was fresh, original, and most of all is funny! After the replacement of ""My Brother and Me"" (which was replaced by Roundhouse and lasted for 13 episodes)on the 8:30pm time slot. SNICK decided they needed their third sketch-comedy to come on their scheldule. It was Michael Tolin, Brian Robbins, and Dan Scheidner (Both from Head of the Class)first production they had for Nickelodeon with the launch of their production company Tolin/Robbins Productions.<br/><br/>
During those years it was the kind of sketches where you can laugh on whenever is parodies of all comics and shows from time to time and lots of stuff along with the theme song by TLC. It's like the Saturday Night Live for kids and teens! But in a kinder way. It was the time when it became a hit for Nickelodeon!<br/><br/>
The Original Cast Members: Angelique Bates, Lori Beth Denburg, Katrina Johnson, Kel Mitchell, Alisa Reyes, Josh Server, and Kenan Thompson. Along with the Bald head Stage Manager Kevin Kopolow.<br/><br/>
The Sketches: Superdude, Cooking with Randy and Mandy, Talk with Dr. K, Okrah, Mrs. Piddlin's Class, Good Burger, Cereal Critics, Cheese Police, The Lemonade Stand Girl, The Island Girls, Coach Greeton, Vital Information with Lori Beth Denburg, Repairmanmanmanman! and more.<br/><br/>
The Later Cast Members: Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli, Leon Frickerson, and Christy Knowings. With the helping of Zachery Lemore Tricia Dickson in 1997.<br/><br/>
Their sketches: Ask Ashley, Star Drek, Whateverr, Fat Cop, Have a good time with Leroy and Fuzz!, and more.<br/><br/>
Of course after the show is the musical guests that was from Rap and R&amp;B. But let's not get into this one.<br/><br/>
At that point those were the best years of All That with the moving from Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida to the Aquariums Theatre now known as Nickelodeon On Sunset in Hollywood, California. When the show got popular, both Kenan Thoompson and Kel Mitchell became famous as they had their own spin-off called ""Kenan &amp; Kel"" in 1996 as well as their own movie that inspired the sketch from that show called ""Good Burger"" in 1997. It was the years when it was fresh and fun and that's how it was cause it was ALL THAT!<br/><br/>

However, in the 2001-2002 season, the quality of the writing dropped through the floor.  It's slowly working its way upward, but the burden of little Spears's lack of talent and the overdependence on adults in sketches will keep the show from reaching the greatness it once had.

318,All That," The best live-action series Nickelodeon had, until the new cast came","OK, I remember this show being a golden part of my childhood, I laughed hard back then and watching the reruns I still do. Kel Mitchel was one of the greatest actors in the show. It may have had cheap effect but it was all for the good of comedy, the actors unique style of acting made this show funny and I am still smiling. It was all good until the new cast came there and many new sketches were being preformed. I laughed at some of them and some not, but it was not as good as the old cast. I prefer the old cast far more than the new one. But I had to understand that they grew up and had to move to new places like in movies. When the new cast arrived the show was kept in a fair length for comedy, but then it got canceled. Dan Schneider should not have done that. But this place was where all the new superstars started; the old cast started good and continued to be good in movies and in other series.

All That is trying too hard these days. When people try too hard to be funny, it's no longer funny. Even if they had to be replaced by new, younger actors, why couldn't the old ones take the places of the writers? They could've kept All That cool. Now the only cool thing is their theme song (but only because it's the only thing that hasn't changed). Nickelodeon has basically been flushed down the toilet like a dead goldfish, and that's not cool. All That used to be the best show on Nick. It makes me wonder what the world is coming to.

321,All That, Funny TV show that seems to lag after a while...,"All That is a unique kids' show with many kinds of sketches (some that repeat) and a few distinct young preteens and teens. But as time goes by, there are only FOUR sketches... they should dump the music video (I'll get to that), and add more like Monty Python did.  It doesn't have to be intelligent, just fun.<br/><br/>Music Videos... I don't care about Brandy or Spice Girls or TLC. All they are is some fabled singers to come up and try to finish off the show good. Well, I always flip to another channel.  It's just for pre-teen rock stars and people girls dream to be like in the future.<br/><br/>Actors... A pretty colorful cast, but now begins to lag to mediocrity. Kenan and Kel are most likely the BEST cast members, and two of the surviving ones, they get all the good sketches are full of creativity and style.  Lori Beth was wonderful as a cast member (cept for Loud Librarian), with Vital Information.  But it lost a lot when Danny Tamberelli stepped in. Don't get me wrong, Tamberelli is a good actor, but he doesn't have the charm to replace Lori Beth in Vital Information.  Josh Server is a good actor with some nice lines. Amanda Bynes is perfect for Ask Ashley, but sometimes she grates into my nerves for a while.  The rest either suck or are cool.<br/><br/>Sketches...

Also, the idea of picking up clues, and putting them together to get the answer could inspire youngsters to have strategic thinking like detectives.<br/><br/>Again, the show was such a hit that it ran for over a decade.

329,Blue's Clues, A Perfect Recipe,"Take an adorable twenty-something guy, a computer animated blue puppy, add a dash of spices (Mr. Salt, Mrs. Pepper and Paprika to be specific), throw in your favorite preschooler and you have the perfect recipe for a delightful Nick Jr show.  ""Blue's Clues,"" and the format in which it is shown, are simply ingenious.  In the show, Steve (the adorable twenty-something guy I mentioned earlier) is the only live action character in an animated world.  Every episode, his dog, Blue, has something that she wants to tell Steve, and in order to do this, she goes around the house leaving blue paw prints on clues.  While trying to find the clues, Steve often stops to help his friends (Slippery Soap, Mr. Salt, Mrs. Pepper, Paprika, Shovel and Pail, the Felt Friends and various others) with some dilemma they may be having (shapes, colors, what doesn't belong, etc).  At the end of the show, Steve asks the children's help to figure out what Blue is trying to tell him. There are various songs that remain the same from episode to episode.  The songs are simple enough for the child that I babysit to sing and dance along with. Each week, the same episode of `Blue's Clues' is shown for five days. The thought process behind this is that the more times a child sees something, the more they pick up from it and the better that they feel about themselves for having learned something.  I have seen this plan succeed. On Monday, the four-year-old that I baby-sit asks me what the answers are.  I dumb myself down as Steve does on the show in order for the little boy to learn the answers.  On Tuesday, he's a little more vocal because he learned some things the day before.  On Wednesday, he's interacting with Steve and Blue for a good portion of show.  By Thursday, he has everything figured out and answers them easily. On Friday, he's a pro at it and answers the questions before Steve can even get them out of his mouth.  `Blue's Clues' is a pleasant and welcome change from other television shows.  It is totally interactive and because Steve relies on the kids help to figure things out, it makes them feel like good.  Not to mention, it's 25 straight minutes where I don't have to worry about what the child is watching because I feel safe letting him watch ""Blue's Clues"".",12 out of 13 found this helpful.,,12 April 2000

331,Blue's Clues, A Delightful Children's Show,"The first time I saw Blue's Clues was in 1997 with my daughter who was two at the time. A friend of mine raved about the show so I decided to tune in. After watching several shows I found it to be delightful and charming. Steve Burns was a great host for the show that was wonderful in the way it taught and entertained children. With the stuffed Blue my daughter had, the games and of course watching the show every day Steve and Blue almost seemed like members of our family! Several years later, on a personal note, on 9/12/01 (everyone knows what happened on 9/11/01)my two daughters had a doctor's check up to go to. Since we lived in the New York Area, we were all on edge, to understate things. As I took my children to the doctor's office, the office had Blue's Clues on, for some reason, watching Blue's Clues actually gave me and my children a sense of calm.<br/><br/>Less than a year later, we met Donovan Patton (aka Joe) at the Toys R Us on Broadway in Manhattan. My daughters always wanted to met Steve but while I couldn't do that I had to take them to at least meet the new host of Blue's Clues.

We, like several of the reviewers, have liked Steve's talking to the audience as if they are ""people"", rather than condescending to them.  His energy and enthusiasm are contagious!  I hadn't known that Blue is a ""girl"" puppy until we started watching recently; that's a very good thing, because in children's stories, dogs always seem to be male, while cats always seem to be female.

334,Blue's Clues," Nicely Done, The Transition to Joe Seems O.K.","Blues Clues is quite popular with toddlers and preschoolers in the U.S. The show has a ""host"", more like a main character (originally Steve Burns, who was very good, now ""Joe"" Donovan Bratton) who introduces a scenario and leads the viewers through a sort of ""scavenger hunt"".  The hunt is guided by hints from talking things in the house (e.g. slippery soap, tickety tock and the salt, pepper paprika family), with the targets of the search marked by the girl puppy, ""Blue"", using paw prints (hence Blue's Clues).<br/><br/>The secret to the show in my opinion is that it has a nice formula, and more importantly the host treats the audience in an engaging manner and are NOT condescending (I think a lot of shows talk down to kids and they can pick up on it).  Steve retired from the show (they told the audience he was ""Going to College"") and his brother Joe was going to take over.  Steve was especially good at dealing with the audience (many adults secretly enjoy the show, Steve is pretty good), but his recent replacement by Joe seems to have gone well and I think Joe may do well (although I still like Steve a bit better, Steve had more practice).",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,,4 May 2002

337,Blue's Clues," (ding ding ding ding) We're gonna review Blue's Clues, because it's a really great show! Yeah!","*Zoom in on house with music until camera reaches the door*
*opens*<br/><br/>Oh, hi! Come on in, I'm so glad you're here! You're just in time for hearing me talk about one of my favorite shows, Blue's Clues!<br/><br/>Created by Angela Santomero, Todd Kessler, and Traci Paige Johnson the show centered on a kind, innocent, cheerful, and caring man named Steve and his lovable, intelligent, sweet, and adorable dog Blue.<br/><br/>Every episode goes like this: Steve opens the door to the house in the intro once the camera zooms in on it and greets us as if we were an old friend visiting for the day. After some interactions with Blue Steve would notice that Blue is trying to tell us something, but because she can't talk we don't know what she's saying, so she has us play a game of ""Blue's Clues"" to figure out what she's telling us when she puts a pawprint on the camera lens. To play Blue's Clues we need to find 3 paw prints which are the clues, each time we find a clue we draw it in our Handy Dandy Notebook, when we find all 3 clues we have to go to the Thinking Chair and piece the clues together to see what they have in common. But wandering around the house to look for paw prints wasn't all they did, during the journeys to find the clues we would have to go on side quests with other characters to learn something extra about what the episode is teaching us, get a letter from a young audience member tying into whatever the episode is about delivered to us by Mailbox during a segment known as Mailtime, and we would enter pocket dimensions in a picture, book, or diorama by ""skidooing"" (which in actuality is just jumping) into it, which would be places like the jungle, the farm, Recycle Town, the city, the beach, the ocean, and even the entire galaxy sometimes.<br/><br/>The formula of the show was a stellar formula, while I can understand people being annoyed by its repetitiveness, it's actually for the best if it's like this so that children can memorize how everything works and be able to learn what they're being taught quick enough. The 2 most common skills the show taught us was problem solving and creativity, the problem solving came in being able to identify patterns in the side quests you would have to go on and the creativity came from all the potential ways that any of the clues could be used.<br/><br/>The show also featured a variety of other characters for Steve and Blue to interact with.
As mentioned earlier Mailbox shows up whenever it's ""Mailtime"" to give Steve a letter, he was very funny and cheerful and it's clear he loves sharing mail as much as we love receiving it.
Side Table Drawer sits right next to the Thinking Chair and holds the Handy Dandy Notebook for Steve whenever he's not holding it, she always says she's excited for when we're playing Blue's Clues but overtime she started to say other things and have more interactions with Steve as the show progressed.
Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper were French diplomats that would teach the audience about healthy eating and nutrition.
Shovel and Pail were friends who played outside a lot and would show kids how to use a magnifying glass, build a sand castle, and do other fun things outside.
Tickety Tock was an alarm clock who lived in the bedroom of the house and loved to count and tell time.
Slippery was a bar of soap who said ""woah"" a lot.
Magenta was Blue's best friend and one of her nextdoor neighbors.
Periwinkle was another nextdoor neighbor who loved to perform magic tricks.
All these characters made the show feel very 3-dimensional and were very distinct from one another, and they inspire lots of creative potential for all the fun things they can teach us.<br/><br/>I didn't however touch upon the best element of the show, Steve. Steve was the main reason I was so obsessed with the show. His childlike innocence, excitable behavior, and caring affection make him feel so enjoyable to spend time with, he feels like a real person that's actually interacting with us directly. Whenever he spoke through the camera it felt like he could actually hear us which is what made the connection we had with him so effective. To this day people still recognize him even though it's been 18 years since he last hosted the show and has expressed countless times how grateful he is for having been part of the show and all the love he's gotten over the years. But unfortunately nothing is set to last forever, Steve began to go through an identity crisis as the show kept getting more popular while at the same time feeling he was beginning to mature which he felt interfered with his childlike mentality he was supposed to embody. So in 2002, everything changed.................<br/><br/>Season 4 ended with a 3 part TV special, it starts off with Steve getting a call from his younger brother Joe, claiming he was coming to the house. At first viewers assumed that Joe was just visiting for the day, at the time other human characters appeared on the show so we weren't too uncomfortable with it. It was interesting to meet one of Steve's relatives so we were thinking ""oh that's cool, nice to meet you Joe."" So we assumed it was just a regular episode with a special guest and that was about it. But then things started to defy our expectations as we didn't even know we were watching a 3 part special. In the next episode that came after Joe was still at the house......... Except this time Steve is actually teaching him how to play Blue's Clues, Blue reveals she wants to give Joe a gift, the clues were paper, a crayon, and a spiral, and it turned out Blue wanted to give Joe his own Handy Dandy Notebook............ Wait....... What?..................... What's going on here?.....................<br/><br/>Before we get to part 3 of this special I should address what makes watching this special so hard; When you spend years and years and years of watching the show like I did, you start to get used to how everything works. Whenever it does something new like introduce a new character or have another human performer appear on screen, they only do it once, so you never have to feel uncomfortable with whatever it is they're doing. But when Joe showed up that's when things started to feel nerve-racking. As you're watching the special, it keeps getting more and more unsettling and you start to feel more and more anxiety as it keeps going. Why is Joe still at the house? Why is Steve teaching him how to play Blue's Clues? Why does Blue want to give him his own notebook? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE??????<br/><br/>Then, on April 22, 2002, that's when suddenly everything clicks, that's when you see what parts 1 and 2 were building up to, that's when you immediately understand what's going on................................................................<br/><br/>STEVE WAS LEAVING THE SHOW, AND JOE WAS HIS REPLACEMENT...............................................................................................<br/><br/><br/><br/>When I was a kid, and I watched this episode for the very first time............ I was honestly never the same again.............. I felt that I lost someone that I cherished for so long, someone that always made every day worth experiencing, someone who helped me get through the toughest times in my life, someone that I could look up to whenever I needed them. But that's just how reality is sometimes. When you meet someone like Steve, who's kind, caring, and supportive, there will be times where your time with them might have to come to an end. (to quote Quinton Reviews) Maybe they change, maybe you change, maybe you both stay the same, either way there's bound to be something to pull you apart, and that can hurt, that can hurt a lot. But it goes to show that the only way you can deal with it, is to move on and find new people who are like Steve, because not letting people progress or move on with their lives can hurt just as much sometimes................<br/><br/><br/><br/>Joe hosted the last 2 seasons of the series and he did do a pretty good job, but unfortunately, most other people couldn't really stand him. Everyone else only remember him as ""the replacement,"" and even then the show started to experience other changes (aside from child actor replacements for the side characters because of puberty). The songs began to change, the clues started to draw themselves and sing, and in season 6 a new gimmick was added to the show.<br/><br/>Every episode would end with a segment in the show called ""Blue's Room"" where Blue enters a pocket dimension where she's a puppet and can talk. I didn't have a problem with it but I never really understood why it was even added in the first place.<br/><br/>Sadly people stopped tuning in and the ratings for the show began to decline drastically. I guess people figured ""without Steve running the bandwagon, what's the point?"" So the show was cancelled without having a chance to say goodbye in 2007. Steve's departure might as well have been the series finale, because when Joe was around, it honestly felt like watching a completely different show altogether. Much like when the Wiggles would eventually go through the complication of having to find new replacement members in 2006 and 2012.<br/><br/>But despite the unnecessary changes the show eventually went through, I still hold Blue's Clues very close to my heart. Steve really helped shape me into the person I am today inspiring me to embrace my optimism and kindness toward my loved ones. It pushes children to be creative, teaches us problem solving, has very good messages, a likable cast of characters, and best of all, it gave us our best friend Steve. As for the reboot that just came out recently, I absolutely love it, Josh is a great new host (who was actually handpicked by Steve himself), Steve made a cameo in the series pilot, and all the updates made to have the show translate into the year 2020 feels very natural. I can guarantee that what I and lots of other 2000's kids grew up with is going to make a new generation of kids very happy.<br/><br/>Now it's time for so long.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,23 April 2020
338,Blue's Clues, We Are Gonna Play Blue's Clues,"Blue's Clues is a classic in childhood entertainment and honestly it's kind of a wonder that I didn't review it sooner. There's a lot to be said about just great the show is and even those who have never even seen it have at least a passing knowledge of what its about. The basic plotline of every episode is that the titular blue puppy wants something and leaves clues by putting
paw prints on various items. Then the host Steve has to solve the mystery to what Blue wants with help from the viewers. Yes, this is one of those interactive kid's shows but while this format can feel awkward in other shows, Blue's Clues uses it to its advantage and I always got a sense of pride feeling like I helped Steve solve Blue's clues. In case anyone is wondering, the title
for this review comes from the song right before the search for the clues begins. Another good song is the ""mail song"" which I actually sometimes find myself singing when I check my email. Last but not least are there are several amusing characters. Besides Blue and Steve, there's Mailbox, Sidetable Drawer, Pail and Shovel, the Shakers (Mr Salt, Mrs Pepper, and Paprika), Tickety, Slippery, Magenta, and Periwinkle. There's a spinoff called Blue's Room which I
haven't seen so I can't comment on that. I can say, however, that I wholeheartedly recommend Blue's Clues.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,13 June 2018
339,Blue's Clues, Like a ray of sunshine,"I may be 23 years old, but ""Blue's Clues"" is a truly wonderful show where animated characters and a human character can interact and play in a surreal animated world.  Blue is simply adorable and her audience can identify her as the typical preschooler that they are themselves.  Joe (Donovan Patton), the live-action character, is full of warmth and energy, he's a person that loves to have a good time and it shows through in his bright smiles. I think kids and adults alike can relate to Blue, Joe and their friends, and they show that learning can indeed be fun for everyone!",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,,25 May 2003
340,Blue's Clues, Great show for kids AND adults!,"Ok.  Let me just say this much.  I'm a 21 year old male, and I watch Blue all of the time.  She is the cutest dog ever, how can I not watch?  You got Steve and his dog Blue, and adorable little puppy who makes cute noises and hops around the house all day wanting to do different things.  Steve's job each episode is to find out what Blue wants to do.  She can't exactly talk, so she leads Steve around the house, the yard, even into board games and books, etc, to find 3 clues.  When they find 3 clues, Steve, with the help of the children (you can't see) and the home audience solve the mystery to find out what Blue wants to do.  It's a cute show for kids, and I'm geussing it's a really good learning tool.  I think the episodes are cute enough and funny enough, with lots of different characters for adults to watch also. Like I said, I watch the show whenever I notice it's on, and I love it.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,,14 October 2000

I remember just about all the episodes with Steve but when Joe came, I hardly remember the handfuls I watched when Joe was on there. When Blue's Room came on, I thought it sucked!

349,I'm Dying Up Here, Under rated and totally top notch.,"Like the tragically cancelled Roadies I'm Dying Up Here has not received it's due praise. It's funny and touching examination of the lives of upcoming comedians masks the true magic of the show, which is to relate universal struggle all of us face in trying to realize our future potential while nurturing healthy relationships and balancing responsibilities right now. Shooting for the top before fizzling out or exploding. Reconciling our past with our present. <br/><br/>I don't know why these amazing shows have so much trouble finding an audience or critical acclaim. It seems like if character arcs are not clearly defined then critics think it is muddled. This is not the case though.<br/><br/>I love this show as I loved Roadies. The history and trade knowledge serve to enrich the themes adding texture and ambiance. I love it.

352,I'm Dying Up Here, Please Renew I'm Dying Up Here,"As I never saw promotion for this series, I started watching it when I stumbled upon it one night during what was the 5th episode. I immediately had to go back and watch the first 4 episodes. Having lived through this time, I see a lot in this series that seems familiar, bringing back memories of a quite different time. Anyone who doesn't get this show does not realize it is portraying the 70's! A lot of jokes from then do not translate well today but they are telling it like it is, or was. Ron's storyline reminded me of when Jerry Seinfeld actually had a bit part on Benson. A lot of great comics evolved during this period. I believe this show is not meant to be ""haha"" funny, but to show the struggles of those who make us laugh. Love the cast they do a superb job!

355,I'm Dying Up Here," Entertaining, addictive and very authentic","After a 'first career' in ordinary work, I decided to take a fling at stand-up comedy at the Comedy Zone in Jacksonville Florida for a second life. It's a major club that draws ""A-list"" comics from L.A. And NYC for the Thursday-Sunday shows. Us rank neophytes are given the opportunity to do 5-12 minutes on a Tuesday-Wednesday, and we learn from the local club owner who is a national booker of comic talent. We had to pay and complete an 8 week class, and then meet the standard in our 'graduation show' to be part of the team. About half make it. <br/><br/>I'm Dying Up Here is so much like what we go through every week. We get paid nothing, we get one free drink each night we work, no food. I drive 50 miles one way to the club, at least twice a week. The owner is like Goldie - he knows the business, he's demanding but supportive, and if we work another club, we're in trouble. But he knows his stuff. Some who have come up this way have done well, going on to Hollywood and Vegas. We've met Arsenio, Tom Arnold, Sheri Sheppard, Ralphie May, Bob Saget, etc. <br/><br/>You want to know what it's really like? Like ""I'm Dying up here"" - minus the sex. Or maybe it's just me... Look for a club that has a comic class - try it.",27 out of 36 found this helpful.,10.0,12 August 2017
356,I'm Dying Up Here, Much Better Than I Expected,"I just finished a two-day binge of the first two seasons of I'm Dying Up Here. To be honest, I approached it with pretty low expectations, so maybe that's one reason why I came away liking the show so much. The pilot really doesn't do justice to the rest of the show--and that's a good thing, because I would always rather watch a show hit its stride and get better than watch it go downhill. <br/><br/>The best reasons to watch this show are the writing and the characters. This show does what the best ensemble shows do well, which is combine and recombine the characters into different situations, so that their relationships with one another become how we understand who they are (just like our relationships do in real life). Even when the characters do something predictable, they usually do it in unpredictable ways. The characters are three-dimensional, flawed but mostly likeable, and I found myself rooting for them when they succeeeded and sympathizing when they failed. The dynamic between tne young and older comics is interesting, and it's intersting to see professional mentorship explored within this particular world. The writing shows a surprising sensitivity and nuance, and there's something about that plus the 70s setting that reminds me of Almost Famous.<br/><br/>Some people have complained in their reviews about the decor and clothing on the show, because they think it's too over the top. As a child of the 70s, I beg to differ; if anything, there are too many contemporary touches in the character's costumes. (Just watch anything on TV from the early 1970s and see what I mean). The same goes for the interior design; it look exactly as I remember things looking, especially the kinds of places where relatively flashy people lived. I also read some complaints about the amount of smoking on the show--but I remember the 70s, and (even through the 80s) we lived in a haze of the stuff. I also have to say that I appreciate that, for the most part, the show depicts drug use in a frank and mostly unmoralizing way; it doesn't glamorize , but it also doesn't preach. Also, lest I forget, the comedy spots are actuallly really dang funny. The show's raison d'etre isn't to only be funny; but, as a show about comics, it carries the water it needs to in order to make things belieable.<br/><br/>I also read a few comments that compared this to HBO's dreadful Vinyl. That's nonsense. Vinyl was an unholy mess, so unbelievably silly and while it took itself so seriously--and it was BORING. The only interesting scenes took place in the record company offices. The characters were utterly flat, their problems barely registered over all the sound and fury signifying nothing, and to top it all off, their David Bowie had a double chin and the ""new discovery"" young singer sounded like a mid-2000s American Idol contestant. Plus, you don't need a dramatic zoom shot every time someone does a line of coke--and people don't always yell when they do one. Please. There's no comparison. Vinyl was a mess and shouldn't have been made in the first place.<br/><br/>I'm Dying Up Here is a good show with potential to be a great one, but a few things get in the way. The drama sometimes verges on being a little soapy, with a lot of emotional weight invested in who's sleeping with Cass (our protagoneuse)--lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth because apparently every guy in the whole comedy world wants to be with her. She's adorable, but come on--not every funny guy is a sad sack who expresses his insecurites by glomming onto women. Early on in the show, things got a little self-aware, with lots of harping on about the ""alchemy"" of comedy as a remedy for personal damage, and owning your pain, and things like that--which would better be shown than told in most cases. It seems like the show laid off talking about catharses in the second season, and I think that was an improvement. From time to time, there are a few speech anachronisms in the dialogue (I think ""getting in your own way"" is 2000s jargon, although I could be wrong about that); they're not egregious, but the show is otherwise so good that they stick out when they happen. People spoke differently in the 70s; I don't think I've heard one person say ""terrific,"" and that word was the 70s equivalent of ""awesome."" But these are mostly quibbles, and they're mostly forgiveable, because the show gets so much more right than it does wrong.<br/><br/>I really hope that Showtime extends this show's run for a nice, long time. As HBO has become the network for giant, epic, CGIfests in its original programmng, Showtime has stepped up and dug for gold in humanist stories like this one. I like dragons as much as the next gal, but I also want to to watch people with interesting lives. The next Sopranos won't come from a show about a zombie apocolypse; it's going to be a psychologically astute character study (which was what the Sopranos really was underneath it all).",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,8.0,23 July 2018
357,I'm Dying Up Here, Criminally Underrated!,"This show was an incredibly realistic portrayal of the 70's and it's criminally underrated by lame sources like Rotten Tomatoes (probably because it's very non-PC and shows an authentic dose of how much more crass social dialogue was back in the day aka lots of racial slurs). There are definitely moments of hilarity, but just because it is about comedians does not mean it's meant to just be a comedy show...it deals with lots of dark themes we all face in every day life (addiction, death, depression, failure...etc).

362,I'm Dying Up Here, COMEDY IS NOT PRETTY,"More prophetic words were never written than these, ""Comedy is not Pretty"", when they adorned the cover of Steve Martin's third album. While most of us see the laughter inducing antics or hear the howl inducing words that comics offer the reality behind the scenes is not near as fun as one would think. It's a dog eat dog world and was that even more so in the heyday of the stand-up comic in the early 70s. And the one place that was the mecca for comedians during this time period was L.A. <br/><br/>I'M DYING UP HERE is a drama/comedy hybrid that focuses on that time period and on comedians trying to get that big break, the chance to appear on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. By now we have a generation unfamiliar with the power Carson wielded on a young comic but most of us recall his laugh and how he helped create numerous stars who performed on his stage.<br/><br/>The series takes place at Goldie's comedy club. Goldie (Melissa Leo) is obviously based on Mitzi Shore who co-founded The Comedy Store in L.A. in 1972. A tough as nails club owner who provides several stages for comedians to hone their craft while at the same time not paying them a dime, Goldie has dreams just like the comedians do. Her chance comes halfway through the series as she pitches an all-female comedy special to CBS. Not only is it her dream project it also allows her to show them what women can do. <br/><br/>The cast that make up the series offer different aspects of comedians from the time period as well as being representatives of different styles. The series opens when comedian Clay Apuzzo gets his big break not only appearing on The Tonight Show but being called over to the couch by Johnny himself, the highest accolade a comedian can get. Afterwards Clay checks into a posh hotel, orders the best meal possible, walks outside and steps in front of a bus committing suicide. He'd reach the pinnacle he sought and left this world. His death looms over the casts throughout the show.<br/><br/>Central to the story is Ari Graynor as Cassie Feder. A transplant from TX she's still in the early stages of developing her on stage persona with the first episode. She takes a personal hit in the opening moments of the show with the death of Clay who was not only a fellow comedian but her ex-boyfriend as well. As the series progresses we see her realize that she's accepted but not thought of in the same manner as her male counterparts. Instead she is either the sought after fuel for their sexual natures or as merely one of the boys. Neither of those offer who she truly is.<br/><br/>Andrew Santino is Bill Hobbs, the most outspoken and least likeable character in the series. Hobbs feels like he's above the rest of the comedians. His humor might be one thing on stage but his vicious verbal attacks on the other comics offstage are what make him so unlikeable. Early on he and Cassie begin seeing one another only to have him sabotage it with his attitude. Much of the misery in his life is self-inflicted and one wonders if he will ever make it big in spite of his talent.<br/><br/>Ralph King (Erik Griffin) on the other hand has made it big, kind of. Not only does he have the envious position of emcee at Goldie's he's also a writer for the Sonny and Cher show. He seems to be the most level headed of the bunch, even if he has his own demons that stem from his time in Vietnam, the focus on one episode.<br/><br/>RJ Cyler plays Adam Proteau, a young black comedian who like the rest is still searching for his voice. Early on he seems so enamored of other young black performers that he almost finds himself not just following in their footsteps but standing in them as well, crafting his performance more as an homage rather than his own voice. But as the series moves forward glimpses of his self-discovery are there to be seen. Only time will tell if he finds that voice inside of himself. <br/><br/>Two other characters of note are Eddie Zeidel (Michael Angarano) and Ron Shack (Clark Duke), two best friends from Boston who were friends of Clay who invited them to come out and stay with him while looking for their big break before he killed himself. Arriving with nothing they rent a room from the club manager. Well not quite a room. Closer to a closet. Actually it is a closet. That they share. Both are early in their careers and still working on material. Eddie gets a job in a deli where he talks them into allowing an open mic night. Ron is taken to an AA meeting by top talent Nick Beverly (Jake Lacy) who tells him that there he has a captive audience. He can apply his material to their plight while posing as an alcoholic to have this forum to ""perform"". <br/><br/>This is the sort of world these comedians face. Each of them has their own insecurities and issues and all of them apply those life choices and decisions to the material that they show onstage. They say the best comedy is inspired by real life events and these comedians prove that. But the show not only focuses on their comedy but the lives they lead as they reach for the brass ring.<br/><br/>When I started watching the series here on disc I wasn't all that impressed after the initial episode. It felt to cardboard cutout and I wasn't sure it would be worth the time to carry on. But as each episode played I found myself both fascinated and curious about what would happen next. I began to care about the characters. I began to hope that some would find their way to stardom and wished that others would abandon their dream and become something else. I found that I was rooting for them all at some level though and wanted to continue watching to find out what would happen.<br/><br/>A second season has already aired and I look forward to its release on disc to enjoy. And for those who have Showtime I can't suggest strongly enough how this series is worth your taking notice of. It never got boring. I will note that the show feels the need to use as much language as a Showtime series seems to enjoy and that the standard nude scenes are there that I've come to expect with anything shown on pay cable networks. I will say that they did restrain themselves this time out and waited at least 20 minutes before tossing in the obligatory T&amp;A moment whereas they normally toss that in with the first 5 minutes. I find it odd that in an industry currently being bombarded with sexual harassment cases and the #metoo movement going on that the proclivity for female nudity remains unchanged. Who knows, perhaps that will change in the future. For now if it offends you be aware. One last thing of praise. This show has a dynamite soundtrack going for it with some fantastic songs of the time playing. This is one show worth checking out.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,24 June 2018
363,I'm Dying Up Here," Great writing, good acting, fair pace","From the opening music, you understand there is a pall over this show. No, it's not a comedy, and the telling of jokes over the melancholy (borderline depressing) jazz riffs that begin each episode aptly explains exactly what this is. This is a glimpse into the hard life of comedians, and dammit, they aren't pulling any punches. <br/><br/>However there's something unexpected - because it's just hard to do - and that's to make it funny every week, and the writers of the show pull it off. In spades. That's no easy task, considering the crowded cast list. The show list 10 writers, not counting Jim Carrey, and in order to create the depth that this ""dramedy"" shoots for, I would expect no less. Even if I hadn't looked at the credits, it feels like a full staff of writers are involved. But that's just scratching the surface, because it also aspires to be a drama packed with everything from heartfelt, to love stories, to danger, and here's where it has its work cut out for it.<br/><br/>If I were to try and compare it to something, I would compare it to M.A.S.H. - now don't get me wrong, rarely does anything compare to that fantastic show, though I mean it in the way of attempting comedy of all sorts, from witty to silly, right next door to death and pain.<br/><br/>It does not fire on all cylinders. It could be better. I feel there are too many characters, and some of the stories are thin. After all, how well can you really flesh out 12 or 15 characters and make them all intricate, complete beings? Some story lines suffer and you might wish certain characters were explored more, and some you may really not want to know about at all. A few are just plain unlikable. However for balance, there are a few who really charm, and you just wish they had more screen time. <br/><br/>There are gems in this show. Some great moments, yet sometimes bogged down a bit by stories better left unexplored and actors better left off-screen.<br/><br/>Some overact, in my opinion, embarrassingly so. Specifically first billed Melissa Leo, who I keep hoping, now after watching 8 episodes, that she would tone it down a bit - or more than a bit. Yes, we all know what she's going for: brash, East coast, hard drinking, self- made, female-trailblazer, kick-ass club owner. We get it, but she insists on shoving her overblown personality down our throats in each episode. It gets tiresome. That being said, I have to say that I want very badly to like her, and in her more subtle moments, she just about pulls it off. She needs to stop being a caricature and start being a character. <br/><br/>Ari Graynor is the saving grace of this show, and the heart. She lights up a room when she enters it. Hell, she'd light up a room backing into it. As well, honorable mentions go to Michael Angarano, Erik Griffin, and even the sullen, sarcastic, fatalistic character ""Bill Hobbs"" played by Andrew Santino. There's good acting here. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I'm having a good time with this interesting concept of a comedy-drama, and although there are things I wish were a bit different (as well as a bit of a slower pace) I have found myself looking forward to each subsequent episode, because it's getting better and finding its stride. <br/><br/>I hope it stays around. I need to find out who makes it as a big comedian and who goes back to a life of mediocrity.",11 out of 18 found this helpful.,7.0,1 August 2017
364,I'm Dying Up Here, Pretty bad -- READ the book,"This show is awful. It'a hard enough to write a show about comedians. You have to write jokes--and funny ones--weekly if you insist on showing the comedians on stage. This show can't do it. Based very loosely on Bill Knoedelseder's terrific book about The Comedy Store and the comedians who eventually went on strike because they weren't getting paid, this really pale imitation takes place a good six years before the events Knoedelseder wrote about. It's just not interesting. Did I mention it wasn't funny? Whoever compared this to HBO's Vinyl was right on the money. It's doomed. Also, the comment about how the show uses every 70s cliché in the book was also correct. The only thing this show is very good at is showing what a terrible person ""Goldie""--Mitzi Shore--is. Do yourself a favor. Read Knoedelseder's book. It's about a thousand times better and, unlike this series, you really feel for the people in it.",30 out of 67 found this helpful.,3.0,17 June 2017
365,I'm Dying Up Here, Every cliché imaginable,"I agree with the other reviewer who suggested that they're overdoing it with the 70s kitsch. It's not really the decor or the clothing that's a problem, though, not even that proverbial plate of coke. It's the bad wigs and the dirty filter every scene is filmed with. The comedy club was probably in fact quite a dark smoky haze, but their is no reason that every scene, including outdoor shots, has to look like archive footage from the 70s. Just like you can shoot a movie set in the 20s or 30s without resorting to filming in black and white - it's too camp. And if you have to use wigs, they have to look like actual hair, not part of a ""Real Groovy Hippie"" Halloween costume.<br/><br/>Of course, there are the bad jokes, but one can imagine that people who are desperate to come across as funny do in fact tell an endless stream of one liners - clever or stupid - all in the hopes that one will eventually land. We all know folks in everyday life who are like that who are just born clowns - not comedians. But then there's the entire recycled BS that to be funny a comedian has to reveal his or her innermost pain. Comedy tends to be a defence mechanism so it doesn't reveal pain, it hides it. It's actually a shell game, because it often involves telling something that seems deeply personal to distract from the fact that the whole story isn't being told.<br/><br/>And so comedians don't really reveal their deepest darkest secrets, they admit to the surface lies that everyone tells, add a few ""shockingly personal"" details and then keep the truly damaged parts locked away. But that's the problem with such navel-gazing writing like this show seems to have so far. People slap themselves on the back for making the same tired old observations about human behaviour that have been made thousands of times before as if they've made some incredible breakthrough in self-awareness. Let's hope the writers on this show eventually dig a little deeper and move beyond the plot line of ""Punchline"" or what Barbara Walters could easily pull out of a comedian in a 10-minute interview.<br/><br/>Now, I'll be honest, there were some lines that were so bad that I threw up in my mouth a little. It's not even because they were so overly sentimental or cliché - it's that I actually feel embarrassed for the actors having to deliver such dialogue. It's a no-win situation for them, because if they treat them like throwaway lines, it only emphasizes the fact that no one would seriously say them in real life. But on the other hand, if they try to be really sincere in their delivery, they'll come across as scenery chewers acting their little hearts out to earnestly spew out dribble. Lose the righteous anger about life being nothing but a serious of hard knocks. Honestly, they should have prefaced many of the lines by stating ""I know that everyone says this..."" or ""You've probably heard this a thousand times before..."" Even a sarcastic, ""Well, here's a newsflash..."" Keep in mind, I've only watched one episode and I'll still probably watch another one just to see if they pull their heads out of their butts or if they keep going with the whole ""a comedian's comedramedy"" shtick. Because if the show can make itself seem relevant to today rather than like it is someone's hazy walk down memory lane where he or she remembers the drugs getting you so much higher and the love being so much freer than it actually was, there may be some hope. I think that it can only get better - well, really it has to!",20 out of 45 found this helpful.,5.0,8 June 2017
366,I'm Dying Up Here, Thumbs Up,"Unlike the one previous review, I thought that this was an accurate, insightful look at the 70's comedy scene in Hollywood. The styles, cars, and outside shots looked exactly like the somewhat sleazy look of Hollywood in the 1970s. I lived in the Los Angeles area during that period and that is exactly how people dressed. And sleaze. Yes, it was a pretty sleazy place but I was fascinated by it all. There are a lot of different characters to remember but the character, Clay Abruzzi, was the most memorable.

And the show has a keen eye on how life was during the 1970s (one noticeable flaw is that all of the vehicle are of 1970s vintage instead of the range from mid-1950s until the early 1970s that would have been on the road at the time) although many of social and political attitudes are that of its 21st century filming period.<br/><br/>Not a bad drama.

What is disappointing to see is this constant added element of left wing politics that DID NOT exist at the time. Bra burning.. fine.. All this talk about police brutality and gender inequality... of course it was there.. it was NOT discussed daily like they do on this show. THey literally rewrote history for the script.

370,I'm Dying Up Here," More drama than comedy, but It's better this way","Stand-up comedy isn't always full of big laughs and good times. As a comedian of more than 8 years, I'm biased, but I would like to think that my observation and analytical skills mean something. I really like this show and think others will too if they understand what it is and what it is not. If you're looking for a laugh-out-loud comedy, you should keep it moving and find a sitcom. This is a 70's drama that happens to be about the stand-up comedy scene in LA. This is an artfully crafted period piece that portrays the culture, the beauty, the struggles, and the joys of an American art form - stand-up comedy. I literally looked away from the screen at times because I felt so acutely what the characters were experiencing on stage. All comedians at some point and especially early on know what it feels like to expect laughter that never arrives. Regardless of its shortcomings, stellar moments, or the ultimate conclusion of this show, ""I'm Dying Up Here"" much like stand-up comedy is definitely worth the ride for those who enjoy peeling back the walls we erect and the many faces we wear. This show reveals something real and raw about the human condition and about the people who dare to make a life of making people laugh.",8 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,21 June 2017

372,I'm Dying Up Here, Single lensed downbeat drama,"There's a few things that you should know about this before heading in. Firstly, it's mot particularly funny. There's a few scenes that might amuse, but both the stand up bits and the humour in the show is pretty juvenile. It amounts to ""your mum"" jokes, racial observation (black people say so and so), and fairly basic sexual humour. Perhaps this is an accurate reflection of how comedy has evolved, but really don't expect to chuckle.<br/><br/>It's primarily pretty serious drama. The drama is relatively compelling, well acted, but then there's the second and third things you should know. It's dark, it's not uplifting, it'll leave you feeling sort of glum. And lastly, it's filled with very progressive narratives, as most post-naughties historical works are. And by this I mean, that the characters are quite black and white - the really bad people, are all white men. The women are to be sympathised with. There's the whole racial element. And I don't mean, as one would expect that it's just a current events, period theme. I mean it's sort of blow up into cartoonish proportions, as the progressive narrative tends to do.<br/><br/>So if you looking for something with complex characters that are likeable and hateable at the same time, nuance on the periods issues, or multiple points of view, you may be disappointed. And if you are a centrist, conservative or left libertarian of some variety, you may find it irritating enough based on its every presence in media to give up on it.<br/><br/>That said, if you are a baby boomer, millennial or other individual with leftist tendancies and don't mind something that brings little laughs and is kind of depressing - you'll probably like it. It's a very single lensed somewhat downbeat drama",5 out of 10 found this helpful.,6.0,9 April 2018
373,I'm Dying Up Here, Most excellent.,"If the first episode is anything to go by, this one will be a keeper. It strikes a beautiful balance between the dramatic and comedic. There is tragedy, but it never becomes maudlin. There is laughter, but it never becomes silly. There is nostalgia, but it never becomes sentimental. I call that a home run. It is always interesting to explore what drives comedians, who give us so much joy and yet so often are deeply flawed and unhappy themselves. There is a pathology to it and the greatest among them often seem the most broken. They are a tribe unto themselves and this show shines a light on the workings of their community and their compulsions. The characters are well drawn and believable. Given time, this could become something great. To those who are comparing this to Vinyl - it's a valid point of comparison. The main difference is that this is good.",10 out of 25 found this helpful.,9.0,10 June 2017
374,The Barrier, I wanted to like this series.,"I really want to like this series, the plot is interesting, and quite original.
But the cast is just frustrating, or more likely the directions they are given. Constantly over acting on the side of melodrama in almost ridiculous ways. Any normal person would keep a low profile in dangerous situations, but here they throw fits, scream and yell for no good reason, seemingly totally unaware of how much attention they are attracting. It's like these guys have survived hard conditions, but somehow managed to gather exactly zero street smartness.
In a society with a strong class system, you can't just ignore your superiors, or challenge them any time you disagree with them, Not that I think it is the right thing to do on a general level, but being constantly melodramatic, is probably not gonna get you far when you live in a police state.

424,Sanford and Son, Classic 70's television.,"Sanford and Son (1972) was a classic American television sitcom that was based upon the B.B.C. tele-comedy show Steptoe and Son. Whilst Steptoe and Son dealt with the ""Rag and bone"" business, Sanford and Son dealt with the ""junk"" business. A perfect vehicle for stand up comic and performer Redd Foxx. Many people felt that he couldn't make the transition from party records and blue humor to the restrained format of television. He proved them wrong. During the first couple of seasons some of the episodes (including the pilot) were Americanized versions of Steptoe and Son.<br/><br/>The show became a huge hit for N.B.C. and the series lasted for six seasons.<br/><br/>the ""classic"" episodes of this show were written by Paul Mooney and Gary Shandling. The best seasons happen to be the second and fifth, many classic episodes debuted during that time. Aunt Esther was Fred's nemesis, Rollo was Lamont's best friend and another thorn in Fred's side. Fred also has his buddies Bubba and Grady. Fred was involved with Donna to whom he was engaged to throughout the series. Redd Foxx always had problems with the producers of the show and he used his leverage as the star to get his stand-up comic friends on T.V. Performers such as Pat Morita, ""Slappy"" White, Scatman Crothers and the comic team of Leroy and Skillet all received spots or recurring roles on the show.<br/><br/>Thanks to D.V.D. and syndication, Sanford and Son will live on forever and future generations will enjoy the humor of Redd Foxx and company. Sanford and Son spawned two spin-offs and a sequel series.<br/><br/>A highly recommended show.",33 out of 33 found this helpful.,9.0,1 October 2004
425,Sanford and Son, One of the Funniest Ever,"Very funny TV comedy series about the situations a Los Angeles junk dealer,Fred Sanford (Redd Foxx) and his son/business partner Lamont(Demond Wilson) find themselves in.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the impeccable timing of hilarious lines delivered by Mr. Foxx made this show a classic.  I think the humor was probably cutting edge for its time also, often referencing the racial and sociopolitical climate (a la All in the Family).  Though ageless with respect to humor, some of the lines are not politically correct anymore as evidenced by TV Land (that currently shows reruns as of this writing) cutting out any reference to the ""N"" word said by Fred Sanford as I remember being in more than a couple of episodes when they first aired on NBC.<br/><br/>A whole host of other characters added to the shows hysterical but stereotypical flavor such as the religiously fanatical Aunt Esther, the dimwitted Grady and neighbor Julio.  No ethnic group or race was spared a ribbing on this show.<br/><br/>Two of my all time favorite episodes are 1.  The Sanfords being promised $10,000 if Lamont marries Fred's cousin's overweight stepdaughter and 2. Fred and Lamont's plane ride to St. Louis to attend the reading of a will of a relative that recently passed.<br/><br/>Priceless.",27 out of 28 found this helpful.,,21 January 2004
426,Sanford and Son," Some May Have Seen ""Redd"", But the Show Was ""Foxxy"" Nonetheless.","Highly hilarious and dominant television show from the mid-1970s that continues to have a great following even today (despite some detractors who take the show way too seriously). California African-American widower/junk dealer Redd Foxx (one of the most under-rated entertainers of his time) and his only son (Demond Wilson) argued and got into every odd-ball situation one could fathom during their six years in prime-time (from 1972-1977). The series was an answer to ""All in the Family"". It showed the differences and similarities between white blue-collar society and the working class African-American. It also was a coast war as ""All in the Family"" took place on the Atlantic shore while ""Sanford and Son"" took place on the Pacific. The supporting cast (led by the priceless LaWanda Page as Foxx's sister-in-law) was used in well-calculated ways to add to the program's comedic momentum. Never dull, never slow, never boring and never sorry, ""Sanford and Son"" is one of those shows that just seems to stand the test of time. 5 stars out of 5.",30 out of 32 found this helpful.,,19 December 2003

My parents and I would turn on this show every week just to see Fred put down Lamont by constantly calling him ""Dummy"".  However, you pretty much could tell that even though he called Lamont a dummy that he basically loved his son and was very much afraid of losing him.  Also the supporting cast of Don Bexley as Bubba, Whitman Mayo as Grady and, of course, LaWanda Page as Fred's bible thumping sister-in-law Esther all made this show the great alternative to the bubblegum shows that were on A.B.C. on Friday nights.",18 out of 19 found this helpful.,,22 April 2003
428,Sanford and Son, The Name Is Fred G. Sanford - And The 'G' Is for Great TV!,"There have been 4 show business personalities, over the years, over whom I shed tears, when they passed on. John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Roy Rogers, and... Redd Foxx. The reason is very simple: Redd Foxx, as the arthritic, heart-troubled Watts Junk Dealer, made me laugh. Something that not many performers can do. I have experienced more genuine laughter, while watching 'Sanford And Son', than with any other TV show, or movie, ever.<br/><br/>I have seen every episode at least 20 times, (Except for the Christmas episode - I only watch it during the Christmas season). I never tire of them, and the antics of the gripy, grumpy old 'Commodities' dealer and his family and friends never fail to draw a laugh from me, despite the fact that I know every episode by heart.<br/><br/>Until 'Sanford And Son', Redd Foxx was probably best known for his nightclub acts, featuring his dirty stand-up routines. He was a master of improvisation, and shows his true comedy colors, in this classic sitcom. And, he was no slouch when it came to drama, as proved by his performance in the episode where he must ask his girlfriend, Donna, to marry him, before she accepts a proposal from another man. That particular episode made me cry, as well as laugh.<br/><br/>Admittedly, much of the writing wasn't all that great, and the acting - In the case of some characters, obviously played by non-Actors - Leaves something to be desired. But the laughter is there, making up for that, and then some.<br/><br/>I once heard it said that laughter is a gift, and Redd Foxx gave me that gift, with 'Sanford And Son'. The show has a tremendous following, to this day, better than 30 years after it's cancellation - A fact which speaks volumes on the talent of Redd Foxx.",17 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,7 June 2003
429,Sanford and Son," This show is a classic, dummy","I guess that ""Sanford and Son"" must have been the first show that portrayed black ghetto life. No matter, it's hilarious. Dad Fred essentially spends every episode lounging around his house, calling his son Lamont ""dummy"" and threatening to bust people's lips. Lamont remains eternally embarrassed about Fred's antics, especially whenever Fred comments on how ugly he considers the sister-in-law, Aunt Esther, to be. And it's always great when the two cops (one white and the other black) come to the house, and the white cop acts like a dork, forcing the black cop to have to identify it.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was part of the new wave of really funny shows in the early 1970's that portrayed stuff that TV shows previously were uncomfortable portraying (""All in the Family"" of course led the way). It would have been neat if Fred Sanford and Archie Bunker could have ever met. That would have made for some crazy dialogue. Four stars.",17 out of 19 found this helpful.,,9 April 2005
430,Sanford and Son," Episodes Adapted from ""Steptoe and Son"" Are the Best!!","It's already known that `Sanford and Son' was the Americanized version of `Steptoe and Son' of England, created by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. `Steptoe' was extremely funny and groundbreaking in England.  When the show was brought over to the USA, it's initial transformation to `Sanford and Son' was excellentin it's early years.<br/><br/>The original premise of `Steptoe' was the direct relationship between the father and son, as the son strives for a better life from the junk business, while his cantankerous father holds him back, due to fear of being alone in his twilight years.  Many comedic situations resulted as a result of this conflict.<br/><br/>TVLand currently shows reruns of `Sanford and Son'.  If you pay attention to the opening credits, and the writer(s) of the current episode is given, it is sometimes followed by Based on `The Piano' by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson.  `The Piano' was an original `Steptoe and Son' episode.  This meant that the upcoming `Sanford and Son' episode was merely a retooling of the respective `Steptoe' script for American audiences, now entitled `The Piano Movers'.  There were 136 episodes of `Sanford and Son'.  If you include all episodes, movies, and TV specials, there were 59 offerings of `Steptoe and Son'.  Based on my research, of the 136 `Sanford' episodes, 16 episodes were direct adaptations of the `Steptoe' series.  Those `Steptoe' copies were the funniest episodes of the `Sanford and Son' era, due to the exceptional scripts by Galton and Simpson.  If you have the DVD, you are able to watch the uncut, unedited versions, which is not the case when watching the TVLand episodes.  Other `Steptoe' episodes could not be duplicated because they were either far too oriented in British culture to be adapted for America, or they were considered too crude &amp; vulgar to attempt to tone down for America, although I wish they tried.<br/><br/>Another strong point was the opening theme song by Quincy Jones, as well as the closing theme.  <br/><br/>However, due to the extreme popularity of the show, Redd Foxx developed and ego, wanted more money than the producers, and disrupted production of the show to the point where Whitman Mayo (Grady) had to fill in on a temporary basis.  This was one of the downsides to the show.  Eventually, he came back, and the show labored on.  Redd Foxx had marital problems during this time.  Being distraught over that, he left the show in 1977, even though the show had more life left.  <br/><br/>NBC tried to keep the flame lit by producing `Sanford Arms', which revolved around the Sanford Arm tenants which lived there when Fred and Lamont bought the Sanford Arms when their show was on-the-air.  There was also `Sanford.', which did not have Lamont.  The less said about these two shows, the better.<br/><br/>All in all, the `Sanford and Son' episodes adapted from the Galton and Simpson scripts from `Steptoe and Son' will always be the better episodes.",29 out of 39 found this helpful.,,5 March 2004

432,Sanford and Son, A 70s Sitcom Classic,"Norman Lear's second sitcom Sanford and Son is definitely a 70s classic. Redd Foxx's portrayal of Fred Sanford is so funny, yet he was bigoted like Archie Bunker. He also had great chemistry with Demond Wilson, who played his son Lamont. Though Lamont was the smarter of the two, Fred kept calling him ""Dummy"" which I thought wasn't very nice. What made the show funny for me was Fred's frequent phony heart attacks when he would clutch his heart and bellow ""OHH! THIS IS THE BIG ONE! YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH, I'M COMING TO JOIN YOU!!"" Every time he did that, i would crack up laughing. The other phrase he constantly used was variations on ""How would you like five across your lip?"" <br/><br/>What also made Sanford and Son stand out was the chemistry between Foxx and LaWanda Page, who played Aunt Esther. Both were long-time friends who grew up in St. Louis. I thought Page delivered her lines with gusto and really brought her character to life. <br/><br/>My only dislike of the show were the episodes without Foxx, who sat out due to a contract dispute and were centered around Grady. Whitman Mayo was an outstanding supporting player, but I felt he couldn't carry the show as a lead actor and that was why his spin off Grady was short-lived. It was like watching an episode of The Honeymooners without Jackie Gleason. <br/><br/>There were a lot of good episodes, but two of my favorites were the Gong Show episode and Steinberg and Son, a TV show that mirrored the Sanford's lives. Each season of Sanford and Son is on DVD so if you haven't seen them, do so. You won't worry about commercials.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,,29 February 2008

441,Sanford and Son, A Beloved Classic Television Comedy,"This American sitcom is about a father and son who own a scrap business called Sanford and Son Salvage. The son, Lamont Sanford, usually played the straight man to the more comical father, Fred G. Sanford. The father was played by comedian, Redd Foxx. This sitcom was based on the British sitcom, ""Steptoe and Son.""<br/><br/>The show always tended to keep the mood light and fun. The character of Fred G. Sanford could occasionally be grouchy; but, he was also more relaxed and fun-loving than his son, Lamont. Whenever Fred came up with schemes, his son frequently assumed the position of moral high ground and preached to Fred about whatever it was that he was doing. The father and son often engaged in role-reversal, with the son acting as the father's disciplinarian. Although Lamont frequently preached morality to his father, he sometimes defended one of his own friends against his father's moral criticisms. Fred was outspoken and never feared burning bridges with anybody whom he did not like. If Fred thought that the person was ugly or irritating, he would tell that person what he thought in the most insulting (and humorous) manner possible. In many ways, Fred was a something of a geriatric teenager who simply wanted to have fun.<br/><br/>The show featured a great cast of characters. Fred's friends, Bubba and Grady, frequently paid visits to the Sanford home. Aunt Esther was Fred's feisty and religious sister-in-law, whom Fred routinely antagonized. Julio was the Sanfords' friendly and easy-going Puerto Rican neighbor, whom Fred frequently insulted with racial slurs. Fred and Lamont both dated women who often appeared on the show.<br/><br/>The show occasionally touched on sensitive topics. The issue of racism was sometimes addressed on the show; but, it would often be dealt with by poking fun at its absurdities. The sitcom always kept humor at the forefront; and, the show's mood always remained light-hearted.<br/><br/>This sitcom was easily one of the funniest American television shows from the 1970's. The show was a great platform for displaying Redd Foxx's comical talents.

443,Sanford and Son," ""Is this Esther, or King Kong AFTER he fell off the Empire State Building?""","The quote is from the episode where Grady mistakingly gets more Social Security checks than he's entitled to.<br/><br/>This was one of the series of episodes when Redd Foxx was absent, and I think this episode shows the genius of the show's writers. I especially like the patriotic and all-American justifications Grady made in the face of Lamont's objections to keep the checks.<br/><br/>Another favorite of mine was when Lamont took karate lessons to defend himself from a much bigger guy, Jo Jo Jackson, whose girl he was dating.<br/><br/>The scenes where Grady warns Jo Jo that Lamont is mentally unbalanced, and the subsequent ""fight"" scene between Lamont and Jo Jo are priceless.<br/><br/>For some reason, I liked the episodes where Fred was absent even better, as I thought Grady was a gentler and kinder version of Fred. I love the goodhearted, dimwitted Grady.<br/><br/>The ratings at the time would seem to bear it out, as the show ranked even higher when Foxx was absent.<br/><br/>And Esther, boy, what can you say? The on screen antagonism between Fred and Esther have to surpass any other in any comedy series, including Fred and Ethel, in terms of sheer hilarity (""Watch it sucker!"").<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine that in real life LaWanda Page and Redd Foxx were close friends from childhood.<br/><br/>Anyway, I like all the episodes. It brings back memories of when we first came to this country, and my parents and I would sit down and watch them.

That's testimony to the show's power of transcendence.<br/><br/>Rollo, Julio, Smitty and Hoppy, Bubba, etc, where all great as supporting cast.<br/><br/>I still get nostalgia whenever I hear the opening music.<br/><br/>In my opinion,""Sanford and Son"" beat ""All in the Family"" hands down.

And really that's why I watched these shows; not to be reminded of life's ugly side.<br/><br/>Too bad Fred and Archie weren't neighbors. I always fantasized about what their exchanges might have been. If there was anyone who could've countered Archie in terms of bigotism, it was Fred. They were mirror reflections of one another, albeit the difference in color.<br/><br/>That would've been a dream match!",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,20 June 2006
444,Sanford and Son, Mixing Archie Bunker with vintage Cosby,"Don't know the extent of Foxx's input on the scripts (he is credited) but you can see his hand all over the place.  It's like Archie Bunker in the wits of vintage Bill Cosby genious, -(Rememeber Cosby's  visit to the dentist monologue and  ""To Russell My Brother..."",)  but Cosby's extraordinary humor was always Jello clean... Foxx saw not that line.<br/><br/>
According to IMDB ""The big one"" finally did him.  But not before he made his mark.  And of the kind that a decade earlier was only being done by Lenny Bruce and, today, Chris Rock.  Don Rickles had license to use it all throughout...  A great performance by Foxx and Grady (Mayo), cashing in on the Sanford ""Empire"".  A nice fun show.  One of few really Big Ones.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,,28 October 2003
445,Sanford and Son," Hands down, the best sitcom of all time!","Trying to some up Sanford and Son in a word would be hard. I can some it up in three words. Gut busting funny! Redd Foxx is truly a genius. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin really knew what they were dong when they hired the cast. The acting is very well done. The show dealt with a lot of issues over the years and Sanford and Son doesn't get a lot of the credit it deserves. All in the Family was also great and it tackled more social issues so it will always get more attention. However, Sanford and Son was just a lot more funny.<br/><br/>
My all time favorite on the show besides Fred was Grady. Grady Wilson was hilarious. One of my favorite episodes was when Grady thought the wild parsley he planted was actually marijuana. He had the cops eating the evidence. Now you will never see on any of today's shows something close to this. The show was original and pushed the limits. It isn't politically correct like all of today's shows are. I agree with other commentators that if you put Sanford and Son up against many of the current sitcoms, Sanford and Son would blow them away. Very few sitcoms today push the envelope. They are too politically correct and the storylines are too predictable. They copy each other. I wish some producers would have the good sense to copy some of Sanford and Son's plots.<br/><br/>I was bummed to hear that TV Land wasn't gong to show the shows any more. I couldn't buy all the episodes on tape because it would take too long and cost way too much. Then when I heard they were putting the show out on DVD, I jumped up and said, `Good Goobily Goop!'  I just bought the first season and can't wait for the rest. I just wish they could have added some extras like interviews and biographies to the DVD. The video and audio aren't great but it's good enough. <br/><br/>Sanford and Son is TV at it's best! <br/><br/>Rayvyn",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,,9 August 2002
446,Sanford and Son, A Work of Genius...,"Growing up in the 1980s and early 1990s, I had no intentions to think of any show before that era. It's not that I didn't like them, I just felt that the shows I grew up on were the best. A couple of years ago I grew weary of the state of television and decided to find something that would satisfy my taste buds. When I found Sanford &amp; Son being aired on TV Land, I was surprised. I never knew beforehand that so many good sitcoms came out of the 1970s, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Originally based off of ""Steptoe &amp; Son"", Sanford &amp; Son revolves around a junk dealer and his son living in a neighborhood in Watts, Los Angeles. Fred Sanford (Redd Foxx) is a sarcastic and stubborn person who's plans usually backfire, causing trouble. His son Lamont Sanford (Demond Wilson) usually has to complete tasks and order his own father to complete jobs. It was very amusing to see the two argue against each other and have to become loyal in order for things to come back to normal.<br/><br/>But there are a couple other interesting characters in the series worth mentioning. Aunt Esther (LaWanda Page), who is sister of Fred Sanford's late wife Elizabeth, is a Baptist who just can't seem to handle Fred too well. In most cases they spew insults to each other such as ""Gorilla Face"" and ""Fish-Eyed Fool"", and what makes this funny is that it never gets old. I always found myself laughing whenever Fred gave Aunt Esther a dirty joke. Grady Wilson (Whitman Mayo), who is Fred's closest friend, usually acts as his ""sidekick"" and is involved in get rich schemes. Unfortunately, Redd Foxx left the show for some episodes (due to a feud with the producers) and thus Grady had to fill in, in order to watch the junk yard business. Many characters appear in the show, and not one of them is really that boring to watch.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the classic sitcoms, well before Cable TV and Reality TV started getting out of hand. I consider the 1970s to be the ""Golden Age of Sitcoms,"" because that was when barriers were broken and actors displayed their best talents to make themselves stand out. All in the Family, M*A*S*H, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Happy Days, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Three's Company, Different Strokes, Taxi, and numerous others. Sanford &amp; Son puts most of the 1990s and 2000s sitcoms to shame. It was a stroke of genius, and Redd Foxx was a one of a kind individual. No one beforehand thought a stand up comic would be good in his own show. But he did it, in a big way. It's still a hit among old and young generations alike, and if Sanford &amp; Son still lives on even after over 35 years, then you know that it's a classic. Like Archie Bunker, Fred Sanford is a unique person.<br/><br/>So don't waste your time watching the Disney Channel or anything that comes out of Reality TV. Sanford &amp; Son is a timeless sitcom that will keep you laughing. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>9 out of 10.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,11 March 2008
447,Sanford and Son, Very good,"Towards the end, one got a little tired of Redd Foxx's same lines, especially about Aunt Esther. However, this comedy was very good. First of all, it was after the Watts Riot. Lear wanted to have a positive portrayal of the inner city. Sanford and Son succeeded without being patronizing. Fred Sanford was a bit of a trickster, but he had a good heart. He may have been about making money and surviving, but eventually his conscience would get to him. Demond Wilson is the serious and responsible son. He is also keeping Sanford from getting out of control. There are very funny characters, like Shady Grady and Rollo. There is the white police officer who can't get anything street slang correct. He says ""just gravy"", instead of ""Just groovy"". Sanford still mourns the loss of his wife Elizabeth and argues with his Aunt Esther. He has every insult imaginable for her. The best episodes were the last ones. Sanford and Son are in Hawaii and end up in a ""Hawaii Five-O"" type situation. The show displays the many good sides to the inner city. It shows that an ordinary junk man does have a heart and a personality to him that can engage the audience.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,7 September 2006
448,Sanford and Son, Another gem of a sitcom from Norman Lear.,"Sanford and Son was about the misadventures of elderly junk dealer Fred Sanford, and his son, Lamont. It was one of the few 70s sitcoms, that had blacks as the main characters. Unlike other 70s comedies built around the lives of blacks, Sanford and Son never resorted to buffoonery, to get laughs.<br/><br/>The considerable comedic talents of Red Foxx as Fred Sanford, and Demond Wilson as Lamont, were what made this show so much fun to watch. Fred and Lamont were always aggravating each other, and it was hilarious to watch their father-son squabbles. And they (especially Fred) were always coming-up with hare-brained money-making schemes, to supplement their meager income as junk dealers. The viewer was always wondering how Fred and Lamont could get out of trouble, after one of their latest ill-conceived plots to make it big, fell-through.<br/><br/>On one of my favorite episodes, Fred decides to try and make quick money, by purchasing an old race horse. Lamont comes home, goes to the kitchen to make a sandwich, and all the while doesn't seem to notice that Fred's horse is standing right there in the kitchen. At least, the viewer thinks that Lamont doesn't notice-until he exits the kitchen, and dryly asks Fred; 'Pop, what's that horse doin' in the kitchen??' Though the chemistry between Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson was what made the show great, the supporting characters added much to this show. Especially Lawanda Paige, as Fred's wild, holy-roller sister-in-law, Esther. The knock-down, drag-out verbal battles between Fred and Esther, were always drop-dead funny.<br/><br/>Creator Norman Lear, had a well-deserved rep for crafting excellent, cutting-edge 70s sitcoms. Lear was, after all, the man who gave TV viewers the brilliant sitcom, All In The Family. Sanford And Son, wasn't as ground-breaking a show as All In The Family was. But it was still one of Lear's sitcom gems. I for one, hope that Sanford And Son lives forever in reruns, on cable TV.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,19 March 2009

457,The Baby-Sitters Club, A way for parents to discuss more intricate but important subjects with their children - intoscreens.com,"Based on the best-selling book series that was highly popular in the 1980s and 1990s, Netflix's new series 'The Baby-Sitters Club', follows the friendship and adventures of Kristy Thomas (Sophie Grace), the genius but shy Mary-Anne Spier (Malia Baker), the artsy Claudia Kishi (Momona Tamada - 'To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You'), the fashion-queen-with-a-secret Stacey McGill (Shay Rudolph - 'Lethal Weapon'), and free-spirited Dawn Schafer (Xochitl Gomez - 'Gentefied') as the middle-schoolers start their babysitting business in the town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Each episode in this first season is based on one of the books in the BSC-series, which was originally written by Ann M. Martin, who also produces the series.<br/><br/>The Netflix Original Series revolves around this group of inspiring girls with different backgrounds, personalities and opinions who become best friends by working and growing up together. Combining drama and comedy, this adaptation for the small screen might look childish, but in fact tackles some mature subjects such as divorce, online bullying, the importance of using right pronouns, and even explores a dark part of American history (in this case the World War II internment camp, Manzanar).<br/><br/>Alicia Silverstone (The Lodge) plays Elizabeth Thomas-Brewer, the selfless single-mother of Kristy and love interest of all around good guy Watson Brewer, played by Mark Feuerstein ('Prison Break'). As part of the adult cast, they never steal the spotlight and are mostly here to support this young group of actors. All members of The Baby-Sitters Club do a fine job at playing their own specific character, but some of these actors are clearly still getting used to being in front of the camera. Baker's Mary Anne grows a lot into a well rounded personality, after being a shy wallflower in the first half of the season, but you can tell the young actress struggles a bit with keeping a straight face during the more dramatic scenes. Without her the BSC wouldn't be complete - everyone gets a bit of stage fright in life. Tamada, and especially Gomez, are stars in the making, both exuding a natural energy that breezes through every episode.<br/><br/>The fun part about this series, is that we get to explore a different character's personal life and struggles in a stand alone episode which they narrate themselves, with the other members of the club basically playing the supporting cast. This not only gives the viewer the time to explore their favourites a bit more, but also gives those you might not like as much at first, grow on you. Showrunner Rachel Shukert (Glow) and executive producer and director Lucia Aniello (Broad City) take a simple yet effective approach at educating viewers of all ages in a wholesome, balanced and innocent way.<br/><br/>The series explores female empowerment, entrepreneurship and discusses some more intricate but important topics, which could open up the conversation between parents and children, or those who aren't familiar with certain topical subjects. Knowing just how successful the book-series was, Netflix would make the right decision by greenlighting the second season of the potential hit-series 'The Baby-Sitters Club' to make sure they can keep the same cast to play this group of best friends, before they outgrow their on screen characters.",26 out of 57 found this helpful.,8.0,5 July 2020

459,The Baby-Sitters Club, Better than the books,"You know, I think I'm here from a nostalgic point of view. I realize this is a tv series aimed at children or young teenagers but here I am reviewing this title while I'm in my 30s.<br/><br/>I grew up with the BSC books and thought of them like crack. I couldn't wait to go to Walmart and buy BSC books with the pocket change I had on me. I read them for a good number of years until I aged out of the series and went to other things. Good number of years passed and I joined communities that snark the series and that inspired me to read through the series again with an adult perspective. The book characters could honestly be pretty cruel to each other. Mary Anne cuts her hair off, gets a makeover and the older club members shun her and treat her like garbage because how dare Mary Anne do something they don't approve of.<br/><br/>I've felt this way about the early 90s tv series and feel the same way with this series: They're both better written. I was always lukewarm about the big screen movie from the 90s. Anyway, I could buy the girls in the club as being close friends and being supportive of each other on both tv series. I also like how the girls have gained a clearer perspective than the book characters. This version of Dawn knows that some people are worse off financially than her family or the people she knows. Book Dawn didn't see that. Book Dawn was grossed out by a homeless woman eating out of the trash dumpster.<br/><br/>The book series went into a time warp and had the characters stuck at the ages of 13 and 11 for the bulk of the series. This tv series won't be able to time warp like that so here's hoping the characters are kept at the level they're on instead of deteriorating the way they did.<br/><br/>Would also like to point out that a few modern storylines are in this series. I know this world has gay people in it and people that feel like they're in the wrong body/gender so I'm absolutely accepting of the fact that the series chose to include people instead of excluding them.I realize there's some people that aren't accepting of either one so they might not enjoy the series because of that.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really enjoyed the series and congratulate the cast and crew for a great job.

The way it has been translated into English is fantastic, and the depth of the philosophical conversations, and the concepts and trains of thought therein, are highly intellectual. This adds massively to the richness of the characters, in what could otherwise be considered as a kind of swords and sorcery story.<br/><br/>The different characters from history concept made me dubious before they appeared, but they are done in such a unique way and so unexpectedly; that again it adds to the depth of the story. The voices are marvellous in some instances.<br/><br/>This animation is engrossing and fun, with a story that does not feel episodic. I rate it very highly.

478,Fate/Zero, A mature and epic anime.,"Being a prequel to Fate/Stay night, which I happen to really like, it was a great experience to see what happened in the events mentioned a lot in Fate/stay night. <br/><br/>Fate zero is serious, brutal, unapologetic and mature. It is a character driven and dialogue heavy anime. <br/><br/>Story is good. I like the whole holy grail war scenario and the idea of using past great heroes to fight in them. Storytelling is AWESOME. There are lots and lots of characters in this anime and it manages to give everyone a fair share of screen time and great character development. Each character is complex, varied and distinct. This is where this anime truly shines. The relationship between the Masters and the servants is great and is distinct as well. Some are easy, some are complex, some are downright weird. The dialogue in it is also really great, and there is a lot of it. Every movie a character makes is a calculated one. There are no pointless fights or stupid decisions. It really goes to show how mature this anime is. The protagonist especially, is really clever and plans out everything with perfection. It, at times, gives Baccano and Death note a run for their money. There is some humour in this anime, although all of it comes from Rider and his master's conversations and scenes. The way they handled them was one of my favourite things in the anime, loved it. <br/><br/>Animations/art is without a doubt the best I have seen so far in an anime series. Everything is so detailed, beautiful and fluid. There is a lot of CGI too. Normally, I hate CGI in animes but here, they managed to blend it almost perfectly. On very few occasions did it felt out of place. Watching this anime in HD really just melt your eyes, ITS SO PRETTY!!<br/><br/>Soundtrack is amazing as well. From epic battle music too moving sad moments, it has it all. <br/><br/>The anime is not perfect however. I really wished there were some more dialogue moments between Saber and Kritsigu other than that one epic one. Would have loved if there was more development between them. Also, there aren't many fight scenes in this anime. I get the reason behind it as its a more mature anime, pointless fighting was not gonna be in it. But still, epic ones are few and far between. Would have loved to see some of the characters go all out against one another especially in the quality of its animation. <br/><br/>Overall, it is a great, epic anime which you don't get to see a lot. Its maturity is what sets it apart from other animes like it. It is certainly one of the best anime I have seen in a while and perhaps of all time. <br/><br/>Compared to FS, FZ is way way better.

480,Fate/Zero, Incredible scene after incredible scene,"This anime is fantastic. The most amazing thing about it (especially in the second season) is its unflinching attitude to the darker themes - some scenes will shock you, others will make you cry, and all of them are fantastic. Just when you are about to predict the story it will smack you across the face and tell you to try again. When you know that almost 95% of all the characters can either die or get some seriously messed up treatment, it makes for some of the most tense TV moments... ever.<br/><br/>The characters are generally good. You'll find yourself picking sides and favourites very early on due to the nature of the show. The show presents all sides, all characters and their motivations while managing to keep the some huge story elements secret until they are revealed - that's good writing and it engages the audience. <br/><br/>Animation is literally eye candy. I don't normally enjoy CGI effects, but this show perfectly marries 3D and 2D animation into one. The production values of this show are amazing and I applaud the animators and artists for not taking a half assed approach to some scenes while giving special treatment to others. The OST is used well and the sound is very nicely done. <br/><br/>Overall, 9/10. The 1 deducted was due to the story maybe introducing a little too much characters early on, making it fairly hard to keep track of in the first few episodes.",27 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,16 August 2013
481,Fate/Zero, This is one of the most impressive TV shows I have ever seen,"This is a good example of how great anime can be. The plot is very well done and only gets better as the show progresses, showing development in the characters as the conflict continues. Each character is given a good deal of screen time and development, and there is a lack of a main character, which makes it all the more interesting. The show also questions many things noted as honorable and questions them, such as what it truly means to be a hero and if honor is truly selfless. Fate/Zero also spared no expense on the animation, each movement flows beautifully, and the action is truly something to behold, with a fantastic musical score as well. In short, this show is very well done and has an excellent story, with amazing action sequences and beautiful music. I cannot praise Fate/Zero enough, you're doing yourself a a big disservice by not watching this, however, it does contain some very bloody scenes and gas very dark subjects and disturbing characters, if you do not enjoy dark stories, you may not be able to enjoy this show, if you can look past this, you are sure to enjoy.",14 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,17 February 2015
482,Fate/Zero, An anime with a lot of touches,"When I started watching, I had no clue at all on what the anime was about. Fortunately, the first episode went along smoothly answering basic questions.<br/><br/>The songs were a beautiful addition, fitting very nice with the story and the flow.<br/><br/>The story is about the Holy Grail, said to be an omnipotent wish- granting device. There are seven sides to the story, seven partnered Masters and Servants. The pace was perfect like a story unfolding in front of your eyes or a book with its every content shown at the most colorful and meaningful interpretation.<br/><br/>It is an anime with a lot of touches, action and sadness driven with the power of desires and belief, hopes and twisted wishes that came from different pasts and the ever-uncertain future.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it to people who want action, an interesting plot and some grief to accept.",16 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,8 July 2014
483,Fate/Zero, Awesome animation,"I love anime. Fate/Zero is rapidly becoming part of my 'must have' collection. It's strongly designed and scripted, the characterisation is excellent (though why do so many of the men look alike?) and the plot thickens nicely.<br/><br/>Its strongest point though is the animation. I have seen lots of really good animation, some of the Studio Ghibli output is fabulous, but so far nothing can touch Fate/Zero. Of course, it's new and using newer techniques, which give it an edge, but the design is crisp, clear and original anyway. Even it it had been made 10 years ago I would give it 10/10 for style and quality, but it wasn't. The techniques that went into the production have given Fate/Zero a unique appearance. The characters look like anime characters, but some of the effects and even some of the heroic characters look like someone spent a million dollars a second getting them perfect.<br/><br/>The character of Berserker is a bit hard to flesh out, for example, almost by definition as he was a knight driven insane by the horrors of battle, but his appearance!! He is gorgeous, so far as a frightening, black revenant can be. At one point he fights another of the heroes having taken possession of a fighter plane, and the whole section is beyond anything I had ever previously seen.<br/><br/>One could quibble that King Arthur was in fact, a bloke, not a girl or that Alexander the Great was both short and gay, but it's anime, not the History Channel.<br/><br/>All round, this was a huge surprise, and a total delight to me.

486,Fate/Zero, One of the best anime i've ever seen,"Fate/Zero produced by the famous animation studio Ufotable is the story of the 4th Holy Grail War, a magical battle royal between 7 teams of 2 consisting of a Master(wizard) and a Servant(Spirit) and the prequel to Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works. The Servants are actually souls of famous heroes summoned from various eras of history and given supernatural magical powers. The team that is left standing wins the Holy Grail which is an omnipotent wish granting device capable of performing miracles. <br/><br/>The plot is not very hard to follow however you need to have an understanding of the Type-Moon universe and the events of the first 3 Holy Grail wars to get the most out of the series.<br/><br/>The characters are very well portrayed. Each character has a reason to fight and most of them commit actions that lie in the morally gray area. However this series does have its villains that could be considered sadist to say the least. The main character, Kiritsugu Emiya,is a very intriguing character who you want to find out more about. <br/><br/>As far as visuals go.. This anime has the most gorgeous artwork and animation I've ever seen. The fights are fluid with realistic sound effects and combined with epic OSTs, you'll want to watch them over and over again. The special animation techniques used by Ufotable is so flawless that even if you pause abruptly in midst of action you'll always have a clear frame... No matter what... Believe me.. I've tried to disprove it and failed miserably.<br/><br/>Overall rating.. 10/10 if you obtain some background knowledge about the series.. if you don't you'll probably still rate it a ten on basis of eye-watering animation alone.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,5 April 2015

Each one of them is special and have their own desires and motives for wanting the grail which make you not having a clear good v.s. evil outlook on the cast.<br/><br/>The sound track, animation, story, and characters are all amazing and I would say this is a show you need to watch before you die.<br/><br/>Loved Fate/Zero through and though. 10/10 on pretty much everything.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,29 August 2015
488,Fate/Zero, Perfect on all accounts except one.,"This show is guaranteed to have something you'll like. There's so many great characters with their own set of morals, beliefs and desires that it's impossible not to identify with at least one. But it does have one flaw: the ending. Fate/Zero is a prequel but feels like a stand alone series that you'd assume to have a satisfying conclusion to wrap up all loose ends. However, the ending feels like it's just thrown in as an excuse to set the story up for Fate/Stay Night. And Stay Night is an average show at best - with all the clichés like teenage heroes and token girls (one of Zero's strongest and most interesting female leads, Saber, basically becomes just one of many token love interest for the main character in Stay Night). As long as you can handle a less than satisfying ending, Fate/Zero is an amazing show that doesn't do what you expect - which probably stems from the fact that it's a prequel and the writers got all the cliché overused plot devices out of their system. The main focus of the story doesn't rely on the epic battles, but rather the build up to these battles; the plans and preparations made, spying on the other Masters and Servants, discovering the motives of each character, the backroom deals made to further each Master's advance. It's basically a deconstruction of the Master/Servant Battle Royal formula (commonly seen in shows like Pok'e'mon, Digimon, Yu'gi'oh, etc.), and with adults.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,9 June 2014
489,Fate/Zero, Game of Thrones of Anime!,"This review is covering the entire Fate/Zero series(25episodes).<br/><br/>Before i watched this series someone had called it ""the Game Of Thrones(GoT) of anime"", now i didn't understand because i never watched GoT before. So as i was putting off watching this anime for a few months. I ended up watching all 4 current seasons of GoT and upon finishing that i decided to watch Fate/Zero. After having seen both i agree completely, this IS the GoT of anime. This show was an ""decent or alright"" anime in the first 12 episodes and for me ""decent or alright"" means i could keep watching or if i stopped right now i wouldn't feel an unfinished urge to watch more. After the first 12 or 13 episodes, this show went from my average list to one of my top 8! Now don't get me wrong it was still an above average anime from the get go but for me it just wasn't pulling me in for more after the end of every episode, but that changed real fast after i started the second half.<br/><br/>If you like old hero's and legendary warriors brought into the modern day age (with magic!) to all fight each other to see who is superior in the name of the holy grail(!) then you will enjoy this show! Now maybe you don't really care for old legends and warriors(like myself) but you wanna see bloody violence with a taste of real life hit-men and a hint of badass magic then you should really give this show a try and i can guarantee you'll enjoy this show. <br/><br/>5/5, 9.5/10. Why? The storyline and plot is very solid. The animation is flawlessly beautiful. The music is very well picked. English dub is amazing. All of the characters are very developed. Through and through i have to say this isn't my favorite but in terms of things that make or break a show i can't name a single ""flaw"" with this show. My only ""complaint"", not really a complaint as the ending was amazingly done, but i am saddened by the ending, it wasn't how i thought it would end. And you should know that there is a sequel to this called ""Fate/Stay Night"" where it picks up where this series ended.",11 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,24 August 2014
490,Fate/Zero," Great concept, the rest is a mixed bag though","One day I was just looking for a highly rated anime on Netflix and came across this so I gave it a shot and watched the whole way through.<br/><br/>First of all I love the premise: It's an excuse to have a bunch of interesting characters from history fight to the death, all controlled by human handlers. All the masters and servants have their own interesting personalities and motivations. Okay, there are a few humans who are mostly stoic low talkers but overall the characters are really diverse. The animation also seems really good and up to date. I love how well-drawn, colorful anime looks on an HD TV.<br/><br/>My only thing is the storytelling could've been much better here I think. You've got a great cast of characters and a cool concept right off the bat, but I'm not sure it was executed as well as it could've been. There's just not enough screen time for all those interesting characters. Many of them don't get fleshed out nearly enough and a handful could even be considered flat characters because we only learn as much about them as the plot demands.<br/><br/>Not necessarily a big negative, but I thought the pacing was strange as well. There is a one on one fight pretty early on, so you assume things are going to move fast, but after that it's mostly the human masters scheming or servants talking a lot but never actually getting to the point where they throw down with each other. On the flip side this results in the show being deeper than just a bunch of fight scenes.<br/><br/>Another complaint would be some plot devices introduced out of nowhere. There are two or three times where you'll be thinking ""Wait, what's this now? No one mentioned it before."" Somewhat related is the fact that they're not really clear on how this all works. Of course magic isn't real so it's hard to quantify it, but I had absolutely no idea why certain characters were more feared than others, and definitely no idea how strong their ""super moves"" actually were. Some rules of the contest that are established eventually end up being ignored, forgotten about, or are violated with no repercussions. It's almost like the rules are a gentleman's agreement, but you don't REALLY have to follow them. That's fine if that's the case but they never really say that.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fun show though, and over the course of 26 episodes none of these complaints crop up too consistently. There's a lot of meat here and getting into some more back stories for the characters could have definitely resulted in at least one more season or even two. The show could've used more actual fighting too in my opinion but regardless you're still intrigued the whole time about who will emerge victorious. I hate to say I think it's a bit overrated, but you should check it out anyways. Just expect to be in it for the long haul to get the most out of it, and for some episodes to be far better than others.",18 out of 33 found this helpful.,7.0,6 April 2015
491,Fate/Zero, Amazing History War,"Hear my review.<br/><br/>With the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor. Being the prequel of the well known franchise Fate/Stay Night, Fate/zero certainly captured the attention of many very easily. What is immediately clear about this production though is not only does it match its predecessor, it far surpasses it in every way imaginable. Whether it be the directing, visuals, character exposition, or anything you can possibly think of, Fate/zero manages to move into a class of its own. In the end, this all adds up to a much more complex and interesting tale, which one will certainly not be soon to forget.<br/><br/>An interesting note about the cast in Fate/Zero though is that it mostly consists of older men. This is particularly noteworthy because so few anime today dare to make a cast of older men. It showcases just how a story with older cast members, even if they are men, can be quite entertaining and that perhaps the same old tired formulas do not always need to be employed to reach certain audiences. A story does not always have to be about high school kids, and hopefully this show can set an example of that<br/><br/>

492,Fate/Zero, Fate/Zero,"There are two significant differences between ""Fate/stay night"" and ""Fate/Zero"". Firstly, ""Zero"" is not a harem series; and secondly, generally good.<br/><br/>This is largely due to the difference in source material: ""Stay night"" was based upon a naughty game, whereas ""Zero"" is based upon spin-off light novels. Though still not exactly higher literature, the increase in competence is significant. Two aspects in particular are immediately nailed:<br/><br/>1. Establishing scale. In ""Fate/stay night"", it always bothered me that this globe-spanning conflict was decided in one Japanese city, or more specifically: on one Japanese high school. In a videogame this can to a certain degree be justified by gameplay, but in a series it is just bad writing.<br/><br/>""Zero""'s lengthy first episode (45 minutes, that feel like 20) takes us all over the world: from Totally-Not-The-Vatican to Totally-Not-Neuschwanstein to Totally-Not-Oxford (with a Totally-Not-Big-Ben, peculiarly), and of course to our beloved Fuyuki City, where all characters gather. This does create the common problem that a prequel takes place on a bigger scale than the story that is supposed to be its grand conclusion. However, ""Stay night"" isn't good and ""Zero"" is, so the writers can have their cake and eat it, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>2. Establishing characters. ""Stay night"" took it as self-evident that all Masters wanted the Grail, and barely bothered with actual motivations. ""Zero"" delves much deeper into their backstories, allowing for psychological conflict that is far more interesting than the physical trouble of both wanting the same thing.<br/><br/>Amongst the seven masters, two duos share narrative focus. The first (and less important one) consists out of magic student Waver Velvet and his professor, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald. The novice wants to prove that even those without ancient lineage can become great mages with enough training; the professor wants to teach him a lethal lesson. However, it does not come to a direct, or even indirect, confrontation, let alone a discussion of their scholarly conflict. Their bond is a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Far more interesting is the interaction between Kirei Kotomine, a young priest, and Kiritsugu Emiya, a mercenary. On a surface level, the two are very similar: both clever, powerful, ruthless and recognising each other as their most dangerous adversary. But it is their differences that make them interesting (forgive the cliché -- its use here is justified).<br/><br/>Kiritsugu is an enigma for most of the series. He will go to stunning lengths to achieve his goals, including blowing up skyscrapers and sacrificing his own companions. This leads to some splendid conflict with his Servant, King Arthur, whose knightly ethos is hurt by her Mater's ruthlessness. Nevertheless, Kiritsugu shows an underlying idealism that allows for glimpses of depth.<br/><br/>Kirei, on the other hand, starts off intentionally two-dimensional. He is highly competent, yet emotionally empty. He fights because he is ordered to, and takes little joy in anything. Over the course of the series he is slowly corrupted by the Servant Gilgamesh, who plays into his inability to understand Kiritsugu and his search for meaning in life. His becoming of evil is a delight to watch. Indeed, Kirei's emotional arc is the strongest one in the whole series. His character is a combination of Faust, Claude Frollo, and Wolverine... if you can picture that.<br/><br/>Despite this good set-up, some of the pacing issues from ""Stay night"" are still present. Most glaringly, the story is interrupted three times by special episodes that undermine the series' structure. The one in which the three Servant kings (Arthur, Alexander, Gilgamesh) sit down to drink wine and discuss philosophy is quite nice. And the one dedicated to little Rin is cute, if redundant. But the two whole episodes relaying Kiritsugu's backstory are a mess.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious matter that leaving them out would have made for a stronger character (knowing how Kiritsugu ends up in ""Stay night""), these episodes are detrimental to the series' tone. The backstory is, to put it simply, utterly ridiculous. I can take female King Arthur fighting for the Holy Grail against the legions of Nyarlathotep, but magic vampire zombies? And then playing it as straight drama? You've got to know when to stop.<br/><br/>By placing these two weakest episodes right before the final battle, the writers bring the series' pacing to a complete standstill, hereby deflating the carefully built tension.<br/><br/>Only with great effort does ""Zero"" manage to get back on its feet. Some generally splendid plot-twists, truly epic battles, and an emotionally resonant conclusion ultimately manage to end the series on a satisfying note, even if this victory comes not unconditionally.<br/><br/>Despite its fair share of flaws and silliness (I have refrained from mentioning Gilgamesh's echt-Babylonian jet fighter) and not having as much depth as some would have you believe, ""Fate/Zero"" is quite good. It is an adept action anime with writing, fighting and animation all slightly better than we are used to. Most impressively, it spun off from one of the most dishearteningly plain action-harem anime of the decade, and manages to elevate its material far higher than would ever seem possible.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,19 September 2019

497,Fate/Zero," One of the greats, so lovable","You could watch this anime and never hear of the original Fate/stay night which is a beauty. <br/><br/>It pretty much sums everything up in the first episode, it's long and might bore you but it will pay off to understand the rest of the series. <br/><br/>If you're into historical subjects then you will enjoy it, however, they do twist it up a bit (not the reason why it's a 8 by the way) <br/><br/>Absolutely amazing writing, alike with another anime: Attack On Titan (and all the fangirls flip their shizz) it is very dark, maybe even a bit darker.

Beginning with the dazzling opening credits and stylish musical score, this show is an absolute joy every week. I fail to understand how anyone can possibly be unimpressed by the gorgeous period costumes and sets and the fine, subtle performances of most of the cast. If there's a weakness to be found, it's with Jeremy Piven's acting, though I admit that even he's starting to grow on me as his character begins to acquire a little more dimension. But there's so much else that's wonderful about this series, including engaging story lines, that Piven can almost be overlooked. Overall, it's a light, frothy confection that charms and delights in an easy way that few shows ever manage. But I suppose charm is out of fashion.

500,Mr Selfridge, A Period Drama Worth Watching,"When I first read about the show I was skeptical, but I found I fell in love with it from first view. The way the story is distributed among multiple characters is definitely something you don't see every day, or at least not with the quality that ""Mr Selfridge"" has. I'm reminded how relationships run on the fast track, how they lack foundation and are never really secure, how decisions are made on a whim, when you're overwhelmed or when you feel you need more from life that you're currently getting. The fact that everyone is susceptible to passion and making mistakes is at the core of all human beings and the cast of the show portray it beautifully through a much needed emotional acting that most shows fail to provide. The splendor of the fashion world and the eagerness of the workers reveal the inner beauty of times long gone. Mr Selfridge has become one of my favourite period dramas and I have high hopes for its future.",74 out of 89 found this helpful.,10.0,4 February 2013
501,Mr Selfridge, 'Mr Selfridge': Buyers' Delight,"'Mr Selfridge' (PBS) <br/><br/>The great American playwright Neil Simon, in his memoir ""Rewrites,"" recalls that he was on the brink of ""replacing"" the late actor Jerry Orbach in the Broadway musical ""Promises, Promises,"" when suddenly, Orbach seemed to pull a performing rabbit out of the hat and became absolutely brilliant in the part. The show, an adaptation of the 1960 Oscar-winning film, ""The Apartment,"" had 1,281 performances from December of 1968 to January of 1972, and Orbach won the Tony Award as Best Actor for his performance. I was reminded of this as I watched Jeremy Piven in the title role of the PBS drama series, ""Mr Selfridge,"" which has just begun its second season. The series, a British period piece about Henry Gordon Selfridge, the American who came to London and opened his department store, Selfridge &amp; Co., at the beginning of the 20th century, has clearly been a class production since the moment it premiered (January 6, 2013 in the United Kingdom and March 30, 2013 in the United States). What I was less certain about was Piven. He didn't, at first, seem up to the task of matching stride for stride a cast that was chock-full of fine British actors. My suspicion is that he himself was questioning his abilities. But he had his moments, enough to have hope for him in the second season. He's now proved, as the next go-round gets underway, that like Orbach, he possesses a deep reservoir of talent that has allowed him to pull the performing rabbit out of the hat, doing not only a capable job, but an outstanding one, certainly worthy of consideration when awards season rolls around. Like the Selfridge character itself, a man who matured and evolved from a philandering husband and mercurial businessman to a steady spouse and solid leader, Piven also has grown, delving into the many sides of a truly prismatic man, as complex as he was brilliant, with a sure hand that reveals an actor who knows what he is doing and mesmerizes in the process. The series itself is knee-deep in colorful quality, depicting the landmark Selfridge department store and the period in which it was born with a brilliance that both captivates and explains. The supporting cast is superb _ Frances O'Connor as Selfridge's beleaguered wife, Rose, Aisling Loftus as the blossoming young woman and retail whiz Agnes Tower, Gregory Fitoussi as Selfridge's best friend and business confidant Henri Leclair, Amanda Abbington as the emotionally fragile sales head Miss Mardle (it's nearly impossible to imagine Abbington as the icy, assured Mary Morstan that she so effectively portrays in the BBC's hit series, ""Sherlock""), Tom Goodman-Hill as the sad personnel head Mr. Grove, Ron Cook as the ever-dependable right hand man Mr. Crabb, and on an on. But without an effective Piven as Selfridge, the foundation of this universe would crumble. Especially now. The plot is beginning to thicken, as they say, with World War I on the horizon. Complex issues, plots and characters obviously await. It's clear that Piven, as Orbach did decades ago on Broadway, has found his sweet spot with his character. And as with ""Promises, Promises,"" the sky's the limit for ""Mr Selfridge.""",25 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,8 April 2014
502,Mr Selfridge, Delightful British Masterpiece,"I'm a late arrival to this true gem of a series, giving me the distinct benefit and joy of watching back-to-back episodes in a binge viewing. Frankly, my initial reaction was ""what could be interesting about a department store?"" I'm glad I went with a friend's recommendation and had a view.<br/><br/>Mr. Selfridge is a finely handled period piece which continues the tradition of exceptional British drama. Jeremy Piven is an inspired choice for Mr. Selfridge, showing his dramatic chops once again in a difficult and demanding role. I've often thought Mr. Piven had more to show us, and this series gives him the opportunity.<br/><br/>As well, the rest of the cast is strong and well-defined. It didn't take long to get hooked into the varied tribulations, trials and triumphs of the characters.<br/><br/>As a confirmed Downton Abbey fan, I thought this series would be a pale copy. I was wrong. It holds it's own very well. The challenge of balancing the factual aspects of Selfridge's history with the fictional, yet realistically painted accounts of the people behind the store, has been very capably managed by the writers. The drive, innovation, quality and forward thinking of the actual Selfridge has been captured here in a way that makes the viewer see how astonishing and astute Selfridge the businessman was.<br/><br/>Kudos to everyone involved. And the theme music for the series is truly inspired. Every time I hear it, I want to shop.",41 out of 52 found this helpful.,10.0,20 October 2013
503,Mr Selfridge, British TV at it's best,"I am loving this series and the details that the production company have put into the costumes and sets are a delight to watch. The hats (referring to some of the previous reviews) are in keeping of the time and reflect, with some humour, some the huge hats women wore at this time. Though I am sure that Mrs Selfridge would have had more hats as she was very wealthy would be nice to see her wearing a few more designs (hint hint ). The cast is very well put together a nice mix of interesting characters, reminds me of the original series of Upstairs Downstairs showing both the upper class and working class characters. I hope they continue to explore all of these characters as well Mr Selfridge. <br/><br/>Some people have made mention to the lack of locations used in the series so far, myself I actually like the fact that it's not filmed in hundreds of locations. With good story and characters I don't need to be shown lots of location filming to grab my interest. Though it would be quite nice to see some more of the homes of the workers. As much as I am enjoying this series as pure entertainment I am actually finding it historically interesting to see the beginnings of the modern department store that we know today. Having worked in department store myself I found all those little details such as the introduction of the perfume counter at the front of the store very interesting from a geeky historian point of view lol. Over all a Lovely series to watch on a Sunday night, I hope there will be a 2nd series, nice to see ITV doing more period dramas.",49 out of 64 found this helpful.,9.0,1 March 2013
504,Mr Selfridge, well worth watching,"As a Londoner who moved out to the states in the 90;s I loved this program.

Each week left me waiting for next weeks episode. is there a lot of romance? yes, but that is the man who had demons. What I found brilliant, was American speed of life, meets English speed of life, which was that much slower, and reserved. Each character, who are brilliantly cast, and plays their roles so well goes towards the jigsaw puzzle that makes this a great show.

506,Mr Selfridge, I had high expectations and this series surpassed them.,"When I saw this series advertised, I thought- Ah yes, another period series. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love series set decades (or in this case, a century) ago. However, in recent times, with the growth in number of these shows, I worry that some are churned out lacking the necessary quality and are present more as an exhibition of period clothing than exceptional story lines. This show, however, was just excellent in my opinion. It challenges viewers whilst capturing the time period. The characters are all divine in their ways. One even finds a place in their hearts for the least desirable characters on the show. I think Mr Selfridge, as well as Call the Midwife, should be ranked and awarded as highly as Oscar-winning Mad Men. Mr Selfridge surpasses expectations by tenfold. For viewers reading this review, who agree with my appreciation of Mr Selfridge, I also recommend Call the Midwife.",18 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,4 October 2013

508,Mr Selfridge, Season two finale was the BEST!!!,"I started watching this show during the first season. I favor British costume dramas because of their nostalgia, elegance and style. At first, Pivens, as an actor, seemed stiff, monotone and non-human, like a caricature. This season, however, he has much improved. We see many sides to his character, and his acting is quite sufficient. The whole entire cast is excellent. How do they keep finding all these excellent actors??? Ms. Ainsling is a real gem. Her character is a bit modest and at times bumbling, but you can never take your eyes off her. This season's finale pulled out all the stops. All the unexpected twists and turns of plot were carefully designed to moisten even the driest of eyes. So much heart. Such great script writers. Wonderful ensemble cast!!! American TV shows pale in comparison to these British costume dramas that keep coming out of Masterpiece.

511,Mr Selfridge, A New British Series off to a bit of a muddling start,"This week Masterpiece Theater introduces yet another series about early 19th century England and while the story is based on fact it seems less rigidly factual than simply a bouncing diving board for a new series that time will tell if it will last. The costumes are most assuredly the main character and for an introductory outing that seems to set the scene just fine.<br/><br/>The interest comes from the apparently true fact that this represents the tale of how London's Selfridge's Department store began. Harry Gordon Selfridge comes to London to establish a department store that understands what women want ' 'to go shopping.' After a brief moment in the standard London store Selfridge is put off by the stringent rules and regulations of just how people can purchase items in a store atmosphere (as opposed to scheduled meetings with personal tailors and dressmakers in private). Jeremy Piven sparkles in the role of the flamboyant optimist who doesn't seem to know the meaning of defeat and manages to pull off the opening of his glorious new store a year after he arrives. He loses, backing, finds backing form a wealthy Lady Mae and her husband, makes changes in the way employees are hired and treated, and falls in fancy with a chorus girl Miss Love (Zoë Tapper), befriends a salesgirl Agnes (Aisling Loftus) who lost her job when Selfridge visited her previous employer, greets his wife (Frances O'Connor) and family when they arrive from America to join him, and is privy to all manner of subplots that are always necessary if a series is going to be successful.<br/><br/>The story is a bit less than involving but the plots that are established (the variety of which remind us that the series is written by four writers and directed by four directors) offer suggestion that there will be some interesting derring-do, intrigue, criminal activity, love affairs, family squabbles - all those things that make continuing watching the series worth while. There are some fine actors involved - Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Ron Cook, Grégory Fitoussi, Lauren Crace, Amanda Abbington, Amy Beth Hayes, Tom Goodman-Hill, Trystan Gravelle, Malcom Rennie, Deborah Cornelius, Kika Markham, Catherine Kelly and many more in this huge cast. The first episode is rich enough in subplots to keep us coming back for more. <br/><br/>Grady Harp",20 out of 30 found this helpful.,7.0,1 April 2013
512,Mr Selfridge, What sticks out most in this series is what a terrible actor Jeremy Piven is,"Mrs. Shullivan and I booked a summer cottage and hunkered down in the evenings to binge watch multiple episodes of Mr. Selfridge all the while hoping the series would improve and hold us spellbound as the seasons progressed. This series may be loosely based on real people, and real retail store empires, but it became evident by the end of season 2 that what we were actually watching was an over dramatized ""event series"" whose lead actor Jeremy Piven's portrayal of the retail store giant entrepreneur Mr. Selfridge was more of a cartoon character who came across as a stand-in performer for someone else who was unfamiliar with his talking lines as well as the emotions his character was intended to evoke.<br/><br/>So we hung in there for all four (4) seasons and we were totally disappointed that this television series only memorable scenes were the episode ending credits which brought us ever so closer to the series ending episode. Actor Ron Cook who plays the down to earth CFO Mr. Crabb, to Mr. Selfridge was the saving grace in any scene he appeared in. Jeremy Piven however is credited as a producer, as well as a co-producer and even an executive producer so maybe he considered this series as his own special vanity project to show off his acting chops, or his crowning achievement, but instead he (personally) failed miserably and I for one am left with a low opinion of any future TV and/or film projects that the actor Jeremy Piven may be involved in if Mr. Selfridge is to be considered his baby.<br/><br/>I am only giving the series a more than generous 5 out of 10 rating as we invested forty (40) hours of our summer vacation late evening time in binge watching this biographical/historical series and I would otherwise be admitting I am a bigger fool than I actually am in wasting forty (40) hours of my time otherwise.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,5.0,3 July 2019

514,Mr Selfridge, Non-masterpiece for Masterpiece PBS,"I waited until I saw the entire 8 parts of this before commenting.<br/><br/>Here is how to make a terrible TV production. Have the lead role so badly miscast and add horrible writing. Dump into a pot of another Edwardian period England stew, sift in a large supporting cast of upper elites and lower classes, and you have a too familiar and predictable over-long series that is just plain boring in the end.<br/><br/>Piven could not give a worse performance of pearly white teeth smiles and forced grimaces and stock method pouting. He is not just in the wrong show, the scripts are just terrible for his part. Ditto for his ""family"". <br/><br/>The most interesting parts of this series, end up belonging to the shop working class employees (just like in the original Upstairs,Downstairs where the ""family"" that toiled below stairs were the people who won our hearts most.) <br/><br/>If only the producers of this show had left well enough alone.<br/><br/>Another problem with these modern ""period"" productions: too much music (they call it ""dramatic underscore""--OK, but why so much of it? Ironically, the music for the series was the only Emmy award nomination for 2013. No acting nominations, none for art direction, nor costumes etc. Just the music. That tells a lot what the Emmy judges thought of this, and no surprise.<br/><br/>Other problems (besides using too many vernacular idioms script-wise), is the continual reliance on gimmickry camera shots, and wild moving camera swings around the interior set of the store, quick little fast-edited reactions shots and short little snipped scenes of dialogue--the overall effect is dizzying and annoyingly distracting. Why can't they just shoot a scene as a normal scene without all the gimmicks and shaky camera effects and once again, without all the background music?? <br/><br/>And there will be a second season. That is sad,sad,sad. Shame on the producers of Masterpiece for feeding us tripe and promising more to come. Sad,sad,sad.",23 out of 40 found this helpful.,1.0,18 July 2013

Hardly a romantic leading man!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is by and large excellent, but I just cannot get past the casting of the male lead!<br/><br/>Frances O'Connor is a face I have not seen in a long time and am glad to see again!

516,Mr Selfridge, A story from history destroyed by a modern perspective and not enough money,"This series is based on a fascinating book - it's the real-life story of American entrepreneur Harold Selfridge and the American-style department store he created in the middle of London a century ago. There are plenty of real-life stories to pull from for the series but they happened over a broad period of time. So far this series seems to be stuck in the first year, at least that's how it appears because most characters wear the exact same outfit in every scene. Even more distracting than that are the constant contemporary slip-ups, from Jeremy Piven's fluorescent white teeth and faceless mannequins, to women freely entering men's clubs, public kissing, and the use of words that weren't even in the English language yet like 'lipstick'. Why bother setting something in the past when its clear that the writers and director have no interest in recreating history other than for picture postcard purposes.

I also thought the dialogue stilted and contrived and the narrative itself sounded second-hand,a thrift shop sort of series where the actors are primed and primped and off they go...has anyone actually been realistically served in this shop since the series began? I've looked but not seen one purchase and how sad as Selfridges has such lovely things...<br/><br/>No, its a boo-boo.

518,Mr Selfridge, Piven Is Awful,"I must admit that I didn't even finish the first episode. I have always liked Jeremy Piven since first watching him play a bitter writer on the excellent ""Larry Sanders Show"", and I thought that even when ""Entourage"" started to seem tired and aimless, Piven always held up his end in his delightful portrayal of the ruthless, preening agent Ari Gold. And so I was interested to see if this man could step out of his usual character and play retail pioneer Selfridge, a role that if played successfully would prove the Piven is truly a gifted actor, not just a reusable character.<br/><br/>The answer comes all to quickly in the first episode: Piven can't act. What is the point of watching, or even discussing, a show called ""Mr. Selfridge"" when the guy playing the titular role is just so completely, irredeemably awful? The rest of the production might be great or terrible, I don't care because I will never force myself watch Piven stomp around the set completely sucking every moment he is on camera. He is so bad, he doesn't even have to say anything to make one cringe! Just that phony fleeting half-smile that seems to scream ""Look Ma, I'm ACTING!"" instantly demonstrates that he is in way over his head.<br/><br/>For Heaven's sake, Jeremy, come to your senses and RUN, and tell everybody you had a horrible psychotic break with reality and you can't remember anything that happened. Then maybe...MAYBE you can land a future role in the kind of comedy farce at which you excel, and redeem yourself from the nightmare that is ""Mr. Selfridge.""",19 out of 36 found this helpful.,1.0,1 January 2014
519,Mr Selfridge, Suffered through first episode of Selfridge,"So surprised that this series has gotten so many favorable reviews. I never write reviews of things and barely comment but felt compelled to write this. Loved Jeremy Piven on Entourage but after watching him as Selfridge, it felt to me that he had not only never acted before in his life but possibly had never even SEEN good acting. He seems to shout all of his lines with no emotional depth of character and no connection to anyone else he is working with. The story line seems trite and the writing extremely inconsistent and uninteresting. Not to mention using some expressions that I question were in existence at that time like Selfridge saying ""I'll catch you later."" Really? The other thing that I question was the cinematography. The sepia tone used to push the period feel, I felt works against the theme. Selfridges was supposed to be about luxury but the lack of color in the series does not make anything look luxurious. Last thing, I do love all of the supporting characters (they DO know what acting is about) But seems like the director and/or casting director has chosen female leads that all slightly resemble each other.

Some very sympathetic characters and Jeremy Piven is good in the title role. It's not up the same standard as DA but it does hold its own. Some of the villains are a tad cartoonish but on the whole it fills a Downton Abbey-sized whole in the viewing schedule. Also, some very impressive hats!

522,Mr Selfridge, Interesting turn of the century series,"For starters, ""Downton Abbey"" this is not. For some odd reason, a few critics out there expected another blockbuster PBS/BBC miniseries in the same vein as ""D.A."" but that rarely ever happens.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Mr. Selfridge"" is certainly a well-made tale about the titular character who's wonderfully played by Jeremy Piven. A few critics made comments of some kind or other, claiming that the actor was just playing his Ari character from Entourage with a different wardrobe or whatever but that's an unfair assessment, at least in my opinion. Piven plays Selfridge as a mercurial, ambitious man, driven to be a success, even at the expense of his sweet but frustrated wife Rose, played by a glowing Frances O'Conner. I liked how they showed Harry, flaws and all. You root for him, even when he's being a knob to his wife and family because Piven gives him a likability despite his often over-driven personality.<br/><br/>The series weaves in several other human interest stories, fleshing out the people that helped make Selfridge's the successful store it became (and still is today). I especially liked the stories surrounding shop girl Agnes, rising slowly but steadily from dirt poor to a senior position, all the while getting romanced by not one but two of her handsome fellow co-workers. The writers even give O'Conner's ""Rose"" a tempted storyline with a hot young painter when she starts to feel neglected by Harry and grows suspicious of his after hours activities (which tended to include popular chorus girl and reigning tart, Ellen Love). Good stuff.<br/><br/>The series did start off a bit slow in the first two hours but once it picked up steam and you knew who was who and what was going on, it really began to hold it's own. If you want Downton style drama, well, this series won't match it but the acting in Mr Selfridge is first rate and the character's stories will draw you in and keep you there.

524,The Young Riders," Wonderful cast, unforgettable show","I cannot calculate how many hours I have spent watching this show. You only have to check out the fan sites on the internet to see its impact. This must be one of the best (and best-looking) casts ever assembled. Josh Brolin is intense, sexy and magical as 'James Butler Hickock'. Anthony Zerbe hits just the right note as the wise but eccentric 'Teaspoon'. Ty Miller as 'Kid' is sincere and appealing. Gregg Rainwater plays the sensitive 'Buck', a half-breed torn between two worlds but belonging to none. Travis Fine is remarkable as 'Ike', a bald mute. Could any other actor have pulled off such a role? Brett Cullen is the handsome and fair marshal 'Sam Cain', if only he had stayed beyond season 1! Yvonne Suhor gives and amazing and sympathetic portrayal of 'Louise McLoud', a scared but strong woman trying to make it in a man's world by disguising her femininity. Don Franklin plays the intelligent, funny, but frustrated 'Noah Dickson' - who is very far from the usual stereotypical portrayal of blacks in westerns. Chris Pettiet plays 'Jesse James' at 14, a boy anxious to grow up and be a man but badly needing guidance and a sense of family. The comic relief is provided by Stephen Baldwin who gets all the best lines as the obnoxious but endearing 'William F. Cody' (although you may more often than not be laughing at him, not with him).  The first housekeeper was 'Emma Shannon' (Melissa Leo), a woman trying to make it in the west after being deserted by her husband. She becomes a mother figure for the riders, something that most of them were lacking. Later came Clare Wren who played the sexy 'Rachel Dunne' who was a lot tougher and wiser than she looked. Well I don't think I missed anyone out. The show also had fantastic guest stars, excellent shoot-outs, and showed the conflicts that were developing between the north and the south at that time. It also showed the true meaning of love and friendship. It was wonderfully shot and had just the right blend of drama, action, and humor.

526,The Young Riders, The 19th Century Greatest Generation,"What do MASH and The Young Riders have in common? It's an interesting answer and you'd guess it immediately if you know your history. Both television series lasted longer than the historical event they were set in. MASH which ran over ten years was longer than the three years of the actual Korean War.<br/><br/>The Young Riders lasted for 3 seasons and in real life The Pony Express was started in 1860 and lasted until the beginning of the Civil War. Technology replaced horses, the telegraph invented almost 20 years earlier finally spanned the continent.<br/><br/>Still for its brief time, The Pony Express which was run under government contract by the famous western freighting firm of Russell, Majors&amp;Waddell certainly earned its colorful place in our history. In doing the television show the producers went back into what used to be done in Hollywood westerns, take some frontier legends and weave plots around the names that had nothing to do with real life.<br/><br/>According to this show Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickok and Jesse James all rode for the Pony Express. Of the group only Cody did in real life and he was all of 14 at the time. Stephen Baldwin was a bit older than the real Cody during his Pony Express period. Of course in the film Pony Express the mature Charlton Heston played Cody and Baldwin was certainly closer than him.<br/><br/>In that same film Forrest Tucker played Wild Bill Hickok. Hickok would have been in his early twenties as Josh Brolin was at the time of the series and he did work for Russell,Majors&amp;Waddell at the time. But he was a teamster, he drove their freight wagons. He was too old to be a Young Rider. In fact that was what the Pony Express looked for, young riders, teenage boys looking for a little adventure and a chance to make a decent wage. To those farm and ranch kids trying to make a living off the land, this was a great opportunity.<br/><br/>A third western legend, a child actually at this time also joined The Pony Express. Young Christopher Pettiet played Jesse James who never had any connection at all with the Pony Express joined the cast in the third and final season. He was a fine young player and his death from a drug overdose in 2000 was a tragic end to a promising career.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast reflected some of the issues of the times. There was a southern kid simply called The Kid who was played by Ty Miller. Gregg Rainwater played an American Indian young rider, Travis Fine was a mute young rider, Don Franklin joined the cast as a runaway slave escaped to the free west in the third season as a young rider.<br/><br/>The most interesting gimmick was Yvonne Suhor who was going in incognito drag. I don't think the rules of The Pony Express expressly forbade women in its employ, but they sure didn't provide any separate accommodations in those relay stations. For about half the first season, no one knew she was a women. Then it finally came out, though at first only relay station manager Anthony Zerbe knew.<br/><br/>Zerbe played a colorful western type character who must have felt like he was running a summer camp. But these kids were there to work and their work created a legend that's come down to us today. If the young people of the World War II era are the Greatest Generation of the last century, than those who were in the Pony Express who joined the Union and Confederate Armies of the time in an awful Civil War, were the 19th Century Greatest Generation. The awful tragedy is that this generation was busy killing each other in that the USA be preserved and free for all.<br/><br/>When The Young Riders ended its run, the various cast members left the disbanded Pony Express to whatever destiny their consciences told them where to go. It was a moving finale to the series and something played out across the United States of America and the Confederate States of America in thousands of homes.<br/><br/>Despite some really bad historical inaccuracies, The Young Riders was a fine series and I wish it lasted a bit longer.",11 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,16 June 2009
527,The Young Riders, Young Riders are missed,"I, and many friends, miss this show. While there were many liberties taken in the writing of the show it was very entertaining. The actors did exceptional jobs of expressing the mood and attitudes of the mid 1800's just prior to the Civil War. The Plight of the Native American people was highlighted in several episodes as was slavery. The writers used and developed characters to portray person's trapped in the non-white world. One character, Buck, played by Gregg Rainwater, developed over the three seasons from a relatively minor character of mixed blood to a highly intelligent, well read person who completely broke the misconception of the ignorant drunk Indian. I feel more could have been done with the Civil War aspect of the show but they chose to end it instead. I'm hoping this show will be released to DVD as I would like my children to see it.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,,28 March 2005

The show had such an impact on me; in some weird way, I think it really helped me to grow up into a better/stronger person than I was! Now, 15 years later, as an adult, I just got the DVD of Season 1 for Christmas. I thought I might be embarrassed by my earlier obsession, but I was wrong! I fell in love with the show all over again! There is just some special quality to the characters and their relationships to one another that really sets this show apart. I am really hoping Seasons 2 and 3 get released on DVD.

Well, when The Young Riders came on TV I forgot all about that and I was as healthy as anyone jumping up and down in my bed and feeling great (I even made up lyrics to the theme music that I used to sing as the theme played) and I felt fantastic until the end of the episodes when my throat was killing me and my fever was high as ever. Such good times! :)<br/><br/>Season 1 of the series has finally been released on DVD! To those of you who never watched the show when it aired, I ask you to check it out now. The show's got everything...action, romance, adventure, pretty boys, humor, gun fights, a great theme song, pretty girls etc. It's also a great opportunity to watch the young Josh Brolin and Stephen Baldwin in action. You'll love it, I promise. <br/><br/>PS. Guest stars of season one include Cynthia Nixon (of Sex and the City), Rob Estes, Chris Penn (R.I.P), Fisher Stevens etc.<br/><br/>And in an episode of season two Pernell Roberts (Adam Cartwright of 'Bonanza') guest stars.

542,The Young Riders, Not Western but human drama show,"I was touched when I saw this show first approximately 10 years ago. I think I was in junior high or high school at that time.

Speaking of the atmosphere of the show, I didn't really care about the shooting scenes themselves in general and also in this show, but the reasons why they fought were adorable. People in the show could die for their dignity, which was similar to part of the Samurai spirit in Japan hundreds years ago. Well, the shooting scenes didn't have much percentage in the show, though. Anyway, what I'm saying is that this show has stories and it is not like the just-shoot-them-all-because-they-are-bad ""masterpiece"" Western movies.

550,Aquarius, A slow burn but worth the wait,"I was on the fence until about the 5th episode. But as the multiple cases and crimes start interconnecting, the plot thickens to a nice soup. David Duchovny pulled some acting chops I've never seen before actually. Everyone else seems to hold their weight as well. A lot of people complain that Manson wasn't that ""pretty"" or tall but if you look at the earlier interviews with the real Manson, you'll see for yourself that he wasn't a bad looking guy. And this is taking place before those interviews. <br/><br/>I think the show does a good job of not trying to make Manson super scary, and I'm sure it'd be tempting too, knowing how much of a boogeyman his name is in American culture. Despite his psychological charms, he was also just a tripped out mess too. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a Manson story that's going to hurry along and give you the film depiction of the Tate murders, etc.. it's going to disappoint. I was half-way disappointed but I stuck in there, and I'm glad I did. If there's future seasons, by the time they show the progression of Manson's character into what he's known for today, I think it's going to really pay off for the audience.",37 out of 41 found this helpful.,8.0,4 June 2015

Instead, Aquarius adds creative twists that make the show worth watching. I've never been interested in crime shows and I have a very short attention span. I had no problem making it through the first season of Aquarius and enjoyed every episode. I can't trust the snob reviews people post on here.

The same occurs when you watch the X files: another character very well formed but completely different from the other Duchovny's roles . That's good acting. 
The show is convincing, realistic and has a great soundtrack. If it weren't for the brownish filter that they put in every single episode with the purpose of letting you know that the events take place in the 60s the show will be great.",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,8.0,24 May 2018

I respect and appreciate that decision because this show is a great one to binge on. Making such a bold move seems to have pushed expectations to unattainable heights based on some of the reviews I've seen. This is a good series.

554,Aquarius, Finally a different cop show!

I think the show is probably building up to it if the show last that long I personally think that the madness the actor is building up in his Manson character is exceptional, though this is my opinion and we all have one. <br/><br/>I find this series quite fascinating, it was a bit slow in the beginning but most new shows are. I found this show is different than all of the current cop shows on TV and I find it very entertaining. I was always a David Duchovny fan and I just discovered this show on demand over a weekend and spent the whole day watching all 12 episodes. The characters, to me, are mesmerizing, especially the guy who plays Manson (Genthon Anthony plays freaky amazingly well). I was never really into the whole Charlie Manson thing but my friend forced me to watch and I was hooked, in the beginning I thought that the plot would be the whole story line on Charlie Manson but there are other issues inter-weaved with the Charles Manson story not too mention the whole 60's era including the fashion, music, the attitude of the era between the hippy community and the so-called, overdrinking, straight laced adults which I really am enjoying.

Gethin Anthony totally channels Manson's body language. Look at Jason Ralph as Mike Vickery -- he steals the scenes he's in. And Gaius Charles as Bunchy Carter. There is brilliance in these supporting roles. The writers have written some incredibly witty dialogue. I've always been fascinated with Manson stories. This one is fresh.

556,Aquarius, Good after a rocky start,"SPOILER ALERT!!! <br/><br/>Having now binge watched all episodes as a Duchovny fan, I've got to be honest and say I was not taken in by the first two episodes that premiered this week on NBC. But I'm glad that I stuck with it and continued through the entire first season. It took some time for the series to catch its stride.<br/><br/>Set in Los Angeles 2 years before the Tate/La Bianca murders, Duchovny and Grey Damon (Friday Night Lights) play detectives with a generation gap who tangle with an early Charlie Manson. Some Justified players are also along for the ride. David Meunier plays a character I think is loosely based on Manson associate Tex Watson. Abbey Miller plays Manson's first follower, 'Mother Mary,' who comes into the family fold about half way through. Gaius Charles (also from FNLs) plays a Black Panther's leader.<br/><br/>As I said, the first two episodes, I didn't care for them. The loosely based Manson story was distracting, chaotic, even corny. At first, there is too much going on with that and Duchovny's character, Sam Hodiak, with a former love, her daughter, and his son. I was much more interested in getting to know the core cast in the Detective Squad. And the series finally goes there, moves through time, and takes on other cases and stories. Those law enforcement relationships are rich and honest, and I really enjoyed those stories a lot. Well cast and well acted. Hope to see a lot more of that in Season 2 because that is where the gold is.<br/><br/>Duchovny does a good job developing his character. As do he and Damon in slowly developing an unlikely partnership. Love the female officer. All of them. Even the racist officers and the Neanderthols of the 1960'd LAPD. As I said, it's honest.<br/><br/>I lived in So Cal during this time. I remember the hippies, the racial strife, the music, counter culture, and the political Revolution and unrest of the turbulent 60's. The Vietnam War. I was a kid, but I vividly remember the times. Manson should have been a minor backdrop in this series as a time marker . . . . and maybe in Season 2, he will be.",33 out of 44 found this helpful.,8.0,30 May 2015
557,Aquarius, Truth is Stranger Than Fiction,"Anyone that has done some research on Manson, the family and all circumstances that surrounded them before during and after the horrific countless murders that climaxed with the Tate La Bianca ones and the three ring circus that was the trial, knows that there was no need for writers and producers to embellish or go off book. Fact is stranger than fiction, especially in this story, you can't make this stuff up. The cast of characters, hippies, ranchers, runaways, satanic cultists, vindictive hells angels, black militants they re all there along with riff raff of all kind.

558,Aquarius," Pretty good, but with problems. Still stinks of network TV.","I really wanted to like Aquarius. What I mean is that the set-up, featuring society on the cusp of the counter culture in Los Angeles, with all its hippie utopia colliding with the darkness of Vietnam, the Watts riots, and of course the Manson family, is wonderfully colourful fodder for a contemporary miniseries/costume opera. What better material could you ask for in terms of good narrative threads, a wide variety of personalities, and great imagery? The So-Cal dream with its late sixties style, permissiveness, and lotus-land consciousness is rife with narrative potential as it meets the urban grit of your typical hard-boiled Los Angeles police department. Throw in some accomplished faces and the thing should write itself. And it succeeds to a degree. It's wonderful to look at, and well, feel. The series' construction works masterfully to affect a quiet unease amongst sun-drenched suburbs. The art direction has captured the Los Angeles of its day to a tee. You can practically smell the sweat and patchouli in the scenes of the hippie retreat of Topanga Canyon. Furthermore, there are interesting narrative arcs and sub-arcs that weave in and out of the two main characters' (David Duchovny as Sam Hodiak, the jaded, button-down detective, and Grey Damon as the undercover age-of-Aquarius narc) caseload. Items such as block-busting, the Black Panthers, and the anti-war movement all intrigue as we are reminded about just how fast a massive amount of social change was occurring at the time. A good eighty percent of this is really good, solid storytelling. Except it's also really troubled. There's that other twenty percent. And the biggest fault here is what they've given Duchovny to say. And how they told him how to say it. We know that Duchovny can make a good geekish, details-oriented detective, and against the setting of a transitioning world it's an apt, loner-ish choice. However, there's far too little of Mulder here, and unfortunately far, far too much of Californication's Hank Moody instead. It's as if he's being directed to be all his previous roles at the same time. While he comes off with intelligent observations about whatever nefarious crime he's looking into, he apparently cannot help but offer smug little one liners, in which the sense of irony is so completely before its time it's like he's in a completely different TV show. So badly do these dialogical frogs emerge, that one wonders if they let him write his own lines. But this isn't the whole of it. There are some relationships that just reek of falseness. The wealthy couple Grace and Ken, whose daughter has been adopted into the Manson clan, have conflicting and ridiculous reactions to the motivations in their lives. One asks if they themselves are on the acid their daughter takes with Charlie Manson, by accident perhaps? Furthermore, Hodiak's affair with Grace, and indeed his entire personal life, appears to have no emotional, nor rational foundation. For example, he's in recovery for the first five episodes, and then he's not – but without any really big reasons to be, or apparent consequences for not being. This is add-on screen writing at its worst and stinks of having been scribed 'by committee'. Worse than this however, is Ken's supposed evilness. Here, all the cards are pulled out. Greed, lust, duplicity, abandonment of one's child, being a lawyer, and belonging to the Republican party are all paraded and conflated as a consequence of Ken's – horror of horrors – homosexuality. Furthermore, they add onto this overloaded gay signifier the ultimate repulsion, a salacious gay romp with – you guessed it – Charlie Manson himself (played marvellously by Gethin Anthony – Game of Thrones' Renly Baratheon). This kind of demonizing of queerness is cheap, manipulative, and agonizingly tired. It's so bad in fact that it reminds one of bad network television of the era it's set in. These worn-thin tropes are one of the main reasons that the public is turning away from such twaddle, and moving towards much superior cable programming. Such programming is clearly what this show is attempting to catch up to – they've even gone so far to release the entire show at once - a la Netflicks. Yet come to think of it, looking at this as a piece of network television, one wonders if they'll ever really learn.",19 out of 24 found this helpful.,6.0,1 June 2015
559,Aquarius, Duchovny makes this whole show...,"After about 4 or 5 episodes I find myself waiting for Duchovny to come back into a scene, he makes this whole show go forward; otherwise, a bit plodding in terms of story and script. The Manson actor good but in a scene with Duchovny, no contest who makes the scene memorable. Without Duchovny, a plodding script with pretty boy, pretty girl actors whom you want to be forgiving towards as it is obvious they are trying their best and good at it, but the script will not let you do it.<br/><br/>The show does a pretty good job of showing the times for what they were in terms of dress, cars, music and the like but at times, it gets in the way of the show. For example, the Duchovny characters son shows up having fled the war as an enlisted soldier appalled that he was in Cambodia fighting what he believed was an illegal war. Accurate but really off topic and this character is a diversion to the plot and unnecessary to illustrate the times. It is unlikely Manson did what he did because of this, so why throw this in the script (including the Black Panther movement angle)?<br/><br/>If the writers had stuck to the crime drama, dress, music, cars of the period it would have been a great series. Too many plot diversions that are unnecessary and make the script plodding. <br/><br/>BTW, David looks great for his age and his acting accomplished. He makes the pretty boy actors in the show look just that, boys and not men. Why I gave the show an 8/10. Without him in this show, try 6/10 at best.",41 out of 58 found this helpful.,8.0,30 May 2015

There were so many twists and turns that I never saw coming.I can't say enough about the acting. The whole cast were so believable. The plot kept me hanging on wishing for more. I can't wait to see what next week brings. The mind controlling antics of Charles Manson is well portrayed. DD is excellent in his part, such a no-nonsense guy and I love his partner.

561,Aquarius, couldn't get into it,"There are some shows that don't really click with you. They can be well filmed, they can be well acted, but you just can't get enthusiastic about them. For me, Aquarius is one of those series.<br/><br/>There were things that started putting me off right away. The cinematography was slick but uninteresting. And I love 60s music, but I'm a little tired of this idea that you have to have people constantly listening to all the coolest songs from the 60s.<br/><br/>I didn't find most of the characters interesting, including Manson. I admit, Manson is tough, in that it's possible he really was kind of uninteresting but good at talking to particularly dumb girls, but to me he seems transparent and that makes his success puzzling.<br/><br/>For me, the only real bright spot was Grey Damon as an undercover cop. His scenes were all good, and I enjoyed the banter between Damon and Duchovny (although the rest of the time I found Duchovny flat). <br/><br/>I think this series is well enough made that there are people who will really like it, but I felt restless within the first 10 minutes and nothing in the rest of the first episode pulled me in after that.

Among the many elements that make this such a special event is the cinematography. It recalls film noir and still captures the color and off kilter tones of the 60's. The acting is uniformly excellent, with David Duchovny giving a stunning performance as the detective, Hodiak. It is stellar work and deserving of an Emmy nomination at least. In fact, there is little that isn't award worthy in Aquarius. Intense, fascinating, and utterly enthralling, this is television at its very finest.",59 out of 103 found this helpful.,10.0,29 May 2015
565,Aquarius, The retro vibe and bizarrely charismatic antagonist only amount to average thriller.,"Aquarius has good foundations for a drama thriller with its time period and decent cast. That being said, it doesn't really excite. The atmosphere is drab, not in intentionally classic manner, and the plot isn't audience friendly due to the vague script. The most it can offer is buddy cop mystery or the chase of an enigmatic villain, which is actually decent. However, as audiences have known better mystery show like True Detective or even The Following which has remarkably similar concept, Aquarius might not reach the iconic stature of its original source.<br/><br/>The show opens with a missing girl. Sam (David Duchovny) is called by his associates to look for the girl, who unfortunately has record of misbehavior. Then he embarks on the investigation, meeting potential suspect and hardheaded colleagues as the show frequently switches to the antagonist's point of view. It tries to give perspective of both sides in parallel.<br/><br/>It's properly made with sandy visual flair and hefty influence of the era like the baggy costume or old-fashioned tune. However, the introductions of the characters are bland. They are not memorable, even the role of Charles Manson is overly cryptic. It gets the story going, but doubtfully captives the audience. The songs and gimmick feel cosmetic, they don't emphasis much on the time except occasional reminders of trivial hippie style.<br/><br/>David Duchovny also isn't that engaging as the lead. He seems flat and is an uninteresting reminiscence of cop stereotype. Gethin Anthony as Charles Manson does a decent role of creepy yet alluring mysterious man, although he might not be that psychologically menacing. The script could've done a better job on setting the era or the character, but as much of the dialogues feel forced in hope to be edgy but ends up unrelatable.<br/><br/>Aquarius doesn't have glaring flaws, it doesn't possess clever hook or identifiable characters either. It's an average mystery drama with all of its aspects intact, but it is not as exalted as the real life source.",33 out of 57 found this helpful.,6.0,30 May 2015
566,Aquarius," Addicting, well written, love the way it handles themes of human prejudice!","I have been totally addicted to this show for the past week! It is obviously, openly, and unabashedly a fictional take on the early years of the Manson Family, a storyline that is meant to be an avenue for a fast paced, well written crime drama about a 50s detective trying to navigate 60s counterculture. David Duchovny rocks it out once again as his go-to lovable but flawed character, and though I would agree with many of the IMDb reviewers that the Manson Family is heavily glamorized, I think enough time has passed now for that to be appropriate you don't see anyone on here weeping about the glamorization 1920s gangsters murdering people in all those HBO shows, so I say glamorize away! One of my favorite aspects of the show is the way it uses Vietnam protesters and the civil rights movement to explore human prejudice and the idea that everyone has a line that they draw somewhere-- I think when you read about this period in a textbook you see people in the 60s as stereotypes who all think the same way as their societal tribe, but Aquarius uses a diverse cast to show the more accurate fluctuation of these mindsets- for example Brian, who is in an interracial marriage but has major hangups about going undercover in a gay bar, or Bunchie, a Black Panther who ends up having to work with the police, or Sam's struggle as an old school cop coming to terms with his soldier son's decision to protest Vietnam. Of course it is a little larger than life, but why not? The writing is entertaining, the pacing is perfect, and it brings up a ton of issues that are just as relevant today as they were then. I've been on the edge of my seat for 13 hours, thanks to NBC's solid decision to make it available for immediate streaming. Let's go Season 2!",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,5 June 2015
567,Aquarius, Why cancel it?,"Even though Duchovny was the lead and did a good job, I think the break out actors were Claire Holt ,Chance Kelly, Brían F. O'Byrne, and Michaela McManus. As having grown up in that era, I think they were all did an excellent job of crafting their roles into believable characters. And the sets were also period correct.<br/><br/>This was one of the few shows that I have really gotten into. I'm laid up with a torn hamstring, so watching shows is one of the few things I can do right now. I have looked everywhere online to try and figure out why the show was cancelled. It appears to have had pretty good ratings, and even better ratings once the put the first season in Netflix. <br/><br/>I know that they kill shows for all sorts of reasons, Political, poor ratings, problems with actors, etc. I know there was some problems with Debra Tate, and as I said, I grew up in this era, and I remember what happened to her sister and all the others very clearly. And understand her position of protecting her sisters memory and legacy. But she should have also realized that this show could have helped her bring the focus back onto this tragedy for a new generation of people who might never have known.<br/><br/>I can see many directions that could be taken with this story line and its characters.

568,Aquarius," Started Well, Then Quickly Began to Lose Stars","I soldiered my way through the pilot, and by the time it was finished knew it was time to say goodbye to this show.<br/><br/>At the beginning I would have rated it a 10. The music is fantastic. But that may have an underside: the licensing fees on these songs are high. Maybe that's why there was no money left for a good script or decent actors.<br/><br/>Worse yet, like so many shows it's very dark. Not dark in tone: that's perfectly fine. But other than the outdoor scenes, too often there's so little light on the scenes that it's more like radio than television. Here's another cinematographer who never met a 15 watt bulb he didn't like.<br/><br/>The story is set in the summer of 1967, the year I turned 21. When I saw a billboard for Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign in the scenes on the Sunset Strip I thought, hmmmm, wonder if this is going to turn up in later episodes.<br/><br/>The worst part is the presumption that the LAPD is going to spend two years investigating Charles Manson and despite David Duchovny's best efforts Manson (played with no charisma by a young man named Gethin Anthony) is going to do terrible things over the coming episodes.<br/><br/>Unless, of course, the show decides to completely abandon history and let Sharon Tate and her friends, and maybe even Bobby Kennedy, go forward into the 1970's unharmed. After all, the coveted viewers between the ages of 18 and 35 have only slight awareness of modern history.<br/><br/>Skip this.

First of all: playing old songs in the background all the time (and I do mean ALL the time) doesn't make anything look old. And apart from that they didn't really put much effort in convincing you it's the 60s... Then there is the camera and the whole look of the show which is just flat and dull and creates no atmosphere whatsoever.

570,Aquarius, Absolute Fiction,"Charlie Manson was one of the most bizarre characters of the 60's and the murders he and the ""family"" committed were enough to keep people on the edge of their seats for years. Why does NBC need to fictionalize almost every detail except Charlie's name? There was no Emma, nor her republican stereotyped parents. Sam Hodiak and Shafe are fiction. The other girls aren't named so who knows if they are actual Manson girls. What is the point of totally rewriting the story? <br/><br/>That said, David Duchovny is great and I like Grey's character. Gethin Anthony's portrayal of Manson comes off like a parody. The story is silly and simplistic. Are the writers trying to romanticize a lunatic? I sincerely suggest the writers do their homework?

571,Aquarius," If you weren't there, don't make movies about the Sixties","I lived through the Sixties as a young woman. The dialogue in Aquarius is ridiculous. None of us talked that way - especially not with Valley Girl accents. The writers have used contemporary teen talk, made-up cop insults and the worst of Jim Morrison's yowling poetry. The costumes are absurd - the writers seem to think that all you have to do to create a hippie character is give them dirty and ragged clothes. The clash with the cops is ludicrous - nobody used the insults the mob shouts. Not only weren't the hippies all white, many of us were older. Many of us believed in and worked at building a viable counter-culture. As for Manson - who seems to have become an object of juvenile fascination - he was singular. There were serious communes all over the States. All in all, miss this shoddy piece of exploitation.

He doesn't sound like him, he doesn't look like him and that dialogue is hackneyed and stilted. David Duchovny puts a pall on the whole production, he ruins it. It could have been so much more.

574,The Flintstones, None of the other Hanna-Barbera cartoons were this funny--or this smart,"""The Flintstones"" was so dead-on satirical in its view of a prehistoric suburban world that I don't really understand it when people tell me they liked ""The Jetsons"" better. There's nobody I can relate to on ""The Jetsons"", no character who exudes any warmth or wit. The characters here (Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, Dino, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, Mr. Slate, Mrs. Slaghoople, etc.) have expressions and personalities which are instantly recognizable to an audience. They're a very funny bunch, and they often find each other greatly amusing as well (each character has a sense of humor--and their friendships really do seem like a bond). I don't know why the Hanna-Barbera team weren't able to duplicate the quality of this show in terms of its writing and voice-casting (perhaps it was all a fluke?), but ""The Flintstones"" has it all: great writing and voices which bring one-dimensional drawings to life, terrific plots, fantastic music by Hoyt Curtin.

And even though I feel that in most cases the introduction of cute kids ruins a show, the introduction of Pebbles and Bamm Bamm helped to show that beneath his gruff exterior Fred was a big teddy bear.

579,The Flintstones, Classic Hanna-Barbera show though it took some hits.,"""The Flintstones"" to me is indeed one of the greatest cartoons that was produced by Hanna-Barbera. For those who aren't familiar with this show (which I'll be shocked with if there are.) The shows premise is about a blue collar, dino crane operator in Fred Flintstone, who in each episode had a wacky situation along with his wife Wilma, and his neighbors Barney and Betty Rubble. The show is basically ""The Honeymooners"" except it's animated. The show also had an adult style (not porno) to it, but it was light. However, there were some things that occured that affected the show...<br/><br/>First off, the birth of Pebbles. Don't get me wrong, I had nothing against Pebbles, or Bam-Bamm the world's strongest baby that the Rubbles adopted, I think their appearances to the show hurt it  since the show was originally a adult oriented show. What I'm saying is that now with kids on the show, it wasn't as adult oriented. The show was losing ground then, but that moment can't top the moment when the Great Gazoo came in. This was when the show really lost it. All of the life that ""The Flinstones"" had left was sucked dry when Great Gazoo came in. He ruined the show, and finished what was left of it off, and left it for dead basically. Sadly the show left the airwaves in 1966, but Hanna-Barbera began to beat the show to the ground in the 1970's with debacles like ""The Pebbles and Bam-Bamm Show"" (Possibly the WORST Hanna-Barbera spinoff show ever!), and the shows where Fred and Barney met the Thing, and that blob called ""The Shmoo"" (Both of these shows were CRAP!!!) were just bad. However, the original show itself is still great after 40+ years.<br/><br/>This show overall gets a 10/10 for the Pre-Pebbles birth episodes, a 5/10 for the Post Pebbles birth episodes, and a whomping 0/10 for the awful Great Gazoo episodes (thought there weren't a lot).",28 out of 37 found this helpful.,,14 November 2002

581,The Flintstones, A Milestone in the history of TV-Animation,"This was supposed to be the spin off version of Jackie Gleason's 1950's sitcom of The Honeymooners,but to anyone's surprise that The Flintstones was to surpassed beyond it and continues to do so to this day. After being remembered as TV longest running animated sitcom for six seasons during its run,Fred and Wilma Flintstone are still at it in re-runs(still in syndication after more than 30 years after the show went off the air) along with their neighbors Betty and Barney Rubble and the family's pet dinosaur Dino and later on during the series run a new addition was added to the Flintstone family,the birth of Peebles and also gave the Rubbles a child of their own too,Bamm-Bamm. Other characters included Wilma's mother-in-law,Fred's feuding cousins The Flintrocks,and there gruesome neighbors The Gruesomes,Fred's boss at the Slate Gravel Company,Mister Slate(where did Fred's best friend Barney worked?)not to mention that repulsive alien from another planet,Kuzoo...why was he needed on there anyway which killed the show. There may have been some changes during the show,but it still its entertaining for adults as well as for children of all ages. Where can you find good family values and still provide laughs while at the same time keep the kids tuned in to see what Fred and Barney would come up with next? Another lame hair-brained scheme?(You won't find that with The Simpsons mind you...) Only The Flintstones. Catch the classic re-runs on either Cartoon Network,Boomerang,several local stations and on Superstation TBS.<br/><br/>The original ""Flintstones"" series ran on ABC-TV from 1960-1966. It was only during the first two seasons(1960-1962)of the show that it was telecast in black and white(actually was filmed in color),and later on made the transition to color at the start of 1962-1963 season where it remained until the end of the series in 1966. The series produced an astounding 166 episodes during its entire run on the air with superior production values and the vocal talents of the great Alan Reed as Fred Flintstone,Jean Vanderpyl as Wilma,and the great Mel Blanc as Fred's best friend and bosom buddy Barney. The vocal talents for the character of Betty(Wilma's best friend and Barney lovely wife)were done by the great Bea Benederet of ""Burns and Allen"",""The Beverly Hillbillies"",and ""Petticoat Junction"" fame. When Benederet left the series in mid-1964 due to health issues and was doing other projects,the role of Betty went to actress Gerry Johnson and from there stay with the role until the series went off the air. Other voice characters included Hanna-Barbera regulars Don Messick and Daws Butler and John Stephenson and also from actor Harvey Korman as the voice of Kazoo. When the animated series,""The Flintstones"",premiered on ABC-TV in September of 1960,the show was aimed toward an adult audience,but instead was more focus on adult situations since there were scenes where Fred or Barney for that manner are smoking a cigarette.

I was always made fun of during my school days for being such a fan and even though i'm 28 now, my passion for 'The Flintstones' is still as strong as ever. So what is so special about this show? From episode 1 to episode 166, we are treated with laughs and clever animal gimmicks as well as good storylines. The voices are great especially Alan Reed (Fred) who has such a loud and obnoxious voice which fits Fred Flintstone's character so well. The only problem is the amount of mistakes that were made throughout the 6 seasons. They will stand out if you have watched the different episodes enough times. For example one episode will tell us that Fred and Wilma had their honeymoon in Boulder Beach, another will tell you it was Bedrock Races and another at the Rock Mountain Inn. Also do The Flintstones live on Cobblestone Lane, Stonecanyon Way or Gravelpit Terrace? There are many other mistakes like this but they don't take away the fact that 'The Flintstones' is top notch entertainment for the whole family, not just children. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera have given us some fantastic cartoons that have stood the test of time and 'The Flintstones' is my favourite out of all of them.",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,,11 March 2004
583,The Flintstones, Probably the most enduring of all cartoons!,"THE FLINTSTONES hold a special place in my memory, as I'm sure they do for many people the world over. The series started in Britain in 1960, the year I had my very first job - babysitting for a neighbor. I was just 15. The two kids were total brats, screaming, spoilt, mashed potato slam-dunked over the wallpaper...but I didn't care, I was watching Fred and Barney live out there lives of near-perfection in a world that was starting to move away from near perfection! ""Yabba Dabba Doo"" must surely be one of the most recognizable cries on earth - WHO would not know its origins from 4 to 90?<br/><br/>The success of this animated icon probably lies in the simplicity of the Flintstone and Rubble clans. Everyone on this planet is part Fred, Barney, Betty or Wilmer at some time in their lives. Events depicted in each and every episode were things that everyone can, did (and will continue) to identify with. They are Mr and Mrs Average and if we all lived our lives and never achieved anything more than the Flintstones we could justifiably be happy. The show supported family values, decency, togetherness, love, friendship, clean living, laughter and it was environmentally aware, socially responsible and able STILL to reach children.<br/><br/>The lives of everyone in the Western World would have been that much poorer had it not been for THE FLINTSTONES. I can't say as much for the two appalling movie spin-offs!",14 out of 18 found this helpful.,,22 March 2002
584,The Flintstones, Great show!,"When this show was on I watched it every time I could! I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious like the Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funniest and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes then I strongly recommend that you watch this show!",15 out of 21 found this helpful.,,8 July 2005
585,The Flintstones, Funny and incredibly smart,"I grew up on shows like Scooby Doo and Tom Jerry and this is no exception. I love the Flintstones:- it is funny and incredibly smart, and at 17 I can still watch it and there is very seldom a dull moment. What makes it great? Well, the detailed and colourful animation contributes hugely. Also the theme tune, has to be one of the most catchy theme tunes on any animated TV show. Then there's the humour, the whole show is constantly funny and is guaranteed to have you chuckling away. Finally we have the characters. Fred is one zany cartoon, and Alan Reed was the perfect choice for him. Another hilarious character, perhaps even more so than Fred is Barney, who is quite goofy yet completely lovable. Who'd better to voice him than the immortal Mel Blanc? Then we have Wilma, who is a great sexy female character and wonderfully voiced by Jean Vader Pyl. Plus the voluptuous Betty, voiced to perfection by Bea Benaderet. The writing constantly is incredibly witty, sharp and smart, the story lines are outstanding and the supporting characters namely the hilarious Mr Slate and cute as a button Pearl are just as great. All in all, I loved this when I was a kid, and as a near-adult I still love it. Adults will enjoy it as well as kids. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,24 December 2009
586,The Flintstones, A historic cartoon show that broke many boundaries including being the first to air over a hundred episodes.,"Fred Flintstone, the gruff but also lovable working class stiff was introduced to audiences everywhere in the 60's. His wife Wilma and his neighbours Betty and Barney Rubble were the most loyal and helpful people in his life and Fred took advantage of that in every way he could.<br/><br/>Although what I have just written makes Fred look like the ultimate beast you couldn't write a character like this without him having redeemable qualities as well. So Fred is also trustworthy when Wilma tells him to and works hard to give her things she so desperately craves eg. glamorous clothes though the most times she has to return them.<br/><br/>As the series evolved so did the characters so Fred, Wilma, Betty and Barney all became parents. Pebbles, Fred and Wilma's daughter were the pride and joy of Fred and he became a babbling softy when he became her father. Barney stayed himself and Betty and Wilma didn't change all that much either. There was one major difference in Wilma's character. She didn't put up with so much anymore. She wasn't just a spectator anymore. She tried to become something other than a housewife and Fred didn't like it one bit at first, but those were the breaks and he had to.<br/><br/>I think the earliest episodes of the Flintstones were the best but not because the character of Fred was more mean spirited and chauvinistic (a caveman if you will) but when Betty got a new voice (Gerry Johnson) she lost all appeal. She sounded like a boob (no pun intended) and Barney got pushed into the background. The early episode saw Betty and Barney actually standing up to Fred on a number of occasions and that was the morale of the show that you couldn't let Fred get away with his selfishness all the time.<br/><br/>I will not compare this show to the other more successful show the Simpsons of today because I think they are in entirely different leagues. The Simpsons are at times so out there where as the Flintstones is for the most part totally believable except for the stone age setting. So both have merit and they should be judged entirely on their own terms.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,,12 February 2005

So I have recollected all the wonderful memories of my childhood.<br/><br/>The cartoon itself is based on a citizen of Bedrock named Fred Flintstone who we follow through the endless adventures that he has with friend Barney Gumble. The show has great kid humour and considering that it was produced in 1960 it still holds up against any of the crap thats on TV today.<br/><br/>I loved how the writers incorporated the cave man lifestyle with modern day advances, the mammoth that operates as the shower, the cars that run by human power.....Pure genius.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,16 November 2008

Mind you this takes place in the stone age. Go figure.<br/><br/>My favourite character was and still is Bam Bam.  Wow it must be great having the world's strongest baby for a son.

589,The Flintstones, King of the World!,"The Flintstones was the cartoon to begin all cartoons.

But a cartoon...can do more than human actors can! And in watching the Flintstones, it was imagination beyond belief - Stone Aged Dinosaurs tamed and used as building machinery, pelicans used to mix concrete, Fred smacking Barney so many times he should be in a hospital, cars run by foot power and also your feet as the breaks against the hard stone ground...OF COURSE THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE! It's cartoons, humor...fun. Remember that?<br/><br/>Loved this cartoon to death...what long lasting images, staying power and I can watch it 1,000,000 and not tire of it. Consequently, I can watch it 1,000,000 times and not develop a violent streak in my body either. (The Flintstone was also one of the first cartoons to be placed on the ""violent cartoons"" list...and now the smoking and drinking lists as well.) It's a piece of childhood (and now adult) fantasy...nostalgic...loads of fun and quite a look back at the foundation that runs through many cartoons today.

590,The Flintstones, the best written comedy of all time,"After the original series left the air in 1966, there have been a lot of inferior remakes and adulterations in other venues. Nothing compares with the original. People have compared this to the Honeymooners. Not so. The Honeymooners was a simple situation comedy. Except for the early episodes, Fred and Wilma didn't bicker much. The show was busy making subtle and not so subtle satiric points.<br/><br/>In one episode, they poked fun of ratings, unrealistic TV shows, placement of station breaks and people who live vicariously through television.<br/><br/>In, the Beauty Contest, Fred and Barney waxed nostalgic over when they were single and longed to hear a woman's voice. Later, there were many hilarious exchanges. The show didn't give you what you expected. Sometimes an overdone point was hysterically funny. Betty: I don't feel like watching television. Barney: But you HAVE to watch television, Betty. Some lines of dialogue are for the ages BARNEY: Did you ever start up a gangplank and have a sudden feeling there was no ship?<br/><br/>Among stellar characters, we must mention Verna Felton's portrayal of Wilma's mother. She was the worst mother-in-law in the world. (I must point out that Wilma's maiden name is Pebble. Later writers forgot that and gave her the name Slaghoople. Thus are errors perpetuated.) At turns the show could be warm, mature, serious, poignant and hysterically funny because of the subtlety with which certain things were done. Every week was an incredible adventure. I was there when it began. It was my favorite show then. It still is.<br/><br/>I should also mention the great Alan Reed, the quintessential everyman, incomparable Mel Blanc and real life best friends Jean Vander Pyl and Bea Benaderet playing best friends and wives Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble.<br/><br/>I could mention Paula Winslowe's portrayal of Greta Gravel in an episode with an important message about marriage.

591,The Flintstones, The BEST cartoon of all time (IMHO).,"I was born in the very early 60s, so although I do not remember this show during its prime-time run, I did grow up with it in syndication. It was on EVERYDAY after school (those were the days!) as were so many of the other classic TV shows of the 50s and 60s. Hanna-Barbera too dominated Saturday morning television but nothing came close to this wonderful show; be it the characters, the use of animals and dinosaurs in everyday gadgets - I don't know, but something clicked. I never tire of watching any episode and in fact, own most. So unlike so many of the shows today, done too quickly and without much depth, it had heart. One episode in particular comes to mind that shows it in Fred.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Fred decides he has had enough of Dino's jumping on him when he gets home for the day, Dino's dominating the TV to watch his favorite 'SASSY' and of course, the everyday expense of having him around. The Sassy show has a contest, Fred figures it's his answer and lo and behold, Dino wins! This means a recurring role on the show for Dino, he gets an agent and Fred gets everything he had wished for yet... he actually regrets it right away and we see him tear up in front of the fireplace and Dino's picture. (This episode ALWAYS tears me up, too.) <br/><br/>It ends happy and clearly shows that Fred was more than a blow-hard. He had a BIG heart and many episodes from the original series show it. I even liked the later episodes; so many were classics! The Gruesomes, the Hatrocks. The episode when Pebbles is born and when Bamm-Bamm is left on the Rubbles' doorstep are both favorites. Even the much-later Gazoo episodes have their good points! Though true of the original series, it was not the case of 'The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show' or any other recently unearthed likeness. The more recent Fred is generally portrayed as a simple loud-mouthed bore. The movies too, are a total waste of time.<br/><br/>If you have never seen The Flintstones (and if you don't get Boomerang you may not), try it on Netflix.

Amazing writing kept the series fun and interesting right up until the end.  Of course the premise is the life of blue-collared, dino-crane operator Fred Flintstone and his wacky adventures with his wife Wilma and his neighbors Barney and Betty Rubble.  ""The Flintstones"" is basically ""The Honeymooners"" turned animated, but the creativity of the series makes it stand out from most other television shows.

Their neighbors are Barney, Betty and Bam-Bam Rubble. Fred and Barney work at a construction site, while Wilma and Betty stay home. Granted, almost nothing about this show was accurate (not to mention the fact that Fred's car changed shape depending on who was sitting in it), but cartoons don't need to be accurate or consistent! The point is that ""The Flintstones"" not only makes us laugh, but also gives us a new perspective on our own world. My favorite episode? Well, it was pretty neat that time when Fred and Barney were going bowling and they had car trouble in a creepy forest. And apparently, Elizabeth Montgomery guest-starred on an episode as a character named Samantha Stephens, although I've never seen that episode. Anyway, it's a really neat show.<br/><br/>I read that this show was based on ""The Honeymooners"".

597,The Flintstones, The Best of Friends,"I am not much of a cartoon watcher, but the Flintstones and Bugs Bunny are still very funny and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>I always realized the great friendship between Fred and Barney, Wilma and Betty.  I think the gift of friendship is one of the nicest gifts that we will ever be blessed with.  The typical friendship sometimes encounters trouble, just as we would sometimes see on the Flintstones.  The most important thing, is that down deep, these characters loved each other, and they always ended the episode friends again.  It's true friendship, that endures the test of time.  I would think that this is one of the biggest messages that I have extracted from the Flintstones.  Their lives would have been so much less, without each other.<br/><br/>I was watching an old rerun of the Beverly Hillbillies last week, and I heard a familiar voice.  There was an actor wearing a hat, and while talking he sounded just like Fred Flintstone.  He even laughed like Fred.  I paid close attention to the credits at the end and sure enough, Alan Reed's name appeared.  It was the man who did the voice of Fred Flintstone!  I think the 4 main voices on that show, Fred, Wilma, Barney and Betty were all done by extraordinary individuals.  I would have loved to see them taping just one episode.  To see these people performing behind the microphone must have been an incredible thing to witness.  The timing, the multiple voices, and the expressions that you could hear in each word was amazing.  These people were very talented.  It's those voices that kept the characters alive! Although they are no longer with us, the gift that they gave us will live on forever in our hearts.

598,The Flintstones, Special show in my heart,"Recently while I was at the library, I looked up the newspaper from the day I was born on microfilm.  In the entertainment section, there was a review of a TV show about an animated ""Modern Stone-Age Family"".  Yes, folks, I was born at roughly the same time as THE FLINTSTONES!  It was a very unique show, showing how some of the modern gadgets of today (or the ""today"" of 1960)were actually around in caveman times (phonographs, cameras, intercoms, hot water heaters). But, let's give credit where it is due:  There would really have been no FLINTSTONES if there hadn't been THE HONEYMOONERS.  Both shows dealt with a big, loudmouth type with a goofy friend who were in a battle of the sexes with their wives.  The loudmouth worked at a job that involved a big piece of machinery (Ralph Kramden drove a bus; Fred Flintstone operated a dino-steam shovel), was at odds with his boss, didn't get along with his mother-in-law, belonged to a lodge named after a mammal, always had a get-rich-quick scheme and liked to go bowling and shoot pool.  Alan Reed, the voice of Fred Flinstone, even used to do vocal stand-in work for Jackie Gleason.      Oddly enough, though the show is popular with children, I don't think it was aimed squarely at kids.  In fact, I think a lot of it would go over most children's heads.  One episode in particular I didn't understand as a child, but now has me kind of stunned when I think back at it:  Wilma has a recipe for gravelberry pie.  Fred tries to market it and gets a factory to buy him out.  Later, Fred tries to raise the price of the pies and tells the factory owner to take it or leave.  ""I'm leaving it."" the owner tells Fred, ""What am I going to do with all of these pies?"" Fred asks, ""Well, you can take those pies and . . .""  At that moment, the factory whistle goes off and drowns out what the man has to say.  ""Excuse me,"" Fred says meekly, ""That whistle was making too much noise.  What did you say I could do with those pies again?""  Needless to say, when I got older and saw that episode, my eyebrows were raised.  I shudder to think what would be done with that moment in this day and age.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,30 October 2000
599,Highway to Heaven, Never Sanctimonious,"One might expect that any show about an angel of god who walks the Earth trying to help people would be heavy-handed and depressing. Highway to Heaven is neither. It's an uplifting show that showcases all the best aspects of religion and niceness. Unlike ""Touched by an Angel"" and the televangelist shows, HtH deals with whether a person is good, not whether they subscribe to the right religion. There is room in the definition of ""good"" to include businessmen, politicians, and former criminals. I'm a hardcore atheist and I still love this show.<br/><br/>In addition, the element of God's power is never used as a club. Jonathan has ""the stuff,"" but never uses it until words and persuasion have failed. It almost makes one feel that with a little effort, they might do some good themselves in the world.

I am actually an agnostic as far as religion goes but even if one doesn't believe in God, a lot can be learned from a show like this on how to treat people and how to do things the right way.<br/><br/>All in all, a very sentimental show.

As Jonathan Smith Michael tried to instil better values in people, as well as showing us how to treat people with love and respect. Plus there was always plenty of action when Jonathan would be forced to defend people from thugs. One of my favourite episodes has to be the one where a man has his food taken from him by thugs, Jonathan says to the thugs c'mon give the kid back his food you've had your fun, when they refused Jonathan threw the thugs all over the place. The show also showed Jonathan and Mark on wonderful journey's from town to town each week, which was great. Michael Landon tried to show people how to love and laugh, just watching an episode makes you want to get out there and help someone out. I thank Michael Landon for inspiring me to be a better person. I will never forget what Michael Landon has contributed to my life, and I thank him so much. Highway to Heaven should be on television again, rather than the non-family oriented Reality Television Shows of today.

608,Highway to Heaven, Highway to Heaven,"I grew up watching this TV show and it was usually very touching and sometimes very sad. There is one episode in season 2 that was very good called ""Friends"". It's about an overweight girl, Jenny, who is desperate to make friends at school. When she begins to tutor the school jock, Jack, another girl in school gets jealous and acts like she is her friend. Then she humiliates Jenny in front of Jack. Jonathan helps her build her self-esteem and brings Jack's down a bit.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed these two guys on Little House on the Prairie which was an excellent family show (I own all seasons on DVD!) It's sad that some people think these two were gay. I guess some narrow-minded people can't understand that two guys can be very good friends. Especially with all of the trash on TV now, if a show is very wholesome some people don't like it and have to try to tear it down.<br/><br/>Anyone with children who wants to let them watch a show without profanity and filth should let them watch this great show.

609,Highway to Heaven, The greatest show of all time finally arrives on DVD,"Well thats my opinion anyway, Michael Landon graced millions of TV screens once a week portraying Johnathan Smith, and angel sent from God to help people find their ways in life. He is assisted by Mark Gordon an Ex-Cop who's life he helped turn around, brilliantly played by Victor French.

Michael Landon's final public work before passing away (Us, never aired)touched millions of people including myself. I know of a LOT of people looking for this show and by the grace of god it is finally arriving on DVD. I urge you to spend the money on this product and share it with your families!

I still watch this show to this very day - the reruns play on a network called UP. Even though I have seen every episode...I always feel good watching them again and again...one might call the feeling I get as joy; I don't use that word much. I have watched so many shows over the years and none make me feel the way this show does. Michael Landon was truly an angel to have created this series...so call it cheesy...call it outdated...call me sentimental - I don't care.

612,Highway to Heaven, Could've only been done with Michael Landon's backing,"Sometime in 1997,I recall listening to an edition of ""Fresh Air with Terry Gross"" where they did a tribute to the late NBC executive Brandon TArtikoff(who is generally credited with fostering NBC's resurgence in the ratings through most of the 1980s),who had passed away shortly before. They played an interview bit where Mr.TArikoff was asked about ""Highway to Heaven"" and his reaction to being pitched this series by NBC standby and TV icon Michael Landon. He told Landon something to the effect that he wasn't really sure how well a show like this could be successful in a period dominated by Stephen Cannell/Glen LArson/Aaron Spelling shows,saying something to the effect of ""This show could be broadcast in black and white and there would be no real change to it"". To which Landon replied something to the tune of ""Look,there aren't really ANY shows like it on television now,and what will it hurt to give this one a try?"". Tartikoff was convinced,ran the show and it preceded to have an effective,five season run before quiet cancellation.<br/><br/>I was fairly skeptical of these shows as a kid and didn't really warm up to them until I was in college(!). I suppose I felt like it was probably a little too heavy-handed in its moralizing and,to be quite frank,anything that DIDN'T promise sex and/or violence when I was in junior high really didn't seem to interest me. It wasn't until I was a little older(And maybe a little bored),watching rerun t.v. at my college dorm that I stumbled across the show and gave it a chance. I must say that,as schmaltzy as it was(And that heavy music track didn't ease the tension!),it was at heart a sweet,heartfelt show that taught simple lessons about morality and faith. <br/><br/>Crafted almost like an anthology series(I hope I'm using the right term here),the cast was merely LAndon as human-turned-Angel Jonathan Smith,traveling with retired-cop and faux grouch Mark Gordon(Victor French),going from city to city,town to town,on missions determined by the almighty,in order to help Smith get to heaven for good(turns out,he's a probationary angel it seems). EAch episode feature different principal players who interact with JOnathan and Mark,and the lessons they learn.<br/><br/>I would have to say I recommend this one. Whether it's TVLand or DVD(if it's there already,and I kinda think it is)where you see this,you should get the same effect,and a good one at that.",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,,7 April 2006

620,Highway to Heaven, great series that deserves a new life on DVD.,It is most unfortunate that this show is not available on DVD yet.  I always enjoyed the series (and the Dave Rose scores) and several really stand out. One in particular featured a young Helen Hunt in Thoroughbreds.  Another was Hotel of Dreams.  But my absolute favorite was the one where Jonathan finds that his assignment is supposed to be completed and God decides to extend his tenure on Earth.  Because of this Jonathan also must accept the fact that he will not yet be reunited with his late wife and he rebels. He later meets a lady that is attempting to commit suicide and the story took what was to me an unexpected detour.<br/><br/>That episode made my heart ache but it also made me happy.<br/><br/>Goodtimes Video has been improving their act as of late.  They re-released the 1970 flick Airport in widescreen format and they've also done something I never expected; released Little House on the Prairie on DVD.  I'm hoping the quality is decent since the ones on TBS look hideous.  Perhaps Goodtimes Video will release Highway to Heaven on DVD.  I'd buy simply to avoid having to watch tapes I dubbed off syndicated runnings on cable.  Plus some of the episodes were in stereo when run on NBC.,7 out of 14 found this helpful.,,23 May 2001
621,Highway to Heaven, An angel and his assistant,"Although occasionally the episodes could truly become maudlin, Highway To Heaven was generally a nice family oriented series that dealt with some serious topics in the stories. Michael Landon produced and co-starred in this series with his fellow expatriate regular from Little House On The Prarie Victor French.<br/><br/>I remember that first episode well. French is a cynical former detective with the Oakland PD and throughout the series proclaimed his love for the Oakland Athletics with the cap he wore. He's a peripheral character in the plot of that episode, but he hasn't forgotten his police training. He knows there's something not quite right about Landon and in the end Landon has to fess up the holy unvarnished truth. So French becomes uncynical and a partner in the various assignments that probationary angel Landon gets.<br/><br/>The assignments ran the gamut from simply uniting people in romance who were meant for each other but never quite connected to tackling things like racism, poverty, homelessness among others. Some stories were better than others, some things might be dealt with today that couldn't have been dealt with in the Eighties. It would be interesting if the Landon estate would consent to a revival of the series, what might be an episode subject now that wasn't then. And of course who could take the place of Michael Landon and Victor French.<br/><br/>The real life friendship between these guys is a big part of what made the show work. Their scenes in their vehicle are a lot like the ones between Jack Webb and Harry Morgan in Dragnet where you got to see a bit of the human and human-about-to-be-an-angel sides of French and Landon. The small talk between the two players in both series gave these guys a more rounded character. In the case of Landon he's not quite left earthly values and emotions behind and in some episodes he struggles.<br/><br/>I'd check some of the stories out, they're worth a look.",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,7.0,28 December 2012

623,Highway to Heaven," This was accurately (if cruelly) referred to as ""Malibu Jesus"" by a critic.","I never could stand this show with its mawkish story lines, saccharine plot resolutions, and (mostly) horrendous acting. I'm sure Michael Landon was a good man--many who knew him apparently loved him, and grieved over his death, but he was never much of an actor. Still, somehow he managed to parlay his good looks and easy charm into a successful television career. And I have particularly resented him for his work on Little House On the Prairie, a series based on the excellent Laura Ingalls Wilder books which he co-produced, turning it into a sugary insult to the original children's books.

624,The Staircase, A Masterpiece - on True Crime genre and Documentaries,"If you think ""I'm not into true crime documentaries, I'll pass"" please do yourself a favour - don't think of it as a ""crime doc"". <br/><br/>This case has been one of the biggest and most controversial cases in recent times and if you have no idea of who Michael Peterson is you will be gripped by all the episodes. <br/><br/>Having previously watched the released episodes before Netflix premiered the series, adding 3 more, I had already formed an opinion and thought that 3 episodes would not make a huge difference. I was wrong.
If the twists, turns, anger, love and incredible, mind-bending insider views weren't already enough, every single episode added had an incredible emotional charge to them.<br/><br/>This is not your usual ""true crime"" documentary. Yes, we have seen how the genre has expanded to showing the BTS footage, how Making A Murderer caught the attention of the whole world but trying not no spoil it... I would say MAM leaves a lot unsaid or ""to be presumed"" by the viewer. While The Staircase focuses on Michael Peterson and can easily be argued as ""biased"", I don't see how this particular case would have been fairly presented without that ""bias"". Meaning, all that is revealed (until the very last minutes of the last episode) will make you understand why Michael Peterson had the opportunity to be presented the way he is in this documentary.<br/><br/>If Making a Murderer did come up with several issues and questions were raised, they were just that - opening lines for possibilities that never got solved or resolved (most of them are still open for dispute).<br/><br/>But The Staircase is filled with facts and presentations of evidence that will for sure make everyone rethink about the whole justice system.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with the Owl Theory and don't understand why this wasn't discussed I would guess that it was a good effort to keep the bias to a minimum - not attempting to offer a solution, the viewer is left with what I believe to be the main core information. The flaws of a system are exposed - the flaws that everyone knows about but no one seems keen on solving... It is very disturbing (even for someone who is a fan of the true crime genre) to hear and clearly understand from the words and actions of the players involved in a murder case what *exactly* can go wrong - and why. <br/><br/>This was a brilliant, gripping series I watched in only 2 days because the revelations never end. I was not expecting to know much more about the case I was already familiar with but I was wrong.<br/><br/>I hope this documentary finds its way out of the true crime genre because even though it starts from a murder charge, everything else comes down to empathy, emotions, social and family relationships and a whole lot about how we, as a society, can be easily swayed from our very core beliefs.<br/><br/>You will laugh, you will cry, you will yell at the screen. No matter how you *personally* welcome what the director presents you, the raw honesty and the human emotions will affect you - from everyone involved in this tragedy.<br/><br/>I would say this is probably the best true crime doc I've seen, easily. And from someone who watches trials and live streams of these cases, I had never learned so much about the humanity (or lack thereof) and emotions going on in these procedures.<br/><br/>Don't read spoilers, don't read about the case if you have the chance to avoid it. This goes way beyond what is presented in any website you might read about it. <br/><br/>There's much (apparent) simplicity on the way the images are presented but they do serve a higher purpose - for the viewer to be able to live every situation as if it was happening to them.<br/><br/>Congratulations on the marvellous completion of 13 episodes and I truly hope every documentary lover will watch this, not only true-crime genre fans...",125 out of 152 found this helpful.,10.0,10 June 2018
625,The Staircase, Still not sure how she died?,"As we watched the series we are left with two choices....either she died by fall (illogical based on lacerations and loss of great amount of blood) or the husband killed her (illogical because never once was there a beating without a brain fracture, and there was no fracture of the skull here so the beating theory is very weak ...plus, there was no evidence to show of a struggle, which would have happened. Oh, and does anyone really believe the blow poke was the weapon? Come on people! ). We were never left with door number 3, except at the end they discussed this theory that some barred owl may have done this. They only gave us a three minute video on that theory but after getting on the internet and doing further research, this theory makes the MOST SENSE to me. Did you see the lacerations on the top of her head for crying out loud? What do they look like to you? Talons!!! Hello people.....do you honestly believe a blow poke did that? And if you do, why was the blow poke in the house not shown as evidence as the weapon? If you believe that, you not only are gullible but I wouldn't want you as a juror in my murder case either because quite frankly, you aren't smart enough to think clearly and logically. <br/><br/>I live with barred owls in my back yard and they are big and if they feel their young can be threatened, they can go on attack mode. Plus, look at the facts: at the time of death, Kathleen had a FEATHER in her hand, bloody twigs in her hand, her hair pulled out in her hand, and there were traces of blood OUTSIDE on the walkway going into the house which signifies she was attacked just before she came into the house. She even had needle point wounds on her arms as if she was protecting herself from this attack. Honestly, this theory makes much much more sense to me than the two they left us to choose from. I know they made a motion in May of 2016 to add this evidence so maybe if they had a new trial this would have been entered, but because of the Alford Plea, we will never know. <br/><br/>Lastly, while the death in Germany was eerily similar, I really do not believe you can admit this as evidence because it is too prejudicial to the average juror who is probably being led more by emotion than logic. But, the fact is, there was no evidence in Germany that this was a murder and it was never thought to be based on their investigation. Case closed folks. So why let an American jury hear this if a German police department and DA determined there was not enough evidence to proceed as a wrongful death? I see no reason to allow, thus this judge screwed the pooch. Oh, and guess what? To his credit, he admitted at the end that he probably should not have admitted that evidence, because it probably was too prejudicial. That comment is right....too bad for Peterson he didn't have that logic in 2002.The judge also questioned whether he should have allowed the bisexual evidence but I think he had to allow that because after all, Peterson's lawyer did say their marriage was IDYLLIC. Well, that comment should be open for examination. Did Kathleen know and approve her husband wanting to have sex with other men during their marriage? In order to be idyllic you would have to prove this didn't bother her. Well, let me tell you, if my wife thought or knew that I was seeing other men (or women) while married to her, she would both beat me up (a former cop who works out every day) and then throw me out the door. I think most women would feel as my wife would, not the opposite. There was no evidence presented that Kathleen didn't mind Peterson getting it on with other men except his weak testimony. Don't forget, he did say, ""we didn't talk about it"" so this shows me she obviously did not approve of it. Personally, I think Peterson was lying about this and was telling us what made him look more favorable in order to remove motive. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the series but I agree, it was slightly slanted toward Peterson's side and especially now knowing he was in a relationship with the editor of the series does not look good as being a totally OBJECTIVE documentary. I believe Kathleen's family should have been included much more so we could also experience what they were going through too. After all, they gave us way to much time showing us how Margaret and Martha feel, so why not show us how Candace, Lori, and Caitlin feel too? I know some people were upset with Kathleen's sister, Candace, for her harsh comments, but not me. She is her sister after all, and she is right...the evidence doesn't point to merely a FALL as the cause of death, so what else was she to conclude? Oh well, I guess i can't have everything, thus my 8 rating, and not 10. One last thing, I feel I should probably add this....I am an attorney, so I am seeing this through those colored glasses which can be slightly different from an average layperson. I hope you enjoyed reading this review...I know, it was rather long-winded wasn't it? Cheers.",101 out of 129 found this helpful.,8.0,4 July 2018

Yes, this is a tragic story and has some interesting twists. Yes, I feel that justice was not well served for this whole investigation and trial.
However, this 13 episode series could have easily been edited down to 6 or 7 episodes. There is SO much fluff. There are SO many scenes that drag on or rehash the same info. The characters are just not that interesting to hear them go on and on. They even have drawn out scenes of cars parking or driving away or people walking...nothing going on. No drama.

628,The Staircase, Accidental Masterpiece,"(I tried not to spoil anything, but I clicked the spoiler alert just in case.)<br/><br/>The Staircase was accidentally absorbing. Even though the filmmakers had an unmistakably obvious point of view, they did not succeed in persuading me to the same conclusion. Yet, to Maha's credit, the film was thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. Most of the characters it dwelled on were so despicable, transparent, and sad that I can think of no real life situation where I'd have spent more than five minutes in the company of such people. But it was tolerable and even darkly fascinating to observe them on screen over the course of this enthralling real life documentary. <br/><br/>Since I first watched the film, I've read an excellent book by Diane Fanning about the Michael Peterson case. I recommend it to all -- titled ""Written In Blood."" My instincts, according to this exceptionally well researched, well written book, were pretty solid as it turns out. Common sense served me well, and I believe common sense prevailed in the face of a million+ bucks in ""expert obfuscation"" and P.R. hi-jinx -- AKA David Rudolph's High Powered Legal Defense Team. <br/><br/>I can say without reservation, The Staircase is highly entertaining and well crafted. Yet I must encourage viewers to balance the heavily one-sided array of facts and suggestions by consulting additional sources. There are a number of places online offering background, evidence, testimony, and opinion. Or get one straightforward, well organized, and riveting account in Fanning's book. After bulking up your knowledge of the opposing viewpoint and forensic evidence, watch The Staircase a second time and experience a whole new set of ""Aha!"" moments.<br/><br/>One other spectacular element that must be mentioned: the exquisite and haunting original music composed (and performed?) by Jocelyn Pook.

I had always trusted the law enforcement system and believed you are innocent until proven guilty but it the opposite. You are guilty and we had to spend $247,000 on legal costs before he was found not guilty by a jury of 12. The state wasted so much money and we are still paying off those we borrowed money from and he was also on 3rd party for a whole year. It was over four years ago now but I still suffer from depression and anxiety from this horrible, unbelievable failure of our legal system. I will never trust it again nor will any of my family. I don't even care whether Michael Peterson is guilty or innocent. Just the lies and misconduct of the procsecution team was glaring and oh so familar. They , too, did not care if he was guilty or innocent: they just wanted to win. Instead, everybody lost.

631,The Staircase, Brilliant but biased,"""Death on the Staircase"" deals with the arrest and subsequent trial of Michael Peterson, a writer accused of murdering his wife. Directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade - the man behind the documentary masterpiece ""Murder On A Sunday Morning"" - this mammoth 360 minute documentary is intriguing for most of its running time.<br/><br/>The film grants us an inside look into the workings of Peterson's defence team and focuses on procedures usually omitted from most works of fiction. For example, the buying and coaching of ""expert witnesses"", the severe denial people undergo when family members are accused of a crime (Peterson's daughters undergo Stockholm Syndrome before our eyes), the lengths defence attorneys go to distance themselves from their clients (they could care less whether Peterson is guilty or not), the staggering amount of research, surveys and preparation that goes into a case etc etc.<br/><br/>Most interesting, though, is the way Peterson's past is dissected by the prosecutors, his bi-sexuality (and liaisons with prostitutes) brazenly brought up in court. Of course Peterson denies these things at first, and so its all the more fascinating to watch as he slowly confides his sordid past to both his family and his lawyers.<br/><br/>Lestrade touches upon the media's biased coverage of the crime, but mostly he's interested in painting this case as a gigantic failure of justice. The director wants us to believe that America is a puritanical and uptight country that unfairly convicted a man based on his wealth and bisexuality. That small town Americans are conservative, racist and classist, and that the (largely black) jury believe that bisexuals are criminals, innately sick and so must be punished.<br/><br/>But of course Lestrade would have been unable to make this documentary had Michael Peterson not granted the director permission to document his life and trial. No doubt Peterson provided a series of very strict rules for the documentary crew to follow. Is it therefore any surprise that the film is so pro-defence? That it deliberately omits facts and paints Peterson as a man betrayed by justice? <br/><br/>8/10 – Though this documentary borrows elements from ""Capturing The Friedmans"", ""The Thin Blue Line"" and ""Murder on a Sunday Morning"", it's not as good as either of those films. The rich psycho-horrors of ""Capturing The Friedmans"" is lacking, the moral integrity of ""Murder on a Sunday Morning"" is absent and the brevity of ""The Thin Blue Line"" non existent. Still, for fans of the genre, Lestrade delivers a couple hours of good stuff.<br/><br/>Worth one viewing.",61 out of 87 found this helpful.,,7 July 2010
632,The Staircase, Marvelously Gripping True Crime Mocumentary,"Possible spoilers ahead -- best read once you know a thing or two about the case and the players.<br/><br/>I give it a 10 as an edge of your seat, deliciously consuming film treat. I give it a 3 for truthiness. To find out what was omitted from the film I recommend Diane Fanning's 2005 excellent true crime book, ""Written in Blood"" which covers the case and the trial in detail.<br/><br/>First of all, I completely reject the comments of reviewers who say that this film is somehow an indictment of the jury trial system and that it shows that Southern juries and populations hear the word bisexual and vote to convict. Hogwash. But I will caution first time viewers to watch this film through the lens of what should be completely obvious, which is, that it is a tool of the defense. At some point while watching you must wonder why the evidence and the prosecution gets so little airtime while we instead get so much of the defense team talking about how to craft their story to best tear down anticipated arguments and witnesses for the prosecution. And way too much of a jovial and harmless looking Michael Peterson, surrounded by his very protective adult children.<br/><br/>I watched the film having only the vaguest familiarity with the case. I do, however, have familiarity with the courtroom, attorneys and narcissists. It was immediately apparent to me that Peterson is quite likely a narcissist and that the ""narcissistic family"" dynamic was on full display. Michael Peterson was the center of everyone's universe, prompting a fierce display of united loyalty. But that loyalty looked false and coerced. Too much, too forced, too effusive, too grandiose. Red flags that something else is going on with this family. Some of them are true believers that what they are showing is absolutely sincere. This false reality is the definition of love that they know to be true. With that understanding --- NOW think about the future for the most harmed children that Michael Peterson put on display for his own use: Margaret and Martha Ratliff. Caitlin Atwater will find her way to a better and healthier life, and she has sane family members to help her do that. Margaret and Martha may never be able to do that because they have been so inculcated in the narcissistic family abuse/intimidation/fear/demands which have been defined for them as love -- and they have only the Petersons to guide them.<br/><br/>Americans believe in many myths about our democracy. One of the most egregious being that truth and justice awaits you in the courtroom. Again -- Hogwash. The courtroom is a stage and all who enter it enter the theater. The best actor, not necessarily the truth, wins. The name of the game is always to destroy the credibility of each and every witness, which is always easiest to do with personal attacks rather than evidentiary rebuttals. This said, however, I believe it was entirely appropriate to speak of both Michael Peterson's sexual trolling and his financial position because both go directly to motive. Personally, I don't believe Kathleen Peterson knew her husband was being unfaithful to her until the night of her death when I think it is likely that she found evidence on Michael's computer and confronted him. (Remember that, inexplicably, he spent the next hours and days after her death reading emails and deleting files from his computer.) She had ended her first marriage over her husband's infidelity. Why would anyone not consider it relevant to the case that if she had discovered it happening with her second husband she may ultimately be moved to end that marriage as well. And if that happened, Michael Peterson would have no source of income at all and his high standard of living would literally go Poof in an instant.<br/><br/>And lastly, a comment on the sons - Todd and Clayton. It seems apparent to a discerning viewer, and obvious to a reader of Diane Fanning's book, that Todd absolutely had an agenda. He seems to be the sociopath ""boy next door"". I believe he was an accomplice in Kathleen's murder and the ensuing story being fed to police, friends and family. He clearly orchestrated the obfuscation and failure to cooperate with EMT's and police at the scene of the crime. In the follow up episodes of the film, when Michael Peterson is seeking a new trial, Todd offers a very strange toast to the family and singles out Margaret, especially, for all that she's done to stand by Michael. Surely, it would not be notable for a lot of viewers but I found it chilling. The look on his face was smug and intimidating and, when he noticed the camera on him, changed to a much softer, camera friendly look. The impact of his words goes to the heart of the narcissistic family --- Margaret was used and manipulated by Todd, Michael and the defense team and she is utterly clueless about that. In short -- they got away with murder, in part, because of Margaret's dutiful assistance.<br/><br/>Clayton has a history of violent and subversive acts and has spent time in prison for them. Conveniently, none of that was mentioned in the film.<br/><br/>The bottom line on this film is to view it with the full understanding that it shows you a small piece of the puzzle. The most meaningful aspects of the family picture are not included. Neither are the most damning pieces of evidence. Which means that those who cry ""Travesty!"" at Michael Peterson's conviction are speaking from the viewpoint of one who is ignorant of the evidence. And this includes the family of Michael Peterson.",65 out of 97 found this helpful.,10.0,28 May 2013

Was there enough evidence to convict? Not in my opinion. Despite this, even when he was incarcerated I had no compassion towards Michael Peterson because he is so highly unlikable. He comes of very narcissistic. By the 12th and 13th episode I had to fast forward through the interviews of just him talking. I simply could not listen to him go on talking another minute. I'm not sure if this series was meant to evoke empathy for a wrongly accused man or to show the flaws in the American justice system, or both. I found it impossible to have an ounce of empathy for the accused thanks to his self centered, egotistical manner. I found myself having way more compassion for Greg Taylor and he was shown for probably less than 10 minutes in the 13 episode series.

638,The Staircase, The Trouble With Lawyers,"This film reminds me why I avoid breaking laws. The criminal justice system in America is profoundly broken along with a collective moral compass. <br/><br/>Attorney Rudolph lost the initial trail and subsequent appeals because he failed to nail-down obvious issues like the blatant homophobia of the jury which should have been address in voir dire (jury selection) and the incompetence of the Deaver testimony. He could have and should have used his own expert (Dr. Lee) and looked into Deaver's lies about experience, etc., like he did in the request for a new trial. <br/><br/>His pretrial discussions touched on arguments he failed to take to completion e.g., addressing the amount of blood with medical testimony on how very much scalp lacs bleed. His reconstruction of what likely happened with this intoxicated slip and fall was half-hearted and incomplete. He mentioned making an animation of what could have happened, yet one didn't show up until after losing. He failed to make much distinction between the German stairway accident with it's brain aneurism and Kathleen's impaired state . He could have introduced the number of stairwell injuries/deaths annually to explain how very often they occur, mitigating what appeared ""too coincidental."" <br/><br/>He characterized the Peterson marriage as idyllic without addressing the bisexuality-He glossed over the infidelities without explaining the concept of a poly-amorous relationship. He was out of his depth with the sexuality aspects and didn't bother to educate himself or the jury. The female prosecutor was extremely homophobic and didn't try to conceal it. Many on the jury and the judge as well. Rudolph and his team ignored it.<br/><br/>The defense needed many moving parts which Rudolph neglected to install. Then, he was shocked by the failure of his defense machine.

639,The Staircase, Worst True Crime documentary I've ever watched,"Not sure if this is going to contain spoilers, so adding the spoiler tag just in case.<br/><br/>First of all this whole documentary's credit gets thrown out the window as soon as you find out Mike Peterson was having a relationship with the editing director. I don't care what the director said about it not effecting her work, you can see it in every episode. I know a lot of True Crime documentaries end up being biased, but this was shamelessly so. It was honestly disgusting how much they played up his innocense. They left out so much key information that would make him look bad. The whole time their talking about Mike Peterson being a wealthy man when in reality Kathleen was the major breadwinner in the family, who had a huge life insurance policy. Both him and both his sons were in debt, and one of them was in jail for a bomb threat. <br/><br/>The editing in this was almost comical, so many scenes of them eating, of him smoking the stupid pipe, of him telling stories with the stupid pipe, what was with the series of pictures of him on top of a staircase, I think it was the 10th episode? Was that supposed to make the viewer feel bad for him, because it personally really pissed me off and thought it was almost offensive to Kathleen's memory. <br/><br/>This whole series seemed so fake, so scripted, nonstop praise for Michael Peterson, who (whether he's innocent or not) seems like a jerk. How they treated Kathleen's daughter because of her stance was upsetting. His forced tears were upsetting. Watching it just made me feel slimy all around. It was trying so hard to make him look innocent it made me think he's more guilty than I already did. <br/><br/>Overall don't watch this documentary, it's a waist of time.",39 out of 61 found this helpful.,1.0,18 June 2018
640,The Staircase, It's propaganda - not a documentary,"As my wife and I are relatively new to the North Carolina area, we watched this ""documentary"" as it was billed as ""a gripping courtroom thriller, offering a rare and revealing inside look at a high-profile murder trial."" Honestly - it was anything but that. Instead, it was a puff piece that focused on how to portray Michael Peterson as innocent and the State of North Carolina and the city of Durham as conspirators in convicting him.<br/><br/>The film leaves out anything that is not convenient to portraying Michael as innocent such as the $1.4 million insurance policy on his wife, the fact that she was likely facing a layoff, the fact that Kathleen Peterson's (the victim) family did not consent to the film, the fact that Kathleen's daughter changed her mind about Michael's involvement, etc. etc. etc. Anyone that does not toe the line about Michael being an innocent victim and this being an incredible and loving relationship is immediately removed from the screen.<br/><br/>The new episodes also do not disclose that the editor was having a personal relationship with Michael Peterson - which is a serious conflict of interest and at least should have been disclosed. <br/><br/>Overall - if you want to see a whitewash of a court case that has been made to portray someone that eventually took a guilty plea as a victim and does absolutely nothing for the victim - this is for you.

642,The Staircase, Fundamental flaws reveiled,"Watching this series, and similar Netflix-series like Making a Murderer and The Confession Tapes fulfill me with sadness, as it reveals a broken justice system. My diagnosis based on these documentaries. 2 fundamental flaws:
1. The Distric Attorney and the Judge are elected officials and therefore find it hard to make unpopular decisions. You see it in this documentary where the DA after a new trial is granted to Michael Peterson, is first inclined to accept a deal, and then backs down from it after talking to the sisters of the victim. The same in Making a Murderer: the reaction of the victim's family dictates what the DA does. This does not help finding the truth, as you have to be able to look to the facts objectively in order to find the truth.
2. The adversarial nature of the proceedings: all series mentioned before are a testament to the fact that putting two parties opposite each other and let them fight with all legal available means does not further the truth. It only leads to a competetion of who is going to win and who is going to lose. All parties involved are forced to choose sides: am I for the DA or for the defendant? As is evident from the Staircase Series this applies to law enforcement officials too. The CSI-techs were more interested in proving their theory, than following the evidence, wherever it may lead.<br/><br/>Solutions?
I hope this series will lead to a debate about improving the system. My thoughts? Start with depoliticizing the justice system by appointing judges and DA's not through elections, but independently by the Supreme Court or any other judicial body.<br/><br/>Watching the series is very instrumental in understanding the US justice system. And in seeing the consequences it has for anyone being accused of a crime and their loved ones. I can very much recommend it. The documentary maker has had unprecedented access to the defendant, his lawyer, to the lawyer-client discussions and to the jail where Michael was held. This makes it unique. As making a documentary of only 11 hours involves making choices what footage to use and to disregard, and is in that sense subjective, there is a lot of court room material in the series to allow you to get a good picture of what the case was about.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: as you might have guessed I am a European lawyer and this is just my personal opinion.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,20 November 2018

Soon there were other things Ann could not ignore. Ann was never seen at the trial because by that time she had found sufficient evidence to believe that her brother was guilty of murdering his wife Kathleen. There are those who say there is reasonable doubt Mike killed his wife but for his sister it was all too evident that the evidence was overwhelming.,40 out of 66 found this helpful.,,31 August 2005

I don't think I will ever understand that. <br/><br/>As someone who believes the original guilty verdict was correct, I am sad that I gave Michael Peterson air time and that he's basically trying to profit off of his wrongdoings and the death of his wife.",47 out of 80 found this helpful.,4.0,10 June 2018
645,The Staircase, Worth watching,"Reading all these reviews after I finished watching the show what I realized is that most people don't realize what the criminal justice system should be all about. It's not about deciding if Peterson is innocent or not. It is also not about what your common sense tells you about what happened. Any person who is charged with something is ""not guilty"" unless proven ""guilty"" beyond reasonable doubts. And in this particular case it was prosecutors burden to prove that. The only thing which is begging us to give attention in this series is the broken criminal justice system and the fact that the DA will go any length to put someone behind the bars. This guy had some money so he could fight against it whether he killed his wife or not. But think about this possibility: you're poor and your wife died by an accident and they think you murdered her. So they will do whatever is there to do to put you away for good. And you cannot do anything about it because you are poor. The justice system is biased and rigged against the poor. Whether we think OJ or Peterson killed their wives doesn't mean anything. The prosecutors have to prove beyond reasonable doubts that they are guilty without masterminding the evidence and/or bringing prejudicial matters as evidence. The judge was not wise enough to stop that in Petersons case which he should have stopped. It's not like we can execute some innocent people for the sake of executing a lot of guilty people. If you are not proven guilty then you are not guilty and that's the bottom line. Just because something goes along smoothly according to our common sense doesn't make them right. You have to produce evidence what matters. I agree what David said in one episode, ""the absence of evidence is not same as evidence of absence"". No one knows if he killed his wife except himself until you can prove otherwise by the evidence of presence. If the prosecutors went for the DNA in her clothing straight forward maybe they would have better case against him rather than fabricating with the evidence. True they could have brought some more perspectives from the prosecutors side. It would have been really interesting to see their reaction after the Deaver things came out. But overall it's an average crime documentary with not very high quality. I'll put a 8 star and encourage you to watch it if you have some time to spare.",20 out of 31 found this helpful.,8.0,17 June 2018
646,The Staircase, Murder In My Heart For The Judge,"THE STAIRCASE is protracted and meticulous, yet a fascinating study of how a 'Dream Team' legal defense is organized and executed. In December of 2001 acclaimed author, Michael Peterson, was accused in the death of his wife, Kathleen. It was his contention that Kathleen slipped and fell on a staircase in their home after an evening of wine and relaxation, while the prosecution maintained that Mr. Peterson had bludgeoned his wife, and positioned the body to appear as an accident. Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, the writer/director, has culled this account from more than six-hundred hours of taped documentation. Every aspect of the case is dissected and examined in great detail, and the viewer watches as each piece is crafted into the best possible case for the defense. The film demonstrates how expert witnesses are selected and coached so that the presentation to the jury becomes a calculated performance. The facts of a case are seen as nothing more than elements in a construction to portray the defendant in the most positive light. Truth is of secondary importance, and it is clear that in the American justice system, only the wealthy can receive anything approaching fairness. If you are a fan of The Courtroom Procedural, THE STAIRCASE is well worth your attention. Superb soundtrack by Jocelyn Pook.",40 out of 69 found this helpful.,9.0,18 April 2009

It had some truly great story lines and was funny as all get out....and it ""looked"" like me.;-) Now, what I am not understanding are the comments suggesting they could not afford their lifestyles. THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.<br/><br/>Think about it: Kyle and Overton - Kyle is a SUCCESSFUL stockbroker and Overton is THE Handyman for the building. So, would it not be correct to assume that their apartment had a HUGE discount for Overton's services? And, can we not also deduce correctly that since Kyle IS a successful stockbroker ON THE RISE with NO KIDS and NO WIFE, it is completely feasible he can afford the apartment, his designer clothes, and art collection not only WITH Overton, but by himself as well? <br/><br/>The girls: Khadijah OWNS her magazine. Though struggling, she is STILL a business owner. Regine was a buyer for a high-end boutique, THEN a wardrobe assistant for a MAJOR soap opera and eventually, an Event Planner for WEALTHY clients. Now granted Synclaire is a receptionist, but she is ALSO an actress. She has to make decent money on the side from that. Last, but not least, Max lives across the street in the same neighborhood. She is a successful lawyer, has been a partner in a top law firm AND an Alderwoman and is now the TOP attorney in the NYC Public Defender's office. I'm thinking EACH one of these ""tenants"" HAD to make a MINIMUM of $50k per year in NYC, with Kyle, Max, and possibly Khadijah on the higher end of $75-85k or better, wouldn't you agree? <br/><br/>To state my case :-)......this is the 90's in BROOKLYN. Even if these apartments were $3600 per month, which IS about practicable for BROOKLYN brownstones at that time, why can't we not assume that each one of these ladies could afford $1200 each per month? Or, in Kyle's and Overton's case, $1800 a piece BEFORE Overton's ""live-in"" Handyman's discount is applied, making the apartment surely close to, if not free? Or, in Max's case, approx $2000 per month for rent on a PARTNER's salary, a partner who comes from a FAMILY of LAWYERS (i.e. wealthy parents)? I just do not see a huge disparity, if any, between their lifestyles and their incomes.<br/><br/>Carrie Bradshaw's rent controlled apartment on Sex and the City in MANHATTAN on the UPPER EASTSIDE in 2002 was approx $750 per month. (In Season 4, she was looking for apartments around that price range after her building went co-op and she wasn't sure if she would be able to purchase it).<br/><br/>So, my point is (and to sum this sermon up lol).....if Carrie did this on her own with multiple pairs of $450+ shoes in Manhattan on a writer's salary (no matter if we are in TV Land *wink*).....tell me why my beautiful, each successful in their own right, black ""family"" cannot REALISTICALLY afford their digs in Brooklyn with three apartments and SIX incomes between them.......TOGETHER.....IN THE NINETIES....WITH NO RESPONSIBILITIES.....AND UNDER THE BILL CLINTON ADMINISTRATION???

OMG!! I know we're supposed to be living in a color-blind society denying that any current racism still exists, but this is ridiculous. And you all are carping about the 'unrealistically luxurious apartments' of these girls because...? How many hundreds of sitcoms are produced in Hollywood (and set in New York) every year which feature swanky apartments that no one with an annual salary of less than $200,000 can actually afford? Nobody questions why the out-of-work actor or the struggling chef on FRIENDS are in the huge apartments they're in. Black professionals do exist, even in the make-believe world of sitcom television. I thought this series was a charmer; if it was guilty of anything negative it was its initial presentation of all-men-as-neanderthals during the first season. It was allowed (after a fashion) to flourish and find its audience and in that time it even started to give shape and background to its core characters- not to mention allowing them to advance (in the way of job promotions, romances, breakups, and even a wedding). I never thought it ended satisfactorily, but I'm happy for the five years FOX allowed it on the air. Considering that it preceded FRIENDS on the air by one year, should we conclude that FRIENDS was a white version of LIVING SINGLE?",29 out of 39 found this helpful.,,29 August 2003
657,Living Single, It was an awesome show.,"I loved Living SIngle. Queen Latifah is one of my idols and I used to make an attempt to take a 30 minute break out of my day to watch this. The producers should have been very proud of this outstanding and remarkable show. I wish they would show the re-runs more often in New Orleans. On the last episode everyone went their seperate ways and went on to live their lives by themselves. I wonder if Max and Kyle reunited for the sake of their unborn child, and if Regine ever got married or settled down with someone, or if Khadijah's magazine made it bigger than what it already was, or if Synclaire and Overton made plenty babies. Someone should make an attempt to make a Living Single Reunion movie. I think it would be a big hit. And they should air it on the WB.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,,22 July 2004

It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong.

I now appreciate how well produced it was and I am proud of everyone in that show. They all did a fantastic job. If you watch, you realize it goes beyond of race or color. You don't think they are African American. You just think they are good friends. They are all unique and I can't decide who is my favorite. You identify with the characters.

661,Living Single, Living Single #1,I love the show. I record all episodes on Direct TV every day shown on Oxygen. Thank you Oxygen! My 8 yr daughter has become a very big fan of Queen Latifah through watching Living Single reruns. I love the witty banter shared by the girls and their male friends upstairs. I love that all the girls were successful in their own careers and always supported each other. I want to know why Regine left the show so abruptly? That final episode of her marriage proposal left so many unanswered questions. The writers for the show were so very creating for the first 4 years but they let the fans down with the final season ending with some many hanging story lines.

Living in a big city with my college friends and still being able to hang out with people from my childhood. Now that I am in my mid 20s some of those things have come true; I have a friend who acts like Max, I still hangout with several of my childhood friends, and I got a Kyle and Overton, we just don't all live in the same area. Point to all of this is they just don't make shows like this anymore. I watch crime drama now, but I still like a good laugh now and then, even though the show was fictional a lot of the issues they discuss were real topics. Me and girlfriends watched the episode when Max started dating Regine's ex and it caused friction between them, we sat and laugh at the episode but we discussed how that would hurt our friendship.

Queen L. is very funny and relaxed in her role and seems like someone you know. Kim Fields' timing and delivery is consistently dead on.

671,Living Single," The Forerunner To Friends: Amusing, Light-Hearted -Yet Far More Intelligent","Living single was lauded as the African-American version of Designing Women and Friends. With the latter show being a forerunner to Living Single. <br/><br/>Like Friends, it was based in New York- only this time in Brooklyn and as opposed to just 3 guys and 3 girls, there were 2 guys and 4 girls who all hanged out in a little apartment. <br/><br/>The show's ensemble cast was one of the best, let alone in a Black sitcom; Queen Latifah was superb as Khadijah- she was laid-back but also, had a no-nonsense yet still firm attitude. Erika was at times hilarious as Maxine, Kim Fields was very, very good as Regine and managed to be sharp and sweet too. My favourite was Synclaire (notice the spelling, there is an 'e' at the end of it); played by actress and later TV host, Kim Coles. She was by and large the Black version of 'Phoebe' from Friends. Kooky- yet subtle, quirky and silly. Which is good! <br/><br/>Another Friends- like character was Kyle- he was the show's version of Ross but he was less goofy and more reserved, he came off as being very 'dashing' and exquisite in contrast. Almost posh-like. And last but not least was Overton- he was the more laid-back, easy going, fun loving guy. <br/><br/>Arguably, most of the jokes and funnier moments were much better handled and executed well; thus, it stood out more than NBC's worldwide hit, Friends. Each character had their own agendas, as well as individual personalities and the actors all had depth and they brought something different to them to make them as likable as interesting as they are. <br/><br/>I also noticed whilst watching a few of the episodes that there seemed to be an air of intelligence, especially in the writing that made this head and shoulders above many other black sitcoms. Not just in the 90s but the early 00s as well. For instance, whilst Synclaire was portrayed as being an 'air-head' in many respects, she was also very loyal, compassionate and had a innocent and endearing charm about her. Nearly child-like that is. The scripting of Living Single was excellent. <br/><br/>One's initial viewing of this show would be this is a 'chick' show, but for a so-called chick sitcom, Living Single was both clever AND amusing. <br/><br/>I read also that like many sitcoms over the last decade, Living Single fell foul to terrible writing towards the last couple of open-ended episodes of the final season, which later resulted in its cancellation by network Fox- only for the series to be brought back and wrapped up in the final 3 eps. <br/><br/>Living Single was very under-rated as a show; the characters were well developed and story-lines were well-written; the writers did extremely well in juggling and handling both the humour and drama. <br/><br/>The rights were never bought in the UK, and so I don't recall Living Single ever being shown on terrestrial and satellite TV over here. But I have watched a couple of the episodes on-line and for me, it is a really good sitcom. It's a shame that U.S TV has stopped making sitcoms such as this nowadays. Sitcoms that put a smile on your face and with an ongoing plot line, because right now, the TV market is currently saturated with reality TV and drama. <br/><br/>Overall, it was and still is amusing, light-hearted and one of the most intelligent sitcom shows around. Living Single may not have been an outright sitcom classic, yet it was terrific fun that during the 00s its relatively short success was later followed by the likes of 'Girlfriends'- another sitcom that was remarkably similar to Living Single in many respects. <br/><br/>Living Single was a show that was fresh and unique that deserved to be handled much, much better than it was by Fox.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,15 July 2010

699,Kim Possible, One of the more clever shows on television,"I am absolutely _shocked_ at the reaction of some of the opinions presented here about what I think is actually a rather well written series. Obviously many here have not clued into concepts like irony, subtlety, and satire. Yes, some of the villains are clichéd, but they're _supposed_ to be clichéd. Like how the big supervillains are always supposed to have a secret lair, or always have to give away their big plan to Kim before they finish her off. (A favorite of mine is the villain who also works at a Costco-type super store, and instead of holding Kim above a pool of killer sharks, uses a pool of bargain-priced snapping turtles)<br/><br/>The dialog is pretty sharp, and I think it's actually one of the more quotable television series along with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Gilmore Girls. My favorite lines? Probably how in the future, Duff Killigan declares himself ""the world's deadliest cyborg golfer"", which doesn't mean much to Ron, since ""cyborg golfer"" can't be a particularly crowded field. <br/><br/>To those who complain about the series not being ""realistic""- you're not getting it at all. (People are actually complaining about the careers of Kim's parents? If I have to explain why them being a rocket scientist and a brain surgeon is sheer brilliance, then you're beyond help.)

Its focus on the blend of ""saving the world"" as a by-the-way activity on the side while handling the ordinary life of being a high school student is part of what makes this show so appealing. Using witty dialogue between the characters, the show often pokes fun at the clichés of villains and action shows. The interactions between each of the hilariously paired characters is really what drives the show. For example, note the team of Kim and Ron (extreme competence and intelligence versus extreme incompetence). Or better yet, note the humorous tension between benign villains and their very evil counterparts. (Dr. Drakken and Shego, and Senor Junior and Senor Senior). This show can be enjoyed on many different levels, which is why it can appeal to such a wide range of age groups.",29 out of 29 found this helpful.,,16 January 2005
702,Kim Possible, Destined to be a classic,"It appeals to kids, it appeals to teens, it appeals to adults.  This show is hysterically funny, with jokes many different age groups will laugh at individually as well as together, and exciting without being too violent for the young ones.  Great voice acting from the usual Disney contract players and outstanding writing and artwork.  The only drawback is they repeat the same few episodes a lot, but fortunately I can watch an episode of KP many times and not get tired of it (of course, maybe that's just me...)

703,Kim Possible," Call her, beep her if you wanna reach her...","The ranks of sisters doing it for themselves have a new member in the form of Kim Possible, and the result is... well, ""Kim Possible,"" Disney's best TV cartoon since ""Gargoyles,"" although the tone of this Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle creation is closer to ""Darkwing Duck."" Then again, that was also a cracker. But moving on to the large-headed, midriff-baring, wavy-haired, adolescent-targeted young lady who is NOT Christina Aguilera...<br/><br/>High school student and cheerleader Kimberly Ann Possible's website (maintained by genius Wade, who serves as her technical backup during jobs) is set up offering her services to people needing help, but said help generally entails her saving the world at a moment's notice - in a running gag, Kim and her sidekick Ron Stoppable are taken to the episode's hotspot by folks who La Possible helped in unseen escapades; like Mighty Max (and unlike most similar characters), Kim's siblings and parents are fully aware of her extracurricular activities - and, again unlike most similar characters, so is everyone else. One of the best touches of the show, in fact, is having Kim take part in one of the most stereotypically stupid pastimes (cheerleading), while her parents are in two of the most stereotypically brainy professions - as the girl says, ""Mom's a brain surgeon, Dad's a rocket scientist..."" (The next time some cleverdick chunters on about Americans having no sense of irony, try bringing this up.)<br/><br/>By itself, saving the world is ""no big,"" but Kim obviously has to deal with all the difficulties of being a heroine and a regular teenage girl, on top of having as her best friend and partner the aforementioned Master Stoppable, who unfortunately lives up to his name a lot. Though this is in a sense admirable as part of the show's overall refusal to play gender stereotypes (Kim and Ron have one of the few truly platonic male/female relationships on television - even Xander, let us not forget, used to have a crush on Buffy), he also comes close to forcing the show to name itself after him, because his antics have more room for comedy than Kim's. Fortunately the show's writers hit a good balance more often than not and remember that it's supposed to be a mix of comedy AND action; but though Kim's not one to mess with when the chips are down, she never comes over as a heartless machine. Though some male viewers will probably refuse to watch it because it might make guys look bad, they'd be missing the fact that the male characters are mostly positive, with the nastiest character being Sheego (Kim's opposite number, and the assistant to Kim's arch-enemy Dr. Drakken - and a lot more dangerous and intelligent than he is; if this was ""24,"" she would be Sherry Palmer). They'd also really need to grow up.<br/><br/>In any case, ""Kim Possible"" is so entertaining that dismissing it on the grounds of sexism would be silly; well-paced, funny without being overly stupid, easy on the morals, with genuinely exciting fight scenes, and a lead character worth at least 30 of Clover, Alex and Sam on the similar but wildly inferior ""Totally Spies!"" (with the added bonus of Kim leaving her closest live action counterpart - Sydney Bristow from fellow Disney/Touchstone show ""Alias"" - standing in both the hotness AND fighting stakes), this might not appeal to people still wishing they made cartoons as good as, say, ""My Little Pony"" or ""Avenger Penguins,"" but it's their loss. And as for people demanding credibility, they can watch ""King of the Hill."" But if you don't want to go into a coma, remember the advice Christina Milian gives in Cory Lerios and George Gabriel's irresistibly catchy theme song - you know that you always can call Kim Possible.<br/><br/>""So what's the stitch?""",50 out of 53 found this helpful.,,1 January 2003

Each of the villains is faulted in some way that is a flash back to the coyote from the roadrunner cartoons. <br/><br/>I started watching this cartoon when my youngest sister (she is 24) was watching it while visiting me for the summer. The first couple of episodes, you will probably be scratching your head trying to figure out why the villains are so quirky. After about a week of watching, I was grounded enough to appreciate the humor. If you like older cartoons, or cartoons like Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, or Courage the cowardly dog, you will probably like this cartoon.<br/><br/>Ron Stoppable and Rufus (his naked mole rat companion) will probably be your favorite characters.

708,Kim Possible, The Best Show on The Disney Channel,"Kim Possible is easily the best show on the Disney Channel, and among the best on television. The show follows the exploits of teen hero Kim Possible and her partner Ron Stoppable. Her tagline ""She can do anything"" becomes more and more true with every episode. Those who complain about the rampant clichés are missing the point. This is satire, for crying out loud; it's supposed to be cliché. The villains would feel right at home in any Bond movie. The whole premise of the show, in fact, leads one to wonder if show creators Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle asked the question: ""What if James Bond were a teenage girl?"" This is truly an all-star cast: Christy Carlson Romano (Ren Stevens from ""Even Stevens"") as Kim, Will Friedle (Terry McGinnis from ""Batman Beyond"") as Ron, Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson) as Rufus, Ron's pet naked mole rat,Tahj Mowry (the kid from ""Smart Guy"") as Wade, the supergenius who runs Kim's website, Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh from ""Office Space"") as Kim's Dad, Jean Smart (Sherry Regan From ""The District"") as Kim's Mom, Patrick Warburton (Joe from ""Family Guy"") as the overly strict teacher Mr. Barkin, John DiMaggio (Bender from ""Futurama"") as Dr. Drakken, Kim's arch-foe, Nicole Sullivan (of ""MADtv"" fame) as Shego, Dr. Drakken's assistant and Kim's negative, and even Ricardo Montalban as Senor Senior Senior. Not to mention guest appearances by Tara Strong (Timmy from ""The Fairly OddParents""), Adam West (an incredibly good sport who appears in the show's parody of Batman), Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson), Brad Garrett (Robert from ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Richard Kind, Rob Paulsen (Raphael from ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""), Nestor Carbonell, Patton Oswalt (Spence from ""The King of Queens""),Brian Posehn (Kevin from ""Just Shoot Me""), Phil LaMarr, Felicity Huffman, Fred Willard, Elliot Gould, Debbie Reynolds, and, my personal favorite, John C. McGinley (Dr. Cox from ""Scrubs"").<br/><br/>While all of this star-power is certainly admirable, it is the clever writing and hilarious parodies that push this show over the top. Like snowflakes, no two episodes are truly alike. Never once did I feel as though I were watching the same episode (except in the case of endless reruns that Disney seems compelled to run).<br/><br/>The only complaint I have with this show (and this is a shot at Disney Execs who control the order in which the episodes air, not the writers) is continuity. Not that I scrutinize each frame, but there are certain errors that show up in the show's plot. The examples are too numerous to list. While this is a relatively minor concern, the fact that the shows often try to build off of each other like a continuous story is hindered by the fact that the Execs run them in a different order than the writers had intended.<br/><br/>Still, this doesn't change the fact that Kim Possible is just plain fun to watch. My favorite part of the show is the jokes that appeal to every age group, something that Disney has previously only accomplished with its movies. This alone cements Kim Possible as the finest show on the Disney Channel.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,27 November 2006

714,Kim Possible, Why Kim Possible is Genius,"""Kim Possible"" is arguably the best series Disney has produced to date... (animated or otherwise) as many other viewers have commented. But the question is why? What makes this program so much better than every other in the long and storied history of the Mouse?<br/><br/>Premise. The old joke about a Rocket Scientist and a Brain Surgeon is a great place to start, as that's Kim's Dad and Mom! And with such intelligent lineage, Kim is a brilliant mind too, only she's not weird about it. She's a basic, average girl, but she's here to save the world! Cheerleader and honor student by day; superhero the rest of the time. Really, she's the most well-rounded and talented Disney female since 1964's Mary Poppins (and she didn't have to keep house; just answer her KIM- municator).<br/><br/>Characters. Kim's partner in crimefighting, Ron Stoppable and his naked mole rat pet Rufus always provided comic relief, humorous complications and legitimate help to Ms. Possible, as well as the inevitable after- school snacks at Bueno Nacho, their Mexican restaurant hangout. Wade, the point man that clued Kim in to the sitch, offered just the right tone of stability to the stories. Kim's occasionally seen twin brothers Tim and Jim gave her some sibling rivalry angst. And the best and most wacky rogue's gallery of villains since Adam West's ""Batman"" series, and with nearly the same level of star power, provided the knockout punch! Led by John DiMaggio's Dr. Drakken and Nicole Sullivan's Shego, other guest voices throughout the series included such iconic names as Debbie Reynolds, Andrea Martin, Elliot Gould, George Takei, Nestor Carbonell and Ricardo Montalban. <br/><br/>Stories. Despite covering the same ground as so many other series had done within the high school framework setting, every episode always seemed fresh and innovative. Full credit to the writers for carefully mixing in the adventure elements with Kim's day-to-day school life, for exposing some of Kim's foibles and failings (she really had trouble with that road test for Driver's Ed!) and for not letting Kim and Ron get too romantic until just the right moment. Also, the fact that the plots always had that sense of danger but were never too frightening for all age groups was a truly brilliant and notable element of the series.<br/><br/>Performances. Christy Carlson Romano, Will Friedle, Nancy Cartwright and Tahj Mowry were fantastic as the core four heroes, and their vocal skills were crucial in making everything work. And the theme song, sung by Christina Milian, lived up to the level of the program itself. Always smart, always funny and always had something to say about family, friendship and life (both scholastic AND extra-curricular), ""Kim Possible"" really was worth watching, and Kim proved it was Possible to be a great Disney role-model without being a princess!",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,24 August 2011

Finally, the decision to do this series at all deserves a big hand, since typical Telenovelas are exaggerated good guys/bad guys stereotypes much like U.S. TV used to be in the 60s and 70s. To do such a complex character arc like Walter Blanco (White) is very unique.<br/><br/>Criticism from the peanut gallery: Some people are upset that Univision didn't just dub the AMC version or subtitle and stay 'true' to the original. Well, gee, why didn't the U.S. just run ""The Office"" - without subtitles, mind you - since it was an English show? Honestly, the list of shows that have been adapted from other countries is enormous (Ugly Betty, American Idol, Three's Company, etc etc etc). It's been done for decades with little controversy. I don't know why this one deserves any scorn. They wanted to do a good adaption, and they have! Love it!",44 out of 165 found this helpful.,9.0,29 June 2014
734,Metástasis, Excellent Remake of Breaking Bad,"I'm pretty sure the reason for the low scores on IMDb for this show is the negative perception of the Spanish language in the United States and was rated by people who had never even watched the show before it premiered.<br/><br/>Metastasis is almost a word for word, scene by scene remake of Breaking Bad. The only thing that has changed is the language which is now in Spanish and takes place in Colombia as well as some other minor differences.<br/><br/>Admittedly I do like the American version better but that is because the bar was already set too high. However, the remake is still excellent and every actor gives a great performance. Any Breaking Bad fan craving new material will be pleased with this remake. Unfortunately they do not provide subtitles in English for the non Spanish speakers.<br/><br/>However the great thing is that they are always releasing new episodes every weekday instead of making people wait every week for one new episode and you can catch it either on Unimas or Hulu Plus.

I suppose I can grant that this series doesn't measure up to the quality and consistency of the acting in the original series. There are lots of other little ways that this is not nearly as good if compared against Breaking Bad. But this production is not a rival to the original; it doesn't detract, it's the same story seen with a different situational lens (and smaller budget) - and I think that's an interesting idea. <br/><br/>The story survives completely intact after the transplant from Albuquerque into Bogota, and the changes that this demanded were handled convincingly and with humor.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed this as an exercise in language learning. I watched it on Netflix with Spanish subtitles, to help me past the slang, and had a great deal of fun noticing the differences in acting style and overall atmosphere.

The only criticism on here had not even seen the show! Well I did, and it's not bad. Diego Trujillo and Roberto Urbina are not as memorable as Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, but they are decent actors. I would say if there is one problem, it's that the director occasionally misunderstands the purpose of the scene. This mostly manifests in the distracting soundtrack. With something like Breaking Bad, you miss the action if your eyes are focused on the bottom of the screen reading the subtitles (Trust me, I know), so there was a reason to remake the show in Spanish.

The ""Skylar"" role isn't as oblivious as the US version and the knowing looks that the Columbian actress gives are priceless and have great impact. Jose's role has been softened somewhat to portray his ultimate decent as much more tragic. Saul's role has been changed to portray the reality's of Columbia (no sleazy lawyer ads). Personally I find the adherence to the script's (for the most part) a really nice way for the viewer to understand what the writer was attempting to convey in the original that was lost upon me until I viewed it once again with a different actor's interpretation.",5 out of 24 found this helpful.,7.0,23 September 2016

The character development in this version was actually better than in the original. They took the characters one step further.

I think Roberto Urbino has a huge career ahead of him, but the other actors were also believable and not like the usual telenovela drama, as I expected. Vince Gilligan was a consultant, so he surely was an influence. I found Saúl to be a bit annoying, but at times I found myself laughing at his antics.

Admittedly, it took me awhile to warm up to the new actors-after all, they had big shoes to fill! While some of them had a different ""take"" on their character, I can still appreciate their interpretation and performances. Sure, a few scenes were a bit less spectacular than the original (say, the scene where the low-rider is shot up and abandoned at Tuco's), I loved the little adjustments they made to Latin-ize the series: Cielo's tango with her boss (instead of singing a Marilyn Monroe-style Happy Birthday), a courtyard fountain instead of a swimming pool (what struggling chemistry professor can afford a swimming pool?). The Columbian characters have become as dear to me as the American counterparts. I expect to watch this entire series multiple times, just as I did the original. Give it a chance!

749,Match Game, A true blast from the past...,"The Match Game shows of the 70's were a huge favorite of mine as a kid. Like ""The Gong Show"", I was allowed to watch this program as a kid despite the content of it being a little too ""adult"" at times, although I think it's much tamer than the crap that airs on FOX. It was a time, the 1970's, when everyone was much looser and there wasn't the hypocrisy and falsehoods of political correctness.<br/><br/>Match Game was similar to games like ""What's My Line"". The contestant was given a phrase with a blank in it and he/she would give a response and try to see if they could get matches from the celebrities. Whoever won the game would then go into a bonus round where they could win various amounts of money (depending on the version of Match Game) where they just had to match the response of the celebrity they chose.<br/><br/>Match Game was famous for their regular panelists. Richard Dawson wasn't just a comedian, he brought moments of arrogance, cockiness, and dry British wit that was so intriguing to watch. He may have not been a favorite of the regulars but the female contestants were in love with him. He was the guy who most of them chose as the one to match answers with in the bonus round before the celebrity wheel showed up. Of course, Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly were awesome, too. Those two were a hoot. I also like Fannie Flagg; she was so out there.<br/><br/>The real star of the show was always Gene Rayburn. The Master of Ceremonies; he always played it cool and collected. He was a gracious, friendly, entertaining, non-overbearing host. I liked his rich tone of voice and charm to make the contestants feel comfortable. I always enjoy watching Match Game on the Game Show Network; I kind of wish they'd dump most of their homegrown game shows like Cram, Lingo, and others (except Whammy) and show more 70's and 80's classics like Match Game. I think re-showing stuff like ""Regis' Gig"" and ""The Weakest Link"" isn't a good idea.",22 out of 22 found this helpful.,,6 November 2003
750,Match Game, A fave of mine,"Match Game started modestly enough with only Richard Dawson as the sole regular. Brett and Charles were added on by a happy accident. When Brett commented that Charles wasn't wearing any socks, someone thought it might be interesting to seat her next to Charles (she sat on Richard's right on her debut week) and another odd couple was born.<br/><br/>At the start of the '78 shows, Richard Dawson was gradually becoming less enchanted with Match Game. He wanted out, but he had to wait for his contract to expire. Richard's behavior took a noticeable turn around April 1978, when he stopped smiling, spoke only to reveal his answers (in a low, monotone voice), wouldn't look at the camera, and overall looked bored and miserable. It didn't help when they added the Star Wheel, meaning that he'd participate less in the bonus game. When Gene noticed this very sudden change in behavior, he tried to co-erse him to smile. The audience shouted requests, and when Richard flatly refused, Gene resorted to nearly strangling him to the ground before finally getting a smile out of him. Unfortunately, this didn't help his behavior for the rest of the run. 6 weeks later, they finally let him go. Richard's last show was without fanfare, and there was no direct mention that it would be his last (other than his statement ""Fare thee well"" which he wrote on his card at the start of the show). Word has it Gene did mention Richard was leaving, but those comments were edited out. It may have been edited out either because they may have thought Richard would return, or they just felt Richard didn't deserve a ""goodbye"" after his erratic behavior.<br/><br/>The following week, Bob Barker was the first to fill Richard's chair, and he noticed a card that Richard left behind that said ""The sun never sets in England"". Gene commented ""He thought he was going to be here forever"" Very little was mentioned of Richard after he left, but on the show's finale, when a contestant insisted on kissing Mc.Lean Stevenson, despite his having a cold, Betty White quips ""May I suggest you pass that on to Richard Dawson?""",20 out of 20 found this helpful.,,7 August 2005

But the show will always be one of the classic game shows from that decade. The late announcer Johnny Olson and the perfect show host,the late Gene Rayburn were simply marvelous. Each episode will have contestants attempting to match six-well knowns to fill in the ""blank"" that was based on a mildly provocative question often with hilarious results from the panel of celebrity guests.<br/><br/>The show made household names out of Brett Somers,Betty White,Charles Nelson-Reilly,Bill Daily,Fanny Flagg,Richard Dawson,and Bob Barker. The show also had contestants on the show as well who will make names for themselves as well including earlier segments which featured future talk-show host Jenny Jones and future actresses Marliu Henner,Joyce DeWitt, and Kristie Alley. The show also had some walk-ons to add a bit of spice to the show and help the contestants along as well including cast members from various CBS shows at the time appeared on Match Game when the show aired including the cast of ""The Carol Burnett Show"", ""All In The Family"" ""MASH"",and one that included the cast of ""The Waltons"",and ""Good Times"".<br/><br/>Recently,The Game Show Network did a day-long marathon of this series and it brought back some grand memories.

Filling in the blanks and trying to match a celebrity panel may seem silly and trite, but that simple premise provided for one of the most entertaining shows in game show history.  Led by the dapper Gene Rayburn, the panel consisted of three regulars (until the later episodes, anyway): splashy and fun Brett Somers, funny theatre veteran Charles Nelson Reilly, and Family Feud's dashing and suave Richard Dawson. Then you had the semi-regulars: hilarious comedienne and book author Fannie Flagg, cute and perky actress Joyce Bulifant, or the lovely and enchanting Betty White.  Occasionally, you'd also see the likes of M*A*S*H's Gary Berghoff, Patty Duke, Marcia Wallace, and many other familiar faces.

Unfortunately, I didn't grow up during the ""Match Game"" era, but I've seen lots of episodes. I particularly liked the chemistry between Gene Ryaburn and the other panelists His wit and humor made that show what it was.<br/><br/>However, during the years, you could tell a definite loss of enthusiasm for the show. In the 77-78 seasons, Richard Dawson tried to put a damper on the show with his attitude. He wouldn't smile, and didn't interact with the other panelists like he used to His actions and his success eventually led the producers of the show to add a 'Star Wheel' where all the panelists had a chance to win on the 'Celebrity Match.' Very shortly after the wheel was added, Richard left.<br/><br/>After 'Match Game' was canceled on CBS and put into syndication, the show began to slowly grind down. It appeared to me that some of the panelists who were brought on tried to upstage Gene. Stars like Bart Braverman, Jon ""Bowser"" Bauman, Bill Daly, and Elaine Joyce overdid themselves trying to be funny, and to me it took away from the classic humor of the show. Gene rarely did his little bits of humor, and a lot of times seemed upset at the stars or disinterested. Eventually, the show was canceled altogether, and 'Match Game' went down as a TV classic. It was revived several times, but none of the other versions lived up to the classic format of the 70's.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to give a big two-thumbs-up for the 70's version.

Also, Brett appears in the brief tribute to Gene Rayburn, which could also have been better, but better than nothing. And nowhere does Match Game's ""prince"" Charles Nelson Reilly appear in any interviews. Not sure if it's because Charles did not want to participate or if the producers of this DVD didn't think to ask him for an interview (???), but this is a glaring omission.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'm blankin' happy with the DVDs and hope it's the first of many more releases to come.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,6 December 2006

The host of it all, the late Gene Rayburn really knew how to work the crowd and made sure that they never left without a laugh, no one else could of done the same. <br/><br/>It was also so funny to see the comedic duo, Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly bickering and making a mockery of each other's answers. The chemistry between them always grew into a slapstick parody of some sort that never made a dull or boring moment on Match Game. Even when Brett wins the ""Pathetic Answer Award"" from Charles, the two will always be a unique caricture of the show and will always remain one of a kind. For lots of laughs this would be the one show to see, Don't miss out.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,10 August 2002
764,Match Game, ...guarenteed a laugh!,"I must say, ever since our acquisition of the Game Show Network not a day has passed when I have not enjoyed watching Match Game. If I am not home I make sure that it records so that at least when I am home in the evenings I can guarentee that I will have something to look forward to.<br/><br/>The 1973-77 seasons of Match Game have to be the best. Consdering that right now they are showing the 1973 and 1977 episodes on GSN, I am thrilled. Before Dicky Dawson left. Before the Star Wheel. When everything seemed lighter and more fun oriented. At least to me, Gene Rayburn will be considered the best host of Match Game.<br/><br/>Match Game PM is also good, but I don't like it as much because there is less time for jokes. There is a new game each time the show opens, always two new contestants.<br/><br/>I prefer the time spent on the jokes to the time spent actually playing, though the answers most of the time are good enough for a laugh. Especially when the answers that are ""really out in left field"" get ridiculed, or if the judges are forced to take back their decision. Match Games 73-77 captures this comedic essense.<br/><br/>I can barely watch the 90's episodes - when they show Brett Sommers again I might warm to it. I miss Charles (CNR) giving her the ""Pathetic Answer Awards"" though most of the time I end up matching her the most. It's hard not to play along when you watch Match Game. It is a complete riot and can have you laughing at possibly some of the most minimal things. I always crack a smile when Brett mentions Jack Klugman and I wish he had done a longer stint on the show (in 73).<br/><br/>All of that said, it is definitely a game show worth tuning into :)",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,27 October 2001
765,Match Game, One of the Funniest shows ever,"Match Game was one of the funniest shows of all time. Some sitcoms never get to the level of humor this game show did. You had on Match Game really funny people like Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, Betty White, and others. Gene Rayburn was also very good as the host. He was such a natural that you would think being a host was easy. THe writing was also very good. The short sentences or stories were excellent. Especially good are any blanks that had to do were Dumb Dora or Old Man Periwinkle. Gene Rayburn did that character particularly well. Any version that plays on Game SHow Network is good. THe regular or Prime time edition. If you like game shows this is the one to watch.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,10 July 2001
766,Match Game," Not just a game show, but good laughs too","When you watch an episode of ""Match Game"" juxtaposed with a more modern game show such as ""Jeopardy!"" or ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"" what is so astounding is how much time the host, the panelists, and the contestants waste.  Only about 15 minutes of each half-hour show seems to be occupied by actual game play.  The unique and extraordinary thing about ""Match Game,"" though, is how that time never (or very rarely) drags on.  Most of the time, the witty diatribes between the panelists or the panelists making fun of the readily-mockable Gene Rayburn is  more entertaining than anything going on in the game. ""Match Game"" is always fun to watch, and unlike any other game show, watching contestants give grossly unrelated answers is much more interesting than watching them give correct ones.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""Match Game"" though, is certainly the celebrity panelists.  Unlike modern versions of ""Hollywood Squares"" or ""To Tell the Truth,"" all of their little humorous interjections during the show do not seem to be rehearsed ad-nauseum.  Until 1978 when he decided he was too important for the show, Richard Dawson could be consistently counted on to keep the audience and the contestants entertained.  But the two most crucial ""Match Game"" panelists are the ones who stayed with it for the entire duration of the show.  It is hard to imagine ""Match Game"" without the faux-bickering between Charles Nelson Reilly and Brett Sommers who had more to do with the longevity of the show than the man the announcer calls ""the star of 'Match Game'"" at the beginning of each installment.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,8 March 2001

768,Match Game," If you watch it, you'll love it!","I've been catching re-runs of these 25 year old Match Game episodes.  And I don't know if people in the 70s found the show to be funny, but personally I think the show is a riot!!<br/><br/>The late Gene Rayburn hosted the show for years and years, and he was a scream.  Whenever Gene would read a question having to do with Count Dracula (a regular match-game question character) the impression was brilliant. He's a guy who can make fun of a contestants answers and yet the contestant wouldn't ever be insulted.<br/><br/>The regulars on the panel are also a hoot.  The team-up of Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly was fantastic.  These two would play off each other so well.  It was very rare when these two's hijinks didn't have me laughing. Richard Dawson was also a comedy riot.  He was always able to come up with a perfect one-liner at the drop of the hat.<br/><br/>And I have to say, even the show's questions were a ""star of the show"".  It was very rare when a question didn't have the audience laughing.  Over the years, some characters from the questions became so popular that they were repeated often.  Characters such as:  Dracula, Old Man Periwinkle, The Godfather, Mr. Robot and of course, Dumb Dora (How dumb is she???)<br/><br/>Another great part of this game, which I think it essential to a good game show is:  the ability to play along at home.  Its always fun to see which celebrity would match you if a question was asked, ""Trixie, the beautiful stewardess, lost her (blank) over the Rocky Mountains""<br/><br/>I guarantee that if you watch this show, if only for a week, you'll be coming back for more.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,10 January 2000
769,Match Game," More Memories, But These Are Better (SPOILERS)","SPOILERS<br/><br/>As you know if you read my comments, nobody does, by the way, I am a huge fan of game shows. Well, this little game show just happens to be my favorite. Come on, how could you not this? You know everyone has fun, this is anything but serious, everyone is probably a bit drunk, you can basically do anything but doing something bad or nasty, and come on, this is just plain fun! How could you not like some of the most famous game show moments of all time, including the 1977 School Riot, other mistakes, puns, and more. I can not name all the moments, that would take days. Gene Rayburn (RIP) is one of the greatest game show hosts of all time, along with Bob Barker from the Price is Right, and he was a panelist for a short while, by the way. Everyone knows, though, that the best and most prolific panelists are Charles Nelson Reilly, Brett Somers, and Richard Dawson. On Head-To-Head Match you should always choose Richard. Most of the time he matches the contestant. Then he left in 1978 for time to do Family Feud, which is another great game-show. This show was the best game show until the Star Wheel came. That kind of ruined it. That made the contestants spin a wheel. When it landed on a certain celebrity, you had to try to match that celebrity.<br/><br/>Here is how you play. There are six celebrities, called panelists, and they are two contestants. Gene Rayburn says something, with the word blank in the sentence. The panelists write down what they think is that blank. The contestant tries to match the panelist. There are two rounds. Whoever wins gets $100 and then plays Audiece Match. There is something like Rocky *blank* and the contestant calls on 3 panelists. They give what they think is that blank. The third answer is $100, second is $250, and the top is $500. If they get one of those they play Head-To-Head Match. Let's say that they won $500, they then play for $5000. They try to match the celebrity. If they do, they win the $5000. If they do not, they win the $500.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the finest game shows ever. It is one of the funniest, one of the most famous, and one of the most iconic ever. This totally deserved to be number one of the Fifty Greatest Game Shows Of All Time. When I say that I mean it was number one, and it could not have been anything less. Yeah, it is that good. Trust me, if you absolutely love game shows, you have to watch this. Nothing is wrong with this, well, except for the Star Wheel. Anyway, I guess there is nothing else to say. This is an excellent game show. Everything has already been said about this game show. Well, I guess I can say just watch this and be entertained for one of the best thirty minute-long game shows ever.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Recommended Shows: Family Feud, The Price Is Right, and Wheel of Fortune.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,19 May 2007

772,Match Game, This may possibly be the greatest game show ever produced...,"I am 16 years old, and first discovered 'Match Game' on Game Show Network about 2 or 3 years ago, and since then, I am hooked. The show began in 1973 on a spinoff of the old 60's series, 'The Match Game'. Gene Rayburn was the perfect match as a host of the show. The game itself was very simple: two contestants filled in the blank on a question, rhyme, poem, etc, that usually had a definitive answer to it. If the contestant's response matched that of a celebrity, they got a match. There were six celebrities on the panel in all, and whoever got the most matches after the end of two, sometimes, three rounds, they moved on to play the 'big money Super Match', where they had to match one celebrity head-to-head for a chance at anywhere from 1,000 to 20,000 dollars, depending on what version of the show it was. The show was simple in itself; it was the interaction between Gene Rayburn and the six celebrity panelists that made it funny. Typical panelists included Richard Dawson, Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, Betty White, Bob Barker, and Fanny Flagg, however, literally dozens and dozens of more appeared from one time to another. The show ran on CBS in the afternoon and evening until the early 80's. Several shows have since tried to remake 'Match Game', but none have been successful. 'Match Game' runs on Game Show Network weekdays at 9:00 AM, 12:30 PM, 6:30 PM, and 9:00 PM. On the weekends, it runs at 9:00 AM, 12:30 PM, 6:30 PM, and 9:00 PM on Saturdays.

773,Match Game," Rayburn's Not A Host, He's A Traffic Director","Organized chaos !!
I should say I've only seen episodes from 73, 74 &amp; 75, but I expect the successful formula remained pretty much the same throughout. Contestants try to match fill-in-the-blank answers to those of the celebrity panelists. And it's those often naughty questions from host Rayburn that gave the game audience appeal. Questions like ""On his wedding night, Bill couldn't find his_____?"" Naturally naughty laughs follow as listeners flirt with the obvious innuendo. Of course, any answer too explicit has to be finessed for TV, and that means players have to be clever to get the needed matches.<br/><br/>The barely controlled joking and byplay on stage often created an air of humorous spontaneity that could at times also become annoying. Host Rayburn did a pretty good job coordinating the byplay with the game while cracking jokes himself. Nonetheless, events often got pretty thick. Though the celebrity panelists, except for Dawson and Somers, would change periodically, the six seating spots on the three-person two- tier arrangement appeared pretty predictable. Seat #1 upper left was the good-looking guy seat, like Convy or Gautier; #2 in the middle was animated Somers; #3 on the upper end was a wise cracker, like Berghoff or Reilly; #4, bottom left, was good-looking girl like Mobley or Pflug; #5, middle, was clever and erudite Dawson; #6, lower end, seemed an untyped exception, like Betty White or Kay Medford. Also, it's not commercially surprising that the good-lookers seats #'s 1 and 4 were also those closest to he camera. Anyway, events never dragged, to say the least.<br/><br/>All in all, I can see why some folks would tune out not only because of the innuendo, but because of the often really busy atmosphere, funny or not. But for those who like spice in their stew, this is a tasty dish for you.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,,25 October 2020

Ray Wise definitely comes out on top with his take on The Devil, anyone who remembers him from Twin Peaks will see glimpses of Leland Palmer in there, albeit a bit more over the top.<br/><br/>Definitely a few plot points being dropped that suggest a deeper storyline ahead for Sam and his cronies.

775,Reaper, A good non-cable show !? Who knew?,"Reaper was much much better than I thought it was going to be; consistently funny and not predictable in the way that most sitcoms are. It is a regular on my TiVo list now, I can only hope that the network doesn't kill it off for some lame reality show replacement. If you get a chance, watch it, it is the rare network show that is funny without resorting to being dumb. It's so strange to actually have something decent to watch on regular TV! Excellent casting, especially for the Devil.<br/><br/>Oh, and the person who was reminded of Shaun of the Dead - the unlikely loser hero with the fat maladjusted buddy is a comedy standby. Shaun of the Dead borrows from some of the best as well - Ghostbusters, Army of Darkness, etc....But the comparison to Shaun of the dead is really a compliment - watch Reaper folks, you won't regret it, and you will actually laugh for a change.<br/><br/>Still can't believe that this is on Network TV.....it's too good, someone must have made a mistake.",82 out of 94 found this helpful.,7.0,20 October 2007

I have never been a fan of The CW or WB/UPN for that matter and was extremely skeptical about tuning in. Man, glad I did. This show is so funny. I haven't laughed this hard watching TV in a long time. And I laugh a lot during The Office. Reaper is paced perfectly for the hour long format. I could never see this working as a sitcom. The interactions with the cast seems so real and natural. Sam and Socks chemistry is great as well as Sam and Satans. Everything clicks. Sure there might be some continuity issues but this show isn't made to be taken all that seriously. The plot all but says it shouldn't be taken seriously. This is a great show and is quickly climbing the ladder to become one of my all-time favorite shows. hopefully it can keep up it momentum. RECOMMEND THIS SHOW TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW.

It has comedy throughout, action, drama, and could have some cool special effects down the line (if it gets picked up for a second season and has a bigger budget). I recommend people give this show a shot because it's a keeper this new Fall season. It has likable characters, a great story (whether you believe in the Devil or not), and it has all the elements to be a fantastic show. I hope America doesn't let this one slip by.

778,Reaper, The BEST New Series of 2007,"I came over to this show from The Loop - one of the best Fox shows of the Y2K era that was dumped on the public this summer and never to be seen again. That show starred Bret Harrison as Sam - the youngest exec at an airline.<br/><br/>Bret was the MAN on The Loop so of course I followed him over to Reaper where he plays another character named Sam but this one's a college dropout who works at a Home Depot clone. Sam turns 21 and suddenly he finds out that his parents has sold his soul to The Devil many, many years ago. The Devil (Ray Wise) comes to collect by making Sam become the 'devil's bounty hunter' by re-reaping souls that have escaped from Hell and now are killing people back on Earth. It's really a win-win...the devil gets his soul back and the town has less murders. Sam, however, thinks the situation ...well...SUCKS! The show is pure genius. It is set up like Smallville or Buffy where there's a 'monster of the week' to beat up but here it is always secondary to Sam just trying to live his life normally. He has two friends which are INCREDIBLE: Sock (Tyler Labine) who is the overweight, quick witted buddy that everyone prays they have in their life and Ben (Rick Gonzalez) who rounds out the trio and usually is the one who ends up getting hurt...quite hysterically. It's a show about GREAT FRIENDSHIP and this show has it...you really believe these guys are friends. The show is rounded out with super hottie Andi (Missy Peregrym) who likes Sam but isn't in 'the know' of what's up with him and is therefore blown off a lot and the BRILLIANT Ted (Donovan Stinson) who is the young arrogant jerkie boss who is more akin to be a young David Brent from the office - he wants to be cool...but he's the boss.<br/><br/>The show SHINES with Harrison and gives 'Devil' Ray Wise the biggest and best performance of his career. The man shines in every single scene he has on the show. You see him as he tries to help Sam and when he is angry that smile disappears in a moment and you truly believe that there is Satan behind Ray Wise's eyes.<br/><br/>A top notch cast, amazing scripts, great direction...I was sad to see The Loop get cancelled and now I wouldn't have it any other way.

Ben (Rick Gonzales) is not as good as the others, but still very funny.<br/><br/>The end of every episode is satisfying; I've found VERY few plot holes or flaws. The show is deep and complicated without being confusing, and every episode has several laugh-out-loud and edge-of-your-seat moments.<br/><br/>The concept of ""Reaper"" is very original, the script is flawless, the acting is phenomenal, the special effects are gorgeous, and it's the highlight of my Tuesday night.",54 out of 64 found this helpful.,10.0,15 November 2007

It is such a great change to see a new show on television that has nothing to do with ""reality"" or superheroes {even though I like one or two of them} It is refreshing to watch a show where the idea hasn't been done to death, I think the originality is one of the major things I like about this show.

782,Reaper, Funny as Hell,"The CW has really stepped up on there line-up of shows this season and this is an example. Sure, a kid who plays bounty hunter to the escapees from Hell, it doesn't sound funny. Its sounds like a... well, something deep and dark. And that's what you would expect, but don't. The show takes you out of the land of religion and plops you in sunny suburbia, with a guy who just can't get things right, and then finds out he has to work for the devil. That would suck. That's the appeal of an average college dropout battling hell with his friends at his side. That's where the real fun comes in: Sam has great friends. He has his bud Bert ""Sock"" Wysocki who is loyal and just goes with his friend's new gig. There's Ben, who is more of the brains of the outfit. And, of course, there's the girl, in this case, Andi. She works at the same Home Depot-like store with the guys and is going part-time to college. Oh, and she has no clue that Sam is in love with her. That's all pretty typical of a twenty-something TV comedy. But the fact that they throw in the Devil and his needs takes it from ""Friends"" to ""Buffy""  real life is hell. But it can be funny too.

Now don't get me wrong, i love Friends/the Simpson's/family guy/Scrubs/South park/dirty sexy money/pushing daisies/west wing etcetc<br/><br/>but nothing quite compares to the originality or catch of this, certainly it is probably the best show i have seen in years in terms of enjoyment<br/><br/>the only negative thing i can dare say about it is the fact the first series is over<br/><br/>long live reaper!<br/><br/>for those that haven't seen it, it is truly a gem to behold, for those that have and arnt obsessed with it, shame on you!<br/><br/>i love this program so much. If you have a complaint with what i've said, go ahead and complain to me, i really don't care anymore, this show is too good to miss out on or miss the chance to explain how unbelievably good it is, so all you nay-sayers do your worst, this show is near perfection and i am more than happy to admit it. I rated it 10 out of 10 on here for a good reason and i stand by that decision completely.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,4 June 2008
792,Reaper, If you aren't watching....START!,"Reaper stars Bret Harrison (Grounded for Life) as Sam who works at a Best Buy wannabe store and is afraid he'll be stuck there his whole life. He then finds out the hard way that his parents sold his soul to the devil before was even born. Now the devil wants him to pay up and hunt down demons that escape hell.<br/><br/>The result is a show that goofy fun with the cast in top form. Bret Harrison who was the geeky but hilarious b/f in Grounded for Life handles the lead role perfectly. While Missy Peregrym is adorable and hot at the same time as Sam's crush Andi who works with him and is also a good friend. Ray Wise is simply a show stealer as the devil. Tyler Labine is also great fun as Sam's bestfriend, co-woker and sidekick Bert and he gets to show his comedy talents more than he did in abc's Invasion. Rick Gonzalez is also funny as Sam's other co-worker and friend who also helps him catch demons.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on this show just because it's on the CW. It's not sappy teen drams show that wants to be Dawson's Creek. It's clever and fun and is an original comedy horror series.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,21 October 2007

794,Reaper, One of the better television show I've seen,"And I didn't even see when it was on. Found it on instant Netlix. Maybe if more people like myself had been in tune when it was on, it wouldn't have gotten canceled.<br/><br/>The cast couldn't have been more right on! It was trivial to me while I watched. It was like putting together a puzzle! Sock being the same actor who played that drunk fellow who just needed some coffee so he could drive home in Zack &amp; Miri Make A Porno was far out! ""You and your little dog!"" Sam was none other than the ill-fated Charlie from That '70s Show, who, in my opinion, kicked Randy's prettyboy behind.<br/><br/>Ray Wise scared the hell out of me in Fire Walk With Me, but as the Devil he's more like an easy going CEO who moonlights as a talk show host.<br/><br/>This show was legendary and I believe that it holds the power of fan potential to get an amazing flick sequel adapted for the big screen!

795,Reaper, Pontential dampened by formulaic structure like Chuck,"I was really looking forward to this series, it looked fun. Unfortunately the writer seems to have little imagination and the episodes are churned out within a predictable framework for quick and easy dollars: ""Guy wakes up, something is weird that gives a clue about the escaped soul, with his 3 buddies he captures it"" Fair enough he is a reaper and this is his job, however this does not mean the plot cannot deviate from the same monotonous scenes and setups - such as the development of his powers or his relationship with Andi.<br/><br/>The relationship with Andi also lacks realism and seems frustratingly infantile (like in Chuck). There are other frustrating moments too, like when he is in danger from a 'escaped soul' and seems to forget the fact that he possesses any powers at all. Why bother with the whole reaper thing when really its just 3 normal guys capturing these souls?? After every episode you get the sinking feeling that nothing has progressed and the next episode will be just like the last but with a different escaped soul.<br/><br/>Overall the series is quite fun but I cannot get over these bad points.",14 out of 27 found this helpful.,5.0,6 January 2008

It's funny, witty, romantic, with some action, and it makes you think -- and not predictable. The only thing that makes me angry about the show is that it ends on the 2nd season -- I would LOVE to start a revolt to get it back on the air!!! Especially with the way Season 2 ended, it was the best cliff hanger ever -- if you got to get to the next season.

What I'm wondering is what took them so long I mean the show was aired like in 2007 and it takes the 2 years 2 make 13 episodes. I can't wait till season 2 arrives in March, damn, it will be one of the most outrages shows in '09.

798,Reaper, Don't fear the Reaper. Seriously. Don't. Dude's not that scary...,"Despite people comparing this show to Supernatural, it actually shares very few things in common with that series. Yes, the main character is named Sam, he *does* have some powers and there are demons/supernatural things going on - but that's where the similarities end. Reaper is much more tongue-in-cheek/takes itself far less seriously/embraces the absurdity of the situation, rather than focusing on the drama aspect. That isn't to say that there aren't serious moments in the show, but when we get them, it is SO unexpected that you suddenly realise things aren't all light-hearted and there is potential for some truly dark moments/themes to be explored. The show's morbid sense of humour is one of its best assets. The creepiness catches you completely off guard.<br/><br/>Whilst the show is rather formulaic, and rarely deviates from its pretty simplistic premise, it does make attempts to try new and different things on occasion. The first few episodes are probably the slowest of the series, but around episode 5 or 6, things start to pick up and you realise that there may be more to this show than it would first have you believe. While it may not take as many risks as it probably should, it does at least come up with some twists and turns along the way. There are some unforeseen/interesting developments in Season 2 especially.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons the show works is because of its hero, Sam Oliver. Bret Harrison fits the role well and demonstrates that he's capable of balancing the humorous aspects with the more serious side of things. He a bit of a ""loser"", yes, but a likable loser nonetheless. The most important thing is that you can sympathise with him and the impossible situation he's in. Sympathy for the Devil, however? Not so much. Guy's a jerk. But an entertaining jerk (which, really, is all that matters). Ray Wise is another piece of brilliant casting, as he's able to exude menace along with that twisted sense of humour one would expect from Lucifer. He can turn on a dime, from friend to foe.<br/><br/>One of the main things that peeked my interest about this show from the start was the fact that it starred Missy Peregrym (who had been underused on Heroes). I'd longed for a show that had not only a love interest for the hero who *stayed* on the series (and wasn't booted off simply because fangirls didn't like her), but also had a truly likable relationship happening between the hero and the love interest. The Sam/Andi relationship is surprisingly refreshing in that, whilst it starts off in familiar territory (ie. he must lie, make up lame excuses and keep secrets from her), it actually gets moving after a while. It doesn't drag things out NEARLY as long as other shows do and by the end of the first season, certain things are revealed that makes for a change of pace from the usual continuous lying/keeping secrets over multiple seasons.<br/><br/>You can see why Sam falls for a girl such as Andi (she's a cool chick, and nowhere near as bland as most female love interests tend to be). Although she does get understandably ticked off at times, she never does anything to make you HATE her. Missy is, in large part, the reason for this. You can't help but like her. It's a different case with Sam's bulky buddy, Sock, however. He's the sort of character you either love or loathe (he proved to be the latter for me, after having witnessed his animal cruelty in the 'Pilot'). He's your typical annoying sidekick - complete with crude jokes, bad advice and slacker behaviour. A large portion of screen time is often wasted on his (mostly) unfunny comments. Poor Ben (Sam's other friend) is less annoying, but almost always ends up getting hurt every episode (at least he cares for animals).<br/><br/>There are other supporting characters who vary in their likability. Sam's boss at The Work Bench, Ted, is the usual type of jerk you'd expect (but is, on occasion, somewhat funny). Josie, Sock's ex, is kind of a non-entity and you wonder how on Earth she could ever fall for someone like him. Then there's Gladys, the demon at the DMV who basically exists to deliver the escaped souls that Sam has captured (with an array of bizarre and comical ""vessels"") to Hell and say, ""Place the vessel on the mat."". Much more successful are the characters of Tony and Steve (Sam's neighbours). Tony, especially, is well-portrayed by Ken Marino (from Veronica Mars). There's also the awesomely weird spawn of Satan, Cady (Jessica Stroup). She provides some nicely creepy moments (but unfortunately makes a premature exit and never returns). Her absence is more than made up for in Season 2, however, by the introduction of a demonic love interest for Ben, named Nina (played perfectly by Jenny Wade). She proves to be a great addition to the cast and provides plenty of wicked humour.<br/><br/>The show might not have the best CGI going around, but it gets by. You can't really criticise it for the somewhat dodgy effects, considering the type of show it is. What matters is that, with its cast of bizarre/funny characters, its ludicrous ""vessel"" props, and - at times - dark humour, the show avoids being overly convoluted (as so many other shows are getting these days), offering us something that's easy to get into. The second and final season shows what great potential the show had. It's a shame the series was cancelled. While the final episode does feel a tad rushed and things are left open-ended/unanswered, it's at the same time oddly satisfying as well. This series is definitely worth a look.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,21 September 2008
799,Arthdal Chronicles, One of the best,"When you think of a Korean drama, you'd think of a modern love story in which characters are drawn closer in the face of conflict. This production is a daring, and likely expensive, leap into uniqueness that goes far beyond the typical romance. The vibes felt in Avatar, Narnia, and Harry Potter films are also felt throughout the episodes that make this show a cinematic experience you'd never wish would end.
The reviews don't do justice to this beautifully put together show; I had expected at least a 9/10 if not higher.<br/><br/>Some critiques argue that the lengthy episodes make the story progression rather slow. However, any great tale that keeps us on our toes are those that invest time to connect with the characters (this may be why original novels tend to be superior to their movie counterparts). Critical comparisons made with Game of Thrones may as well be beyond my understanding; this drama holds its own essence.
Irking our curiosities of primitive life and a plot that pulls on your heartstrings. The actors and entire production crew couldn't have done a better job. This show is more than about romance; its about friendship, commitment, respecting mother nature (yes, like in Avatar), and believing in yourself. I highly suggest you finish all your errands before watching the first, 1.3 hr episode. Believe me, you'll find yourself clicking to the next.",59 out of 61 found this helpful.,10.0,7 August 2019

The more episodes i watched the more i did not want it to end and the closer i got to the last episode the more i was dreading the end was coming and now it's finished i can not stop thinking about it especially with the way it ends you got to be sure there's plans for another season. I have been recommending this show to anyone and everyone i know and have not done that since the early days of GoT. Speaking of GoT, saying it's a copycat could not be further from the truth, Arthdal Chronicles is unique and while watching it not once did GoT cross my mind.

801,Arthdal Chronicles, Definitely not a copy of GOT,"I found out and became interested in this series after I stumbled upon an article accusing this series to be a Korean GOT copycat. I watch it in Netflix. The first episode is kinda convoluted. Viewers were thrown into the midst without any guide or explanation to the background behind the setting of the story. This probably contributed to it's low rating.<br/><br/>But as the season goes on, the story line become apparent and it starting to become interesting. The article cited the props and clothing as the indication that Arthdal Chronicles is a copy of GOT. But this like saying that Brooklyn Nine Nine is a copy of Law and Order because they both have guns and Police uniform. Nothing can be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Unlike high medieval settings of the GOT, Arthdal Chronicles was set during the early bronze age and the time when human race starting to emerge from a tribal society into an early form of nation state.

Instead of the feeling like these people are only there to do their job.
The CIG is acceptable, this is not a hollywood production so I am impressed with how much they can get out of the budget. And the sets are also done well, and with story and lore behind them too.

I've watched the 12 episodes available so far. The characters evolve, they are not cardboard cutouts that remain static. The beautiful world is progressively both viscerally and intellectually challenging for those characters, and the viewer follows that progression along with the characters.

In fact, Martin admitted as much.<br/><br/>Arthdal Chronicles is loosely based on Korean mythology regarding the First City called Ah-sa-dal. The names mentioned within the shows are loose derivations of characters in the mythology. This is just a fantacy twist of how Korean Historical dramas usually go.

812,Arthdal Chronicles, Great Fantasy Drama,"There are fantasy shows that have everything that makes fantasy great, and there are many that try and fail. Game of Thrones is one that succeeded. Arthdal Chronicles is another. So they have something in common. And no matter which fantasy show you take, you will probably find some king sitting on a throne and some women in pretty dresses, swords and castles. Game of Thrones was based on the scandinavian Edda, an old myth. A lot of fantasies are based on old myths, its what makes them so interesting - they remind us of fairytales we heard in childhood. And at the same time, if they are great, they are unique. Arthdal Chronicles has created something beautifully different from what we have seen before. It is creative, imaginative, captivating. The series started a little slow, but quickly found its pace. It has great actors, who very clearly do their best to bring their roles alive. It is not an American production, so sometimes the characters don't act like you would expect them to. I consider this a good thing.

813,Arthdal Chronicles," Before history, there was myths and legends.","Among the vast and rich human resources, we have one that allows us to learn and improve: the art of storytelling.
Before the times of documentation of history, were the stories about knights, warriors and their exploits that gave us the possibility to believe, grow and create. Entire civilizations were armed according to their needs, the majority based on beliefs, superstitions and myths.
And between reality and legend there is always fantasy extolling every feat. The epic and the glory encouraging us to be brave. Punishment or redemption marking the path to good or evil.
That's what this series is about. Comparable to others because it also represents various epic fantasies. But unique in its class because in the process each story, each villain and each hero possess the original and unique voice of the narrator.

Among all the ugliness, even the smallest pleasant act or scene can mean a lot; when our tiny hopes for a positive resolution are fulfilled, we appreciate it all the more. <br/><br/>The acting and cinematography are great. The interactions are realistic and the viewer understands each character. Every scene seems important and keeping focus is rewarding. Not knowing what to believe, whom to trust and what the motivations are, is a necessary part of such a show, however what subtle hints we do get are delivered very well. <br/><br/>I don't want to praise this show prematurely, considering we have only seen one episode, however if it keeps up the twists, plots and great characters, I am sure it will be a success. <br/><br/>Considering the amount of people who feel the irresistible need to tell others their views on religion, I suppose a lot of viewers will express strong opinions about the themes of this show. I hope others will not be dissuaded by those opinions. This is a clever show, definitely not aimed at advertising anyone's beliefs or conversely, offending anyone else's.",64 out of 88 found this helpful.,8.0,30 August 2014
828,Hand of God," Smart, Well-Acted and Complex. Watch it.","I loved this pilot and anxiously await the next installment. I really appreciated having to think and pay attention, I thought the acting was top notch across the board (the most I've ever liked Dana Delaney or Ron Perlman) and the plot was intriguing and leaves this one with a lot of places to go. I felt for a father trying (and failing) to cope with the loss of his son. We see a man who has done bad things trying to change (and it will be a slow process) and STILL making mistakes. The sense of doom as Pernell and KD hurtle down a path the audience knows they shouldn't take, and then the twist at the end leaves you saying ""Now what?!"" <br/><br/>I think it is interesting that most of the one-star ratings reviews I read complain about one of two things: 1) It's too pro-Christian or 2) It's too anti-Christian. Which is it? Maybe it's not so clear cut as that. At no point did I feel like this was supposed to be a champion of either camp. It's just the frame for this particular story. Flawed people grasping at any reason they can find to justify their actions. This didn't change any view I already have about Christianity or religion in general. <br/><br/>There are plenty of unlikable people here (as in every good story) but plenty, also, who I am rooting for as well. They don't go about things the way I would--but I already know how THAT story plays out. I want to have an experience far from my own and far from the expected. <br/><br/>It's not for everyone--nothing I seem to really enjoy is. Deadwood, No Country For Old Men, Breaking Bad, Assassination of Jesse James, Chopper, Animal Kingdom. This series has a lot of potential and I hope Amazon gives it the chance to grow and expand on what is an excellent beginning. <br/><br/>Enjoy.",51 out of 73 found this helpful.,,30 August 2014

I absolutely love her character, because I feel its true to who she is in real life. Fantastic show! If I could give it more than 10 stars, I would. I literally sob every time Ron Perlman cries.

With no real evidence to go on, Pernell begins to rely on ""visions"" and ""messages"" he believes are being sent by God through Pernell's ventilator-bound son. <br/><br/>It starts good and its premise is very original.

833,Hand of God, Excellent pilot episode. Promising.,"This is by far the best pilot that Amazon has produced so far. It immediately draws you in and makes you feel what the characters are about. It is gritty, well written, and has a solid lead actor in Ron Pearlman. His performance is very grounded and natural. One of the best of his career in my opinion. The show explores pretty powerful themes and judging from the pilot, It does so in a way that is interesting and thought provoking. It is paced well and at the end of the pilot, It leaves you wanting more. Amazon needs to green light this to series and get it going as soon as possible.

836,Hand of God, An actual season review and not just the pilot.,"The show starts off with an interesting concept and builds up many questions that we hope will be answered in throughout the season. Whilst you cannot fault the acting in the show, the overall storyline unfortunately becomes somewhat convoluted with a few curve balls seemingly chucked in for the sake of prolonging the storyline. Not to mention a few unnecessary side stories.<br/><br/>My major complaint is that the hand of God becomes much less prominent as the show goes on, it would have been nice to push this further with the protagonist. It seems more that the idea was used to draw viewers in and then once you're in they switched it to more of a general detective show. Don't be afraid to push religious boundaries and taboos guys, this could still become a great show if you do.<br/><br/>Overall I'm say this premiere season has been decent but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't bother with season 2 if the quality stays the same, but with a few tweaks and polishes I may be drawn back; so watch this space.",31 out of 53 found this helpful.,6.0,7 September 2015

838,Hand of God, Great acting. Interesting premise.,Every episode from this season I felt like I had to watch the next one to see what happens and they don't do it in a teasing you and not answering any questions kind of way. Ron Perlman is simply a fantastic actor and he does a great job here with his character. There's not much of a happy go lucky funny TV show going on here it's dealing with some serious issues of Pernell trying to save his son PJ by doing things that he believes god wants him to do and wondering if it's really god or if he is delusional. Pernell is a judge that has a lot of influence and others are trying to use that influence to get things done but while he is on this quest he becomes hard to control because that is his main focus is on saving his son and everyone trying to control him while he tries to solve mysteries about his son and they are trying to get what they need done and the two conflict. Im really not sure what they are going to do in season 2 but hopefully they can come up with something interesting. If anything Ron Perlman I'm sure will give a fantastic performance.,6 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,8 May 2016
839,Hand of God, Stroke of Genius!,"Absolutely brilliant series! Really original story with lots of twists and turns, and excellent characters who aren't straightforward 'goodies' or 'baddies'.<br/><br/>If you are considering watching it, I would suggest avoiding reading too much about the plot or story. I watched it with minimal info, and heartily enjoyed watching the story and characters unfold in front of me, changing my mind about the characters and my theories about the story as I went! As a show centering around suspected 'messages from God', it would have been so easy for the plot to descend into silliness or clichés, the characters to be cheesy and the actors hammy. But none of that here! The story is rich and a bit dark, the characters well layered and acting very good - Ron Perlman is fantastic and very believable! As the 1st season could have been left as a stand-alone season, I am thrilled season 2 has been announced. I look forward into uncovering more secrets and lies!

844,Hand of God, A New Favorite,"Full disclosure, I am not a religious person. In fact I am strongly anti-religion. That being said, I love this first episode of this series! It truly strikes a cord with me as I would love it if there truly was a just and noble God out there using people to mete out justice. And that is the premise of this series.<br/><br/>Right up until the end of the episode you are left wondering if this guy is insane or truly being told to deal justice in the name of god. And it is a truly satisfying yet tragic revelation at the end as the path is set for this story to unfold. Garrett Dillahunt is such an underrated actor and I think he has finally found the roll that may give him the recognition he deserves. Ron Perlman is always great. <br/><br/>I am sure this series is inspired by the excellent 2001 movie Frailty with Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey. It had the same theme and the protagonist in that film was dubbed The Hand of God killer.<br/><br/>I have really high hopes for this series to last a good long time.

It will be interesting to see where the writers take this show and how directly involved Pernell gets with meting out the justice or if he utilizes Solomons henchmen.<br/><br/>Again, he performed great in this episode and I cannot wait until the next episode comes out. <br/><br/>I anticipating that the Mayor will be his biggest antagonist in the end.",16 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,29 August 2014

849,The Lost World," Cheesy, at Times, But an Exciting, Guilty Pleasure!","It is easy, perhaps TOO easy, to heap abuse on this series, very loosely adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fantasy novel. Certainly, Doyle would not have recognized much of it; then again, would he have recognized a majority of the 'Sherlock Holmes' features over the years? And what would he have made of Steven Spielberg's ""borrowing"" his title for the second ""Jurassic Park"" film? Ultimately, any production's success or failure shouldn't be judged solely by the fidelity to the original work, but whether or not audiences accept it. Many marvelous adaptations, from the theatrical WAR OF THE WORLDS to television's ""The Third Man"" have carried over little of the original source material, but have won a place in our hearts, nonetheless.<br/><br/>And this New Line-produced series, filmed in Australia, even at it's most absurd, was always an enjoyable thrill ride, with a very ingratiating cast!<br/><br/>A spin off of a 1998 TV-movie, the series follows the adventures of an early 20th century party of explorers, stranded on a mysterious plateau in South America where multi-dimensional 'rifts' have allowed animals and cultures from past and future to co-exist. Led by brilliant Professor George Challenger (the wonderful Peter McCauley), a bearded, wild-haired scientist who thrives on facing the unknown, the party consists of handsome big game hunter Lord John Roxton (Australian actor/model Will Snow), mysterious benefactress Marguerite Krux (beautiful Australian actress Rachel Blakely), American journalist Ned Malone (Canadian actor David Orth), and elderly scientist, Professor Arthur Summerlee (Michael Sinelnikoff, whose character would 'die' by season's end). The TV-movie introduced a new character to the mix, blond 'native girl', Veronica, whose scientist parents had disappeared eleven years earlier. Portrayed by ""Beverly Hills 90210"" alumni Jennifer O'Dell, the voluptuous 'savage', scantily dressed, raised the level of sex appeal for the program immediately, and quickly became a fan favorite.<br/><br/>Working out of Veronica's huge tree house (a split-level that Tarzan would have been envious of), the characters would, each week, encounter everything from dinosaurs (created through CGI, and, while not quite 'realistic', still vastly superior to the stop-motion models, puppets, or rear-screen projected lizards of previous ""Lost World"" adaptations), to sophisticated cultures practicing human sacrifice, to demons and wizards, to nearly any kind of bizarre civilization one might imagine. Glimpses of each character's past allowed the cast to 'grow', and become more interesting, each season, and provided enjoyable subplots; Lord Roxton falls in love with the greedy, but lovely Marguerite, but her past includes espionage and other unsavory activities, so she only gradually accepts his advances; Veronica, drawn to Ned, must deal with his moodiness (WWI had left him emotionally fragile) and his sense of wanderlust. It is a tribute to the writers and talented cast that the subplots never sank into mini-soap operas!<br/><br/>Australian tax laws nearly sabotaged the series' third season; Canadian Orth and American O'Dell were forced to limit their appearances because of their being non-Australians. So Ned Malone was often away on a 'identity-crisis'-fueled quest, and Veronica, whisked away by a runaway balloon, returned later in the season with a pendant her mother had left for her with a distant tribe, and new responsibilities as 'Protector' of the plateau. A new character was introduced, a wise-cracking girl named Finn, from a hundred years in the future, who was transported back to the plateau by a Challenger invention. Portrayed by 24-year old Australian actress Lara Cox, she was a survivor of a radiation-poisoned Earth, and was quickly 'adopted' by the scientist, who made it his mission to prevent her future world from happening.<br/><br/>Despite very respectable ratings, ""The Lost World"" was canceled after the third season (with a cliffhanger ending to end ALL cliffhanger endings!), because of spiraling production costs. The cast and crew have remained loyal to the series since cancellation, however, and there is still a slight, if dwindling, hope that the show may reappear, either in series format, or as TV-movies. <br/><br/>""The Lost World"" may never please Doyle 'purists', but it was certainly a most enjoyable 'guilty pleasure'. I join with it's many other fans in hoping it will return!",52 out of 58 found this helpful.,,10 February 2004

Everyone was energetic in their roles, and it really drew me in and made me feel a part of their ""family"".  The action was usually a bit on the silly side, though always entertaining.  It struck a nice balance there.  The special effects were good for a TV show, though still not too realistic, which added to the wonderful cheesiness of it.  The writing was always creative.  They would take just about any idea that popped into their heads and make an episode out of it, meaning that it never got bogged down in a handful of similar plots like so many other action/adventure shows.  The fact that it never took itself very seriously was key to its charm. <br/><br/>

Not only is the Challenger Expedition fighting the elements, strange occurrences and the general dangers of the world surrounding them but they are also learning, as the months pass, to live with one another and become a family.<br/><br/>
Wonderful friendships and romances have developed over the last few years that are very appealing to both young and old alike.<br/><br/>Kudos to all cast members: Peter McCauly (Professor Challenger), Rachel Blakely (Marguerite Krux - a character not in the book but mysterious and lovely -- a favorite!), William Snow (Lord John Roxton), Jennifer O'Dell (Veronica - Another new character but a welcome addition), David Orth (Edward ""Ned"" Malone), Michael Sinelnikoff (Professor Summerlee - Season One) and Lara Cox (Finn- a young woman from our world's potential future - New character in season 3).<br/><br/>Sit back, watch a few episodes -- and become enthralled.

The show is a cross between Indiana Jones, Earth 2 and any show where the characters are trying to find a way home(too many to list).

856,The Lost World, This one has taken me back at TV!,"What else can i say? This show RULES! excellent, delightfully campy (in the best way) has the powerful, nostalgic sense of some good old (and underrated) series like the ""Tales of Golden Monkey"", ""Adventure Island""... films like ""The Man of Bronze"" or these Kevin Connor's camp adventure classics like ""Warlords of Atlantis"" (all of them as ""the missing link"" between the old Republic Serials and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). I've been wondering myself why these TV guys have forgotten how to do a good, enjoyable TV show á la old fashion style and the answer came to me as this wonderful piece of fantasy.<br/><br/>All on this show works with the accuracy of a clock, the main characters, the story, the locations. Even each time, over and over again, when i see the powerful main titles it turns me on like the most childish kid (the images... the amazing and far over the average ""heroic"" score). The following has all which anyone could ask for: lots of adventure, beautiful and wild babes, really bad guys and terrible monsters (well, still a bit cheesy but... who cares? ""Valley of Gwangi"" is, even today, a hell of entertaining despite the Harryhausen's ancient models).<br/><br/>Beyond the fact they grabbed only the name of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's to make their very own gem, this TV show has a strong spirit as i haven't seen since much time ago, and i'm seriously considering into my all-time classics (sharing honors with Twilight Zone, Miami Vice or Airwolf). Many people could think i'm exaggerating a little, but i fell this one has something else than many other (may be much more successful), but cold and empty programs, and i'm not talking only to the people who think Simon Wincer's ""The Phantom"" was a misunderstood good movie.<br/><br/>My only wish is to know if they going to release the seasons on DVD.

860,The Lost World, It's Not THAT Bad,"I was lucky enough to discover this series during a repeat episode from its third season. The writing was immensely improved in the second and third seasons compared to the sluggish, corny, and mostly humorless first one. The banter between the characters is much more natural in the later two seasons and O'Dell's acting improves dramatically - seriously, it's an instant improvement between the last episode of S1 and the first of S2. But by the time I finished watching the third season repeats, I didn't care either way. I now watch the first season with as much enjoyment as the others because the characters are so endearing. If you judged the series by an episode you saw from the first season, give it another shot with a later season's episode before throwing in the towel for good.<br/><br/>It's not for everyone but for sci-fi lovers like me who are willing to suspend reality in order to become immersed in a good story, it's quite enjoyable. Who cares if they fire too many bullets in a world where gunpowder is in short supply? Who cares if the dinosaurs look fake? Who cares if the land seems too vast for the amount of literal space it might take up geographically? It's a mystical plateau... with dinosaurs. I think you've pretty much steamrolled over the confines of reality right there. And, as a side note, if I saw a dinosaur coming at me, you can bet your a** I'd fire as many bullets as humanly possible - to hell with the rations. <br/><br/>Relax, free your over-analytical mind and enjoy the fun.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,31 August 2018
861,The Lost World, Excellent action/adventure series with great characters,"The Lost World is an excellent action/adventure series inspired by the Conan Doyle book of the same name.  Unlike the book, the characters here are trapped in the Lost World and struggle weekly against hostile creatures, inhabitants, and against the mysterious force which created the Lost World.<br/><br/>The show, however, is much more than a simple run of the mill science fiction series, although it works quite well that way as well.  The characters are complex, well rounded and interesting.  Sometimes they struggle with their relationships with each other as much as with their environment.  The growing romance, despite the obstacles presented by their vastly different and emotionally scarring backgrounds, between the Roxton and Marguerite characters has become a centerpiece of the show.  The character of Challenger, so brutish and one dimensional in the book, has grown and changed over over the course of the series into a fully developed and interesting character while still maintaining his core focus and scientific genius.  The addition of the character of Veronica Layton as the explorer's guide and host on the Lost World was an inspired addition. Veronica brings a humanity and nurturing presence and provides the emotional glue that hold the group together.<br/><br/>Altogether, The Lost World is a unique and compelling show which is well worth your time.  Only the most superficial of reviews would dismiss this show as nothing more than another science fiction show.  The show offers something for everyone and I highly recommend it.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,,1 June 2003

Having been a viewer of Neighbours some time ago, Rachel Blakely was instantly recognisable and being joined by other cast members such as Alan Dale and Laura Vazquez, it made me feel it was going to be worth watching. I was right. From start to finish this has been a 'must watch' program. I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite programs ever.

863,The Lost World," So Cheesy, It's Great...","I use to watch this show in the morning -- back when it was airing in syndication -- and it was just a great time. The acting is okay here and there, but most of the times it's really hammy. The special effects in the first season are laughable, while the later episodes tend to use the same CG templates over and over again. The stories only go linear near the season finales and premieres, otherwise, the typical episode is danger-predicament-next time on... etc. The writing is okay, though is probably the helping hand that makes it so ridiculously fun to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lost World (TV series) is a good show to watch when you're waking up, and can get engaging when the story follows a linear time line. It's sad that that production had to close due to costs, leaving us with unanswered questions, which would be nice of the studios to give the fans a bit of closure.

866,The Lost World, I Love Krux,"I started watching this show in its second season, not expecting much, but intrigued by an episode called ""Stone Cold"". The characters were possessed by some really reprehensible men and women from centuries before. The episode had an Edgar Allan Poe feel to it that I liked very much.<br/><br/>
I found myself mostly intrigued by the character of Marguerite, an heiress, and not just because her blouse was missing buttons in strategic places. The actress playing her was stunning, with wide moody eyes and terrific hair, and she seemed to have a wonderful handle on the part she was playing.<br/><br/>
Later, as I continued with The Lost World, I also became interested in the others, Professor Challenger, Malone and John Roxton, the hunter. Oh, and also Veronica, the jungle woman. they all touched something in me.<br/><br/>I know this is basically an action adventure show but when the characters can touch me more than the dinosaurs and action elements then I know we have a winner.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to learn The Lost World had been discontinued because it was one of the few shows I watched on a regular basis. Recently, I've heard it may return. I sincerely hope this is true. three years is not long enough for such a fine production.<br/><br/>Thank you.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,,13 March 2004

872,The Lost World, What a shame,"It is indeed a shame that the excellent and pioneering Willis O'Brien film of the Conan Doyle masterpiece is not being granted the decent big-budget re-make it so rightly deserves.  Instead we have, in recent years, been lumbered with a lot of tacky, vacuous, half-hearted re-makes.  This TV series has nothing to do with the Conan Doyle story ""The Lost World"".  The name is merely used as a blanket title to attract viewers to what is a completely unremarkable series, little more than an excuse to show uninteresting and woefully cliched 'butt-kicking babes' saving pathetic, inadequate men from computer game sprites.  The storylines are slow and tedious, Challenger is feeble, nothing like the fiery character he was in the novel or the 1925 film, the natives are just laughable, and the dinosaur sequences are leaden and unexciting.  The Lost World?  Conan Doyle would be ashamed to have his name associated with such bottom-of-the-barrel tosh as this, and O'Brien would wonder what special effects have come to.",14 out of 34 found this helpful.,,1 June 2001

889,Jett, One season just isn't enough. Carla Gugino as JETT makes for insanely good TV.,"JETT is outstanding. As is Carla Gugino's performance. I commend Sebastian Gutierrez on creating a captivating, pulpy noir piece. The complex character relationships, snappy dialogue and unexpected plotting only deepen a series that, on first viewing, may appear nothing more than a slick and mildly diverting vanity project. It's FAR more than that.<br/><br/>Remove potential external distractions, dim the lights a little, pour yourself a large glass of red and put your troubles on hold for nine hours. A wandering mind may give up during the first episode and it's probably not a good idea to watch when tired (a mistake I made on first viewing). There's plenty of backstory, a non linear narrative and a handful of (seemingly) minor and (seemingly) inconsequential characters to indulge in that will really demand full attention for max enjoyment. You'll have more fun with JETT if you go in deep and let it surprise you. It's so worth your time.<br/><br/>Cinemax would be crazy not to renew it for a second series. It currently holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yes, I realise viewing figures are most important since nobody is going to renew a show that isn't making money. However, I find it a travesty when TV networks green light so much inane, procedural content for the casual viewer that will run for six or seven seasons with weighty marketing behind it and then unceremoniously cancel brilliant and inventive shows like Counterpart on the Starz network (which nobody heard about) or The OA on Netflix.

The main characters are all charming and lovable, the plot is enticing, and the humor is surprisingly fun for adults as well as kids. There has been a trend of brilliant kids cartoons like Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, and Adventure Time reversing the otherwise downward trend kids TV programs face. There seems to be a great disparity between kids shows these days, in that they're all either mindless cash grabs by network producers, or they're completely brilliant and absolutely amazing for kids and adults alike. Star Vs the Forces of Evil certainly falls into the ladder. It actually took long exposure to heavy praise of the show to get me to finally buckle down and watch it. Half way into season 1, I was hooked. Though the traits that make it a kids program are often glaring, the characters are so well-written that it becomes difficult not to love them. Once the plot falls into motion, it's impossible to stop watching. Having watched up to the most recent episode as of posting this, it's impossible for me to give this show any less than a 10.

The storyboard artists of the show also do a fantastic job of mashing it together to create a unique take on being a zany cartoon, each episode featuring fluid animation and a fast-paced 12 minute format. While Adventure Time pays homage to fantasy RPGs and Gravity Falls to fans of paranormal mystery, SVTFOE is like a western love letter to the mahou shoujo subgenre of anime. Though the ""star"" of this new Disney show is a magical girl, it seems to defy being pigeon-holed to any target demographic much like SU",31 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,30 March 2015

The last episode when you think Marco and Star will never see each other again was unexpected but the ending was a even more shock! Both worlds colliding would have never crossed my mind, but I got the serious chills after that.

909,Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Disney continues its streak of quality cartoons,"""Star vs Evil"" comes after two tough acts to follow in ""Phineas &amp; Ferb"" and ""Gravity Falls"", both being generally acclaimed and quite successful. Despite having such high standards to live up to, ""Star vs Evil"" manages to meet expectations with beautiful animation and well done humor. Not only does the show provide a strong female lead that is also likable (something Disney has lacked since the end of Kim Possible), it also doesn't fall into the played out superhero trope of the main character having to hide their powers. Overall I'd say this is one of Disney's best new shows - providing some of the best animation on TV, very likable characters, and interesting plots that don't go into the over the top tryhard zany zone that so many cartoons suffer from.",27 out of 41 found this helpful.,9.0,8 May 2015
910,Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Awesome show,"When I saw a trailer for this in 2015, I was thinking: ""Oh, just another Disney princess. I won't be watching this.""

913,Star vs. the Forces of Evil, I highly recommend this cartoon.,"I only took up this cartoon recently, but now that I've seen it, I honestly think Star vs. the Forces of Evil is the most underrated cartoon Disney has ever released. It has an amazing cast of characters, a great balance between lighthearted and serious moments, and the longer the plot goes on, the better it gets. Since the show changed drastically over its lifespan, I feel it appropriate to review each season.<br/><br/>Season 1: 8/10-When I watched the first season, I was in love almost immediately. Technically, the plot isn't that present in this season, being more episodic than having episodes build on each other, but I was so enthralled by the lovable characters the show had to offer that I didn't even care. Even then, the plot they did have-both in isolated episodes and overall-was really good. If you're looking for a fun time, this season will provide it.<br/><br/>Season 2: 9/10-This is when the show starts transitioning towards plot focus. For the most part, it retains its episodic format, but the connections between episodes become stronger as it goes on. It also sets the stage for many of the events in the upcoming seasons, so this season is essential to anyone who wants to tackle the whole series.<br/><br/>Season 3: 9.5/10-This may be a controversial decision, but to me, this was the greatest season of the show. It was here that the plot was at its most powerful. Granted, there was a bit of a lull after the Battle of Mewni, but once the plot picks up momentum, it becomes one of the most captivating parts of this show. I'll admit that I didn't like a few of the things the characters did, but those can easily be accepted as mistakes. And even with those mistakes, I still enjoyed each and every one of them. Personally, I love this season, and I recommend it even more than I recommend the other seasons.<br/><br/>Season 4: 7.5/10-I'd be lying if I didn't say this was the weakest season. It wasn't necessarily bad: they just didn't do as much with it as they could have, and I wasn't a big fan of its finale. But what they did give us in this season was sill mostly well done-maybe a bit slow paced at times, but the payoff is generally worth it.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this show. Was it perfect? No. Is it still worth watching? Absolutely.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,23 December 2019

916,Star vs. the Forces of Evil," Bad first half of season 1, but fantastic after that","The first couple episodes are mediocre as the writers tried to go a bit too over the top with zaniness and thrill, but by the 3rd of 4th episode the show levels itself (still zany but toned down) and becomes a very enjoyable show to watch that is fun for both kids, teens and adults.

917,Star vs. the Forces of Evil, A promising show to watch.,"At first when I heard about Star vs The Forces of Evil, my original reaction was that it was going to be one of ""those"" kinds of shows that would just be childish and stupid. When I started watching it, I did like the animation and I gradually started liking the art style. The content seemed alright and the characters gave off what kind of people they were...but as you continue watching, it becomes a lot more than just some silly show.<br/><br/>What really hooked me were the last few episodes of the final seasons, where things took a rather dark tone and an actual story was being made. Characters begin to develop and become ultimately likable. Even today, it's still a show that has its childish gimmicks, but it helps balance that out with episodes taking a serious tone and actual story progression.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not the best show, but it is definitely one to get invested in if you are interested.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,28 September 2016
918,Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Hands down my personal favorite,"I'm going to say this clearly: I LOVE THIS SHOW. At first it was a fun show where I could just tune in and get some quick entertainment out of, but as we approached the Season 1 finale, I found myself getting more and more invested in it. Sure, the series isn't perfect, but it more than pays off with its characters and the heart put into it. You can tell the creators really had fun making this series. Although there are some story elements that could have been better, the show more than makes up for it with extremely likable characters and a fun premise to follow along. I would recommend people check it out because the entertainment value is high with this one. On the surface, it's a fun little story about the adventures of two teenagers (who have great chemistry together by the way), but as we ""dip down"" (wink wink), we see that the show is slowly building toward something bigger and grander. Some people may find this buildup a little slow, but I'd say that the best way to watch this show is to just tag along and don't worry too much about the deeper elements. (I really wished this was a show I had growing up, but thankfully I still retain some of my youthful innocence while also understanding some of the more mature topics.) I can't wait to see what the show has in store for us.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,25 September 2016

With a cleverly original coming of age story, amazing colorful animation, strong well developed characters, and a strong message of family, maturity, and being one of few animated shows where one of its main themes is being WOKE.

923,Raised by Wolves, Entertaining depiction of the Black Country,"I have just watched 'Raised by Wolves' for the first time; I had been avoiding it as, coming from the Black Country myself, I was worried about how 'we' would be portrayed. However I have to say that Della in particular cracked me up - she is so typically Black Country. The accent, the language, the self-mocking - all very typical for the area.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that it was filmed in Manchester, as Wolverhampton has a decidedly different feel and character to the towns shown on the series. You do see some shots of the city - for example Banks's Brewery, the Molineux and the ring road. <br/><br/>It is well worth watching as an enjoyable and, if I'm honest, very good depiction of how folks from the Black Country tend to think.",27 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,29 February 2016

It's not only the working class actors getting muscled out, but the shows about working class families as well. ""Raised by Wolves,"" is one of the smartest and bravest TV shows I have ever watched. Caitlin and Caroline Moran's brilliant scripts maintain lightening fast verbal and visual jokes. From their first episode about a middle sister's first period, which The Herald labeled a ""bloody mess""--those bloody buffoons missed the bloody jokes--to their kick ass mother played by Rebekah Staton. What I truly love about this series (that could never be shown in the puritanical US) is that the Moran sisters wrote honestly and brutally about how girls grow up and out: embarrassing bra and underwear fittings; even more embarrassing feminine hygiene products' awkward and horrifying sexuality; hormones; poverty; boys, boys, men, boys; and the utter embarrassment a teen feels about those you are related to.

927,Raised by Wolves, This is a funny show but...,"My wife and I loved this show and it is great. However--several things will put off American viewers. 1). The accents are a bit thick and to the untrained ear the wonderful dialog is a bit hard to follow. We spent 3 years in GB but still had trouble. 2) There were really funny Britishisms/references but if you aren't plugged in they slip right by. 3). The patter is quick and crisp but if you have trouble with the above items then you must have the closed captions on. So sad that it only lasted these few episodes as it is Sooooo funny. Our first six months in Britain we would watch a TV comedy with friends. We'd be at a loss while they were doubled up. After that, when we were with newly arrived the roles were reversed.

Consequently, while the financial challenges of such a household are hugely reminiscent, I realised all too soon that the extremely cavalier social, economic and moral stance (especially in the adult 'mentors' God help us) was more one at which I could only cringe with rolling eyes and a shaking head.

Having been a fan of Degrassi TNG since season 1 I actually had low hopes for the 'remix'. Let's face it;the franchise has been in decline since season 6 or 7. However that didn't keep me from watching from time to time.<br/><br/>To begin, I actually really like the updated theme song and overall look and feel of the show. I'm not sure where Linda Shuler (sp) &amp; co. got the cash infusion, but even the lighting is better. I also love the increased attention to tech. Being a tech writer, I can appreciate their efforts. I know kids don't necessarily speak in Instagram or ""facerange"" speak, yet it's a sort of inside joke to us techies.<br/><br/>The issues are typically Degrassi 'ish'. Let's face it, the show has always bordered on preachy-corny, occasionally hitting the mark, but for some reason, like a well worn comfortable shoe, we always come back.<br/><br/>I'm hoping Degrassi can find a new niche and audience in Netflix, its rare for a series to ever get to 15 seasons.

Parents with issues who are dealing with real things other than their children being crazy all the time. They just feel like the people who show up when bad things happen rather than the way it use to be with Spike and the adults. I loved having the adult story lines because it made it more real with their interactions with the kids. The care they had for the kids was more in depth than just being their as a comforter.

I have a fond memories of growing up as a preteen and teenage girl waiting for each episode to come out screaming, laughing and crying online with my friends with what each character said or did. <br/><br/>So In 2015 when I heard that the Degrassi series was going to be canceled on Teennick I was devastated; I had not watched the series in years, but it forever made a mark on me growing up. It was a guide of what to do and not to do while in JHS and/or HS. Later on it was said online what the new series of Degrassi( Next Class) was soon to be on Netflix and Canadian Television. Excited I patiently waited the day of which I was able to watch it. I called some old friends over and we binged the whole season. And... It was horrible.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed was the horrible opening song, with some weird remixing(?) type of new intro with pseudo snap chat and Instagram pictures and videos. And we dove right into the content, while I had to say I hated most of the characters because they were not developed correctly, whatever problems these characters went through we all laughed because we didn't care or feel for any for them. And then we have the classic: Gay guy, confused guy/girl, emo chick that's hiding a secret, on-off couple, unstable characters etc.<br/><br/>But what bothered me and really ticked me off was there portrayals of ""social issues."" In the first and second season; they used buzz words, talked about issues that HSers do not even talk about. Seriously when you were in HS did anyone really join ""feminist club"" and tried to screw over everything you liked for no reason? <br/><br/>I am not one to have issues when talking about racism,racial equality, sexism , LGBT rights and etc. And I even try speak about women's rights in the west and east, but they were ridiculous. When you try to do these things: <br/><br/>DO IT RIGHT!<br/><br/>Let me give you a few examples: -Maya calls out a heckler at a bar and he called her a B, but that's what hecklers do they heckle and if you're a performer you have to learn to deal with that. But she calls him a sexist pig as she breaks his phone.<br/><br/><ul><li>The feminist rally to get the EQUAL bathrooms of 6 for boys and girl in 7 for girls and 5 for boys. They complain that the girls bathrooms are always crowded. I agreed with this until my friend said, ""of course they are; girls usually fix their makeup in there, bring friends that don't need to go, have periods and do more things in there than boys do."" What BS, they end up rallying and shame all the guys that want to keep the bathrooms equal</li></ul><br/><br/>-They shame a white girl who is on the volley ball team who accidentally drew a black member of a rival team as a monkey and that girl who did acted like it was nothing. They then say she did it because she has white privilege and doesn't know anything about racism and she is a racist.<br/><br/>*HOWEVER, the writers of this stupid show could have used that episode to show that the girl was privileged not because she was white but because her parents and rich and have influence. But, no you're white and you did that it doesn't matter if it was an accident, you're still a racist.<br/><br/><ul><li>They have a protest for a black kid who was wrongfully suspended( which was right, he was some guy body slammed him and he defended himself) But they focus that said volleyball player got no time for being racism of which they didn't tell anyone! NO ONE WENT TO THE PRINCIPLE OR TEACHER OR TELL THEIR PARENTS?!</li></ul><br/><br/>-The characters get super easily offended, a police officer says that they should muzzle their friend, she is Hispanic in return that doesn't mean he's saying for them to shut-up, but he is calling her a dog. (Yes words don't mean words) A teacher says man power and a student says he was sexist. Misunderstandings are racist,sexist and homophobic. And even if you get everything right about a culture down to the T if you wear tradition clothing of speak the language you're so insensitive and horrible.<br/><br/>Just watch the 2 seasons, I got so mad half way the 2nd I stopped watching. This isn't HS, at most they are trying to act like this is college with the things these kids do.<br/><br/>Overall a someone who has watched since the first season of next gen, this is disappointing. The writers of this show are following some radical SJW book and acting as if this is what you should be doing in HS, no it isn't. These shallow characters always go on another person for doing something they like. Every episode someone is offended and cries that no one with listen and blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Utterly disappointing, I guess this is what you do when you've washed up 2-3 decades of this type of show... I wish I could give it a 0/10.",28 out of 58 found this helpful.,1.0,4 July 2016
948,Degrassi: Next Class, Boo,"Degrassi keeps on getting worse.<br/><br/>Lord the acting. Holy moley. 😨<br/><br/>Too much liberalism and not enough of respecting each of our differences.<br/><br/>It seems like all i see is:<br/><br/>* Different = bigot = mind our business<br/><br/><br/><br/>

949,Degrassi: Next Class, The Cringe is Real,"The Wiki description says it all. ""Degrassi: Next Class is a Canadian teen drama.""<br/><br/>If that doesn't make you want to see what kind of train wreck this show is, I don't know what's wrong with you (Maybe you still have faith in humanity.)<br/><br/>Do you think a good television show looks like a UNICEF commercial? Degrassi has you covered. Complex characters who's depth is that of a shallow pool with a sad little man at the bottom shouting, ""DO YOU GET IT HE'S GAY? Look how progressive we are. We even have lesbians and inter-sectional feminism.""<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered what tumblr would be like in the medium of television? Meet Degrassi: Next Class. <br/><br/>Seriously though, I would recommend watching it if not just for the allusions to gamergate with the swatting. Imagine the SVU episode, but if Canadians made it. YUP, it's that bad. I would also recommend liquor if you take on the challenge of watching this series.<br/><br/>tl;dr<br/><br/>0/10 not nearly progressive enough. I mean come on, it's 2016. Trudeau would not approve. The cast isn't 50/50 male/female.",28 out of 65 found this helpful.,1.0,10 April 2016
950,Degrassi: Next Class, So bad it's funny,"This show, much like the other incarnations of degrassi, is so freaking funny. The acting, script, and overall plot lines are just stupidly hilarious. If you're bored and looking for a good laugh and a show you don't have to completely pay attention to this is perfect. But I also highly recommend it, funnier than a lot of shows without even trying.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think this show must be a work of genius because there is no other reason that I should've watched every episode in 2 days. If you come across it stop immediately and watch the first episode; you will be hooked immediately though you will feel bad for doing so at first. The shame goes away and you realize why have I not been watching this my whole life?<br/><br/>So everybody give it a try, it's so bad it's good ( I promise )",21 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,17 January 2016
951,Degrassi: Next Class, Cringeworthy soap opera,"I'm a big fan of the first six/seven seasons of Degrassi: TNG (less so from season 8 onwards, but it was still watchable), and its parent series, Degrassi JH/H. The aforementioned series presented real issues teenagers faced while still moving the storyline forward. Yes it felt a little ""issue of the week"", but it was better than the tripe of Degrassi: Next Class, a show related to the others only in name and a few characters.<br/><br/>My hopes for this show were appropriately tanked when I saw the updated theme song: an autotuned version of the original TNG theme song ""I Know I Can Make it Through"". Gone are the kids walking around the school doing normal school things. Instead they gather around for selfies complete with incredibly lame hashtags and attempts at ""text talk"". It's hideous and I skip over it every time.<br/><br/>After the cancellation of the original Degrassi last year, it seems like the writers decided to completely revamp the series, and completely turned it into the soap opera-style show it had been flirting with for the last few seasons. I'm four episodes into this show and it's 80 percent about ""who's dating who"" and ""what can we can do to drag out the Tristan/Miles drama further?"". It's really quite tiring.<br/><br/>Before I complain about the characters, I want to say I mean no disrespect to the actors. Most of them are pretty good and are doing their best with the terrible material they're given. But the dialogue and development is horrible. It honestly doesn't feel like the same producers anymore.<br/><br/>Tristan and Miles are still full of preschool drama that involves election sabotage, finding new partners, and of course making out together at a party before declaring they hate each other again. Awesome.<br/><br/>The new character, Vijay, is such a stereotypical gay character that it's hard to believe this is the same show that had powerful gay characters like Marco, Alex, and Dylan. Characters that seemed like real people. The introduction of Tristan was already pushing it a little with the stereotypes, but this new guy really sends it over the top. All he does is fangirl over Tristan, and when Tristan breaks up with him (after a half-episode relationship), VJ says as he walks away ""Don't bother; I already changed our relationship status"". I really wish I was kidding. I don't know how the actor made it through the line without banging his head against the wall.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are focused so much on having sex that it's completely ridiculous. Yes, teenagers think about sex, but they don't spend every minute talking about whether they should have it with so-and-so, or whether they should ask so-and-so out, or whether so-and-so only likes girls with big butts (ACTUAL Plot line, not joking). Come on!<br/><br/>What happened to representing teenagers with REAL issues? Mental health problems like bipolar disorder, depression, eating disorders, PTSD, self-harming...all of these were covered well in the previous series. And if this is being branded as a ""new"" series for a ""new"" generation, why not tackle these issues again?<br/><br/>The show is trying SO hard to appeal to millenials (who will just roll their eyes at how hard they're forcing the drama) that they completely forgot what made the original shows good in the first place. It barely deserves the 3/10 rating.",22 out of 53 found this helpful.,3.0,8 January 2016
952,Degrassi: Next Class, No Depth,"It lost its soul.I didn't feel any emotions from any of the actors or any of the episodes.They stopped tackling the hardcore issues.I watched it hoping it would get better.The last episode it was going to redeem itself.They lost me.There was no major drama with the shooter.That kid is a good actor they all are.They are better then this show.They need new writers because the old ones have lost their touch.Also the Maya swatting and cyber bullying could of been taken so much further but it wasn't.The dance could of been more intense but it wasn't.The pill popping could of been more intense but it wasn't.They crammed as much as they could in 10 episodes and failed.I'm not even attached to any of the characters.They are stereotypical and over the top.It's so bad I don't even remember the new characters names.Only ones I remember is Tristan, Miles,Maya and Zig.They should try researching real teen drama like Skins first two seasons.Or I don't know talk to teens...",16 out of 39 found this helpful.,2.0,4 February 2016

954,Degrassi: Next Class, Like....What?,"This has to be one of the most annoying things I have ever watched. The shows intentions were good, trying to teach young people about different social issues (which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one) but I mean COME ON THIS IS JUST CRINGEWORTHY. <br/><br/>I just finished high school two years ago so I know what it looks like this day in age and I have never met a person there that comes even close to one of the characters in Degrassi Next Class. I mean they are so easily offended by basically everything and the way the creators try to teach you about social issues is just so in your face and obvious you only get annoyed. Try to be a little more subtle about it, you want someone to watch an episode and really think about it afterwards but in this show you can almost finish the characters sentences. That's how predictable it is!<br/><br/>Also if you happen not to agree with the point of view of gays, Muslims, feminists or any other group of people you are immediately a horrible excuse for a human being. This is so wrong because teens should be able to develop their own perspective on such things without someone shoving political correctness down their throats like that. <br/><br/>The show had a good idea and turned it into a complete mess which is a shame because Degrassi Next Generation was a cult classic and a lot of people (including me) grew up watching it. You won't find any trace of that good old Degrassi in this show.",10 out of 29 found this helpful.,2.0,29 July 2017
955,Degrassi: Next Class," Flat, cringy and unrelatable characters, in boring, unrelatable situations","I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone since it is the stalest thing I have ever had to endure. I have (not out of free will), sat through 2 seasons of this garbage. I remember nothing, and I feel like I have wasted my life. <br/><br/>The actors are horrible. It is incredible how little emotion you can get away with showing when working as an actor and still get paid. The dialogue is stale, and with the horrible acting on top, it feels like listening to robots trying to simulate teenagers, without ever having met one.<br/><br/>They have a gigantic cast, but somehow they have managed to make none of the characters likable. In an attempt to make the characters more relatable and ""realistic"", they make every, single person act like morons, all the time. Never in my life have I met any person resembles any of the of characters.<br/><br/>So now you have these characters who are not only unlikable, and stale but also extremely unrelatable, which is impressive when the show's purpose is to relate and handle issues that are relevant for young people. So, incredibly after countless hours watching this garbage, and I can't name one characters name.<br/><br/>Lastly, when you then put these horrible actors, playing awful characters in the most boring and moronic situations, it makes the show outright unbearable to watch. <br/><br/>To sum it up, unless you like watching robot people in a strangely colourfull and polished environment, talking about practically nothing for 6 torturous seasons, then I wouldn't touch this show with a ten- foot pole.",7 out of 22 found this helpful.,1.0,9 October 2017
956,Degrassi: Next Class, Masterpiece,"This might be the best show ever made. So many layers, so many things to think about and analyze. Every time I watch this, I either get chills or find something new to get amazed at. All of the characters are so fleshed out and seem real. When I watch this show, I FEEL like I am a Degrassi student. The show has it all - action, thrills, suspense, drama, and little bit of everything in between. I recommend this show to anyone who has a brain. I'm gonna be honest, if someone says they don't like this show, they're either lying or they have not watched it. For these reasons, I think this show is the best of all time.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,29 June 2020
957,Degrassi: Next Class," Tries a little too hard to be ""woke""","I really like most of this show. It leans on the social issues way too hard in many episodes, especially the Frankie being racist storyline. I also disliked so many of the characters. It is pretty clear they all have a liberal slant. Lots of them had really weak stories and were unlikable. The mental health stuff was great. It reminded me of high school just with too much emphasis on social justice.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,4 April 2020

962,The Gift, About Dubbing,I have noticed many have complained about the acting and dubbing.

963,The Gift, Netflix's Second Turkish Series!,"I didn't keep my expectations very high after the series Hakan: Muhafiz. I ran into a series above my expectations. Although some of the scenes were ridiculous, I found the series successful in general. At least the dialogues were not like translation. The acting was not similarly bad. The use of visual effects was more successful. I watched it and never got bored. Atiye has been a series above country standards.<br/><br/>One of Hakan: Muhafiz positive sides was the steps it took to promote Istanbul well. Atiye does the same for Göbeklitepe and Nemrut. If we look at the script in general, let's not use the word cliche, but I can say classic. But the places used in the series were good. Instead of creating a special universe for itself, the story takes place in today's modern Istanbul. Later, the inclusion of Göbeklitepe and Nemrut adds a mystical feeling to the story. Each series has a color. The selection of light cold and pastel colors was very pleasant. The music selection of the series was also good. Tense music in the tension scenes and the fact that Eastern melodies appear in the background during Göbeklitepe images further connects the viewer to the screen. One of the things I liked about the series was the importance to detail.<br/><br/>Of course, the characters had good and bad sides. The bad character image of Serdar was not as good as I wanted. I found it a bit simple and artificial. Hannah was obvious, too. Some things to improve the mystery of the season seemed a bit unnecessary. There were a few scenes I found extremely bad, but I want to forget them. That's why I won't mention it. It was inadequate for me that the answers of some mysteries were left to the next season and were not explained. I wish the first scene was answered in the season finale, but it didn't. For instance, it would be nice to see what Atiye's powers were. First season was like preparing for the new season. I hope the unexplained things in the next season are explained with a good script. We'il see it next season. 8/10",167 out of 209 found this helpful.,8.0,28 December 2019

Usually stories coming from Turkey are depicting traditional, conservative parts of society and struggles that come with them.

971,The Gift, You will be glued to your seat!,"I was very excited when I first heard that the series was related to ancient history, especially Göbeklitepe and Nemrut. Luckily, I had an opportunity to visit these mystical and historical places when the series started and I was very impressed visiting and learning the unknown aspects of the ancient time in Anatolia.
First of all, I started to watch the series thinking that there is a high chance of being crushed under the influence and size of these special places. Göbeklitepe, referred to as the zero point of history by historians and Nemrut, the mountain of gods, where mystery is still not fully understood. However, the script and the cast manages to stick you in your seat. It is necessary to congratulate Sengül Boybas with her first book (The Awakening of the World). She caused the series to exist and contributed significantly to the script. I think that Mehmet Günsür, one of the leading actors of the series, is the biggest chance of the Atiye (The Gift) because of his interest in ancient history and mysticism. He had previously been involved in similar projects.
I think the other characters in the series have been carefully selected and formed a good team. Hopefully next season will be an accelerating success graph.

987,Dororo," 4 episodes in, Dororo is shaping up to be one of the best anime this decade","Dororo is a great anime about a child that was born with a terrible curse and his journey to defeat the demons that cursed him. It's a great mix between realism and old japanese folktale, and a great mix between action, drama, and mystery.<br/><br/>Everything this anime does is shockingly well. The animation is smooth, the writing is great, and most importantly the atmosphere is unparalleled. The world is immersive and deep, and while the main character himself can't speak a word it's incredible how much you're able to feel for him and everything he's going through. There's a constant sense of mystery in the air that keeps every episode fresh and with good pacing, and the demons themselves are very creative and make for great fights.<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty damn amazing anime that's a breath of fresh air from your run of the mill action anime thanks to avoiding every cliche that's plagued the last two decades, which is ironic considering the source material was made half a century ago.",50 out of 54 found this helpful.,9.0,31 January 2019

The story begins with this child (in his teens) meeting an orphan child and together they embark on a journey to search and eliminate demon ghouls with the scope of retrieving what was taken from this teen as an infant.<br/><br/>The animation is spectacular.

997,Dororo, Amazing self-contained story,"The story of Dororo was originally in a 1960s Manga, it had a more simplified design to it which was a massive rave then, but it was still a massively successful series that lasted 2 years, not staying too long and not wearing out its welcome. It was later adapted to an Anime of the same name in 1969, which was then remade into a Manga in 2018, that is still currently running(circa 2020) which this Anime is drawing from.<br/><br/>So what can I say about the remake of a remake that tells the tale of two very different people during the Waring States period of Japan?<br/><br/>This has to be one of the best Anime series I've seen in my lifetime!!! Studio MAPPA artfully takes myth, legend, history and fantasy, blending them together in a nearly perfect way that has had me floored from start to finish. The art style is gorgeous and gruesome in places, not pulling punches as so many would these days when depicting life during a war, it has traditional Japanese woodblock style art intermixed with detailed and flowing animation, outstanding Siubokuga (Japanese Ink Painting) scenes and stills that give looks on the characters, monsters and areas we explore each episode. Combine that with some classice anime Ultraviolence that gives proper context to it and pair that with religious symbolism throughout.<br/><br/>Add to this the delicately woven stories of the ambiguous central characters Hyakkimaru and Dororo and the detailed and sympathetic foils to the heroes in the wonderfully fleshed out list of side characters, the story of Dororo is one ANY Anime fan should watch and will love.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,23 February 2020
998,Dororo, A superb series,"First, some words to describe this anime TV series:<br/><br/>-Sad
-Emotional
-Exciting
-Mature
-Terrifying
-Grotesque
-Artistic
-Rainy<br/><br/>Consider that last word ""Rainy."" In many of this multi-episode series rainfall is frequent and casts a somber pall over the events that run through this medieval Japanese tale.<br/><br/>The lives, deaths, and redemptions of a handful of wandering characters play out against a background of demonic curses, warring factions of samurai armies, and poverty. One main character, a hideously disfigured young man - Hyakkimaru - who is cursed by demons at birth as a result of his father's bargaining away his life, grows up blind and wandering. He seeks redemption and revenge against those demons and the truth of his birth. He is befriended by a young thief - Dororo - who sees through his physical deformities and then accompanies him on his wanderings.<br/><br/>Each episode is a self-contained morality tale. Recurring struggles between good and evil are never clear cut. This is not a feel-good series but one where stress and conflict are constant. Suffering is palpable with little joy being expressed.<br/><br/>And yet... It's beautiful and ultimately humanely serious. For every bloody and nasty action scene or every tragic event there is also growth. People struggle. They also change. Chief among them is the young warrior Hyakkimaru as he tries desperately to claw his way back to normal humanity despite his deformities and tragic a lack of memory.<br/><br/>The animation is impressive. Hand drawn backgrounds replete with trees, forests, mountains, and rice paddies add gorgeous detail even when rendered in muted colors. Realistic character animation of richly costumed main characters contrasts sharply with the young thief who is surprisingly rendered in a ""cartoony"" style reminiscent of the original Manga author, Osamu Tezuka. Somehow the contrast of character styles works and helps to emphasize the almost classic appearance of the series' rural medieval Japanese setting.<br/><br/>Be prepared for an animated adventure that is simultaneously violent, hopeful, at times tragic, and ultimately beautiful.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,19 March 2019
999,Dororo, An Masterpiece from Tezuka Osamu,"Honestly I'm a fan of Tezuka Osamu creation. I watch the anime like Astro Boy in my childhood time, playing the PS2 games ""Blood Will Tell"" which I never forgot the story in it, watch the Live Action ""Dororo"" in 2007 with the hope Tezuka Osamu and teams can make the sequel because the story end in pursuing others 24 demons (im so terribly curious the ending), and last he brings the remake anime from 1960-an into our time with great story to tell about and outstanding graphics.

1002,Dororo, Dororo just a few shy of perfection,"I normally don't give out reviews on here, but I just had to say something about what I just saw. This show is so compelling in a sense that leaves you breathless in the end. Makes you ask the question of : what the heck just happened?<br/><br/>Hyakkimaru's story on the path to finding who he is and trying to claim the essence of his humanity that was savagely taken by the hands of not only his father,but essentially his hometown is terrifying to say the least.<br/><br/>But his relationship with Dororo definitely lifts the mood and spirits of an otherwise brutal world filled with pain and loss. My heartstrings we're pulled violently more than once I can assure you.<br/><br/>To other aspects of the show, the artwork is so incredible I felt like I was looking at old Japanese style paintings , there was good contrast between light and dark tones and it did the show a service to be sure.<br/><br/>I don't mind Japanese voice work, and I honestly feel they would take the authentic atmosphere out of the show if they decided to dub it.
All the voice actors we're really awesome!<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the music, Good can't even begin to describe it so let's not go there!!!<br/><br/>The pro's to this wonderful show would have to be it's momentum in the second half, tends to drag just a smidge.

1003,Dororo, Drops the ball 2nd Half. Unsatisfying ending,"The first 12 episodes of Dororo are spectacular, but at the start of Episode 13, reality starts to kick in as the quality starts to go down, and you wonder how they are going to manage fitting in another 12 episodes in to resolve the conflict that was already so close to ending in the first half.<br/><br/>The 2nd half of the Anime does this poorly, as it feels less of a fluid arc and more of an episodic ""monster-of-the-week"" sort of affair, as the side adventures feel more like filler. All of it nearly became unbearable at Episode 16, when the show LITERALLY JUMPS THE SHARK. I almost skipped straight to the last two episodes, but Episode 17 was a change of pace and allowed me to finish the anime.<br/><br/>With all the down time Dororo and Hyakkimaru had in the show, it was really disappointing for the show's ending to feel rushed and uncharacteristic. It even ends with the closing outro theme instead of an extended epilogue. The story itself has such a great premise and it's no wonder it's been adapted so many times, but please save yourself and move along from this one.",12 out of 21 found this helpful.,6.0,22 August 2019
1004,Dororo, Just a damn good anime,"Anime is such a hit and miss with these recycled shounen plots and reincarnated angsty protagonists, ear bleeding cry babies and forced comic relief but once in a while, we get a gem. Dororo is that gem.<br/><br/>Set in Muromachi times of war and strife, the anime explores some pretty dark and complex themes of land, prosperity, sacrifice, war and its victims.<br/><br/>Despite the name, Hyakkimaru is the protagonist. His trips slaying demons evolve into a mission to regain everything that he discovers was brutally taken away from him as an infant.<br/><br/>The character development for Hyakkimaru goes beyond his physical skill and prowess. We watch as he learns how to do the most basic of things like eat fish, smile and say names to comprehension of his broken identity and moral contemplations involving the value of his parts against his family who wronged him and those who currently thrive upon his sufferings.<br/><br/>We also get to enjoy some nice fight scenes, basic politics, family tension and a lot of cute light hearted banter and antics from Dororo to balance it all out.<br/><br/>There's more but basically it's a damn good anime.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,23 May 2020

The second half starts awkwardly and keeps it that way through out the remaining episodes.
It gives fillers where you don't need, introduces characters that don't contribute to the story and it actually starts to feel boring.
The last 4 episodes conclude, in a certain sense, the story but I feel too much went on a short time creating an unsatisfying ending.

1007,Dororo, Good but overrated,"I began to watch this show because is my favorite theme in anime: historical-fantastic (I am a huge fan of Mushishi). The story is original and the first 8-10 episodes are very good in both production quality and storytelling, and, overall, they achieve a really captivating atmosphere.
But, inexplicably, the quality suddenly drops in the second half of episodes. The animation, which was very good in the first episodes, became lousy and amateurish, the storytelling was irregular, and the overall story stales. There are utterly bad episodes in every aspects (animation, script, story, but specially animation), as the one with the demon-moths and caterpillars or the one with sharks.
Why, guys? maybe changes in the production team, fund cuts, tight deadlines, or simply the writers and animators get tired?<br/><br/>A really good show at the beginning, ruined in the second half and culminating in an unsatisfactory ending.",12 out of 24 found this helpful.,5.0,16 September 2019

The subject matter is fairly interesting, and I do think it's a story worth telling. The problem is that it's disorganized and could use a heavy edit.<br/><br/>Like so many modern docuseries, this feels stretched. The time jumps are odd, and often the scenes feel random and disjointed. You can watch a scene and be left to wonder, ""So when did that happen?"" because it will be following some footage from 2005 or a phone call recording from 2010.

1015,The Vow," Squandered potential, bogged down by tedium","As usual, too many people on here are leaving ratings based on a.) how interesting the source material is, or b.) their personal feelings about the cult and people who participated in it. Those feelings are valid, but not really what IMDB is for. Instead, I prefer to focus on the quality of the documentary itself and HOW the story is delivered.<br/><br/>The subject matter of this show could not be more interesting, and I was already quite familiar with many details thanks to some longform articles I've read over the past few years. So I had a decent idea of what to expect. As for the documentary itself, I have to say I'm quite disappointed so far. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, and it feels very polished. But that doesn't really make up for some of the glaring flaws.<br/><br/>First of all, I found the editing to be confusing at first. We jump between timelines (the years when Mark was in the cult and everyone was ""happy"" vs the present day when everyone is freaking out) without any kind of text to let us know what year the footage is in. I picked up on these shifts by the end of the first episode, but I still found that a little strange. That's a minor issue though, I could overlook it if that was the only problem.<br/><br/>However, I'm starting to pick up an issues that seem to plague 95% of the 'docuseries' of recent years: it feels like the story is artificially stretched out just to make it fill up a 9 hour series. Episode 1 was boring, but 2 and 3 had much more exciting content. Unfortunately, we've now begun to stagnate. The stories in Episode 4 probably could have been told with just as much detail in 20 minutes flat. Instead, in order to bloat it into an hour, we're left with a lot of repetition and re-stating things we already know from previous episodes, or sometimes even from earlier in the same episode. It's already getting kind of boring hearing women talk about how they were mesmerized by Keith and then lured in by that... there's only so many times we can state the obvious. We know that's how he operates. Let's move on. I really hope the next few episodes don't drag on as badly as Episode 4 did, but I have a feeling that this is a sign of things to come.

1017,The Vow, Thorough but unfocused,"While the series has plenty of recorded phonecalls, recordings and interviews with people who were involved with - and since escaped - the organisation, the series lack of proper pacing trips it up. There is no straight timeline being followed, but instead it steadily introduces more people and might then go back to previous events we have already seen because these newly introduced figures were also involved in that. This leads to topics switching quite randomly. As such the series might struggle to hold your attention past your innate interest in seeing where things go in the end. In conclusion the series seem to portray events accurately enough, however it meanders too much and doesn't have a defined 'thread' you can follow that will keep you in suspense. I would put this slightly above average 6 episodes in.",31 out of 37 found this helpful.,6.0,30 September 2020
1018,The Vow, A Beginners Guide To Grooming,"This is precisely how skilled manipulators groom their victims- they'll prey on your weaknesses, pump you full of confidence to rip it out from under you, tell you you're special/outstanding then do a 180 and proclaim you to be stupid/weak/a follower.<br/><br/>I believe Salzman was the brains and Raniere was the 'beauty' and together they worked to manipulate thousands of people into coughing up millions of dollars- and let's be completely honest-artists/actors/film makers/basically anyone in the Hollywood machine is, at least on some level, a narcissist always in search of praise and affirmation. This scheme fit so perfectly into their doubts and needs that it was likely created with specifically this type of victim in mind.<br/><br/>I'm particularly stunned that literally NO ONE in this group ever bothered to get beyond themselves enough to notice that there's not a single member that's even remotely overweight, at least decently pleasing to the eye, and ALL have access to decent amounts of cash. How does that completely escape your purvey?<br/><br/>If a group is supposedly so intent on changing the world/helping others, why does it not begin with those in our society most in need of a hand up? For a group so based in the principals of'a better world', the only world they seem intent on changing is their own little orbit.<br/><br/>It's a sad and not all together too surprising of a series that shows you exactly how easily some can be manipulated; one key ingredient is the complete and total lack of empathy for anyone other than their own social network. There's a reason that it takes a particular mindset to be pulled into this type of manipulation in the first place, and Raniere and Salzman knew precisely whom to prey upon. With an extensive background into neural linguistics, Nancy was very skilled at pulling the strings with precisely the right context, and I have no doubt she held Keith's hand to teach him her methods.<br/><br/>I hope all these neurotic sociopaths rot in prison-but given that it's really considered 'white collar' I doubt anyone other than Raniere sees any significant time in a cell.",49 out of 63 found this helpful.,8.0,6 September 2020
1019,The Vow, New documentary series examines cult-like organization NXIVM,"As Episodes 1 of ""The Vow"" (2020 release; 9 episodes of about 60 min. each) opens, we get to know Keith Raniere, who talks about ""optimizing people's experience and behavior"". We go to ""2017"" as a guy named Mark confesses that""I was afraid to be attacked if I left the organization"", and then the shocking headline as we go to ""2019"" where Keith Raniere is convicted of sex trafficking. We then go back in time as we get to know Sarah, who meets Mark on a cruise and they hit it off, big time. Mark convinces Sarah to take the organization's (called NXIVM) initiation program (called Executive Success Program). Sarah is skeptical at first but soon finds herself fully on board... At this point we are 10 min. into Episode 1.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: I must admit that I had never heard of this organization, and that the dead-giveaway in the opening scenes of Episode 1 that its leader was convicted last year of sex trafficking made me sit up and take notice. Based on Episode 1, which mostly explores the ""teachings"" of NXIVM, this to me sounds like another cult organization, not unlike, say, the Church of Scientology. People are brainwashed and/or convince themselves into believing things that sound like utter rubbish to me (of course about ""bringing out the best in themselves"", etc.). No signs whatsoever so far about any darker side of things, although the preview of Episode 2 makes clear it's not going to be long before we get to that. How does an entire cult buy into this? That is the $64,000 question which we will explore in future episodes for sure. This new documentary series is directed by the long-time (husband and wife) documentarian team of Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim (""Control Room"", ""The Square""), and once again they deliver what looks to be a fascinating view behind the curtains, in this case of a cult-like organization.<br/><br/>""The Vow"" premiered this past weekend on HBO and Episode 1 is now available on HBO On Demand and other streaming services. New episodes air Sunday evenings at 10 pm Eastern. Can't wait to catch future episodes. If you have an interest in the inner workings of cult-like organizations, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.<br/><br/>*UPDATE 8/31/30* Episode 2 confirms all the good things and, yes, also scary things about Episode 1. We are now really taking a deep dive into the ""high control group"" (a/k/a the cult) that is NXIVM, as we learn new terms like ""emotion stretching exercise"". Yea, you can't make this up! Episode 2 is also where we learn what ""the vow"" (the title of this documentary series) actually refers to/stands for. No worries, I won't spoil. Just watch...<br/><br/>*UPDATE 9/7/20* Episode 3 takes a deep dive into Sarah's trajectory within the NXIVM cult, and how her close relationship with Lauren may impact Sarah's marriage. We are now knee-deep into the cult side of things and things are getting ""weirder and weirderer"". I can only imagine how the remaining 6 episodes are going to play out. This is now officially must-see TV (for me anyway).<br/><br/>*UPDATE 11/1/20* Just as ""The Vow"" came to a conclusion in early October, another NXIVM documentary mini-series debuted on STARZ called ""Seduced: Into the NXIVM Cult"", directed by Emmy-nominated Cecilia Peck. It focuses far more onto the personal experienced on India Oxenberg, who became a slave in the ""DOS"" system of NXIVM. While some of this is of course covered in ""The Vow"", ""Seduced"" goes into far greater details of the human trafficking that went on within NXIVM , and one has to wonder why ""The Vow"" only covers it vaguely.",59 out of 81 found this helpful.,7.0,24 August 2020

Either some of the viewers have been asleep for the past ten years (NXIVM was all over the media and the subject of a year-long podcast about a year ago) or so, or simply have the empathy of a Social Media Influencer.
However the first episode shows NXIVM in a light that is mostly benign that anyone judging (as WASPy really??) the participants has to be mean spirited or uneducated.<br/><br/>What happens after? A mix of Scientology-like mentality and sex trafficking coupled with manipulation that can make any so-called logical (cult-proof) individuals fall into a trap like 'The Vow' so, very inadvertently.

Being that it's a true story, and not fiction, I find it fascinating to understand how people are swept up in a cult. How they entice people in by playing on certain emotions and then these people, sadly, are stuck in a situation that is not always easy to escape. Reminds me of Jeffrey Epstein luring in vulnerable, young girls, with what seemed to them like an innocent job opportunity, and with some of them he waits to get them on his private island and then rapes them repeatedly. How do they escape from the island? They're at his mercy. It's always obvious to those who can recognize what's going on from the outside, but from the inside, it's hard for them to see the truth, or understand how they're being manipulated, and find their way out.",22 out of 33 found this helpful.,9.0,31 August 2020

Basically, I was totally aware of all the cult-like ideology and illegal stuff going on in the background. I KNEW this group was bad news when I began the documentary, but after the first episode I thought, ""wow, the way they talk and teach seems legit. It seems like a thing that would help EVERYONE who sought them out"". AND THAT IS THE POINT!

Secondly, it is very clearly a musical but this still surprises people. If you strongly dislike musicals the show isn't for you and that's okay but if you don't mind them then I'd say give it a go.

Don't ruin the ratings here for a new, original series just because it's a genre (musicals) that you don't even like. I don't like reality shows so, you know what? I don't watch them and therefore don't share my opinion on any of them. Now... for those who DO LIKE musicals (like myself) this show, in just two episodes, has tapped into something that has not really been explored much outside of Disney animated movies. We've had plenty of animated series that use adult humor but how many have used the musical as their primary format? Not only is Central Park laugh-out-loud funny, the musical numbers are actually really, really good! Almost all the songs are infectiously catchy to the point that you might just find yourself searching for the soundtrack in Apple Music or Spotify (I know I will). Watching this I felt like I was watching a great Broadway musical, not an animated tv show. Please ignore the negative reviews here because they are speaking from their bias against an entire genre.

It's a completely different art form. It does have the creator of Bob's Burger on it but it's pretty obvious he's not running this ship, other than it using the same character design style. The narration doesn't work. I understand Josh Gad wants to be part of the project but all the narration chisels away at the limited time for a 22-minute+ show. I like Kristen Bell, as always, and Stanley Tucci's character is kind of funny, and the dad in the show has a good singing voice, though, I don't particularly care for his character or the family's storyline, other than that.

1052,Central Park, Would be mediocre without the song exposition... that makes it really annoying,"I thought we all agreed that breaking in to songs was unnatural and completely takes you out of the experience. Apparently this show didn't get the memo, because they made something more bland than Bob's Burgers, with song breaks, that take any interest you had in the episode, and throw it away. It seems like Apple TV has its loyal legion of employees, investors, cast and crew bumping up it's ratings. If you have to have a gimmick and a star studded cast, just to pull of something as bland, and annoying as this, maybe you shouldn't have gone with this to bulk up your streaming service. Apple TV has yet to make a good show, without its flaws. ""See"" was good, but you have to forgive a lot of stupid choices, boring travel, and characters being brought to other story lines to make them interesting, and it was very predictable. Plus Voss' (Momma) plot armor is thicker than anything I've seen since Game of Thrones. ""Morning Show"" tried too hard, and is just an over the top commentary of the post #MeToo movement. ""Defending Jacob"" was painfully boring, predictable, full of extremely stupid character choices just to make it work and wouldn't have been as watched without the casting of Chris Evans who does most of the heavy lifting, as far as the acting goes. Pablo Schreiber and JK Simmons did a great job as well, but are offset by Martell (Jacob) and Dockery (Laurie), who have 2 emotions, and are annoying. I could go on but you get the point. If it's on Apple TV, it's pretty flawed. The Beastie Boys documentary/stage biopic was great, but you'd have to be a fan to be interested, and it's not Apple TV that should get the credit here either, they just picked up something that would have been good, no matter who streamed it, and probably would have ended up on Netflix had they not grabbed it first. Anyway, if you wouldn't like a less amusing Bob's Burgers, with musical numbers, you won't like Central Park. Plus, the act of releasing each episode one week at a time takes most of the fun out of streaming services.",15 out of 27 found this helpful.,,24 June 2020

1070,That's So Raven, Please read this if you posted a bulletin about this show,"I'm sorry I can't afford to do the chat thing, but I read them anyways and it bugs me, so I want to clarify that Raven isn't fat. I just read something that someone put saying that Raven is 5 foot 3 inches and 170 pounds. I don't think she weighs that much, and she's not obese! In case nobody else has noticed, and I promise I don't normally notice things like this since I'm a straight girl... Raven is VERY curvy! She has big hips as well as other body parts that I shouldn't put on a page for a children's show! Don't y'all think that THAT could be what weighs her down?! Duh! And stop being so shallow anyways! Why don't you go talk about Queen Latifah in some stupid chatroom! Raven is awesome and talented, and she sets a very good example for others.

1071,That's So Raven, Not bad for a Disney show,"I used to love the Disney Show, but now because of stuff like the High School Musical Series and Hannah Montana airing I can barely stomach it. That's So Raven for me while not perfect was one of their better situation comedies. In later years the writing did become less clever and funny, the story lines got really predictable and throughout the show Eddie had moments when he was annoying. However, the production values were pretty good and I enjoyed the fashions, while the music and theme tune were fun as well. For quite some time the show was helped by some witty and clever writing, nicely constructed stories that benefited from a great concept and good characters, Raven, Corey and Victor being my favourites. The acting is surprisingly decent for a Disney show as well, Raven-Symone has a lot of infectious charm about her. Overall, not bad. 7/10 Bethany Cox",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,3 July 2011
1072,That's So Raven, God's light falls down upon me,"no other show on television can compare to the poignant and profound themes of that's so raven. many would disagree, and say another show is better. IMDb, which speaks for the population of the people, certainly disagrees with my taste. A lot of users on IMDb might say that a show like The Wire or Breaking Bad is better. That's what the list says. Planet Earth? Better than that's so Raven??? You've got to be kidding me! The Wire and Breaking Bad are 4/10 at most!<br/><br/>' Nothing in the world could ever make me as happy as seeing Raven Simone look into the future and watch her shenanigans take place. Her vibrant personality and her hilarious wit makes me laugh aloud and clap even when I'm alone in the room. As a child, my dad would always scream at the television while watching Football. I do the same thing, only with That's So Raven. My shrill screams resonate throughout the house when I see Raven on screen. I just see Raven and wonder, ""what's she going to do next?"" and every rerun I watch, I feel that it's the first time I have seen it.

1073,That's So Raven, The BEST Ever show on Disney Channel... or all of TV for that matter...,"I'm going to state this like it's more of a fact rather than an opinion but That's so Raven WAS, is now, and ALWAYS will be the best television series EVER on Disney Channel, or on television for that matter. When it was on Disney Channel, I'd watch it EVERY time it would air, even in the year 2013, all these years later and I'm still a huge fan of that show. I'm surprised I don't have That's So Raven on DVD or any of the novels but regardless, I cannot begin to put into words how much of a weakness I have for That's So Raven. It still appalls me to this very day that That's So Raven fails to be among the many Disney Channel shows that didn't have a movie (I'll get more to that a little later in this review).<br/><br/>I love Raven-Symone, and I loved her in the Raven Baxter character. Well, I love her in all her performances, no matter who she protrays or what show she is on. But Raven really hit this one out of the park. Also, I'm going to put out there that I even wrote to Raven back in fall of '05 asking her to ask her producers if I can be in an episode of her show, even if only to be an extra, because I loved the show so much so to actually be on the set of the best show on television, getting to be with the cast and crew... OF the best show on television would've been like a magical dream come true. But unfortunately the letter never got sent because my mum found it and took it from me. Unfortunately my dream of being on the Raven show didn't come to fruition but I'm not letting that stand in the way of jump-starting my acting career. Oh, guess what? I still have the letter I wrote to Raven eight years ago and I do plan to show Raven my letter one day (give it to her in person, not mail it off).<br/><br/>Let me also just say how the show's ratings were OFF THE CHARTS. Usually, Disney shows seem to have this limit (I'm guessing because they think kids have shorter attention spans) to 64 or 65 episodes per show but That's So Raven BUSTED THAT LIMIT! Oh, yes! The high ratings must have gave Disney the okay to order more episodes made. The only explanation I can think of why the movie didn't happen was because maybe Disney thought the show had enough episodes for a movie to not happen or it might've been a loss for Disney, my other explanation is that it could be a race thing because a lot of other Disney Channel shows get turned into films and they weren't even remotely as successful as That's So Raven so I don't know if it would've been a loss to Disney. As far as I know the script for a movie was written but never made it into the production phase.<br/><br/>That's so Raven was ALMOST everything I could ever want in a television show. I say ""almost"" because I'm more of a drama queen than a comedy critic, so I could easily do without all the comedy aspects of the show. Give That's So Raven more drama and a lot (and a mean a LOT) less comedy and it would've been a real stunner, that being the reason why I'm giving it a 9 although I should give it a perfect 10 to do it justice. If I could vote 9 and a half, I could but I can't so I'mma go ahead and give a full 10. No offense to the actress, T'Keyah Crystal Keymáh, but I'm glad she left the show because her character didn't feel right on the show. I don't know if T'Keyah left of her own accord or if Disney wrote the character off the canvas but the Tanya Baxter character felt kind of useless to me.<br/><br/>OH! I LOVE the opening theme song! I even have the theme on my iPhone and I listen to the theme over, and over, and over, and over again. I even like that the show has a cold opening (a cold opening is a show with a teaser opening scene, and then the opening credits). I like shows to start like that.<br/><br/>This show would've been perfect just kill the stupid, annoying comedic- sitcom aspects of it. Give it the feel that The Cheetah Girls movies had and it would've been absolute perfection. But this show was absolute gold.<br/><br/>Even though That's so Raven aired its series finale in 2007, it's a shame that in these days, the show is no longer airing on television. ABC would air it on Saturday mornings during the Saturday morning ABC Kids block, which unfortunately is no longer airing. There was the one time, ABC aired That's So Raven at 5:00pm for a full hour. *Sighs* I wish I had a DVR so I could record those two episodes. But I still hold out hope one day ABC Kids will return with a full hour of That's So Raven.<br/><br/>And as I am an aspiring television/film actress-producer, I also hold out bigger hope to be part of a show that's even better and more successful than That's So Raven, and I co-star on that show WITH Raven- Symone!",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,12 September 2013

1075,That's So Raven," For A So-Called Kids Show, That's So Raven Is Great Fun For Adults As Well","That's So Raven could be lauded as the best kids TV show coming from Disney for some time. Starring one-time Cosby Show and Hangin' With Mr Cooper actress, Raven Simone, she plays a character named Raven Baxter: a typical teenager who has the ability to see into the future and finds herself in a whole manner of wild, wacky and crazy situations, which often involve her family members, mother Tanya, father Victor and her younger brother, Cory and her two best friends, Chelsea and Eddie. By the end of each episode, Raven and the other characters all learn a few things about life and themselves. Dutch-born Anneliese Van Der Pol puts in a good performance as Chelsea, whilst fans of the 90s Olsen twins sitcom, Two Of A Kind may recognise Orlando Brown.<br/><br/>Raven Simone does demonstrate her versatility as a comic actress by means of playing and dressing up as various types of characters on the show and taking on different character roles. As she has grown up over the years, we as an audience, got to see her branch out and thus, in this show she is not so much Olivia but Raven Baxter. There are not as many child stars today with the capability and ability to do well on screen, but Raven's experience in working and performing in hit shows such as The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, The Cosby Show and Hangin' With Mr Cooper at such a young age has probably given her a slight advantage over her other younger peers. But she's on form here on That's So Raven.<br/><br/>I was very surprised though to see how good That's So Raven was because my initial impressions were because it was mainly a kid's show, the style of humour that accommodated the sitcom would be much too adolescent for me to get to grips with, as well as to like. But in fact, I liked it quite a lot and found the show itself to be quite enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>And yet while this is a Disney show, I cannot fathom why it cannot do well with a different network such as NBC, ABC, CBS or UPN for example. The plot of the show is interesting,-yet one of the most original I have seen for a sitcom, the show is well written with a good cast and interesting characters, and thus it generates plentiful of good laughs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good but fun-packed show worth tuning in for, no matter how old you are, if you like to watch Raven in an almost entirely different role, then That's So Raven is well worth a look",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,24 August 2007

Only her friends and family knows and with the help of her visions in the future, Raven goes on weird, funny and challenging situations to set things right.<br/><br/>This show also delivers a inspirational message too, that always believe in yourself and stop at nothing to fight for what you really want.

1077,That's So Raven, Nice show.,"Okay, so this show may not be all that but man, I gotta say, it's still good enough to watch. The show stars Raven who plays a psychic teenager. This show makes me laugh so much, I am so serious. I love it as a matter of fact. I'll never forget the episode where she had put on the fat suit and was dancing in the hallways, laugh out loud. Chelsea (Anneliese Van Der Pool), she cracks me up the way she never gets it. But she can act good enough I'd say. She just needs to get a clue though. And Eddie (Orlando Brown), he's great. He always gets mixed up in Raven's schemes. He's kinda like the innocent one. Corey is also cool. I love the way Corey is clever and is always doing something tricky. However, the parents, they're okay but the father, he's a bit too flat and I don't know how to summarise him but no, the show needs a new dad. The one they have, i hate to say it but HE SUCKS. One thing that always stands out is the teacher who spits, Mr. Lawler. One thing I don't understand is that when MR. Lawler is talking to them and spitting, in real life, a person would move away, I know I would. BUT THEY JUST STAY THERE AND GET CLOBBERED WITH SPIT! EWW! MOVE AWAY! That's gross. And you can see that it's real, these huge junks of spit pelting, gosh, that's so gross. I like that Raven Symone has made a comeback. She is a very talented young lady and I've watched her grow up from the Cosby Show to Dr. Dolittle to Zenon to That's so Raven. I love her, she's awesome. The thing I also like about the show is the way Raven always misinterprets her visions and does something stupid. And who could forget Stinky Sturkey, I mean Ben Sturkey. He must smell real bad to actually knock people inconscious. Disney constantly airs reruns of the show, so much that I only have to see the first scene of the episode to know what they're gonna say for the entire show. I think there should be new episode each week. But anyways, I love the show, Good Job Raven.",10 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,24 May 2003

Also, i think that Raven and the other actors/actresses on this show are very talented because they really know how to make people laugh, and how to act. This is by far, the best show i have ever seen on TV, the most witty and the funniest. I think that That's so Raven's episodes are all hilarious and you will want to watch them over and over again. I really recommend this show for everyone, and i hope that Raven and her friends will keep making more and more episodes because it's the best show ever.

It better not make it pass 100 episodes.<br/><br/>Another thing I don't like about this show is that a lot of the time she gets away with what she does, and doesn't get in trouble like in the Christmas episode where she looked in her Christmas box and then she needed to buy a new one.

Don't get me wrong, I am very happy that a young black girl can actually get her on television show on Disney, but this is not what I'd hoped it to be. The show has become very predictable and it no longer catches my attention. The fake audience is absolutely awful. Another thing that makes no since is that Raven and her friends are supposedly in middle school. But look at them, they should be graduating high school. With Raven's visions shouldn't she have learned by now that maybe just for once she should just let things take their course without trying to fix it? Because all she does is make the situations a lot worse. I don't see how they spend so much time with Chelsea. She is an idiot. The excuse of ""but she is my best friend"" is getting really old. My little sister is six years old and she loves this show, she thinks that it is funny. But like I said this show is strictly for girls 12 and under.

1082,That's So Raven, Last great show ever on Disney Channel,"In late 2002, the Disney Channel ended its winning streak with another great show. After that, every show ever on the channel has either been painful to watch or just so-so. The last show Disney had a winning streak with was...That's So Raven. The humor is satirical, witty, and hardly, if ever, relies on gross-out stupidity. I'm very glad this show was the longest running ever on the channel, but unfortunately its series finale just aired a few weeks ago. Do you know what that means. There is not a single great show on Disney Channel.<br/><br/>The premise, which, unlike most Disney shows made 2003 and after, is really pretty original. It is about a psychic teen who has two best friends, Chelsea, the ditzy sweet one, and Eddie, the hip-hop type person. She gets visions every so often, and she will try to prevent them or coax them into happening. That may sound repetitive, and at times it does get a little, but the way it happens changes enough to keep this a good show. The writing was some of the best on Disney Channel, and the acting, while not a masterpiece since it IS Disney Channel, is pretty good. And Raven, the lead, is a very talented actress and I hope she does more things soon. The only con to the show is the pointless character Cory, her brother who doesn't really contribute to the show, however in his new show (a spin off of this) he is a little funnier (BTW, Cory in the House is a fair show, and could become, with a tad of effort, the first good show on the channel in 4 and a half years). Also, maybe 6 or 7 episodes were kinda dumb in Season Four, but the last few episodes of the show were good.<br/><br/>My mom actually loves this show, believe it or not, and it's her ""favorite kids show,"" and my dad thinks it's funny too. While I don't know for sure if every mom or dad will like it, it certainly is one of the more tolerable shows you can watch with kids.<br/><br/>So...forget about The Trite Life, forget Hellah Montana, forget Landfill of the Future(or at least the second season), and forget Kim Implausible. If you're only going to watch one show on the channel that's on regularly, watch reruns of That's So Raven. If you have a sense of humour, you'll skip out on some of the shows I mentioned(except Phil if you're easy to impress, or Cory in the House which isn't bad) and watch this comedy.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 or A-",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,28 April 2007
1083,That's So Raven," A delightful, hilarious show but only for the first few episodes","well, what can i say about this show. when i started to watch it for the first time with no other programs in my country except for some horrible, puking serials, i loved the show. Raven is a genius in what all she does, from being extremely funny till being serious. She realizes that this isn't a show in which ordinary acting would be beneficial. She can foresee the future but only in the form of bits of visions. And to fulfill the vision or to prevent what she sees in the vision, she puts herself into trouble along with her two best friends, Eddie and Chelsea. the comic timing of this show is absolutely fabulous, the acting is fantastic and the plot, well.... is good. The jokes are out of the world and are told with perfection by Raven, Orlando Brown, Annaliese Van De Pol, Cory ( i forgot his actual name) and Ravens parents ( here too i am forgetful). the first season is good with sensible plots like the one in which Raven has problems with her cousin and others, the second season is marvelous ( i loved the episode in which Raven and Cory make up their own stories about Raven breaking the portrait by mistake. Raven shone like a rising star in that episode), the third season was good except for some of the episodes which hinted the deteriorating quality of the older episodes and as the title suggests, the fourth season is awful.Raven looks a bit like a horrible animal struck by a disease known as obesity, Cory is shown to money minded while the new stars Donna and her assistant Tiffany are truly horrible. the plots are terrible and the episode in which raven comes face to face with Zack and Cory truly shows that mixing to shows is a terrible idea. but then too i give it an eight because of the starting episodes and this was the first show i truly loved. thanks for reading my first comment",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,21 February 2007

Brian Keith as Uncle Bill Davis, a confirmed bachelor, suddenly has his life changed when he learns that he is given custody of his 2 nieces and nephew when their parents die in a car crash. Anissa Jones as Buffy is the first to appear in episode 1 and it is so good to watch Sebatian Cabot as Mr. French, Uncle Bill's butler, valet and housekeeper, trying to adjust to this shy, sullen little girl who won't come out of her shell.

With the three children at last reunited, life begins anew for Uncle Bill and Mr. French as they learn how to deal with children and the children learn how to deal with them. This show started at a time when family television was still on the airwaves and people enjoyed seeing a show that had 'family values"". But by 1971, when it was cancelled, people started turning to more ""realistic"" and irreverent television shows and it was harder for a ""family values"" program like this to be successful.

1088,Family Affair, Heartbreaking Buffy,"Brian Keith proved to be so good working with little kids: he is warm and paternal, tough but never rigid, always bemused by their antics and reassuring everyone with his calming smile when their spirits were down. When Buffy makes friends with some kids from the bad section of town, Uncle Bill buys her hand-me-downs to wear so she'll fit in (and even tags along and makes friends with a parent, Jackie Coogan). Sebastian Cabot made the perfect valet; he too is charmed by these kids and pretends to be surly even though the idea of having a real family suits him and somehow appeals to him. Kathy Garver is a gregarious big sister and Johnny Whitaker a loyal, dependable brother who rarely got mischievous (he's very grounded and sometimes gravely serious). As for Anissa Jones as Buffy, she didn't seem to be just reading lines that an adult wrote for her, she really WAS Buffy. When her doll gets lost, or when she loses her spot in the Scout Troop, or when the Mod Maidens hurt her feelings (in the terrific episode ""The Joiners""), Jones works the most tender of childhood emotions in a way that is neither flashy nor incredible.

During its first three seasons the series aired on Monday nights at the 9:30 eastern/8:30 central time slot from 1966 to 1969. By the show's fourth season CBS moved the series from Monday nights to Thursday nights in an earlier time slot for its final two seasons(1969-1971) at the 7:30 eastern/6:30 central time slot until its cancellation on March 4,1971. ""Family Affair"" became so successful that CBS put the series on its daytime lineup schedule also known as ""The Family Affair Morning Show"" aka ""The Brian Keith Show"" which consisted of repeated episodes from various seasons airing from September 7,1970 until January 12,1973. Repeated episodes from the best of the series aired from March 11,1971 until September 10,1971.<br/><br/>""Family Affair"" basically was a good series that had a ""Disney"" type theme to it that had a basic story-line, great actors, and impressive guest stars that made it not only fun to watch but made it one of the most popular heartwarming sitcoms of its era. The series chronicles the trials of a successful civil engineer and bachelor Bill Davis(Brian Keith)who life has suddenly changed when he learns that he is given custody of his brother's orphaned children in his luxury Fifth Avenue apartment in New York City. Davis' English Butler and counterpart Giles French(Sebastian Cabot) also had adjustments to make as well as he became the guardian and the second parent of caring for teenage daughter Cissy(Kathy Garver),and his brother's 6-year-old twins Jody(Johnny Whitaker),and Buffy(Anissa Jones) not to mention Buffy's treasure possession Mrs. Beasley her doll that was the heart of the show. This was a series that had basic ""family values"" and ""morals"" that was still on the airwaves that were successful during that era. Out of all the actors associated with the series only actors Brian Keith, Kathy Garver, Anissa Jones and Johnny Whitaker were the only cast members that stayed with the series throughout its entire run. Sebastian Cabot appeared in 130 episodes of the series. When Sebastian Cabot left the series for medical reasons, his brother Nigel French(John Williams) was introduced for nine episodes in 1967. In the show's final season Nancy Walker was added as a part-time housekeeper Mrs. Turner for six episodes for the 1970-1971 season.<br/><br/>Creators Don Fedderson along with Edmund L. Hartmann were writers for all 138 episodes of the series. Other outstanding writers that contribute were Henry Garson, Edmund Beloin, Austin and Irma Kalish, Elroy Schwartz, George Tibbles, Seaman Jacobs, Peggy Chantler Dick, Fred Fox, Joesph Hoffman, Phil Davis, and Phil Leslie among others. Charles Barton directed 106 episodes of the series while William D. Russell directed 31 episodes of the series. James Sheldon directed one episode. Notable guest stars consisted of child actors Eve Plumb, Erin Moran, Veronica Cartwright, Butch Patrick, Kym Karath and Pamelyn Ferdin. Other guest stars were June Lockhart, Robert Reed, Ida Lupino, Jamie Farr, Jackie Coogan, Joan Blondell, Sterling Holloway, James Hong, Brian Donlevy, Martha Hyer, Ann Sothern, Doris Singleton, Vic Tayback, Dana Andrews, Paul Fix and Lee Meriwether among the many who made guest appearances on the show.<br/><br/>As for some of the best episodes of ""Family Affair"" there were several that were very good if not downright dramatic with a hint of comedy. But I start with the show's pilot episode ""Buffy"" from Season 1. Other great episodes included ""The Joiners""(Season 5,Episode 20), ""The Substitute Teacher""(Season 3,Episode 5),""A Member of the Family""(Season 2,Episode 23), ""Christmas Came a Little Early""(Season 3,Episode 7), ""A Matter of Tonsils""(Season 2,Episode 22), ""Oliver""(Season 3, Episode 6), ""Mrs. Beasley,Where Are You?(Season 1, Episode 7), ""Mr. French's Holiday"" (Season 2,Episode 27), ""Fat,Fat,The Water Rat""(Season 2, Episode 7),and ""The Baby Sitters""(Season 2, Episode 29),and the two-part episode ""Lost in Spain""(Season 3, Episodes 18 and 19) to name a few. During its five season run ""Family Affair"" was nominated for eight Prime-Time Emmys between 1967-1969 for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series,Outstanding Directorial Achievement and Outstanding Writing Achievement. Nominated in 1971 for the Golden Globe for Outstanding Television Series and nominated for Outstanding Actor in a Comedic Role(Brian Keith).<br/><br/>When the series was abruptly canceled in the Spring of 1971 after five seasons and 138 episodes,audiences started turning to more ""realistic"" and irreverent television shows that were more of a urban and gritter appeal and by that time it was ""harder"" to find a wholesome family oriented program that was not only family friendly but successful and ""Family Affair"" exceeding all expectations as a television series. The 2002 remake of this was not successful nor did it do right to the original show. Happy 50th anniversary.",13 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,15 September 2016
1092,Family Affair," Relaxing to watch, funny, warm and tender","I love this show. The show looks nice and cosy which alone made it relaxing to watch, and the theme tune is memorable and delightful. Family Affair also treats us to story lines that are written with taste and flair with a lot and heart, and the writing is also very funny(not always hilarious mind) with some poignant parts too particularly with Buffy.<br/><br/>The acting is marvellous, Brian Keith is great as Uncle Bill with a great sense of comic timing and a warm presence too. Kathy Garver shows herself as a promising young actress as Cissy and Johnny Wittaker is a cute Jody. The real stars though are Anissa Jones who is so heartfelt as Buffy and Sebastian Cabot whose Mr French is just brilliant.<br/><br/>Some might say Family Affair is quite syrupy or sugar coated.

1095,Family Affair, A Good Family Show With Moral Values,"This was a family favorite, when I was a child growing up. Uncle Bill played by Brian Keith took in a nephew and two nieces to raise in his New York Penthouse Apartment. However he was a great guardian parent figure as well as Mr. French played by Sebastian Cabot. Kathy Garver, who played Cissy a teenager was a bit wayward. She was made to take responsibility to Buffy and Jodie. Sometimes she neglected her duties. I really like this show better than The Brady Bunch &amp; Partridge Family. Into the 1970's family values changed. Kids wearing long hair, bell bottom jeans and the extreme clothing. I hated to see that happened. I wish we had more shows like Family Affair. I'm very sorry Anissa Jones died of a drug overdose. It's a sad situation to see such a young person end their life. That's what I meant about the change of values.

1096,Family Affair, Cute family series notable mainly for the butler and the doll,"This is an engaging little series that I grew up with, hearkening back to a more innocent age of cute family programming. It revolves around a bachelor engineer, Bill Davis, who has been living a carefree playboy life in his Fifth Avenue apartment. His household needs are tended to by his very efficient English butler, Giles French. Suddenly Bill's life is turned upside down when he inherits three young relatives, who have been orphaned as the result of a car accident. Both Uncle Bill and Mr. French must accustom themselves to this trio of newcomers, pretty 15 year old Cissy and her adorable but challenging younger twin siblings, Buffy and Jodie.<br/><br/>Brian Keith is wonderful as Uncle Bill, the playboy uncle turned surrogate father. The younger stars are also perfect in their roles, especially little Anissa Jones who plays Buffy. Sebastian Cabot is the real jewel of the series in his brilliant portrayal of the butler, Mr. French, who always appears so very proper and gruff but is actually quite charmed by these three kids.<br/><br/>Various amusing and touching scenarios would unfold weekly as the two adults and their three charges grew accustomed to life together. For me, the show was notable (apart from the butler) for Mrs. Beasley, Buffy's bespectacled granny doll. She was a prominent feature in most episodes, always getting lost or whatever, and naturally Buffy was VERY attached to her. All in all, it was a sweet, heartwarming show from nostalgic years of yore when kids were, happily, much less sophisticated than they are today. Pity there aren't more such family programs these days and a demand for them.",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,7.0,15 May 2006

I was at a loose end so gave it a whirl, and sadly i have now finished all 5 seasons. It is such a shame CBC cancelled this. <br/><br/>I loved it, and Brian Keith was great as the uncle who has never had to care about children before, and Sebastion Cabot as the butler was just brilliant. <br/><br/>The children cast in this show were just perfect for the parts. <br/><br/>I wont talk about the contents as there is so much to see but all I can say is if you just want to watch a series with good old fashioned values again, and children not misbehaviour badly then give this a whirl, besides which Brian Keith is sure eye candy and plays a wonderful part which is believeable. <br/><br/>It is a sad thing that the children of this show did not fair well after it ended, and that the main characters passed away, the lovely and talented child actress who played Buffy Anissa Jones sadly died at 18 through a drug overdose, and Johnny Whitaker who played her twin brother Jody had his own issues with substance abuse but thankfully got through it but we lost the great Sebastian Cabot and Brian Keith to early. <br/><br/>Besides all that this is a lovely program about family values and it is timeless as doing well now in 2018 after its first ever episode aired in1966 and has not jaded since then.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,11 August 2018

However, Bill is a busy man and he tries desperately to get a new girlfriend though he must adapt to his new family life, in downtown New York...<br/><br/>It was well done for its times.

1100,Family Affair, Cute Kids Make the Show a Hit,"Fresh off of six seasons of the single parent sitcom My Three Sons, producer Don Fedderson came up with another sitcom about a single parent, Family Affair. I remember the show well as bachelor Bill Davis, played wonderfully by Brian Keith became a father to three young orphans, Cissy and twins Buffy and Jody. The successful engineer and the kids lived in a New York high rise along with the butler Mr. French, played with dignity by Sebastian Cabot. French was reluctant to looking after children but over the show's five year run, he adjusted so well. He often looked after them when Uncle Bill was away on business. <br/><br/>What made the show a hit was the chemistry between Anissa Jones as Buffy and Johnny Whittaker as Jody. They got along so well and they were to of the cutest sitcom kids of the mid to late 60s. There was also Kathy Garver as older sister Cissy, who was like a mother to the two youngsters. Also part of the cast, though inanimate was Buffy's doll, Mrs. Beasley. The doll became a big seller throughout the show's five year run and even when it went into syndicated reruns.<br/><br/>The one episode I remember was the one where Whittaker sang the song ""Every Little Boy Can Be President."" Another one I remember focused on Jody having an invisible bear named Arthur. <br/><br/>It's a shame that the show hasn't been seen on any cable channel in the last few years, it's a show that appeals to the entire family. In the age of sitcoms with objectionable language, Family Affair is a throwback to the days of family friendly entertainment.

I started having horrific problems with my father, who started hating me at a pretty young age, and my insane mother, who we all had to dodge for fear of dying young. I was quite the basket case from all this unwanted stimuli.<br/><br/>So we watch this show weekly and it is such a paradise: Everyone has nice clothes, they live in a wonderful apartment, there is always food, and everyone gets along so well it makes you want to puke.<br/><br/>I remember thinking, ""Is this what life is outside of this scary household?"" I didn't find out till I was much older that Family Affair wasn't the norm, but the household I grew up in thankfully wasn't either.<br/><br/>You'd know a really mushy ""heartfelt"" part of the show was going to be coming up because this maudlin violin music would start playing. Uncle Bill and Mr. French never touched the kids but never hit them either - I thought this was a good trade off. But oh, the corn! All those ""feelings""!

Whoever put their names on IMDb as Patterson-Davis is quite ignorant, or some sort of smart alec. These are not members of the British Royal Family, they are 1960's era middle Americans from TerreHaute, Indiana, and their surname is the name of their father, the late brother of Bill Davis. The name ""Patterson"" was the name of their maternal grandfather who showed up in one episode, but we don't even know if the birth name of the late mother of the children was Patterson. For all we know from information given in the series, Mr. Patterson could have been a step-father.

I've not seen it in several decades and I missed the CW reboot but recently discovered that it airs on Pluto tv and available on demand on Tubi TV.<br/><br/>This show is wonderful and have just about finished binging on season one, ""Uncle Bill"", a bachelor with a ""Gentleman's Gentleman"" (British valet) Mr. Finch, has his eight year old niece dropped of at his place a year after her parents passed away because she was not getting along with the family she was left with. The first episode is all about Buffy and Uncle Bill trying to form a bond with headway being made at the end of the episode when Buffy's siblings arrive, twin brother Jody and big sister Cissy. Second episode is all about Uncle Bill (and Mr. Finch) being overwhelmed by having young kids.<br/><br/>Partly (Jay North) Dennis the Menace, partly Leave it to Beaver, partly Father Knows Best, this show is sickly sweet by modern standards where the new ""father"" figure makes mistakes and kids get into mischief, but each episode has Uncle Bill getting closer to the kids and making sacrifices, including sacrifices in his dating life, in order to take proper care of the kids.<br/><br/>Some notable first season episodes has Uncle Bill taking a combination business and pleasure trip with Jody in order to take him fishing. The trip is a disaster with several obstacles and Uncle Bill so focused on trying to fulfill his promise to take his nephew fishing that he's oblivious to the fact that Jodi is just happy spending time with his Uncle. Another standout episode is when oldest girl Cissy's school has a mother daughter dinner and feels left out.

1104,Family Affair, Wonderful Series Until...,"This was a wonderful series which involved a successful and wealthy bachelor, Bill Davis, who ended up being a surrogate father to his brother's three orphaned children: Cissy, a teenager, and Buffy and Jody, 6 year old twins. To add to the interesting plot was Bill's gentlemen's gentleman, Mr. French, who had no knowledge of how to take care of the children while Bill was at work or traveling around the world on his various construction projects and was away from home at times. In due course, you see the much-needed love that Bill gives the children and Mr. French, although a strict disciplinarian with them, has a very soft spot in his heart for them.<br/><br/>The problem that the producers ran into however was, like with any children, Buffy and Jody in real life grew up. By the 5th season, it was hard to see Cissy still obeying a curfew and getting her consent from Bill for everywhere she wanted to go. But the bigger issue was that Buffy and Jody stopped being the childlike moppets, still not knowing how to do anything, and always saying that their Uncle Bill had all the answers. They wanted to keep them in their 8 year old molds, but by the 5th season, Jody (Johnnie Whitaker) was 11, and Buffy (Anissa Jones) was 13. You can tell that they did everything and anything to make Buffy appear to still be 8 years old with the loose dresses to hide her developing figure, as well as having her still sleep with Mrs. Beasley at night, although she is not toting her around as much. It is clear that by the last season, Anissa Jones resented having to play a little girl and hints of facial expressions come through where she is just plain bored.<br/><br/>Even though the reason for cancelling the series in 1971 was because they were getting away from the rural programs, it is clear that this show would not have survived another season.

The ""class"" of Mr. French? The deluxe apartment in the sky? Period sets and costumes might give it visual interest to today's viewers; see such things in other shows aplenty. Basically ""Family Affair"" stimulated whatever little in the way of homicidal personality traits I possess. Not just for the people on screen, but for everyone involved in the manufacture of this prime time travesty.<br/><br/>Better for me was ""Courtship of Eddy's Father"" if you want this theme .But then who could resist that woman from ""Flower Drum Song"" week after week after week after week after week?

1112,Tales of Wells Fargo, Those Who Would Rob From Wells Fargo,"If Dale Robertson had come along about ten years earlier he would have been a great cowboy hero and Herbert J. Yates no doubt would have had him in his stable of western heroes. But he came along just as the B western was going out of business on the big screen and quite frankly he was a much better actor than some of the B cowboys. He did some serious B films, never quite getting stardom on the big screen, though some of the films were good. <br/><br/>The small screen treated him better with the Tales Of Wells Fargo series in which Dale's character of Jim Hardie narrated his exploits in tracking down those who would rob from his employer the Wells Fargo company.<br/><br/>I think the series was good because it called for Robertson to be a detective as well as a cowboy hero. The scripts were intelligently written given the constraints of developing characters in only thirty minute episodes for the most part. <br/><br/>In the last season the show was expanded to sixty minutes, but the producers also decided to give Robertson's character Jim Hardie a ranch and something of a home life. It never seems to cease, a perfectly good format, tinkered with and then cancellation.<br/><br/>Still Tales Of Wells Fargo gave Dale Robertson his career role, at least the one this fan remembers him best for.

1113,Tales of Wells Fargo," ""My name's Jim Hardie, and I handle trouble for Wells Fargo"" - Episode #2.35 'Hide Jumpers'","Ah yes, another classic TV Western I used to watch regularly as a kid back in the late Fifties. Courtesy of Timeless Video, I've been able to catch up on the adventures of Wells Fargo special agent Jim Hardie over the past few months.<br/><br/>The series ran from March, 1957 to September, 1962, the sixth and final season expanding to a one hour format after leaving the normal Monday night time slot (8:30 to 9:00PM) and airing on Saturdays (7:30 to 8:30 PM). The series opener offered an interesting element; on the barrel of Hardie's gun were imprinted the words 'Be not afraid of any man that walks beneath the sky. Though you be weak and he be strong, I will equalize.'<br/><br/>In that first episode, the guest star was Chuck Connors who a year later would appear as 'The Rifleman' and begin his own five season Western series run. Interestingly, Connors portrayed an outlaw, and the showdown occurred between him and Hardie while Connors was perched on top of a telegraph pole! Connors returned nine episodes later as the outlaw Sam Bass, with another familiar face as part of the Bass gang - future Little Joe Michael Landon, wearing a mustache! In another Season I episode, 'Leave it to Beaver's' Dad, Hugh Beaumont shows up as the outlaw Jesse James, along with one of the Dead End/East Side Kids, Bobby Jordan.<br/><br/>That's a good part of the fun watching these old shows today, and that's seeing who shows up in the stories. Another episode had Robert Vaughn as Billy the Kid, and if you were around at the time, it seemed like the prolific character actors of the era showed up in just about every TV Western at one time or another. Names like Leo Gordon, Claude Akins, Denver Pyle, Paul Brinegar, Don C. Harvey and Edgar Buchanan just to name a few. A few others like Dan Blocker (Bonanza), Jack Elam (The Dakotas) and Steve McQueen (Wanted:Dead or Alive) wound up starring in their own series, along with Connors and Landon mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>The thing I liked best about Dale Robertson's character Jim Hardie is that he could never be persuaded by arguments of moral equivalency. Hardie was the personification of doing the right thing at all times, he couldn't be bribed or sweet talked, and his word was bond with whoever he dealt with. But you know, that was a different time and place, and individuals like Jim Hardie seem to be a rare commodity today, especially in entertainment media. I guess I'm being a little wistful and nostalgic here, just thinking back on the good old days.",22 out of 22 found this helpful.,8.0,27 January 2015

1115,Tales of Wells Fargo, Good to watch it again.,"The Western Encore channel has only just recently begun to show ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" here in January of 2016. I haven't watched this black and white cowboy show since it originally aired on network television back in the late Fifties and early Sixties. I must admit that I am really enjoying watching Dale Robertson as the Wells Fargo special agent or troubleshooter. The show brings to mind ""Have Gun, Will Travel."" Hardie, like Paladin, is a man who would rather use his wits and wiles before resorting to his fists or weapon. Like Paladin, Joe Hardie, travels all over the west and into Canada, tracking down highway agents, frauds and thieves.",24 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,4 January 2017
1116,Tales of Wells Fargo," Remembering Jim Hardie and the classic Western series ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" on it's 60th anniversary","The western-adventure series ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" premiered on NBC's Prime Time schedule as a mid-season replacement on March 18,1957 where it became one of the network's biggest hits that started in a era filled with television Westerns. Out of the 200 episodes that this series produced only actor Dale Robertson(who played special agent Jim Hardie for Wells Fargo) was with the series throughout it's entire six season run in all 200 episodes. Out of the 200 episodes only Seasons 1 through 5 produced only 166 black and white episodes that ran 30 minutes in length(with commercials)airing from March 18,1957 until July 10,1961. Only the first five seasons aired on Monday nights in prime time at the 8:30 eastern/7:30 central time slot where it produced 166 black and white episodes. In the sixth and final season of the series saw a change in production when NBC moved ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" from Monday nights to Saturday nights to an earlier time slot where the show expanded to a full hour and was what NBC would say ""The Following Program Is Brought To You In Living Color"" and this time new cast members were added. The sixth and final season which moved to Saturday nights at the 7:30 eastern/6:30 central time slot where 34 color episodes were produced airing from September 30,1961 to June 2,1962.<br/><br/>""Tales of Wells Fargo"" was the brainchild of creators Frank Gruber and Gene Reynolds where Nat Holt served as executive producer of the series and was produced by Earle Lyon and Al C. Ward which produced a total of 200 episodes airing from March 18,1957 until June 2,1962. Actor William Demarest(later of ""My Three Sons"" fame)joined the cast in the final season of the series. ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" as a series was a well written satisfying western that followed the exploits of special agent Jim Hardie, agent for Wells Fargo who served during the first five seasons as narrator/agent and later on became a rancher while still protecting the law and order for Wells Fargo. <br/><br/>Big name directors from Earl Bellamy, Sidney Salkow, R.G. Springsteen, to William Witney, Christian Nyby, William F. Claxton, to George Waggner, Boris Segal and Gene Nelson contribute to some of the great episodes. Writers were Samuel A. Peeples, James Brooks, Gene Reynolds, Dwight Newton, D.D. Beauchamp, Ken Pettus, Barney Slater, Jack Turley, Sam Peckinpah, Frank Price, to Louis L'Amour and A.I. Bezzerides. ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" was produced by Revue Studios(the same studio that brought you ""Wagon Train"" and ""The Virginian"") for NBC Television. <br/><br/>The guest star roster consisted of Chuck Connors, Michael Landon, Hugh Beaumont, Robert Vaughn, Dan Blocker, James Coburn, Claude Akins, Denver Pyle, Jack Elam, Edgar Buchanan(who appeared in six episodes).

1119,Tales of Wells Fargo, Overall An above Average Western Series,"The first three seasons of the show earned the series a 10-star rating as they were near perfect. The show had a winning formula with Robertson, a tight filmed 30 minute show and Robertson's to the point narrations at the beginning and end of the show.
Seasons 4 and 5 were pretty good but for some reason they dropped Robertson's narrations from most of the episodes. There was also a drop-off in the quality of the teleplays.
Season 6, the final season, saw the show expanded one hour, Hardie becoming sort of a part-time employee of Wells Fargo, and the addition of several regulars to the show.
The new regulars came abroad to support Hardie's ranch, which became a big part of most episodes. They also a side-kick for Hardie but even the actor playing the part realized there was nothing to the role but holding the rein's of Jim's horse and quit after 13 episodes.
All of the changes could not save the show because the 1961-62 season saw hold sale cancelling of westerns, which included Tales of Wells Fargo.
It still plays on the Encore's Western channel minus season 6 if you want to see a really good western series from the heyday of Westerns.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,24 June 2019

1127,The Mist, The Mist... opportunity.,"There's a reason why the Stephen King novella was, in fact, a novella. There is only so much story you can wring out of the premise. King knew that, and so did Frank Darabont when he did the movie adaptation.<br/><br/>The TV version of The Mist, however, clearly believes this is a story that can be milked for as long as possible. After a couple of decent opening episodes, the story has slowed down to a crawl. The Mist of the title is purely there as a plot device to drive the human interest story. Now, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I doubt that is why most people are watching the show. In this show, though, the Mist is already playing increasing second-fiddle to the human drama in the same way that the zombies of The Walking Dead are now almost irrelevant to that show.<br/><br/>Six episodes in are we are already dealing with some of the most turgid and hackneyed story lines involving rape, crazy old ladies, mad doctors, and so on. The list is endless. Now, you can defend this and say the Mist is making the people act like this, but that doesn't change the fact that it is increasingly ludicrous to watch. It is putting me in mind of Shyamalan's The Happening, and that is definitely not a comparison that does it any favours.<br/><br/>The episodic nature of the show, of course, means that the story will never be as dynamic or as engaging as the movie, but even so... it is increasingly dull and predictable.<br/><br/>The choice to change the nature of the Mist, from something from another dimension, hiding monsters to a supernatural version, also seems a little weird. I get that they wanted to do something a little different with it, but honestly, the new Mist is kinda boring.<br/><br/>In fact, watching the Mist brings out the same feelings that I used to get when I was the designated driver on a lad's night out. Everyone else was having a whale of a time whilst I looked on, sober as a judge, and tried not to be embarrassed by what I was seeing. The Mist gives me that embarrassed feeling when I watch it. The sensation that I'd enjoy the whole thing a lot more if I was drunk.<br/><br/>It isn't badly made. It is decently acted. But it just doesn't make me want to tune in every week to watch it. It isn't gripping drama. It isn't scary and, after six episodes, I now have no real interest in finding out what the Mist really is, nor do I care about any of the characters in the show.<br/><br/>It's just... meh! <br/><br/>SUMMARY: Human drama (and melodrama) dressed up as horror. Not engaging and not very convincing. Read the story, or watch the movie. Both are better.",101 out of 119 found this helpful.,5.0,3 August 2017
1128,The Mist, Where do I even start!,"I rarely ever write reviews but for this I am making an exception. <br/><br/>This series didn't just disappoint me but it got me very angry. Christian Torpe should make a public apology for what he did to this show.<br/><br/>When I first heard they were making this into a TV series I was really excited, I loved the movie and I am a big fan of Stephen King's adaptations. I originally thought that they would be expanding on the novella and movie. There is so much they could have done with this story. <br/><br/>I was so excited to see more about the arrowhead project. They could have easily made a great show that revolved around just the scientists at the arrowhead project. Basically a prequel to the movie. <br/><br/>But what this guy did to the story.. Wow.. First off the mist (in my opinion) is a kind of atmosphere from another dimension, that has creatures in it. It's basically their environment, they are just following the mist. For whatever reason Torpe decided to remove the creatures for... I don't even know, hallucinations? Ghosts? Guys on Horses with arrow? COME ON! <br/><br/>Why would someone do that? The coolest parts of the book and the movie involve the creatures and the mystery of where the mist came from. How do you remove that element? <br/><br/>They barely mention the arrowhead project. They are actually leaning more toward the mist being some kind of natural disaster, how stupid!<br/><br/>Then there are the horrible characters in the series, I think its safe to say I hate all of them. The story line involving who raped the daughter is so pointless (and the person who raped her is obvious). The junky who decides to go through detox in the middle of this happening. The people in the church have no point what so ever. The people trapped in the mall is a complete rip-off of dawn of the dead. The black smoke monster from lost, the one that kills the little girl, was by far the worst special effects I have seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Honestly what where they thinking?",138 out of 171 found this helpful.,1.0,4 August 2017
1129,The Mist, They forgot to include likable people,"In The Mist we get to know a small American town in which everyone seems to want to come across as incompetent, over-reactive, small-minded, humorless but above all very unfriendly. Everyone seems to hate each other, and the few people who form the exception, the people who do not constantly act like an idiot, and thus with whom I could best identify, are also the first to die (already in episode 1). This phenomenon is increasingly seen in drama series. At the The Walking Dead I decided to discontinue watching after three seasons (I was ultimately in favor of the zombies, which is not the maker's intention I assume). What makes The Mist even easier to dismiss are the worthless special effects and terrible acting. If you make a television show that is located in a thick layer of mist, you want to make sure that the fog looks like a fog. I suspect the makers were trapped inside their own cloud of incompetence.",105 out of 133 found this helpful.,2.0,28 August 2017
1130,The Mist, I wanted to like this -- I really did,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and I really enjoyed the movie ""The Mist,"" so I assume I'm part of the target market for this show... and so far, it's been pretty disappointing. <br/><br/>Spoilers may lie ahead!<br/><br/>Here's what I was looking for in a TV-series adaptation: Danger, suspense, backstory on where The Mist comes from, how it came to be released, lots and lots of big creatures (spiders! flies! crab-like things, tentacles!), people learning how to fight with the creatures, maybe a few gung-ho idiots that die quickly and a few gung-ho idiots that succeed in some missions through the mist, smart people who make survivalist plans, crazy people who think it's the end times, a bit of mob-mentality from people scared out of their minds, and hopefully some new twists to keep the show going -- like... maybe missions to Arrowhead to plug the leak, maybe some Pacific Rim style fighting the alien invasion, maybe the US military retaliating against the mist, maybe even some MIB agents or some mythical tale about how the mist had come before and what we need to do to stop it.<br/><br/>Here's what we've got so far up through episode 4: Teenagers dealing with gender issues, rape, underage drinking, marital issues, people casually playing games and chatting while waiting out the mist in a mall (even though they've seen the mist murder people just outside the doors), a few people dying from random things we either can't see or do see for a blip and then are gone with no explanation or exploration, and apparently THIS version of the mist has some sort of magic and consciousness as it ""knows people,"" can conjure up dead people to taunt you, and gets thicker and thinner at times... oh, and the creatures are like... moths, roaches, and smoke-monsters.<br/><br/>I kid you not, 4 episodes in and people are tossing a football in the mall as if people hadn't died outside and squabbling over petty issues. A mother just saw her daughter die, yet she's calm enough to go sit on a pillow and chat about other things. She barely tried to open a door to go after her kid before a monster got her. For some reason, the mist itself IS the monster in a sense b/c people are scared to open a door to let it in... instead of it being just a fog to hide and/or sustain the monsters within it. The show is like ""Under the Dome"" meets ""The Walking Dead"" only with less suspense and less horror.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we do have a pastor who thinks it's the end times, a hippie who worships nature that thinks the creatures are manifestations of God, some soldiers who may know more about the Arrowhead project, and we have a girl who for some reason survived a smoke-monster attack. There are still plenty of people to use as fodder, and there's at least one working vehicle to use to explore. All the right notes are there to build something great on, so it's possible they could turn this around.<br/><br/>Maybe it takes 4 episodes to build some exposition... but, I doubt it. It's as if the writer/director thinks the show should be about feelings, deep societal issues, and growing pains instead of -- MONSTERS &amp; people reacting to the END OF THE WORLD as they know it.<br/><br/>I was really hoping for more of a 12 Monkeys style adaptation. Take a movie concept, add in a lot of back-story, create several long story arcs that go beyond the original movie's premise into exciting new territory with new, fun, dangerous things to figure out &amp; new bad-guys, plot twists, and adventures to explore.<br/><br/>Nah, this went all lifetime movie with some deadly fog.

The story is a re-hash of a re-hash and, even then, the main story takes a back seat to the contrived nonsense meant to inform us about the characters.

1133,The Mist, Mist Kills Everyone! I Hope!,"4/10, only because I think the Mist might win<br/><br/>Really the worst money grab I ever seen. There is nothing interesting going on in this horrific (pun intended) adaptation of a Stehen King novella. I can only imagine it is King's difficulty making condo payments that has led to this debacle.<br/><br/>The series is comically bad. Everyone in it is a stereotypical bigoted version of an everyday American. You are left desperately looking for at least one redeeming character. Even the 'rape' victim is a whiny self-absorbed brat that keeps finding herself alone with her love interest, yep you guessed it, the supposed rapist. <br/><br/>But we can forgive her for following him around can't we, he does prove to her he didn't do it, by touching her hand, then showing he can walk away. Good grief. I'm thinking we are gonna find out later he is secretly gay. It is the only way to redeem a All Star Jock-type these days. <br/><br/>The 'Reverend', every King story has one, is strangely defensive when it comes to 'his God', so much so he is threatened by a crazy lady that believes a spider she found in the church is God. <br/><br/>A coward bully cop who's son is???, you guessed it, the accused rapist, and guess who he is stuck in the same church with???, you guess it again, (if you didn't your just not paying attention) the dad of alleged victim. Awkward!!!. Let's talk about dad. <br/><br/>I think he will be the hero in the end, why, because he wrote a children's book. And if there is one thing I know about King stories is the writers that find themselves in it, are always smart intellectual-republican-hating types, that are always heroes, and they are also always white men. Just saying...<br/><br/>Back to ""The Mist"" (say it spooky) and you find that scarier than this pond-scum of a series. <br/><br/>Alyssa Sutherland, no relation, she's just a huge fan of 24, seriously, look it up. Is playing her most unlikable character to date, and I am including Vikings, where her murder was cheered the world over. She is a cheating-whore (their words, not mine, the rest are though) a murderer, a bully, and self-absorbed. She is also the mother of the supposed rape victim. <br/><br/>Sutherlands character is a know-it-all that does not like following other people's rules and this leads to the death of a child. Mommies need their wine breaks. But that's okay, they will blame that on another 'teenager' that they will send to his death, because now of course, we must follow the rules. <br/><br/>Which rule, 'Bust a deal, face the wheel', sorry wrong movie, I digress, 'make us unsafe and out side you must go' even if opening the door is the action we are accusing you of doing that led to the death we are blaming YOU for. I know, it's tough to follow the logic.<br/><br/>Even the gay kid is becoming irredeemable as we are now finding out, he is a liar about the whole, ""I saw him rape her"" scenario. I'm gong to predict, the football-jock-star-quarterback rapist he accused, is a secrete lover of his. If I am wrong, please forgive me I'm only three shows in. But I do know my King.<br/><br/>I short, I am rooting for the Mist here. So I will say a prayer to the Mother-Earth Spider-God, Please give the Mist the strength to KILL THEM ALL!!!

Very much like the movie the mist moves in and various characters get trapped in a variety of places with other characters supposedly creating tension. But there is none. Characters do stupid infuriating things. But unlike the movie there is almost nothing happening outside in the mist and what does happen is not very interesting. It's about 90% characters sitting around talking about their feelings. I know this will allow them to drag it out from a movie to a ten episode TV show and keep the budget low but it's quite tedious as the characters are not that strong.

1136,The Mist, Sub-Plotting Away The Potential,"Shows like The Mist and The Walking Dead are based on a very simple premise of threat (usually super/bio/natural) and the need for survival as a group in challenging circumstances. These shows can pull in good audiences, but it is impressive how frequently this simple premise cannot be executed boldly and instead runs off into a series of sub-plots that detract from the core premise until the core premise is lost. The Mist suffers this fate. <br/><br/>First, the premise is sound enough. The simplicity of the idea is its great attraction. The problem with this show is, like TWD the premise becomes secondary to the sub-plots and poor character decisions that then consume the show. <br/><br/>So, Stephen King penned 'The Mist' - it's an alternate take on 'The Fog' just taking the concept in a different direction. In this envisioning the Mist descends on a small town in the US cutting of communication and isolating the town. Within the realms of this genre, this is a suitable plot that comes with full license for the associated suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>We have a good set. The weakness then is the lack of courage to execute on the core premise, instead drifting into the sub plots of the various irrational characters. If this show had been given the benefit of stronger oversight of the storyline this might not have led to the shows demise and could with the right writing have seen additional seasons tagged on.<br/><br/>When a writer must fall back on the stupidity of characters to carry the story then you know the series is in trouble. Even B movies fans like intelligent characters in B movies. <br/><br/>The Mist is a missed opportunity - a show that should have had a stronger tighter focus on the core plot. Less silly character sub plots. A clearer definition of what it was and a willingness to stay true to that. <br/><br/>I believe there is still very much a market for this type of a show - if only writers of sufficient quality could be found to build the episodes that build ON the core premise, not away from it.",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,5.0,5 February 2018

The first episode revolves more around the drama of a teen girl then the mist in fact the mist is only in about the opening 2 minutes and the closing 10 minutes. the episode revolving around a girl going to a party getting drunk and getting rapped by the local football star quickly gets annoying. throw that in with the fact that every straight male character seems to be either homophobic, racist, an asshole, or a total push over and you really just want to turn off your TV. in the end I will never watch this show again and highly recommend that nobody even bothers with it seriously don't waste an hour of your life on this show.",57 out of 80 found this helpful.,1.0,1 July 2017

Even the characters that the show wants you to like are at best arrogant and endlessly self-absorbed.<br/><br/>I mean, I know that every show has to be modern and edgy these days, but do you know what would be really edgy in a modern show: At least one character who is intelligent, competent, and an emotionally well-adjusted adult.

1145,The Mist, Poor Adaption of King,"I find this to be a very poor adaption of King. One of King's best talents is making believable characters who the reader (or watcher) can somehow identify with easily. The characters in this adaption are not realistic nor can I identify with any of them or really care about any of them. The horror elements of the King novella are missing, the monsters in the mist are gone so this has become more of a soap opera with characters who and poorly drawn. Worst of all this series just drags not excitement, no caring about what the mist is, and it should not have been a 10 segment series.

1146,The Mist, Avoid,"This is a quick review. First I am not offended neither did I notice any ""Social Justice"" in the series, Stephen Kings books often portrait racism, woman abuse, and bullying, so even if the series had that in abundance it would not make it a ""Social Justice Warrior"" wannabe Mist, it would be a regular Stephen King adaptation. Unfortunately, the series is a weak adaptation, the acting is poor, the effects are cheap, really low budget, the editing is awful, and the directing is B-movie at best, the cinematography is atrocious, nothing is worse then a ""cool"" shot horribly done and poorly centered, like in the third episode, some wings burst of a guys back, and it's just bad. The story is blend, the characters are boring, and the greatest offence...three episodes in and no monsters.<br/><br/>if the series picks up I will be seriously impressed, because the way I see it, down is the only way it has.",143 out of 228 found this helpful.,3.0,26 June 2017
1147,The Mist, People Were The Real Monsters,"'The Mist' has all the same problems that 'Under The Dome' had; It doesn't represent a community of people fairly. The TV series has unreasonable people from the start. The movie had a store full of people that were neither good nor bad ... well, one was pretty crazy ... but when they become frightened they become irrational.<br/><br/>That's the whole point of the story: How everyday human beings can go stupid when they're horrified or outraged.<br/><br/>I did read through a few reviews pointing out political messaging, which is fair enough. I don't really care about the message, most shows have a message. My problem is where the film showcased how regular people can become monsters; The TV series parrots the media representation of bad cops, toxic masculinity, homophobia, women's issues, gun control and drug addiction. There's no genuine medium or gray areas to explore. It's all-or-nothing without discussion.<br/><br/>Lastly - There's no monsters. That's unbelievably ridiculous.

Pure genius!,"Many of my all time favourite TV shows haven't been the ones hyped to death, but the obscure ones that you ""discover"" for yourself. 'Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law' is a case in point. I don't know if it achieved any kind of audience in the US, but it suddenly appeared out of nowhere here in Australia and was shown at an odd time slot with little fanfare. A friend caught the Scooby Doo episode and when he described it to me, I knew this was a show I just HAD to see! So I managed to catch the ""Unabooboo"" episode, then the one where Jabbajaw and The Neptunes are accused of plagiarism, and last night I watched the Flintstones/Sopranos episode, which was pure genius! I am now hooked for life! For anybody who hasn't seen the show it features Birdman the 60s Hanna Barbera cartoon character reinvented as Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. Each episode he defends a cartoon client accused of some crime e.g. Shaggy and Scooby Doo for dope, Fred Flintstone for racketeering. Plus there are lots of strange gay in-jokes and surreal bits and pieces which make it one of the most demented things I've seen since vintage 'Ren and Stimpy'. My favourite characters are Reducto and Birdman's nutty eye-patch wearing boss.

Scrappy-Doo then makes a brief appearance at the end, but is then lifted up and carried away by Birdman's falcon sidekick.

1156,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law"," Along with Family Guy, one of the funniest shows","I was a huge fan of Space Ghost Coast to Coast when it was introduced back in 1994 (it has lost a lot since 2000). It was hilarious to see these 60's characters making references to their past incarnations (which were awful) and how they made fun of them. It was great to see Space Ghost believe he was greater than he actually was. I consider this aspect and the idea of the talk show with live action stars to be not only creative but also one of the most original and funny concepts ever.<br/><br/>Now we have Harvey Birdman, based on the same principle as Space Ghost C to C, but expanding on the ""let's make fun of all the crappy Hanna Barbera animations of the 60's"" concept, which is simply great.<br/><br/>The series were introduced in 2001 when Cartoon Network launched Adult Swim, but after a few episodes it disappeared. Thankfully, it wasn't because of low ratings but because they were making more episodes, and each one is even funnier than the one before.<br/><br/>The constant reference to old cartoons and characters is just amazingly funny and, contrary to what some people have posted here, I am well under thirty but I have seen all the re- runs from the original shows in CN, so I believe that it has a larger audience than some people give it credit for.<br/><br/>All the characters are great, starting with Birdman himself. I just finished watching one where the judge is Mentok. That character is hilarious. He is constantly trying to show how great his mental control powers are. It's crazy.<br/><br/>If somebody hasn't seen it yet, please give it a try.

1157,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", Can you file this under Phantom comma Funky?,"I'll admit not everything on adult swim tickles my fancy. I first stumbled upon it with friends on a Friday night in a hazy state of mind half way through an episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. We believed to be a genuine cartoon and laughed hysterically. Needless to say the next week, stone cold sober, meatwad didn't quite have the same appeal. Harvey Birdman Attorney At Law, however, is downright hilarious. It has underhanded satire similar to a 'Family Guy' flashback. I believe this type of camp, sarcastic, pop humor only appeals to a limited audience, however if you don't find at least portions of this show amusing or clever then you're an empty cold shell of a human being.<br/><br/>The great appeal of the show is the cameo appearances of your favorite childhood cartoon stars. I guess I love to see Harvey Birdman ruin that childhood image. As I write this I picture the Jetsons overnight struggle to get to Harvey's desk without the aid of their futuristic travelators, half way through their plight Astro collapses and pleads with the rest of the family to go on without him. Besides, who doesn't want to see Shaggy and Scooby get busted? Hauled to jail because of the damning evidence in the Mystery Machine of empty pizza boxes and clips? Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law is definitely the best thing on adult swim, my only complaint is the episodes aren't long enough and it's not on DVD yet.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,,8 November 2004
1158,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", As funny as it is weird,"I first came across Birdman while on holiday in Majorca when I was 13. I remember vividly watching it with these 2 hot German twins and laughing whenever he shouted 'Bi-ii-irdMAN'. It was really, really corny. But this was back in the day when Cartoon Network didn't have much to show other than the really old-fashioned 1960's and 70's stuff. The last thing I ever imagined is that Birdman would come back in the 21st century to be re-invented as Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law at the Sebben and Sebben law firm.<br/><br/>He's a bit of a dunderhead. And a bighead and a sociophobe and rude but you can't help but love him. Avenger is still his sidekick (only cuter than he was previously) and his boss is Phil Ken Sebben, a one-eyed ladies man. Among the various, random people who work for the firm are Peanut (a Birdman wannabe), Peter Potamus, Reducto and a big cuddly bear who always seems to be smiling (and applauding all on his own at inappropriate moments). My fave character has to be Judge Mentok the Mindtaker (OOOOO-EEEEEE-OOOOOO-EEEEEE!!!!), he just really, really funny.<br/><br/>Harvey's typical cases involve him defending the likes of Shaggy and Scooby, Fred Flintstone, Boo-Boo and George Jetson. Getting in the way of cases going smoothly are and abundance of rapid-fire jokes that come at you from all angles and will probably disorientate you if you're not sure where they're coming from. Sometimes you might have to watch an episode twice as the the dialogue is usually delivered very quickly and you might lose your place among the cryptic references and wildly outlandish humor.<br/><br/>In truth, it's a show for Adults. Even though the jokes are only mildly suggestive there is no way a child could fully understand everything that is going on unless they are an uber-uber-geek. This is a show made for people who love stuff like Family Guy, not Spongebob Squarepants.<br/><br/>Oh, and I love that theme song. They must release some kind of soundtrack CD for this show. Why?

1159,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", Must see TV,"This is my favorite 15 minutes of the week!  Hapless, second-rate H-B superhero Birdman is now a hapless second-rate lawyer, defending various twisted former H-B stars like the cast of Jabberjaw and the now clearly homo-erotic Jonny Quest, etc.  Race Bannon (well, sort of Race Bannon) suing Dr. Quest for custody of Jonny, Hadji, and Bandit after a, uh, lover's tiff? Hapless and hyper-paranoid former Birdman antagonist Dr. Reducto opining over the good old days (""Back when I was a kid, if a someone brandished a Shrink Ray, he'd get some respect!""), becoming smitten with a witness (""No one told me your feet would be so - tiny!""), and threatening everyone in the courtroom to ""Back Off!  I'll make you travel size!""?<br/><br/>    Most people would be completely mystified as to why this would be funny. I thought about it for a while, and I think unless you had watched the old series' on which this show draws, you would have no idea whatsoever what the heck was going on. You pretty much have to be a male between 38-42 to truly appreciate it. That's a pretty small target audience. <br/><br/>   Even if you do recognize the characters, it's so surreal that you will be amazed. Seeing a giant grab and the mechanical spider/eyeball monster testifying to Race Bannon's bond with the kids defies description.<br/><br/>
  One odd thing about this series is that the characters are much better defined than the originals. Back in the 60's, the writing was almost non-existent. Somebody must have written up one or two story outlines, and just randomly used them to generate every episode of Birdman, Space Ghost, The Herculoids, etc, by substituting characters. Could have done it with a computer. This show fairly well written and I think this is what ultimately makes it funny - these absurdly flat characters you remember have internal lives, and for some reason this makes it funny.",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,,6 November 2002

I admit I was skeptical at first but once I watched the show I thought it was hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing. The idea to reincarnate Birdman and other second rate H-B characters is brilliant, its like they grew up and got real jobs. The writing is excellent, and so is the voice work, Stephen Colbert is at the top of his game playing the roll of Phil Ken Sebben and my personal favorite Myron Reducto. Another standout performance is given by John Michael Higgins as Mentok the Mindtaker. A mixture of Sophomoric and sophisticated humor may make a great show but it doesn't necessarily mean great ratings which is sad.

1170,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", Funny in a really weird way  best in small doses,"Harvey Birdman has long since had his day as a superhero but has now taken up a job as a lawyer at the firm of Sebben and Sebben. The move offers him a welcome change of pace but he still finds himself surrounded by all the same strange characters and goings-on.<br/><br/>I have seen this series advertised when in the US in the past but never bothered to stay up and watch it, however on my last visit I gave it a try. The show is hard to describe because it is just very weird. The characters and basic plots spoof the world of the square-jawed superheroes and supervillians by placing them in the office environment and making their characters even more exaggerated. Birdman himself is the most obvious example as he is now a bit of a fool despite his massive chest, although I also really enjoy the eye-patch sporting, womanising boss Sebben. It is all a bit too silly at times and some of it just occasionally feel like it is being weird just for the sake of it but, for me, the majority of the superhero spoof aspect carried it well enough.<br/><br/>The animation is true to the superhero genre and everything looks good with plenty of imaginative touches all round. The voice work is enjoyably silly with Gary Cole doing a great job in the lead role. Colbert is just as good as Phil, really getting into the feel of the character and the series. The support cast are generally good with some unusual guest voices in there.<br/><br/>Overall this is an acquired taste and naturally some will love it while other hate it. For me it was enjoyable enough to take in small doses  too much at once would just get tiresome but in 15 minute bites it is weirdly funny and entertaining.

1173,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", One of My Favorite Adult Swim Shows,"Introduction:
No comedy is like ""Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law"". Taking advantage of old Hannah Barbara characters that everybody has forgotten about, and makes something memorable and hilarious. This show is a master at running gags and joke, as well as just good comedy.<br/><br/>The Comedy:
The comedy of this show can be analyzed. There are so many running gags and hidden jokes, that these jokes often conflict and get tangled with other jokes. Either: inside jokes, hidden references, or long running gags. You can pause any frame of this show, and find something to laugh at. And even with the kind of comedy, it is still able to deal with serious issues, such as, gun control, terrorism, and even gay marriage: while still tackling it in a way that it is still hilarious to watch.<br/><br/>The Characters:
The show is not just funny for the running gags and references, but also the great characters. The interactions between them are some of the funniest moments on television. Out of all of them, my favorite character was Phil. Just the way he was so oblivious to everything and not aware of any real danger, creates hilarious antics. And I give similar praises to all the other characters.<br/><br/>The Animation:

1174,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law"," Ridiculous Fun, Very Bizarre,","Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law is a great television series with well written episodes and a top notch voice cast. It is a really bizarre show that fans of both Adult Swim's content and Hanna Barbera cartoons will enjoy. The characters, most of whom are based off original HB characters, are terrific, with a lot of scope and personality put in to them in just 11 minute programmes, Harvey and Phil stand out in particular. <br/><br/>However, it does suffer from the same problem as most Adult Swim shows, in that it sometimes gets too convoluted for its own good. There are episodes that go to uncomfortable places that are not even humorous, more so just looking for a reaction. <br/><br/>The voice cast is all around tremendous, Gary Cole is top notch as Harvey, making his ridiculous dialogue always sound authentic, and Stephen Colbert knocks it out of the park in his various roles. There are also many great guest appearances throughout the forty episodes, a lot of whom reprise characters they voiced in the shows their from, such as Frank Welker as Fred Jones, Scott Innes as Shaggy &amp; Scooby and Maurice LeMarche as Droopy, it was amazing to see how many people got behind this insanity. <br/><br/>Ridiculously weird and enjoyable. Strange from the get go, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law certainly is not for everyone, but who it is for will love it. <br/><br/>

1175,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", The Power... Of Attorney!!!,"Out of all of the Adult Swim shows this one is one of the best. It follows Harvey Birdman, a superhero gone attorney who went to a 3-hour law school, works with a purple hippo, and whose boss can't wait to fire him. Some situations show Shaggy and Scooby-Doo smoking pot, Race Bannon fighting for custody, and Secret Squirrel flashing people. All of these situations are handled masterfully and couldn't have been done better. If you're looking for a fun Hanna Barbera attorney romp you're in the right place.

1176,"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law", lovely cult classic,"This is a very funny show, the voices are great, I actually quite like the animation style and the humor is right up my alley. I'd call it masterpiece to be honest, the way it deals with both serious matters and just stupid, silly things, while making it all still fun and enjoyable. The show can organically move between topics like race, gender, sexuality, identity and a guy who likes to shrink things loving big butts. <br/><br/>I'd call this one of my favorite animated shows, sure it might not be the best or it might be forgotten, but it does hold a place in my heart as the show that showed me - a little, small, stupid child at the time, that it was completely OK to take cartoons seriously and really look at situations from all perspectives. That might not be what other people took away from it, but somehow it truly did affect me. <br/><br/>Also the humor is right up my alley.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,9.0,29 August 2016
1177,The New Batman Adventures, A decent Sequel with some nagging flaws.,"Overall Gotham Nights isn't as good as The Animated Series. For starters the show has been over sylized, so much so that it loses the heart and feel that TAS had. Some key examples of this would be the new Batmobile, Joker, Poison Ivy and Harley. The Characters don't have the depth they had in TAS, they come off as silly little cartoon characters. And the Joker keeps coming off as a common thug, not the Psychotic genius he should be. Bruce Wayne is too cold and calculating instead of a tortured soul fighting for justice.<br/><br/>But the show has its ups, Some of the storylines really benefit from the increased flexibility offered by WB. The crossover with supergirl really shows this. And the inclusion of Nightwing is awesome, he really adds some much needed depth to the show. His struggle with Bruce was really well handled, with the exception of Bruce being so cold as mentioned above.<br/><br/>Overall the show is still better then 99% of TV today, but doesn't quite live up to the greatness that was TAS.",32 out of 35 found this helpful.,,4 May 2004
1178,The New Batman Adventures, Has its good parts but is frustratingly inconsistent,"As much as I love Batman and Batman:The Animated Series(one of the best animated shows in general), while there are some undeniably good elements there are one too many frustrating ones too.<br/><br/>Pros: The voice acting is superb, Kevin Conroy is the embodiment of Batman and always has been. Mark Hamill brings menace and gravitas to the Joker. There are some effective villains too, Penguin, Nightwing and Scarecrow were the best ones for me. Likewise with some compelling story lines, the overall standard is not as dark or complex as Batman: The Animated Series and some of the animated movies but there are some well-written ones, Old Wounds, Joker's Millions and Sins of the Father were a few of the standouts. The dialogue has its sharpness also, and the action has some exciting moments.<br/><br/>Cons: The animation is a disappointment. Everything here looks too bright and pointy. The brightness jarred with the dark, haunting atmosphere often associated with Batman, which I also found generally lacking in The New Batman Adventures, and I hated the designs of Joker and Catwoman. The characters vary in terms of interest, more leaning towards the disappointing end of the spectrum, Nightwing and Penguin are the most interesting, however Joker is too thuggish often in manner. Batman occasionally is dark and brooding though this is more on Conroy's part than the writing but he also comes across as too cold. Tim is annoyingly childish and Barbara Gordon feels out of place.<br/><br/>As an overall whole, has the voice acting, a few of the villains and some good story lines in its favour but the animation, lack of atmosphere and the way some of the characters are written makes the show inconsistent and frustratingly so. 6/10 Bethany Cox",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,6.0,10 September 2012
1179,The New Batman Adventures, Good but Not Great,"Okay, I LOVED the original TAS. I simply liked New adventures. There were just so many nagging things in the new series that annoyed me.<br/><br/>1. Batman's new dark attitude made him less appealing--that goes for Dick too. Their characters made this leap into a dark and much too serious tone for my tastes. Seriously? Where was the fun? The quips. Gone.<br/><br/>2.I did not like the new designs. Especially for my favorite villain (the joker). The new designs were just so sharp and pointy and it was really hard for me to get over the fact that the joker had no pupils and everyone pretty much had no chin. I could go on forever but I'll make it short and sweet--thumbs down on the ""art"".<br/><br/>3.The story lines were still almost as good, but the the characters didn't follow up. Barbra Gordon seemed slightly out of place whether it was because she was the only character (besides Tim--but he wasn't in the original...thankfully) that retained the positive hero mentality that I loved so much in the original. The voice acting was stupendous as always though thank you Kevin Conroy,Mark Hamill and Mathew Valencia. I don't like Tara Strong's voice but she did fine. Anyway, I think ""The Creeper"" was one of my favorites from this series because it seemed to go back to a more lighthearted feel. The part were the Creeper totally just punches Batman without looking was hilarious. That and Harley and the Joker get some of their infamous banter that wasn't as dark as in ""Mad Love"". ""Joker's Millions"" was much better than ""Mad Love"" because it shows that Harley's not a complete pushover when she haha 'reprimands' the Joker for trying to replace her. There are moments when the episodes just click, but then the terrible art and the way Batman acts (or doesn't respond at all) just ruin it.<br/><br/>Anyway, As far as the story lines go as a whole I think the ones involving the Joker and Harley were the best because that stayed more true to their characters from TAS that I loved so much. On the other hand through out the entire New Adventures series Batman is completely out of balance he's just this cold calculating mess that can't cope without THREE OTHER SIDEKICKS. Batman should have had more lines and actually REACTED to what was happening around him. Instead of standing there with a frown on his face 24/7. Batman lost so much dimension in the new series. Dick is well, to put it bluntly--a dick. Barbra serves almost no purpose simply because she's poorly written into the cast except for ""Over the Edge"" which I thought was a brilliant use of Barbra's character. Tim Drake is overkill and simply there until ""Sins of a Father"" when you suddenly realize oh he's here for a reason--to star in this two part thingy. Yay. Not so much. In BTAS Robin wasn't there when his character would be useless but Tim Drake was so relentlessly useless-AND ALWAYS THERE. On a little side note, if Tim Drake's hadn't been cast so young he may not have been so irritating to me. Seriously,he was like:'Tim Drake the toddler'. Too small.<br/><br/>4. Overall, it was okay. Without the bad art I might have been able to tolerate Batman and Dicks new extremely cold and negative attitudes and the really annoying addition of Tim Drake. I don't know why they decided to so drastically change everything about the original. The new adventures story lines could have been just as new and fresh without the blah art and the complete revamp of the characters attitudes. So,it's worth the watch but just as fun and dynamic as I would've liked.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,,2 August 2009
1180,The New Batman Adventures, I'm interested in Batman not this smart-mouth Robin...,"Oh where, oh where is Batman...<br/><br/>I loved Batman's portrayal in the 1992 animation and in JL/U, but here we hardly see anything of the conflict/problems of being Batman and Bruce Wayne.<br/><br/>And this Tim version of Robin has to be one of the most annoying sidekicks ever. They're trying way to hard to make him cool to ten year olds and his presence has made the show virtually unwatchable.

1182,The New Batman Adventures, Not good enough... but still great!,"I liked it... just that... i liked it, not like the animated series... i love it!!!. The fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate, but this cartoon was awesome, but it really didn't like it that much. There's too much people talking about Bruce being so cold, but if this is around 5 years later, anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude, so to me it isn't a flaw. Batgirl was awesome she really fit there, as there isn't more Dick Grayson as a robin, batman needed a good teammate, not like the new robin, he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child. But heres what didn't work: The new artwork... it isn't horrible but... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman. This is a dark character, with a maniac killer like the joker, so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon, The joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker (but to me the BEST joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond:return of the joker) , so this joker isn't near as good. The good thing about the joker is that it still mark Hamil voice. My favorite character: Harley Quinn (im in love for her) They put an awesome episode for her: Mad love (to me the best episode of this series). Here we finally know how she turned Harley Quinn, and how the joker twisted her mind, and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series, darker, no happy ending, brutal fight with the joker (but too short), this is how it was to be ALL the series. BUT in general i didn't like how she made Harley in this series... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way, she get punched, she say nonsenses, she make flaws... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her, not from her... and here they put ridiculous (like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper) So in general its a good series, it has it upsides and downs, the drawn could be better ( MY GOOD!!! KILL THAT CATWOMAN!!!!) nice sound effects, nice music, nice voices and nice episodes: my favorites, Mad love, Jokers millions, Old Wounds, Sins of the father, and Cold comfort. If you enjoyed Batman:TAS you can watch this but don't spec too much, in the other hand if you didn't watched TAS, watch this first and then watch TAS in that way you're really gonna love TAS :D",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,8.0,15 November 2009
1183,The New Batman Adventures," A good show, but not as good as the original series","The New Batman Adventures (also called Gotham Knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of Batman: the Animated Series (B:TAS) and only aired for 24 episodes. This isn't a horrible show, but it just isn't as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I'll start with all the things that I found not to be very good.<br/><br/>First thing's first, the animation itself: Gotham isn't dark anymore, the sky is always bright red and orange, B:TAS did this also, but it was drawn on a dark palate, so the colour of the sky was more ominous, in this show, it is too bright. It all just looks like any other kids show and doesn't seem unique like Batman: TAS did with it's dark, cool art style on Gotham. The art style is good, but doesn't remind me of Batman anymore. Every character is comprised of straight lines, squares, and triangles making characters look less human-like. In the original series (B:TAS), characters look more like drawn versions of real people. The animation may be more consistent here than in B:TAS, but it definitely isn't as good. <br/><br/>Next: some of the episodes seem too dumbed down and childish, but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in B:TAS.(Two-Face attempting to kill Tim Drake/Robin 2, and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment). This leads me to my next point.<br/><br/>Because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the Batman Animated Universe, many villains do meet their demise or leave forever. Poison Ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes (though she returns later in Static Shock); Two-Face nearly kills Penguin, Killer Croc, and himself, so he's moved to Arkham forever; Joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (though he will return later in the Justice League Animated Series); Catwoman moves away to France leaving Batman, etc... Just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters! The villains' motives are pretty bad, too; For the most part, there are none! In B:TAS, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, that's why they act the way they do, in this show, the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story. It's like Batman just doesn't even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights, he just beats them senseless. This Batman is a colder and meaner version of the character, but since he's been doing this job for years, I can see why he is so harsh. <br/><br/>Next, the redesigned character models: most of them are awful. Gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds... is he sick? Many villains look STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter, and Killer Croc are among the WORST). Although, I do think that some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same, and Ivy (who is even hotter now) has pale green skin.<br/><br/>With the series having some faults, many of the episodes are great- Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware the Creeper, Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight, and Never Fear are my favourite ones here. All of the crossovers featuring Batman in the Superman Animated Series were great, also.<br/><br/>The part about this show that really irritated me is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. On the DVD features of the original Batman Animated Series, they talk about how proud they were with the art style, and how difficult some characters were to animate, but they did eventually succeed with (the difficult animation necessary to animate Clayface, for example). On the DVD features of the New Batman Adventures, the creators essentially say that they preferred this cartoon to the original because of its tighter animation. When the creators casted away the amazing art style of B:TAS it really annoyed me!<br/><br/>It's not a bad show, it is very good, but it is not as excellent as the original animated series. At least this show doesn't talk down to its audience, so for that reason, I still commend it. And about 75% of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching more than once. <br/><br/>Superman: the Animated Series, and Justice League: the Animated Series are great follow-up shows to Batman: TAS and The New Batman Adventures, so give them a watch as well.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,7 December 2008
1184,The New Batman Adventures," Fans of Batman, avoid this!","If this series supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series, I, for one, think it failed terribly. The character drawing is lousy... (Catwoman, for instance, looks awful...) But what really annoyed me is that it made Batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman's allies, besides Robin, but still... making Batman say that he needs help from them... What, he can't handle a few punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem... He's getting old? Come on...<br/><br/>And another thing: I really don't think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon, without years of hard training. One, it's irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, it's not what happened in the comics, if we are to remain faithful to them.<br/><br/>Batman - The Animated Series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters... That really was a legend of Batman. The New Adventures series turned the legend into just another Batman flick.",16 out of 29 found this helpful.,7.0,8 October 2006
1185,The New Batman Adventures, Almost as good as the original,"Two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. I still enjoyed as much as I did the original though.<br/><br/>Some flaws they had though like changing the Joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils, hes still voiced by Mark Hamill which is a plus I guess. They made Poison Ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and Catwomen looks much different and not as ""attractive"" as she was in the original.<br/><br/>Though costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look badass, especially Scarecrow.<br/><br/>The show isn't as dark as the original because Batman doesn't work as alone as he used to. Most of the time working with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing(Dick Grayson) comes to the rescue often. Batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass.<br/><br/>The show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite.

1186,The New Batman Adventures," A good show, but lacks the brilliance of the original.","Being a huge Batman fan, and a huge fan of B:TAS, You have to be a fan of TNBA. But although it's a good series, it doesn't match the sheer brilliance of the original.<br/><br/>I like the look of this show. It's certainly a lot smoother, and I love the red night background that they used. However, I'm not a big fan of the big character changes. The only exception being Batman himself. He looked pretty cool. The Joker, Penguin, Killer Croc, and even to a degree The Scarecrow, I feel they didn't really need a re-vamp as they looked perfect as they did back in the original. One of the problems I have with the series. And The Riddler, they changed everything about him yet never even had a Riddler episode, which disappoints me, as he is one of the more interesting villains.<br/><br/>But having said all that, some of the episodes are fantastic, and make up for some of the problems with the series, ""Over the Edge"", ""Sins of the Father"", ""Cold Comfort"", ""Legends of the Dark Knight"", ""Mad Love"", to name a few. Furthermore, the character of Nightwing is really well portrayed, and really shines in the episode ""Old Wounds"".<br/><br/>To sum up, this series has more not-so-good episodes than BTAS, but as mentioned previously, there are few stand-out episodes which at least match the brilliance of the original. Which sums the show up, not as good as the predecessor by a long shot, but is still an essential for any Bat-fan.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,26 September 2011
1187,The New Batman Adventures," Despite Getting Used To, Still a Great Series","I have to admit, I did have to try to get used to the new look of all the characters, since I was used to how the Batman series was portrayed by Fox. But once I got used to it, I fell in love with this series. I actually felt some were given better looks than some others. In this particular series, it says that two years have passed since the Sub Zero video movie. I wasn't crazy about Batman's new (or should I say old)look. I never thought Batman would ever return to the original black bat emblem and a pouch shaped utility belt. I did however feel that Bruce Wayne looked much better, even though he is now portrayed as a man who never smiles and is nearly impossible to make laugh and he is revealed to be a perfect taskmaster. In addition, Kevin Conroy as of this series, used the same voice for both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I this series, Batgirl is now a regular team player and a member of Batman's crime fighting team. <br/><br/>While I like the Tim Drake version of Robin in the comics, I didn't care for him in the beginning of these episodes, when Tim was probably 12 or 13, but I got used to him by series end due to his voice changing. <br/><br/>I love Nightwing. Dick Grayson's reborn identity. I also like that he and Batman do not get along or at least, there is miscommunication between them.<br/><br/>As for the villains. the only thing I did not care about was Joker having no red lips. The Penguin is now a legitimate business man, who operates a club called the Iceberg Lounge. Yet it seems that all the villains have changed radically. <br/><br/>As for favorite episodes, mine were"" Holiday Knights, Sins of the Father (murder of Tim's father and how Tim suits up as Robin for the first time). Cold Comfort (even though turning Mr. Freeze into an insect body that attatches to a mechanical suit is a bit much), it was still eerie to watch. Over the Edge (what if Batman and Commissioner came to blows), Any episodes with Nightwing (sadly, they only made four of them). Beware the Creeper and Mad Love were superb as well as Legends of the Dark Knight with different variations of Batman being told by several kids. <br/><br/>Perhaps my all time favorite episode of this series, is Old Wounds. Where Nightwing tells the new Robin of his final outing as Robin and his falling out with Batman. That is one episode you need to watch. In it, we see Dick Grayson's last adventure as Robin before quitting. One more episode to remember was Girls Nite Out, a Batgirl/Supergirl team up. I only wish they could have made more than 24 of these episodes, though we did get one DVD movie animated in this style. I'm also glad this series is not only out on DVD, but it completed Batman: The Animated Series, over 100 episodes. Give this series a try.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,20 December 2005
1188,The New Batman Adventures, Series started to go bad,"First of all I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best batman series by far. We watched it when it used to be on TV. I didn't realize that there was a season four. Actually there wasn't. BTAS ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there.<br/><br/>Why did they have to mess with a good thing. Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible grey faces. The Joker looks beyond scary, it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier. He doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is).<br/><br/>Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who does the best batman. Although he now looks like superman. There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes.<br/><br/>Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred just has pupils from eyes, looks more like a character from the 80's.<br/><br/>I have watched three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in every episode).<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is no batman season 4.

I like a lot of the ""Batman"" episodes that aired on FOX (when the show was under the title ""Batman: The Animated Series"").  It's just that the animation in these late '90s installments are better.  Since Warner Brothers owns Batman, I like the fact that they could finally have more creative freedom on the WB network than what they had on FOX.<br/><br/>For example, when the show moved to WB, we finally got to see the pyromaniac Firefly (Unfortunately, he wasn't allowed appear on B:TAS while the show was running on FOX).  He appeared in only two episodes (""Torch Song"" and ""Legends of the Dark Knight""), and should have been featured more often like many other Bat-villains (Joker, Two-Face, Penguin, Catwoman, etc.).

Nightwing is introduced on this series and hopefully in the next couple of years Bruce Timm will make a Nightwing series. Tim Drake is cool personified. Batgirl on this show is really good and she is the star of one of the best episodes of all the Batman Shows(including The Animated series). In this episode, she is drugged by the Scarecrow and has a dream that she dies and her father, Commissioner Jim Gordon, makes a vow to have Batman killed. For a minute I actually thought that Batgirl had really died and it wasn't until the end of the show that you find out it was all a dream. That was a superb episode. Bruce Timm and his people should be the only people allowed to make animated Batman cartoons. I give Gotham nights a 15/10. It is that damn good.<br/><br/>Batman in all of Bruce Timm's incarnations are great. If the movies would have followed this cartoon even a little, they would have been aeon's better then they were.

I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines, great animation (better then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing that I didn't like was that was when it was in the US it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. I just wish some of the episodes could be longer.

1198,The New Batman Adventures, I liked it,"I'm giving The new adventures of batman or batman the animated series season 4 10 stars because the first time I saw it on sale I didn't give it a chance because saw the change in the animation on the pictures on the box. And I'm looking at other user reviews on this site and nobody is off the bat saying how much they really like it. I can say that it wasn't what I thought it was in a good way I thought that they had turned robin into a kid but no hes a new side kick Tim drake red robin ,there's night wing who was the original robin. but there are those changes in the animation some pro's well more pro's in my opinion than con's .Scarecrow doesn't look like a pushover anymore he actually looks like a nightmare.OK This series turns up the adult content in episode 1 season 1 batman gets shot in the arm nobody ever got shot in the first 3 seasons there is an episode explaining the origins of Harley quin. where there's obvious sexual reference that you really notice as an adult. there are other sexual things in other episodes the dare devil lady.on the rocket with batman vocalizing sexually.the sound effects hit hard oh yeah and people bleed. wonder how the networks and producers got comfortable and turned up the violence and sexuality with this series.i liked killer crock in Grey skin in the first 3 seasons they changed bruce wayne he has blue eyes.they changed poison ivy.batgirl is all over this series.there's evan supergirl in one episode basically I give it 10 stars because if your a fan of the first 3 seasons and you look at pictures of the animation and get disappointed because its changed from the good stuff your used too that you didn't feel needed any change. I can say that this fits perfectly as being called season 4 of the animated series. if you liked the first 3 you will like season 4 if you've seen all the first 3 complete your batman the animated series collection with season 4 it is incomplete with out it",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,20 September 2017
1199,The New Batman Adventures, A great follow-up to BTAS,"So a lot of people do not like the direction taken with certain redesigns of some characters and Batman's cold attitude in this one. I agree to a point but this series was pretty damn excellent. First of all it's worth noting that I consider this and BTAS the same thing (TNBA was pretty much the final 2 seasons of BTAS) Just with redesigned animation style and characters.<br/><br/>Now, some of the characters new designs were terrible (Catwoman, Selina kyle, Poison Ivy etc.) But some made the characters better in my opinion and some looked a lot more streamlined. For example, Batman's new outfit gave him a much more dark and serious look. Batgirl's outfit was made to look like the way she does in the comics and I think the colour scheme is better. Penguin actually looks like a human being in this one.<br/><br/>Storywise, TNBA has some pretty strong storytelling. Such as ''Over the Edge'' which depicts Batgirl's death (It turns out to be a dream don't worry) and ''Growing Pains'' when Robin looks out for a lost little girl (It gets quite emotional).<br/><br/>Another thing I admire about TNBA is the fact that other members of the Bat family got more attention like Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl. It's a shame that the series didn't go on for longer because I quite liked the episodes that brought out other characters (Like ''Girl's Night Out'') and I feel like they didn't get enough time to get their stories told before the plug was pulled on TNBA.<br/><br/>Overall I wouldn't say either BTAS or TNBA was better because they were both great in their own ways and both opened up the DC:AU and spawned many great stories(and also as I said I consider them both to be the same thing)You can't argue with the talent of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill who both deliver brilliant performances. This series had a great run and I wish it was on a bit longer to give the other characters some air time. Wasn't a huge fan of Batman Beyond and I honestly would have preferred for this to have been continued.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,17 February 2013

1202,Blackadder, The Original and Best,"This is the first, and in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series - although the second installment runs a very close second. This series, in retrospect, is often dismissed as less funny than its successors and this may be due to its different style and sense of humour. This comparison unfortunately causes the viewer to miss what makes this series such an excellent piece of comedy writing and production.<br/><br/>The whole series centres on Edmund (Rowan Atkinson), the son of the younger of the two princes who in history were murdered in the Tower of London, allegedly by Richard III. In this take on history, where real history is dismissed as being rewritten by Henry Tudor, the princes were not murdered and Richard Duke of York grows up 'to be a strong boy'. The first episode of the series lays the foundation, explaining how Richard III dies, how Edmund's father becomes King and also the important, accidental, foretelling by three Witches (a clever alude to the witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth) to Edmund that one day he will be King. The rest of the series follows Edmund in his attempts to realise this foretelling.<br/><br/>Edmund's definite goal throughout the series, which forms the basis of the subsequent plotlines, gives it a direction perhaps missing in the following series, and it also gives his character more depth. Blackadder (as he names himself), in this series, is significantly different to his persona of the subsequent time-periods - being slimy, selfish and not particularly bright. There is a definite bond between the main characters, Blackadder and his sidekicks, Percy and Baldrick (excellently played by Tim McInnerny and Tony Robinson respectively) and although Blackadder treats his underlings with contempt at times, they collaborate as a team throughout in a series of 'cunning plans'. Baldrick is indeed the intelligent character of the group, the man in the know and his character has much more depth than his smelly and stupid character of later series.<br/><br/>Each plot in the series follows a similar pattern - Blackadder getting himself into a situation and having to get himself out of it. The humour presented is more subtle, relying more on the use of visual comedy, language and historical satire than on blind sarcasm. Many of the gags are implied and expect the viewer to work out the meaning as opposed to ramming it down their throats. Additionally, the script contains a number of lines that cleverly misuse Shakespeare for added effect, a classic example being Richard III calling for 'my horse, my horse my kingdom for a horse' in the style of someone calling for his dog. The supporting cast all play their part superbly, particularly Brian Blessed as Richard IV, the maniacal war-monger who hates his slimy son and fails to get his name right. The late, great Peter Cook also makes an appearance as Richard III in the first episode.<br/><br/>This series must be watched out of context with what followed. It was not written for the popular market, being first screened on BBC2. Watch it, laugh, then watch it again to catch some of the gags you missed the first time. Comedy written this well is unfortunately extremely rare, and to dismiss it without appreciating its aims does not do it justice. This series not only shows Rowan Atkinson at his very best, but also the writing of Richard Curtis (and Atkinson) and it is an overlooked classic of British comedy.",77 out of 83 found this helpful.,,13 December 2000

The second series is a lot better with Queen Elizabeth I played by the wonderful Miranda Richardson (I wondered what happened to her). This role was before her Oscar nominating role in Damage. She is hysterical as the Virgin Queen which I bet is the funniest Queen Elizabeth I in history. I love the costumes, the language. The series got better as it went along. I loved Hugh Laurie as the dumb prince. Tony Robinson as Baldrick always made me laugh. The Black Adder kept moving on until World War II.

1205,Blackadder, watch all the Blackadder shows...,"I have always been a fan of British TV comedy and this is one of my favorites. It's a good start to the whole series and ""side"" shows. It's interesting to note that the main character Edmond is silly and immature in this show while his henchmen come off has somewhat smarter. In later shows, Blackadder II, III, and go's forth, Edmond becomes ever smarter while the henchmen become as dumb as a box of rocks! It's also funny how he slides down the social ladder from duke to commoner. I highly recommend the whole series. It's appeal crosses all age groups with a few ""blue"" jokes but nothing remotely vulgar.

1206,Blackadder, See it gloriously uncut,"Much has been written here about `Black Adder' already, and even if you haven't seen it yet, you probably know whether or not you like the dry, sarcastic style of British comedy that this show typifies.  Don't misunderstand, though.  It's not all high-toned satirical treatment of British history.  There's great low comedy, as well.  I found it clever and multifaceted enough so that repeat viewing enhances my appreciation of it. For those not well-educated on the aspects British history and monarchy that this show sends up (as I am not), they also become clearer with repeat viewing.  So if it doesn't quite register with you at first, you may want to revisit it again.  However, DO NOT base your supposed knowledge of British history on this show, as they make things up for the sake of comedy.<br/><br/>With the recent release of the wonderful `Complete Collector's Set' of Blackadder series on DVD, I had the chance to watch them all again.  If you've only ever seen these shows on American TV, you may be surprised at a few of the bits you hadn't seen before.  The most striking example of this is the episode in the first series where Edmund Blackadder is named Archbishop of Canterbury.  To my surprise, I found an extended version of the scene where Edmund, Percy and Baldrick discuss the marketing of fake religious relics, a scene in which occurs a large and intimidating codpiece known as the `Black Russian,' and of course, the scene wherein Baldrick subdues a troublesome bishop by beating him with a crucifix.  Obviously, Satan and his pitchforks hold no fears for the posteriors of Black Adder's producers, while American TV execs still fearfully guard their nether regions, if not from the Devil's minions, at least from religious protesters.  Political correctness will be the death of comedy, yet.<br/><br/>Among the special features of the DVDs are brief history lessons on certain historical figures, events, places, and cultural references in the shows, explained by Tony Robinson in Baldrick's wonderful, melodious working-class accent.  Also, they cover not just all four series, but every special show and skit associated with Black Adder, making it truly `complete.'  The packaging design of the Complete Collector's Set is so cunning, you could brush your teeth with it, though I wouldn't recommend it.",18 out of 22 found this helpful.,,16 July 2001
1207,Blackadder, 15 years of saying pardon.,"The best of the lot. Very funny script, brilliant cast, superbly acted. I prefer Edmund as this type of meek, slimy character than in later series. Also Balders is better suited as intelligent than stupid, that character is already brilliantly done by Percy. <br/><br/>Each episode has a uniquely funny story. The Archbishop one where Baldrick makes holy artifacts is extremely funny. Especially as Percy thinks he bought a real artifact only to discover that it's one of Baldricks.<br/><br/>
He marries an 8 year old princess in another episode. Very original humour, and the little princess herself is extremely funny. The way she laughs at the Vicar is hilarious. <br/><br/>Witchsmeller Persuivant, another great episode, possibly the best but its difficult to distinguish which is the best as they are all so good. Frank Finlay is so believable as the witch, his voice, expressions, the way he cross examines Edmund in court and entraps him. Pure genius.<br/><br/>The last one is fantastic. I love the way he finally gets revenge on his dad by forming an army of the 6 most evil men in England. All with uniquely evil attributes. <br/><br/>I don't think 6 episodes is enough for this first series. There is so much comedy there to fill 12 episodes at least. Still the second and third series, although inferior did not disappoint.

1208,Blackadder, promising start to an excellent series,"Although series 2 ('Elizabethan'), 3 ('Regency'), and 4 ('Great War') were probably better overall, this was the series that introduced Edmund Blackadder to the TV-watching world twenty years ago.  In series 1, however, it was Edmund who was spineless and Baldrick who really did have the sense; in subsequent series these roles would be somewhat reversed and the idea then really took off.<br/><br/>I do like series 1 for the following reasons: strong casting aside from Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson and Tim McInnerny; this series included Brian Blessed, Robert East as regulars and guests like Peter Cook (brilliant in the very first episode), and Alex Norton (as McAngus).  The eagle-eyed will also spot a very young Angus Deayton in the St Leonard's Day episode.  While the three following series were sharper and more studio-based (not always a good thing ...)

1211,Blackadder, Terrific verbal humor from the great Rowan Atkinson,"Rowan Atkinson was funny as Mr. Bean, but he was downright hilarious as the Black Adder. He had such a talent for playing the sharp-tongued rogue I'll never figure out why he decided to start doing comedy in which he hardly spoke. The premise of this British comedy series is that the central character, ""The Black Adder"", shows up at different points in history in various incarnations distorting historical events and poking fun at various British historical figures and situations along the way.<br/><br/>Lots of people don't like Black Adder I, in which the title character, Edmund, is the younger son of a brutish man consumed with thoughts of war who actually becomes king of England through Edmund's own bungling - he arrives late for the Battle of Bosworth Field and winds up chopping off the head of Richard III, thus saving the life of Henry Tudor. Throughout this first season he plays the buffoon, often having the expression of a deer caught in the headlights. This is the only season in which the Black Adder takes on the persona of a weak effeminate person. Especially funny is Edmund's mother who is a proper noble woman sitting around doing embroidery and indifferently waiting for the next marauding army to pass through.<br/><br/>The second season takes place early during the reign of Elizabeth I, with the Black Adder confident, handsome, and even a favorite at court. A young Amanda Richardson plays the role of Elizabeth I, who comes across as Betty Boop, just not as intelligent. Although more cunning in this season, Black Adder still comes up the loser in just about every episode. My favorite is ""Bells"", in which Blackadder finds his new servant, Bob, curiously pleasant company. Afraid for his reputation at court, Blackadder searches for a ""cure"" - which of course involves leeches, until Bob conveniently reveals that she is in fact a girl called Kate. Their wedding is disrupted by the profane Lord Flashheart, who, although he is the best man, winds up stealing the bride.<br/><br/>The third season takes place in the eighteenth century during the reign of George III, and will be a favorite of all fans of ""House, M.D."" due to the presence of a young Hugh Laurie. Here, Black Adder plays the manservant of the Prince Regent, George, played by Hugh Laurie. George is the dim-witted target of Black Adder's many schemes to enrich himself by taking advantage of his cushy position in George's household, and this often means having to save the Prince Regent's pension and position in the kingdom, which is largely controlled by Parliament.<br/><br/>The fourth season takes place during World War I, with Edmund Blackadder as a captain in the British army whose company is trapped in one of the trenches that gave everyone in Europe such a distaste for warfare between the two world wars. Blackadder's aim in this season is to stay alive by staying in that trench until the war ends. His stunts include shooting a carrier pigeon when it arrives with orders to advance, and joining the Royal Flying Corp - ""the twenty minuters"". Unfortunately, the name comes from how long they are expected to live once in the air, not how much time they work each day, as Blackadder had originally thought.<br/><br/>This show has several interesting plot devices. First, most of the main characters show up in different periods of time with the same name but different roles. Hugh Laurie is always ""George"", Tony Robinson is always ""Baldrick"", Stephen Fry is always ""Melchett"", and Tim McInnerny is always ""Percy"". Since each season was shot in alternate years - (1983, 1985, 1987, 1989) - the cast must have been having a terrific time in order for them to be regathered after such long intervals in order to make filming this series possible. Secondly, everyone in the cast, including the Black Adder, always dies in the final episode of each season. It is somewhat like the South Park stunt of Kenny being killed at the end of every show only to reappear in the next episode as though nothing had happened.<br/><br/>Do note that there are only six episodes per season. If you liked ""Red Dwarf"" or ""Fawlty Towers"", you'll probably like this series too.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,10 April 2010

Prince Edmund is a schemer, but is more inept than his descendants.  In this version, Baldrick is the smarter of the two, a situation reversed in later shows.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate, although Brian Blessed chews more scenery than a regiment of moths.  Rowan Atkinson is superb, as always, as is Tony Robinson as Baldrick.  Great guest appearances by Peter Cook and Frank Finlay.<br/><br/>The show gets better as it progresses, but, I still prefer the later series. I find it interesting that each succeeding Black Adder is worse off than the last.  He starts out as a prince, is reduced to a lord, then a butler to the Prince Regent, then a captain in the army.

The structure of the 4 original series (excluding Back &amp; Forth) is brilliant - Edmund believes he is destined to be king of England; with each successive generation, though, his family drifts another stage further away from the crown, but ironically, with each generation the main character (Blackadder) is more intelligent, and had the family remained close to the crown he no doubt would have found a way to become king.

1222,Blackadder," A good start to the Blackadder legacy, but not the best.","I've always liked epic things, be they on TV, film or even in computer games, and this is really a cross between ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Monty Python"". Though the show's epic settings aren't there for humour - just to bleed the BBC dry of money - they really do make this the best series to look at visually, and there are some good special effects on show (Richard III's head flying off its body is pretty well done). But this is meant to be COMEDY - and unfortunately, this is the least funny series, if I must admit. Episode 1 ""The Foretelling"" ain't too great, but Episode 6 ""The Black Seal"" is brilliant - I hugely enjoyed Edmund's attempts to take over the throne. There is no doubt at all that the series gets better as each episode passes. Get a load of the epic settings while you can - the second series is going to be much cheaper, but it will also be funnier as well. This first series is a good start, and should be watched because it is unique to all the other Blackadder series, but if you aren't used to seeing Blackadder stupid, Baldrick smart, and no Stephen Fry or Hugh Laurie in the cast, you would be best off watching this series first.<br/><br/>The Black Adder is very funny in parts, but all things get better as they go along, and whereas we do have some good episodes in this first series, the following three series are funnier and sharper.

1225,Blackadder, Best Blackadder Series,"This series, the first, was in my opinion the best of the lot. It was also the most expensive. No one can do it like Rowan Atkinson. The way he delivers a line is unsurpassable (""The Black......Vegetable""). He said that he was inspired by Errol Flynn's Robin Hood in the creation of this but I notice the influence of Roman Polanski's MacBeth in the first episode. One very pious lady wrote to the Radio Times after the episode about the church saying it was offensive to everyone who believed in God. But the target of the humour was not God, it was the religious hypocrisy of the Middle Ages. Frank Finlay was excellent in the episode called Witchsmeller Pursuivent. The scene where he catches fire at the stake burning after talking about getting hotter and hotter is great. Who cares that his cloak mysteriously flies up over his face to cover up the fact that it's a stuntman. MacAngus's demise when Blackadder tells him to look into the mouth of a cannon and then Blackadder fires the cannon is hilarious (""There's been a very messy accident""). The other series and one-off specials were good but I think this was the best of a great lot.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,,12 January 2006
1226,Being Human," Give it a chance, folks...","Let me preface this by saying I have seen all the episodes of the BBC version. I love it. I also love the new US version.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read anything about this show (rather than just taking to the internet to spew fury all over everywhere) knows that the US version will be following the UK version, roughly, as far as the end of the first series. The first 13 US eps will mirror the first 6 UK ones. None of the US writers or actors have seen any more of the UK show than the first 6 episodes in order to make the show different in later episodes. What I am interested in seeing is what the US version does after the first 13 episodes, because it will be ""original"". Hopefully.<br/><br/>So far, the US version has made one important improvement on the UK version: the ""ghost"" rules (ie How Sally/Annie can interact with the world) are much clearer. Frankly, the extent to which other people in the UK version can interact with Annie has always been a little murky (read: plot-servicing). I enjoy the clarification of the rules in the US version. I am willing to see what else the US version does. Some things may be better, some things worse. Without giving the show a chance, we'll never know.<br/><br/>It is important to note that SyFy (and Space, its Canadian buddy) primarily air reruns of old SciFi shows produced by others. Original in this context means they are producing it. Yes, linguistically tricky, but so is everything in Show Biz. Bear in mind that BSG was also a remake, just more time had passed and the series was darker. Also, excellent, which gives me hope for Being Human.<br/><br/>I have no trouble watching both shows. Liking the US one doesn't take from liking the UK one. They both have humour, likable characters, and an engrossing storyline. If you like SciFi, Fantasy, or horror genres, give this show a whirl.",95 out of 121 found this helpful.,8.0,26 February 2011
1227,Being Human," It's interesting entertainment, just enjoy it!","To me TV has been a little boring of late... If it isn't forensics then it's reality or cooking shows - too much... So, if you are looking for a fun sci-fi fantasy to keep your attention, this just may do the trick. It's weird, a little quirky and dramatic to boot... Hopefully we will see some romantic possibility with Aiden and Sally - because to me that seems like a perfect match. Aiden doesn't want to kill anyone and well, Sally can't die again... So, vampire+ghost=love...<br/><br/>Don't avoid a show like this because you think you are above the ""vampire"" trend. It's not about a vampire and a werewolf, it's about ""trying"" to be normal, kind and morally acceptable under extremely abnormal and immoral conditions.

1228,Being Human," ""Being Human"" (US) is totally entertaining","I've kept right up with all of the episodes, and the characters have grown nicely. Anyone who can be critical after just one or two episodes is not a critic. I decided to watch the British version after I began watching this one, and, frankly, I decided not to watch it again. I'm very satisfied with the characters in the U.S., and the acting is excellent, as far as I'm concerned, with just the right amount of humor, which is delivered well, and the expected (and sometimes not) horror action that goes with it. The show is unique, as far as I am concerned, and I put it in a class with ""Supernatural"", which is at the top of my list for good entertainment and acting. People need to decide for themselves rather than have someone promote another version that they have become over-familiar with. It becomes like ""the movie just can't compare to the book"". I love British TV, but, in this instance, it can't compare to this version, and I'll stay a dedicated fan for what I hope is a long run. Thanks, SYFY!",73 out of 117 found this helpful.,10.0,1 March 2011
1229,Being Human," Great Show! Give it a chance, and try not to compare!","I have only a seen few scenes of the UK version, so I can't compare very well. However, I do know what I like, and I LOVE the US version! I do want to see more of the UK version, but at this point in time the US Being Human has been firmly cemented as my favorite, even if it is not the original. The first thing that caught my eye is that even though it is about werewolves and vampires, it did not feel like a Twilight or Vampire Diaries type show. I am much more into shows like Supernatural, as opposed to the fantasy-horror shows/movies with all the teen angst. There is angst here, but it's from an adult point of view, which is much more relatable to me. Josh was the first person to stand out to me. I saw a commercial about the characters and he was so awkward and quirky, I just fell in love. I love Aidan and Sally as well, I think all the characters are very engaging, and I really care about them and want to see what is going to happen with them.<br/><br/>The one thing I would say for fans of the original is please try not to compare it to the US version! If you love the original, of course you are not going to like the new version as much because you've established a connection and love for the characters and story. You are going to feel like the new version is just terrible, even if it's not. This happened to me after I read Harry Potter and then saw the movie. I didn't like it at first, but then I decided to watch it as a separate entity, not thinking about the book or comparing it, and I really enjoyed it. That is what people should do with the US Being Human. It really is a great show, and even it if it is a remake, people should at least try to watch it, and give it a chance! I am certainly glad I did!",38 out of 60 found this helpful.,10.0,15 February 2011
1230,Being Human, The first 2 episodes are a remake of the UK PILOT,"Seems like a number of people commenting about the UK version (negatively mostly) don't know that it started with a pilot that was much different than the rest of the series. A bigger difference than comparing the US to UK version in fact.<br/><br/>The first two episodes of the US version combined are a remake, with a number of changes, of the UK pilot. However, incorporating a lot of the character traits/backgrounds of the rest of the UK series. Anyone having started to watch the UK series with episode 1 missed a very important introduction to the characters. Find the UK pilot and watch it if you haven't. It will add a lot of background for the rest of the UK series as well as provide a better basis for comparison to the US version thus far. <br/><br/>Both series are good. The US version has been a pleasant surprise, I didn't think it would be half as good as the UK version. <br/><br/>I'm more vested in the UK version at the moment, which just started its third season. It will be interesting to see where the US version goes and to find out how many episodes they plan to film per year/season. In the UK it's only 6, which feels rather short.",31 out of 48 found this helpful.,,31 January 2011
1231,Being Human, It's not another Twilight,"Being Human is a breath of fresh air for the whole ""Creatures of the Night"" genre. If you think it's just another Twilight rip-off I'm gonna stop you right there. Aiden is not just some Edward. He's believable as a Vampire. When he's jonesing for some blood he looks like he's going to puke and start ripping out his hair. His love interests, unlike in some other vampire shows, are based either on him acting like a normal human being (with humans) or drugs (with vampires). Blood is crack to him. He's not a monster, really (none of them are). He's just a very old drug addict. He's also hilarious. (""Really? The vampire bit doesn't freak you out but the male nurse thing does?"") Josh is a brilliant werewolf. He's a stereotypical Jewish man and former honor student with OCD. He had everything; close friends, loving well- to-do family and the girl of his dreams. But every full moon now his heart stops, his organs fail, his skin rips apart and every bone breaks and relocates itself and he must suffer through every last second and give his mind up to a serial killer (who looks awesome by the way). He lost everything and it's obvious to see why. He's also hilarious. (""Great, we're living with Sally the peeper ghost"") And Sally is just plain lovable. She a free-spirit who had everything to live for but ended up living more dead with her new friends than she ever did alive. Ghost have the obvious trait of going insane if they stick around for too long. They also have many addictive abilities that look fun but are incredibly dangerous. The second season will have a plot twist that will make your head spin with delight. Sally has many problems to deal with being a ghost. But hopefully her loving friends will keep her sane. She's also hilarious. (""You two gonna go all Twilight on each other at some point?"" - ""I'm not a peeper... much... I would get that mole checked out if I were you."") These are just real, likable people under extraordinarily circumstances. <br/><br/>Compared to the UK version, I'd say there both equally great. The US version has more depth to it (more in it to like while the UK version I'd say is deeper (the characters are closer and more it's more emotional). I've watched both and I'll say this; there's no forth season of the US version (UK watchers know what I mean).",24 out of 36 found this helpful.,10.0,30 April 2012
1232,Being Human," Watch it, in the end you'll be glad you did","I have to say that Being Human took time to grow on me and at times I felt I was being led down a path that would leave me sorry I had wasted my time watching the show. I read this sentiment in many reviews articulated in various ways, but the bottom line is Being Human is a very good show, however it isn't until its over that you truly appreciate the show for what it was and is because the end is not sloppy, hacked, or rushed. It simply brings a lot more meaning to the previous seasons and makes you appreciate the whole show a great deal more. At that final place is when you truly engage all that the show brought you through and makes you appreciate the idea behind the story and realize it is much more than you thought while on the ride.<br/><br/>Season 4 of Being Human was the best season of the series without question. The peculiar thing is that I believe it was the best season because it was the last season and the really big questions that this show presents in terms of our main characters can't be answered until the show ends. The other seasons gets us to know the characters, vested in them and the story, and took the viewer to the point of a unique interest in a world of monsters trying to retain what they could of their humanity while by their nature made it impossible to obtain anything but frustration and heartache. But season 4 didn't just bring the story to a close, it took us back through the story with a perspective of how things could have been much different but for the groups will to make them different and appreciate the first 3 seasons a great deal more in the process of taking the characters to a place that I couldn't have imagined in the beginning.<br/><br/>Interestingly after seeing it all I realize they could have made the series longer, but to make it maintain its overall quality the only way they could have done that would have been by making what is season 4 the last set of episodes (or 75% of them) the final season however they wove the story in any other seasons. But given the nature of shows like this that teeter on the edge of being renewed each year there isn't the security to allow the writers to do that. So given the unknown faced with writing each season I have to say that season 4 made my opinion of the writing go up a great deal as it was the best by far and brought a somewhat uneven story come together in a way such that I enjoyed the final episodes far more than I ever would have thought. There are some oddities that bothered me throughout the series that the end made the trip very worth the effort, and a wonderful ending that left me surprised in a day and age when shows rarely surprise me in a positive way. Season 4 makes the whole series better and I'm certain had they figured out a way to work that sort of intensity and emotion into the other seasons would lave made Being Human a more popular, longer running show. But as it is, I'm simply glad I got a chance to enjoy it.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,12 July 2014
1233,Being Human," Pretty good, trust me.","This is show is great. I know there's so much werewolf and vampire movies and shows being thrown about now days but this breaks away from the brooding vampire werewolf combo. You have a serious but humorous vampire living with a puppy dog faced and funny werewolf living together in a house with a ghost who can't move on. The cast is pretty dang good in my book. They all have a chemistry that makes you believe their actually real life friends. You have some eye candy and also a great plot and storyline. It's not all about hot vampires and werewolves beating each other up for a girl...to be honest it's nothing like that, but it draws you in with the drama. You forget that their superhuman but people going through some difficult times. It's fun to watch...you'll laugh and may even relate. Also if your a big fan of syfy, you'll love tuning in to watch 45 mins of fantasy, drama, and humor.

1234,Being Human, American version not as bad as I thought,"I just watched the American Being Human and I have a confession. I liked it. I prefer the BBC version but I liked the American Being Human. If you're not familiar with it the plot of Being Human is about supernatural creatures that secretly live among us and a werewolf, vampire and ghost share a place together while trying to pass as human. That's the plot of both the BBC version and the American version in a nut shell. When it first started the voice over gave me this uneasy pseudo-intellectual impression of talking down to the viewer with simplistic while terms trying to sound deep, a major turn off for me. But it gradually got better. The main plot is very obviously taken from the early 2008 Being Human pilot from BBC 3, the major differences start with the character names and the supernatural powers.<br/><br/>The vampire is named Aiden instead of Mitchell. And unlike Mitchell Aiden can't eat human food. Aiden also seems physically stronger than Mitchell. Aiden's also over 200 where as Mitchell was only 100, having been made a vampire during World War 1. He also has the power to enthrall people like the vampires of Forever Knight, a power the vampires of the original Being Human did not have. Aiden's maker is the local vampire lord or king, Bishop, who in the original BBC version was named Herrick but otherwise serves the same exact purpose. Aiden also lacks Michell's personality quirk of wearing hand warmers / finger-less gloves everywhere. Aiden is more intellectual than Mitchell. He quotes Byron and is a fully qualified nurse. Mitchell a janitor in the original BBC version. Both work in a hospital with the werewolf. I don't like that make up when he's feeding looks obnoxiously like Edward Cullen's make up in Twilight. Don't mix Twilight with my Being Human... I also didn't care for how the fangs looked. The fangs look pretty bad. I guess I'll get used to them but I think the BBC version had better fangs and had really cool looking black vampire eyes which I haven't seen on this one.<br/><br/>Sally is a LOT like Annie from BBC Being Human. They even have the same outfit. Where Annie was murdered by her fiancé, Owen, who tried to flush evidence down the toilet (causing the house's plumbing problems) it seems Sally was killed by her fiancé Danny (Yes, plumbing problems). However Annie had a quirk of liking to make hot drinks and leaving them around the house. Sally (so far) can't interact with the world around her. The supernatural creatures can see her but she can accidentally fade out of view for them too (a nice effect the BBC version does not have). And even our Supernatural boys Josh (the werewolf) and Aiden (the vampire) can't physically touch her (yet) unlke Annie who had no trouble interacting with other supernatural creatures. One thing I did NOT like was she made a twilight comment about the werewolf and vampire. The original show has never done this. Please don't mix Twilight into my Being Human... <br/><br/>Josh is the biggest change. He's the werewolf and in the BBC version his name is George. Before and after his werewolf transformations they do not show his behind at all but this is to be expected, somehow in the last ten or so years the human behind has become taboo on American TV. We USED to be able to see it. I don't know why we can't now. There's a little joke about Josh and Aiden possibly being lovers when they first move in but it's very glossed over. The scene is a lot funnier in the BBC version because George is a very spastic and neurotic character who babbles when he's nervous and has very geeky, intellectual nerd traits. Josh is not a spastic nerd which takes away some of the charm. In fact he comes off as somewhat of a jerk. I am not too thrilled with the personality of the werewolf. His potential love interest, a character named Kara (Nina in the original BBC version) seems to have more of the original neurotic, babbily, awkward geek personality that George originally had in the BBC version. This is a cute character trait. Nina was a little shrew-like in the original series. I feel the Josh and Kara personalities are a reversal on George and Nina. A funny joke borrowed from the original series where George and Mitchell (now Josh and Aiden) are mistaken as a couple has lost it's edge because Josh doesn't have the spastic awkward response George had. Blink and you'll miss it. The werewolf transformations were better than the usual CGI syfy effects BUT the BBC transformation scenes are still superior for visual quality and detail. Another change made was in the original pilot it was George's exfiance that showed up at the hospital and would later unfortunately follow him to where he makes his monthly transformation. In this version it's Josh's younger sister who follows him. One thing I wish they had changed from the BBC version but they didn't is in both versions they have the werewolf only change one night a month. Technically the full moon is three to four nights a month. Also George changed at Moonrise. The moon was already up in this and Josh hadn't changed yet. He clearly doesn't change until the sun has gone down. The American version felt a little rushed, plot-wise. The time progression is uncomfortable and jerky whereas it seemed smoother in the BBC version. The British version is set in Bristol while the American version is set in Boston. The background music was also pretty good. In general I still prefer the original BBC version but this was a lot better than I thought it would be. I thought I'd hate it. Instead I actually want to watch it and see where it goes... assuming it doesn't get canceled.",38 out of 65 found this helpful.,7.0,17 January 2011

I saw the ad on a city bus and it struck my curiosity. I looked into it and loved the premise - modern roommates, cursed in 3 different ways, all trying to be normal.

1236,Being Human, The original British version is much better.,"I fell in love with the original version of this show. I can understand why they needed it to have a little more appropriate content but I felt like I was just watching the watered down Hollywoodized version of the original. I have never been able to understand why they make remakes of things yet change the characters names even though we know who they were in the other version. They didn't change the plot very much and in fact the beginning scene with Aidan practically mirrors the original. I have a friend who watched the pilot of this version and she said she felt as though she was watching one of the episodes from later in the season, because she felt that nothing was fully explained. They added random stuff (Josh's sister) but they didn't keep in the stuff that needs to be in a pilot. I found that I was disappointed with Aidan's(Mitchell-original) overall look. I am so tired of vampires that looked different from normal humans. He is all pale, broody, and gives off hind of creepy bad guy vibe. The British version is slightly more sexual, without nudity, and violent than this one but if you think that you are mature enough to get past that, then I think that it would be more beneficial to experience the show in its true and greatest form.",44 out of 90 found this helpful.,3.0,21 January 2011

1242,Being Human, I give this at least an 8.,"I've watched both the US and the BBC versions of this show and I must say that I enjoyed the US version better. Not that the UK version isn't amazing, because it is very very good. I just think there are so many fantastical problems and continuity issues in the UK version that sometimes I can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>1- Annie can do too much in the BBC version that I don't even think of her as a ghost. She can touch and move things pretty consistently and most of the time she can be seen and touched by humans. Her capabilities increase as the series moves on. Think about it, she can teleport, never die, move and touch what she wants, and look hot forever. Gee, I sympathize for her. At least Sally's situation is pitiable and she didn't start off with a whole slough of ghostly talents. 2- The werewolf costume in the UK version is SO HORRIBLE it is embarrassing. It is clearly a man in a synthetic costume, probably with a helmet. The poor design of this costume is often attempted to be concealed with camera angles of the shadows or through small holes in doors. It's a joke. This is 2011, utilize technology. 3- Herrick coming back from the undead-dead. Enough said. 4- There are parts of the second season when Annie is nearly forced by death to cross over. I feel that this aspect of death defeats the purpose of choice and mostly of Annie's presence in the world. The tricks that are employed with the doors is a poor solution to the necessity of ghostly interactions for Annie's character.<br/><br/>The US version has likable characters, a good combination of CGI and makeup. There are more episodes per season so that the show isn't a rush of information. The characters abilities are subdued a bit so that not every single bit of vampire/ghost/werewolf lore is included. This gives the show a chance to create it's own mythos as well as make the characters more relatable.<br/><br/>Do not perceive this as an attack on the UK version, but I just keep hearing poor excuses of the BBC fans that the US one is not worthy. The differences between them almost make them feel like different shows. The US version is much lighter whereas the BBC is darker. That is fine, but both shows are incredible, entertaining, and worthy of our time. I just feel it needs to be said that the BBC version is not without flaws and that people should give the US version a shot.",18 out of 38 found this helpful.,10.0,1 February 2011
1243,Being Human, Sorely Lacking,"During one of my many down days I stumbled across this on an online TV links site and I had to say I was most interested, so I decided to give it a go with an open mind.<br/><br/>To be honest I was sceptical and I wasn't proved wrong. I'm British and have watched the original Being Human ever since it started and a friend of mine called me up and told me there was this fantastic show on BBC3 about a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost and he wasn't wrong because our version meaning the original British version is better. <br/><br/>I see little point for this American/Canadian version because it's literally the same version as the original just with bad acting and no chemistry and the same nearly exact same script. So on that note I would recommend you just watch the original BBC3 series. <br/><br/>I find the character of Aiden who is meant to be Mitchel unlikeable and smug almost to the point that you want him to fall off the bandwagon. The actor that plays him almost seems too good looking in a carbon copy waxy kind of way and doesn't have that rough and ready edge that makes you route for him like the original does. He lacks the chemistry with the character of Josh who is meant to be an imitation of George even though these characters are meant to be best friends.<br/><br/>Josh lacks the charm that Russel Torvey holds when playing George in a sense that you find him so lovable but unfortunately Josh doesn't have this quality and comes across as whiny and moans a lot.<br/><br/>Annie/Sally is just a cheap carbon rip off of the lovely Leonora Critchlow who plays her originally. Everything about her is a rip off, from dying via falling down the stairs, the grey outfit with leggings, the hair and even down to the fact that the actress playing her like Leonora Critchlow would also appear to be bi-racial. Except this actress doesn't have the quirkiness, charm and loveability that Leonora brings to the role. Instead she just seems pathetic, needy and self absorbed.<br/><br/>All characters seem to hate their condition and do nothing but whine and complain about it. There is no originality and the set looks cheap. The script is basically the same and I can't understand why they didn't take the Being Human idea and expand on it. Nobody said there had to be a vampire, werewolf and ghost in another version it could've been something completely different and it more than likely would've worked.<br/><br/>I do love American TV shows but unfortunately when they try and remake British TV shows (as of late anyway) they just seem to fall flat on their faces, the same problem is with Skins USA which is another flop waiting to happen because it's also a cheap carbon copy rip off of the original.<br/><br/>My American friends do yourselves a favour...... stick to making great shows like How I Met Your Mother and Bones and leave this stuff to us.",20 out of 46 found this helpful.,2.0,31 January 2011
1244,Being Human, A true copy of BBC's Being Human,"Like all the other reviewers, I must agree that the US copy of Being Human is too much like the BBC Original. Even our US ghost was wearing the same white and gray top! Then, there's the acting. Our US trio were not quite believable. Each one seemed to be acting on their own and could not even relate with each other. The viewer could not feel the connection between the characters. This is where the original succeeds. The viewer sympathized with their plight of trying to be human. And, they supported each other, even confronting danger for friendship's sake. BBC's Season 3 has just started and, I must say, came in really strong with it's original theme of human relationship and friendships. Lenora Crichlow (Annie) is a sight for sore eyes!",31 out of 77 found this helpful.,2.0,25 January 2011
1245,Being Human, I Love The British Version Better,"I Give This a Three out of ten. They Tried. They really did but its not working. I gave the show a look at and I was bored to death in the first ten minutes. It never grasped my attention, It's as if I was watching a Documentary on Dust and Pollen. The American version lacks character or sense of witty humor. The Actors are of somewhat C-graded Stars. Not saying they suck but hey they probably beat plenty of others for this gig! (a hint of Sarcasm) The characters seem so distant from one another...not really creating that atmosphere of which the BBC version creates. Now I'm a Proud American but this remake is pure crap. The British executes their Version with no worries of Competition.",27 out of 66 found this helpful.,3.0,23 January 2011
1246,Being Human, I'm afraid...,"To say that the US version is better by the actors, scenery and script is unbelievable. First off, what made the UK version so good was the fact that these actors looked like every day people, not like these famous American actors we see in the US version. Our vampire didn't look like a twilight character! We could relate to the characters and that's important in a good story.<br/><br/>We don't need simplistic, slapstick humour, good looking actors or pretty special effects to make our version work. Ours was quirky and different.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, if I had never seen the British version I would enjoy this a lot more, it's simple and easy to watch. <br/><br/>But the UK version is a lot better.",28 out of 69 found this helpful.,,1 February 2011
1247,Being Human, Why watch this version?,"Since nothing else was on TV, rather than pop in a Movie/Show I decided to give SciFi's (SyFy is still dumb) new show Being Human a try. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. There are/were so many things wrong with this show that it's a wonder Scifi still makes original programming. Considering this is a Canadian version of a British Show can it really be called Original Programming. <br/><br/>The casting is/was bad, very bad. There is NO CHEMISTRY among the cast. Each actor may be okay individually but as an ensemble cast it is horribly done. The Primary Three Characters (Aidan, Sally, and Josh) don't connect with one another; it is as if one of them needed to be replaced to create better interactions. My inclination is that Sam Witwer as Aidan is the character that should have be replaced. It doesn't help that he is totally unbelievable in the role. Sam Huntington as the werewolf Josh, spent way too much time watching Russell Tovey performance as George the werewolf and trying to be different and imitate it at the same time, it didn't work; while I don't think Sam Witwer will ever be believable as a vampire given some serious direction and help Josh could be a believable character. There was so little of Sally in the first episode you wonder if she was an afterthought.. Mark Pellegrino as Bishop, if he is the best person they could find for the ""Herrick"" role from the original it is not a good sign. He does not have the commanding presence or stage presence needed. The writing was atrocious to say the least. While I understand that you need to change the original premise of the show to accommodate an American TV audience and to make it different than the original which airs on a competing network; what the writers/producers did was make a hybrid show that is far worse than better. The concept of an ""open story"" is completely lost as writers attempted to put in so much back story and so many changes from the original that the audience was left with ""huh?"". A lot of the new back story of Aidan and Josh doesn't even begin to make sense there is no connection to reality, even for a sci-fi show. The directing and cinematography were substandard. (I would add in Editing but if you got nothing to work with than as the saying goes crap in crap out.) The Director (Adam Kane who is also the show's Executive Producer which is another no-no) either failed to understand his role in the process or was too busy doing something else. One of the more pivotal scenes in the original series, one that sets so much of the tone, is between Mitchell and Herrick in the Hospital cafeteria. They attempted to reproduce that scene in the SciFi version, it failed miserably. One scene where the writing wasn't entirely the issue and yet the characters demeanor towards one another, their interaction, and the camera angles all failed. It was like no one wanted to actually film it. The scene is supposed to be about Bishop reestablishing his pseudo-control over the rogue vampire and as an audience we are left with the emotion of why was that left in the show. The scene added nothing. The show is supposedly set in Boston, yet to safe money filmed in Canada. It doesn't look like Boston, not one iota, even the scenes supposedly filmed in Boston. If you are going to Film in Canada (Montreal) set the show in Canada and call it a day. It isn't going to change your original audience but you may keep some of them for more than a show or two. I could go but to get the bad taste out of my mouth from watching this load of bull dung I am going to watch the original.",31 out of 78 found this helpful.,2.0,18 January 2011
1248,Being Human, right so i love the UK version...,But this is at least trying. I don't feel i can make a proper judgement as for the first episode i was just watching different people do the same thing i'd seen three years ago. I'd be interested to see whether the characters are going to go in completely different directions than the BBC version because then i might be able to make a judgement based on their individual merits. But at the moment it just seems like a copy with differences which are just a little too small.<br/><br/>I am happy that Toby Whithouse who was the creator of the original is overseeing the US version as at least he can share how he made the BBC version so damn good<br/><br/>One last thing though. Leonora Critchlow who plays the ghost in the BBC version is amazing and i don't think anyone could play it better so thats why i hope they go in a different direction so that it just doesn't become embarrassing for this girl taking over.,23 out of 57 found this helpful.,4.0,6 February 2011
1249,Being Human, Lifeless,"When i first heard this was being made my first instinct was that it would be a poor imitation of it's UK brethren. How right I was.<br/><br/>From start to finish the opening episode was devoid of any of the charisma and humour found in abundance in the original. Sam Witwer as Aiden (Mitchel) was emotionless, unlikable and seemed to be under the impression that he was still on the Smallville set playing Doomsday. Sam Huntington as Josh (George) lacked any of the fantastic comedic presence which Russell Tovey brought to the part in the original and it felt as though he'd been cast simply because he looks... a little odd. Meaghan Rath as Sally (Annie) is the shows only saving grace in the cast department as far as i'm concerned, she played a fair imitation of her counterpart Annie.<br/><br/>Quite bluntly they've taken a great fantasy/comedy television show, stripped it to it's bare bones and put it back together in a new form, but lacking any of the parts which make the original good.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it yet, try out the UK original version which is in it's 3rd series as this one isn't even comparable.",25 out of 63 found this helpful.,6.0,25 January 2011
1250,Being Human, Not nearly as good as the UK version,"I watched every episode of this series because I was bored, and I watched it after I'd already seen the UK version. In the UK version my heart was in my throat during several episodes as people fought and struggled, and almost got caught, and experienced the highs and lows of the things they'd done. The guy who plays Mitchell (the vampire) is fantastic!! Then I watched the U.S. version. It was just so incredibly dull and boring, and stereotypical, and the guy who plays the vampire in this version, can't hold a candle to Mitchell. He's too busy trying to play it calm and cool, where as Mitchell lets us have it all! I was right on board with all of the suspense in the UK version, and the US version just fails to deliver in every single way. I seriously recommend that you don't even watch the US version unless you are bored like I was, and have nothing better to do.",22 out of 55 found this helpful.,3.0,22 January 2012
1251,In Living Color, raunchy and hilarious,"This show was guaranteed to make you laugh from beginning to end. Though I feel I may have outgrew this type of humor, it was nonetheless the funniest thing ever to watch for me, as a 10-year old!<br/><br/>          Who could forget Carrey as the Firemarshall, a female bodybuilder, or the dorky schoolkid named Parnell; Damon Wayans as Homie the Clown, Men on Film, 'Mo Money(the thieves w/their own TV show), and the homeless dude who carries a pickle jar as a toilet and uses big words to sound smart!

  Not sure what happened to Keenan, but I thought Scary Movie sucked.

Not only did it have great writing, but as with Laugh In and Saturday Night Live it proved to be the springboard for several comedians who would make their mark in film and television.  Damon Wayans and Jim Carey may have been the most brightest star, but comic talents like Tommy Davidson, David Allen Grier as well as later additions Shawn and Marlin Wayans and Jamie Foxx all got their big breaks by appearing on this show.  Unfortunately, like its forerunners when the best talent left, the show lost momentum and went downhill.

This was up and coming, and I think by all rights should still be running as, SNL is still going. I can't figure why it is though, anyway, I love the wit and cynicism, that this show brought out as well as crossing various ethnic and moral and mental lines in it's path.

1254,In Living Color, One of the funniest television shows ever,"It gave the Wayans Brothers, Jim Carrey and Jennifer Lopez (credited as a ""background dancer"") a claim to fame...and fifteen years later it's still kickin'.<br/><br/>It seems like lately - since the release of the DVDs last year - ""In Living Color"" has taken off more and has grown in popularity with younger crowds...however I've been watching it for years, even when it was only on Comedy Central late nights and Jim Carrey was only starting to make a name for himself.<br/><br/>The show ran for four years (from 1990 - 1994) and featured some great characters over the years. Wayans had his clown character who they were supposedly going to make a movie spin-off about at one time, and Carrey had his ageing firefighter (""let me show 'ya something!"") who didn't know squat about the job. Used to crack me up so much! My absolute favorite skit was when Carrey played Mr. Rogers and he's browsing through the porn section of a local suburban video store. Comic genius.<br/><br/>I've heard some white people say they have no interest in watching this because it's an ethnic show and was geared towards Latinos and blacks with its early '90s rap music and dancing...but that's really a myopic view of the show and I think anyone who passes it by based merely on the fact that it has a minority cast (for the most part) is missing out on one of the great shows of the 1990s - and probably of all time.",21 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,27 September 2005
1255,In Living Color, One of the great recent sketch shows,"Amongst the many sketch comedy shows of recent years, ""In Living Color"" stands out as one of the best.  In it's first three seasons, it was unbeatable, featuring comics and actors who would go on to distinguish themselves in film and other TV (James Carrey, Damon Wayans, David Alan Grier, Keenan Ivory Wayans).  However, after Damon's departure, the show took a pretty swift nose-dive (though Damon was by no means the only reason to tune in).  Interestingly, Carrey stayed on the show through it's entire run, even in it's awful final season.  There was nothing revolutionary about the show's format, it was just damn funny and extremely well-cast (Kelly Coffield being excellent, as well; the weakest member being Kim Wayans).

1256,In Living Color, One of the best sketch comedy shows of all time,"If you ask me, I think the show was underrated. ""SNL"" gets all the credit for being a great sketch comedy show, yet there are certain seasons (like the current one) where the writers seemed to have conjured up the sketches in their sleep. In the case of ""In Living Color,"" the writing was always sharp. There are certain sketches that I don't find funny, like Jim Carrey as the female bodybuilder, but it's hard to make a show where ""every"" sketch is funny. I remember Tommy Davidson said the reason why the show turned out to be so great was because plain and simple, they worked so damn hard on it. Well, it absolutely shows. Throughout each season, the actors always seemed to give it their all, even if the sketches were weak. In a horribly PC society, it's refreshing to watch a show like this (luckily, I have Seasons 1-5 on DVD). A show like this couldn't be successful nowadays, because we live in a society where you can't say anything about anybody. Doesn't anybody know that political correctness is the enemy of comedy? What made the show so great was the writers' and actors' willingness to break boundaries and make fun of all these ethnic stereotypes, and do it in an intelligent and witty fashion. Though it wasn't one of the more popular sketches, one of my favorites was ""The Dysfunctional Home Show"" where Jim Carrey would play a drunken father. If you ask me, Carrey was the funniest when he was on this show. As far as his movies go, sometimes he's funny and sometimes he's just plain obnoxious (I can't, for the life of me, sit through either one of the ""Ace Ventura"" movies). In a sketch comedy show, his in-your-face comic style works. I also loved Damon Wayans as the homeless guy. I crack up so much every time I see that sketch. Of course, everyone on the show was great. I can't think of a weak link in the chain. I think one of the cool things about ""ILC"" was that despite its predominantly black cast, it was able to reach a universal audience. This isn't like some UPN sitcom. People of all races seem to enjoy it. I think that proves that there's no color when it comes to good comedy.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,9 June 2007

The episode where Blane is hit on the head and becomes straight was hilarious. Kelly Coffield did the old film heroines a la Bette Davis beautifully.

1259,In Living Color, The rise of the Wayans empire began with this series,"""In Living Color"",was without a doubt one of the funniest shows of the 1990's,when it came on Sunday nights and stayed there on that time slot for the next five seasons(1990-1995). This was in fact the show that was the opposite of Saturday Night Live,but more hilarious and more funny than ever before. ""In Living Color"",was one of the top line-up of shows that the FOX Network had on during the Sunday night hiatus,and this was before another hilarious show that came on after it.....the funny and hilarious as hell,""Married:With Children""...and to that extent the onslaught of comedy shows featuring black actors in prominent roles like ""Living Single"",""Martin"",and the non-comedical shows of ""New York Undercover"",""21 Jump Street"",and ""Beverly Hills 90210"",and ""Melrose Place"".<br/><br/>Getting back to the series ""In Living Color"",this show was the one that brought open the Wayans empire,and its rise to the top of the Nielsens and brought the Wayans family from their beginnings as up and coming to one of the most powerful show-business families in Hollywood. With this show really featured the entire Wayans clan...Keenan Ivory-Wayans,Damon Wayans,Shaun Wayans,Marlon Wayans,and sister Kim Wayans and others. Not only was Keenan Ivory-Wayans the host of this series,but he also was behind the scenes as well,serving as the show's creator as well as executive producer and CEO in charge of production,which propelled the FOX network to new heights. Almost everyone that was associated with this show was discovered here and their careers really took off because of this series,including some who went on to become big time actors and producers in Hollywood,including some who went on to become Oscar nominees because of this show. From Jim Carrey,Jamie Foxx,Kim Coles, David Alan Grier,Tommy Davidson,T'Keyah ""Crystal"" Keymah,Jennifer Lopez, Kelly Coffield,Anne Marie-Johnson,Rosie Perez(who served as the show's choreographer of the dancing group ""The Fly Girls""),rapper Heavy D,and others that were behind this successful series from the golden age of the 1990's.<br/><br/>The show itself,in my opinion was way ahead of its time as far as the jokes were concerned. I find that even though this show began over a decade ago,actually begin the five-year hiatus journey almost ten years ago,and the show comes closer to celebrating the 10th anniversary of this series. Even with the overall jokes that were presented with a lot of comment about gays,the homeless,golddiggers,and others of minority was in fact very superb in the sense of the word when it came to providing the laughs and the Wayans did just that. In other words,it was just that damn hilarious. No wonder this show is a classic in its own right. However,related to the Fly Girl dancing sequences,they are really spectacular in there day,but it looks so out dated because of the dance moves and the dance craze that was the thing back in the day....The Roger Rabbit and The Running Man,as well as those Day-Glo costumes that were a little too skimpy for TV then,but in all the music they had back then was so demanding,and it was all hip-hop formatted as the dancers sway to the music of such acts as Public Enemy,Digital Underground,Kid N'Play,Salt N'Pepa,Big Daddy Kane,LL Cool J,Boyz II Men, En Vogue,and many more. It also had a lot...and I mean a lot of special musical guests that performed on the show including one episode where they had a special musical guest known as Jay-Z,and no one knew that this rapper would go on to the top of the world after this show and to launch his own empire...Rocafella.<br/><br/>This show not only had the Wayans as one of the funniest families out there,but the rest of the cast were as hilarious as they were,and some of them were just as crazy as they come. Especially when it provided the hardest laughs from siblings Damon Wayans and Kim Wayans not to mention from David Alan Grier,Tommy Davidson,and T'Keyah ""Crystal"" Keymah,and the wackiest of them all.....Jim Carrey! One of most popular characters from that show was Homie The Clown,who is hilarious as hell and played to the hilt of hysteria by Damon Wayans. He played a character that was so realistic that it had me laughing crying in tears! The other character was Fire Marshall Bill and he was not only funny,but he was extremely crazy and wacko,and no other actor like Jim Carrey could pull this off with such ease and for one the character was one crazy ""psycho"" S.O.B.,and from the previous comment that I wouldn't want him near my house if it caught on fire! The other character was one that had the censors in an uproar along with several organization including the NAACP that tried to boycott this show,but what the hell,the show went on inspite of the threats made...the character featured two male African-Americans who were extremely gay as hell and they were as queer as they can be,and the characters portrayed by Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier not only provided the laughs and some of it was as funny and hilarious to the extent,but it was one episode during ""Men On Film"" where they did the unthinkable where the two men really were liplocking on the set when the majority of children were watching the show especially during the Sunday night hour,which had the censors really uptight! But in all,seeing these two comment on recent movie releases was indeed funny within itself,and it was a scream! The show itself did a lot of parodied of music videos and did it ever poke fun of it too from the likes of Michael Jackson,Crystal Waters, Vanilla Ice,MC Hammer,Stevie Nicks(portrayed by Kelly Coffield),Teena Marie,Rick James,Tracy Chapman(portrayed by Kim Wayans),James Brown,and others. <br/><br/>Let's not forget the others like Jim Carrey's Captain Hazelwood,and the hilarious version of the Lassie,where Lassie is a pit bull is so naive that it was funny as hell.<br/><br/>It also ultimately gave a cross section of the politics,the fashion,the trends,and the happenings that occurred in the 1990's in standard comedic form courtesy of Keenan Ivory-Wayans which remain until during the show's fourth season,the changes were about to be made. When the rest of the actors started to leave(in this case,the Wayans clan)the hilarity declined with each departure of the Wayans clan and the show's departure from its Sunday night timeslot to Wednesday nights which hurt the show badly. The jokes and the recurring characters were getting old,but so after that the series ended its five year run in May of 1995. However,the series can still be seen as reruns on FX,but lets face it... they can showed old episodes of Married:With Children during the day,but not In Living Color? Get With It! But because of the dated quality,you can tell that it went straight to DVD where the sheer brilliance of the first season of the series is a joy to watch.",16 out of 22 found this helpful.,,9 September 2004
1260,In Living Color, Colorful Humor,"This show is my second favorite skit show of all time. I remember seeing this show when I was about 12 and 13 just when I was getting old enough to watch skit comedy. It was just great and was revolutionary for it's time as it was the first all black skit comedy show but also was a show that wasn't afraid to parody on some touchy and current subjects like racism, crime, and others which is now kinda common place in shows like ""South Park"", ""Chapelle Show"", etc. However other than that this show was just meant to be plan fun and funny.<br/><br/>I love the theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, as it sort of has a bit of a hip hop rhythm which I'm normally not a fan of but I make an exception to this. The ensemble was great each were talented and funny in their own way, three of my favorites are of course Dammon Waynes, David Alan Grier, and Jim Carrey, all three just had the most colorful characters and hilarity.<br/><br/>Though of course the most important thing was of course the skits and there are plenty of memorable ones but I'll list a few: Background Guy: This is one of my favorite Jim Carey skits as we are paying attention to Jim's character whom is constantly getting our attention on camera by just doing just a bunch of random things. This is something we all can emphasize with as we all like to be on TV someway somehow.<br/><br/>Safety Guy: This is my favorite from Jim, it's basically a parody on all of the PSA ads you would sometimes see on TV. Jim's character is an extreme representation of that as he is just constantly doing loads of unsafe demonstrations to prove his point.<br/><br/>Men on Film: It's both Damon and David together as gay film critics. It's just funny on how bias their opinions are as they don't like a film because it either is all women or not just enough men. But then again as an old saying goes to each his own. My favorite one is a two parter as Damon's character gets gonked on the head and becomes straight and of course David's character is trying to gonk him so he can become gay again. I know absurd concept but that's why it's all the more funny.<br/><br/>Hommie the Clown: Damon is just great at playing this disgruntled clown that is a dry smart ass, lots of attitude, crude, angry and is constantly rude to the obnochious kids (though of course their adults) and rightfully wacks them with a sock mallet. He just has some of the best lines, my favorite is his trademark line ""I don't think so."" yeah that what I say whenever some jerk wants me to do something I don't want to do.<br/><br/>In Living Color is bright with colorful humor.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,27 January 2016
1261,In Living Color, A hilariously funny show from the early 90s!!,"This is a great show, and quite funny. I have learned that some people would consider this show as a ""black Saturday Night Live"", and I would agree. An endless number of sketches appear in this show. You've got Fire Marshal Bill (the crazy and dangerous fireman played by Jim Carrey), the Miss Benita sketches (the gossipy woman who saw her friends and said nice things to them, and then gave the home viewers dirty remarks about her friends, played by Kim Wayans), Homey the Clown with his famous line ""Homey don't play that!"" (Damon Wayans), Men On sketches (with David ALan Grier and Damon Wayans as the two gay men, giving their own opinions about certain things), Anton Jackson, the disgusting homeless guy played by Damon Wayans, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, the elderly couple played by David Alan Grier and Kim Wayans, where those sketches started out with them chatting with a relative of theirs, and they start tossing insults at each other when their relatives leave. That is a funny one as well. I also love the Cousin Elsie sketches, with Kim Wayans. Cousin Elsie was so funny and did that gross gesture with her tongue constantly. (Be glad she did not try to give you a kiss like that!!!) I also love the sketches of Ugly Wanda, with Jamie Foxx. And, some others were perfect as well. During the first three seasons of the show (1990-93), the Wayans family members made this show quite funny with the many skits they did (from what I heard). But, by the show's 4th season (1993-94), things had changed. The theme song was given a new sound, the Wayans family had all left after the 3rd season (there were some new cast members of the show on the following season who were not quite famous yet), and the new sketches for the last season were not quite as funny as the ones the Wayans family did during the previous three seasons. Some of the familiar sketches stayed in, those being Fire Marshal Bill and Ugly Wanda and several others. But, after the last of the Wayans family left at the end of the 3rd season (I assume in late '93), the humor went out of it, and as I said, some of the newer sketches for the 4th season (1993-94) were not as funny and humorous, which had caused the ratings to go down and by late summer of '94, the show was discontinued. I believe that if the Wayans family had stayed on, the show probably would have kept its humor intact and might have continued on for several more seasons, but with the new cast members and sketches for the 1993-94 season, it went downhill. But think of it this way: The show may have had a short run, but a lot of fun sketches and humor had happened, and it's now available on DVD. I would just love to have this show on DVD sometime soon.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,12 January 2006
1262,In Living Color, The Definitive Early 90's Comedy Show,"Wow. Looking back, this comedy show becomes a time capsule for humor and inside jokes of the early 90's. In Living Color is nothing more than reruns on Comedy Central now, and a reminder of how far its regular comic actors have come. Just look at Jamie Foxx, who is now nominated for Best Actor for Ray. He doesn't do ""comedy"" anymore as he is now a serious dramatic actor. But in this series, he played various comic personas in different skits. This was like an alternative form of Saturday Night Live, and a successful show on Fox which opened the doors to such other hits as Mad TV, which would only about four to five years later. The Wayans Brothers became household names of comedy, and this show launched their career on film and television. And Jim Carrey first gained attention as Fire Marshall Bill before he was Ace Ventura Pet Detective, or the hero in Truman Show or the character in the more serious ""Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind."" Jim Carrey stood out as the comic white guy in a primarily black cast. Also, the then unknown Jennifer Lopez was one of the chorus dancers known as the ""Fly Girls"" who danced in a choreographed early 90's music. The jokes are best seen as funny for its time- the early 90's. For those of us old enough to remember, and yes some of us were kids or growing up in the 90's and recall every thing in the media or TV- we recall such hilarious spoofs of such news events as Lorenna Bobbit, Heidi Flies the Hollywood Madam, the Melendez Brothers who killed their parents for their money, the Rodney King beating and ensuing Riots and many other things. The comedy in this show was pure hilarity thanks to the talents of the Wayans Brothers who morphed into such funny figures as Homey the Clown....""Homey don't play that!"" he would say as he beat someone with his balloon. Kim Wayans as a funny, bum lady who gossiped ""But you didn't hear that from me."" She would say. A very funny and memorable show. I still like it, even if it's campy or old-fashioned now.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,25 February 2005
1263,In Living Color, Great Show for its Time,"This was the perfect Sunday evening show from 1990-1994. It was nice to end a weekend on a totally hilarious show. Although, this show was based on African American comedy, it really tried hard to appeal to everybody. And people who deserved to be made fun of were made fun of.<br/><br/>Favorite Skits:<br/><br/>Jim Carrey as Captain Hazelwood (Exxon Valdez): Everything that Jim Carrey touched turned into a disaster. The coffee maker spitted out coffee everywhere. His wife packed him a quart of whiskey in his lunch box.<br/><br/>Keenan Ivory Wayans as Richard Pryor: It showed Richard Pryor getting scared by eating a box of cereal late at night. You really have to be familiar with Richard Pryor to get the joke, but I thought it was real funny.<br/><br/>Lassie 1990: Lassie as a pit bull brings in a severed arm and Kelly Coffield and Jim Carrey play naive mother and son. They were so naive it was funny.<br/><br/>Keenan Ivory Wayans as Bill Cosby: Bill Cosby was selling condemns to prevent ""stupid"" people from producing more ""stupid"" people. It was a parallel to Bill Cosby's Jello Pudding Pops. The Cosby skit was done very well, with all of Bill Cosby's famous facial expressions.<br/><br/>Homie the Clown: All were good, but I especially like the Christmas one.<br/><br/>The show sputtered towards the end, when some of the main characters left and the jokes got old, but for the first 2 years it was awesome.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,,24 July 2003
1264,In Living Color," Excellent show, I miss it very much!","In contrast to the previous review, I beg to differ with the comment about Kelly Coffield. In my opinion Kelly Coffield was one of THE most talented actors on the show. I felt she was very passionate and even moving at times. One episode in particular showed off her passion when she played a 1940's or 1950's (I'm really not sure) black &amp; white scene waiting for her Johnny. If you are lucky enough to see this episode, didn't actually air until later seasons (Sorry I forget), you'll understand what I mean about conviction and passion.<br/><br/>As for the vulgarity of later episodes/ seasons, I would have to agree they did push the envelope a bit but I believe America was more than ready for the drastic change in entertainment. I mean Mad TV is basically the same thing but with a quieter roar is all. Let's face it they can only attempt to be what In Living Color was. Thanks to syndication we can all enjoy the sweet past of hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>The Wayans are pioneers of great comedy and truly paved the way for some of the talent we are all seeing today.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,24 August 2004
1265,In Living Color, Miss IT much,"I just wanted to say.. I agree so much with you guys.. first of all .. it is now 2010 and I must say... I still miss In Living Color. It was fresh.. it was these fresh comedians take on things and with the little hints of reality that we all see.. on the streets and in our lives.. it was refreshing to laugh about that stuff. Is it Politically correct .. I am so FReakin tired of Politically Correct (PC) PC is for politicians. Its not real. Its not real life. We should all be accepting of each other but forget the being PC all the time..we need to be real.. we need to laugh at each other some and at ourselves but still be OK and realize basically life is just funny and its OK to laugh at those things we are wondering about in our heads.. that these comedians bring up.. we need to laugh while we can. We need more stuff like this. Unfortunately In Living Color is STILL fresh comedically. We really need some fresh new talent and views with a new show developed from a comedic point of view. Their way of presenting things in a fun and lite hearted and ACCEPTING but still poking fun way... and the style in which they did it.. its still much better than all the things being presented so far. Yes I liked MADTV for awhile...Sat. Night Live is not even funny anymore. Lets pick up some raw, breaking the ""rules"" (whatever they are.. who knows since its changing all the time) talent. And the fact that they were black.. some people mentioned that white people didn't want to watch it.. well they had preconceived notions about what it was. I think I actually did too (embarrassed here) but once I watched it IT was SO not about that. and it was AWESOME.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,6 April 2010
1266,In Living Color, Best skit-comedy since SNL,"What can you say about a hilariously funny show that spawned careers for<br/><br/>Jim Carrey, Jennifer Lopez, and countless Wayan's brothers and a sister.<br/><br/>I loved it. I remember watching this show when it first appeared on TV<br/><br/>in April of 1990 and then cancelled in 1994. Occasionally they'll play<br/><br/>re-runs on The FX Network. Thank God for Fox's attempt at Monopoly. Some<br/><br/>skits that were great Dirty Dozens (especially the one with Biz Markie);<br/><br/>Homey D Clown; Men on Film; Firemarshal Bill; Homeboy Shopping Network;<br/><br/>Snuff and Bone (my brother and I still quote those, ""I gonna go Milli<br/><br/>Vanilli on your butt!

Where for some reason the Wayan's<br/><br/>family left and the new members of the cast couldn't carry the show.<br/><br/>Afterall how many times could you see that terrible impression of:<br/><br/>""Sandra Burnheart, Baby! And I'm fabulous, Sister!"" When exactly did she<br/><br/>EVER say that?? Umm... NEVER! And poor Chris Rock! One of the greatest<br/><br/>stand-ups and SNL alums had a 2-bit part on that show. ""Good LORD!<br/><br/>That's a terrible thing to do to a guy! How about we cancel this show<br/><br/>and Chris Rock can move on to better things like an HBO gig!?"" That<br/><br/>would have been a great line. By the way. This was the show where I<br/><br/>first got the term: BLACK PERSON SHOW. It came from a David Alan Grier<br/><br/>sketch called, ""Black Person Show."" It was a running gag the last year<br/><br/>or 2 of the show.

1267,In Living Color," Hilarious, One of the best shows of the 90's","I found that this show was very funny and that it was one of the best shows of the ninety's. Though, during the original air time, Jim Carrey started to do the Fire Marshall Bill skit almost every week and oddly. It became annoying. I watch two shows that the two of the former cast members are in. I just love Damon Wayans in My Wife and Kids, and Thats so raven is alright. The characters are moving on and they are finding new things that will make them even more famous. Though, I have not seen some of them since the show. Cari Ann, one of the fly girls, made an appearance on 'He's a Lady' as a choreographer. Keenan Ivory Wayans And SW1, also known as Shaun Wayans, were in White Ckicks, a nonstop comedy about two black guys dressing up as two white chicks. And, we all know that Jim Carrey has had his time of stardom and more. He is in a new movie, Limoney Snicket's A Series of Unfortonite Events.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,27 December 2004
1268,In Living Color, The best show on Sunday nights in the early '90s,"This show was one of the things that defined my adolescence. I hadn't thought about it until I had heard that the first season of the show was going to be released on DVD. I was so excited and the most memorable and quotable sketches from the show immediately came back into my head. I picked up a copy the day that it was released and I was quite pleased with it aside from its skimpy special features. It only featured David Alan Grier, Tommy Davidson, and Rosie Perez (the choreographer of the Fly Girls) in its commentary. Neither any of the Wayans family members nor Jim Carrey was featured in the commentary and that was a bit of a let-down. Anyway, this is not solely about the DVD.<br/><br/>The show itself, in my opinion, was way ahead of its time as far as the jokes were concerned. I find that even though this show began its four-year journey 14 years ago, the jokes remain as fresh today as they did then. However, the Fly Girl dancing sequences are really dated because of their Afrocentric and Day-Glo costumes as well as the dance moves (think the Running Man and the Roger Rabbit) and music such as Digital Underground and Kid N' Play. Its original cast (before most of the Wayans family left by its final season) was superb in every sense of the word. The strongest players, however, were Damon Wayans, David Alan Grier, and Jim Carrey. Those guys evoked the most laughter for me.<br/><br/>Some of the most memorable sketches include ""Homey the Clown"" (Damon Wayans), ""Fire Marshal Bill"" (Jim Carrey), ""Men on ___"" (Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier), ""Anton"" (Damon Wayans), ""Funky Finger Productions"" (David Alan Grier and Tommy Davidson), ""Calhoun Tubbs"" (David Alan Grier), the Homeboy skits (Keenen Ivory Wayans and Damon Wayans), ""Hey Mon"" (Damon Wayans, Tommy Davidson, T'Keyah ""Crystal"" Keymah, and Kim Coles), ""Benita Butrell"" (Kim Wayans), ""Vera DeMilo"" (Jim Carrey), and the many various parodied music videos from the likes of Vanilla Ice, M.C. Hammer, Michael Jackson, and Crystal Waters.<br/><br/>This show ultimately gives a cross-section of the politics, the fashion, the trends, and the happenings of the time in comedic form. Keenen Ivory Wayans most likely did not know how much of a phenomenon his show would become in 1990, but I think that he knew that his show would reach some people. Boy, did it ever.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,24 April 2004
1269,In Living Color," Two Thumbs up in a circle, a snap and a slap","`In Living Color' is a classic.  Not only did it catapult several comics into stardom... i.e. Jim Carry and several of the Wayans brothers, it also shared black humor with the world.  It served it up raw and real.  The cultural taboos of society were dissected, ridiculed and sarcastically played out without any reservations. We laughed at the rich, poor, handicapped, gays, men, women, children, religions, social injustices and politics.  Nothing was sacred and that's the way we liked it, on the fly and honest.  If you're looking for adult humor that is a not stereotypical, `In Living Color' may well fit the bill. If imitation is truly the best form of flattery, today's SNL and Mad TV using comedic story lines and even characters made famous from `In Living Color' is proof.  However, I believe there is nothing like an original",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,9 April 2004
1270,In Living Color, Nothing lasts forever,"I was 12 when this show came on Sunday nights (after The Simpsons maybe, I'm not sure), and this show was the talk of junior high school on Monday morning (I even remembered when they had to change their logo after getting sued by black rockers Living Color who had a similar logo). Keenan Ivory Wayans was a comedic genius and he brought his family and friends to bring us an urban version of ""Saturday Night Live"". Many careers started from this show (i.e., Fly Girl dancers Jennifer Lopez and Rosie Perez, Jamie Foxx, James ""Jim"" Carrey, Damon Wayans) as well as many catch phrases (""Homey don't play that"", ""I'll rock your world"", ""Hated it"", ""Lemme show you something!!"", and the list goes on).<br/><br/>""In Living Color"" made fun of American culture and while there are too many standout sketches to name, one example is a play off of a sitcom called ""A Different World"" named ""A Different Message"" (Kim Wayans sang the theme song: ""It's a different message/And we'll shove it down your throat!""). Here, whenever a character said a ""black power""-type message, everyone around him/her would applaud. You had to watch ""A Different World"" to get the jokes.<br/><br/>As with all sketch comedies, the laughter didn't last. Actors start leaving (in this case, the Wayans clan) and the hilarity declined with each Wayans' departure. The jokes and the recurring characters were getting old, especially Jamie Foxx's ""Wanda"" who became more a bathroom break during the course of the show, and the series ended.

1273,In Living Color, Let's just say the best skits were really funny,"I wanted to like this, and the best sketches in it are really funny and you can watch them over and over again.<br/><br/>But ... unfortunately the humour is mostly very very low-brow and downright toiletary. The best example is the joke they ended the first season on: It's about a ""Butthead"" family which has buttcheeks on top of their heads. Hilarity ensues... This embarrassingly unimaginative setup is followed by every single butt joke that you can think of yourself. <br/><br/>Poor Tommy Davidson is a funny guy, but his commentary on that last Season 1 episode on the DVD set is a bit on the rosy-coloured glasses side. He calls that Butthead joke setup ""risqué"" - well, ""infantile"" would be another word that comes to mind.<br/><br/>I'm not really impressed when you only ""push the censors"" by using foul language. Politically and socially this show was pretty tame.<br/><br/>Often there is no real joke but just an over-use of one-liners pushed down your throat like ""Homey don't play that"" etc. <br/><br/>Well, again, there is good stuff in there and there is a huge advantage compared to ""Saturday Night Live"": the sketches are shorter and to the point.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,5.0,14 April 2008

While I am not close to that age, I do find this to be a pretty  well done show. I also find that the fact that Leo Howard actually does  martial arts makes his actions on screen a bit easier to accept as  real. I do believe that a lot of the hard stuff that is shown is just  special effects and prepared props. Over all though this is a fun,  decently done show. Olivia Holt does not have a martial arts background  that I could find but does have an extensive dance and gym history  which would allow her to appear as if she knew karate with descent  props. There is a good blend of types in this show-Jerry the punk,  Milton the nerd, Rudy the dork sensei. The real message in the show is  that friends are friends and don't give up or abandon each other. I  think that is a nice, positive message to send out. 3/4/2014- Okay this  update is because I am not watching this program anymore.

1280,Kickin' It, This is a review of the show Kickin It. This review is mainly about the characters of the show.,"I personally think that 'Kickin It' has lots of potential.

He such a guys guy and so sweet at the same time. I like that. That's how I see him, anyway. I also love Kim. She is one of the guys without being a total jock. I love having friends of mine who are girls that are like that. I'm like that. Milton is funny (sorta) and sophisticated. he reminds me of Cole Sprouse. Jerry is so funny! He reminds me of Moises Arias, which makes sense since Moises is his brother. Eddies okay. The show could deal without him, but he's a nice touch. I personally don't think the show could make it without both Jack and Kim. And am I the only one who sees it, or can everybody see them definitely getting together one day? In personally think that'd be a perfect add on to the series. Anyway, 'Kickin it' is an awesome show, that I think most people would like.

1282,Kickin' It, Pretty Entertaining,"Apparently I'm still trying to hang on to my youth. The days of watch Saved By The Bell, Boy Meets World, All That, Keenan and Kel, etc. Well Kickin' It really has very little in common with those shows, but the reason I bring it up is one day while I was kind of under the weather I wanted a movie or TV show I could just kind of chill and watch and found Kickin' It. <br/><br/>It's not really a kids show per se, because from what I've gathered Disney XD is a channel for boys and male teenagers, so that appears to be it's target audience. <br/><br/>The Show centers around a group of misfit kids that go to the same school and all hang out at the same Bobby Wasabi Dojo and practice and compete in Karate. The Dojo is run by a 30-something shorty Rudy, played by Jason Earles. Leo Howard stars as the main character and best student of the Dojo, with the one girl on the show, Kim who isn't far behind in being Jack's equal.<br/><br/>The best way to review the show is to give pros and cons. So here it goes:<br/><br/>Pros: - It's entertaining and has enough action to keep you interest. In addition it's not overly cheezy with relationship, though this is not to be confused with over-acting or what some may call over-the-top. Some Disney Channel shows use this because of it's target audience, Kickin' It uses it for comedy effect, and mostly it's Jason Earles' Rudy that gets brunt of it, and it's more physical comedy than anything. Some will think this is hilarious, while others will run screaming for the hills. <br/><br/>-The choreography and stories can get a bit repetitive, for example Jack typically has to save the day or at least be one to initiate the finale battle, except for a few episodes. The martial arts are entertaining to watch and seem to try and blend as much authenticity along with physical comedy. <br/><br/><ul><li>One of the few shows I've seen that seems to really rely on the studio audience. If a joke works, you'll know it, if it doesn't you'll know it. Not a whole lot filler laughs or added laughter, if any. </li></ul><br/><br/>-A growing and changing relationship between two characters is actually handled well and is a bit more believable than most teen shows. There are a few awkward moments, which is expected but it's usually not done with over-cheezing. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-The show is formulaic in a sense you know where everything is going, though there are a few twists that may surprise people. <br/><br/>-Some of the intended jokes might be seen as potentially offensive and/or racist. This is in part due to the owner of the Bobby Wasabi DoJo, but it really depends on each individual and their viewpoints. Some martial art students may be able to point on inaccuracies and other issues.<br/><br/>If have boys and/or girls between ages 10-14 they might enjoy this series. I think 15 and above might like some aspects but get kind of bored with it. But who knows everyone is different. I'm a bit older than the targeted age range, but find some aspects, especially the martial arts very entertaining, and Jason Earles' physical comedy is pretty funny.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,8 February 2013

1285,Kickin' It, Favorite XD Show,"Sure, there are a ton of clichés...but my tweens think it's hilarious, and my hubby and I enjoy Rudy's (Jason Earles) comedy. He is close to our ages, so a lot of the adult humor that goes over our kids' heads cracks us up. He has a lot of flashbacks from the 80s/90s, and some of the more subtle humor is intentionally geared toward adults.<br/><br/>As silly and unrealistic some of the story lines can be, it is pretty clear it is all about the humor with some pretty impressive fighting scenes occasionally thrown in. When you consider you are watching a teenager, who at this date is only 15 years old, it is easy to admire the lead character, Jack (Leo Howard). Are we seeing a future action star at work? Yet I tend to look at each character, hoping they don't end up going down the same paths actresses like Lohan, Cyrus, and Spears have gone.<br/><br/>Anyway, we really enjoy watching the show with all of its frivolity and goofiness. It makes us laugh, and laughter is a good thing.",5 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,4 June 2013
1286,Kickin' It, I actually enjoyed it,"I'm not really a fan of Disney's live-action shows but this one was actually entertaining. Yes it can get corny at times and not every joke lands but the characters are likable, the stories are interesting, the dialogue's decent and the fight scenes are pretty cool. The premise's about a young martial artist named Jack (Leo Howard) who signs up with a failing dojo called the Bobby Wasabi Martial Arts Academy in hopes of improving its reputation. In addition to learning martial arts he also learns about friendship, loyalty and respect.<br/><br/>I really like the characters, the actors make the lines work. Most of their lines are corny but they still deliver it well enough to be believable. The fight scenes are well choreographed. The jokes are also funny too. The episode where Eddy's blackmailed into pranking his friends is hilarious. When it's revealed why he was blackmailed I found it hilarious. I'd say check it out.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,24 July 2019
1287,Kickin' It, Okay,"I think Kickin it is okay but what bugs me is Jack's sense of entitlement.He obviously thinks he is the best and looks down on people. My favorite is Jerry, he's cool, dances and a dork. When Jerry wanted to win the dance competition, they didn't take it seriously so I didn't get why there were mad when he ditched them. When they wanted to win a go kart and they thought Jerry wouldn't win it because he was broke, He ended up buying it and they were mad at him for buying it. They called it their go kart like they didn't buy it with their money. I hate Kim, she's too bossy and a know it all. Eddy is okay. Milton is okay too. Jack and Kim's relationship was overrated. Phil is awesome and so is Rudy. Jack's catchphrase is corny and he isn't perfect like the gang thinks he is.

1288,Kickin' It, Overall great show,"This show is great for what it's supposed to be. This show is not supposed to be some super funny show with the best production, it's just supposed to be a lighthearted show *for kids*. That's what I think a lot of people don't realize is that this is a kids show, it's not supposed to be perfect. It was my favorite show for the time that it was running, and I didn't see many problems with it. After re watching it I have seen that the laugh tracks are a bit overused, but it gets better. I don't think that full grown adults should be bringing down the rating of the show if they have said in their review that their kids enjoy it, and the fact that the show isn't meant for them. The show has great characters, and I know they're a bit stereotypical, but it's Disney. The character development is great towards the end, and I actually enjoy the stereotypes. They are done in such a way that I don't really think the show would be as good if they weren't there. If Milton wasn't a big nerd stereotype, then his character wouldn't be as great, and there are episodes for each of the characters that help them evolve. Jack is kinda full of himself in the first and second season, but he's like 14 in the show, and he knows karate very well, that's not unrealistic behavior. The show has a couple flaws, but in my opinion they all work together to make the show better in some way or another.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,13 September 2020

1291,Kickin' It, A favorite,"I started watching this a few days ago, and I love it! I love all the characters too, especially Jack! Seriously, what's wrong with some of you? Being very skilled doesn't make a person flawless, and there's nothing wrong with being very skilled. It doesn't make Rudy look like a joke, either. Sure, it's not like Rudy taught all that Jack can do from before moving to Seaford, but look at what Rudy has done for him (and the rest of his students) throughout the show. Rudy has made Jack better!<br/><br/>I love Kim! On a personal note, I'll say this, though: for someone who likes to look good, she certainly doesn't think about taking dancing lessons. Anyway, she's an amazing character.<br/><br/>Milton is nerdy, but sweet and smart and can fight if he gets in the zone. Same with the others. They CAN fight and they love karate, but I think they like being in the comfort zone a little more.<br/><br/>They should make a movie. Lizzie McGuire got one, Even Stevens got one, Hannah Montana got one, Wizards of Waverly Place got one and also has a special, Good Luck Charlie got a movie too...<br/><br/>Disney did karate, and now they're doing a spy show (KC Undercover). I can't believe I never gave those a try a long time ago. I love Kickin It and KC Undercover, among others, now. People! Give a show a chance, because letting others stop you by putting something down is letting them make up your mind for you.

1292,Kickin' It, Good,"This show is one of the better children's sitcoms I've watched in a long time. I watched only a couple episodes of hannah Montana and I genuinely liked it. I think icarly was good and drake and Josh was fantastic. Suite life on deck and pair of kings were really funny and I enjoyed them. They've been progressively getting worse like victorious, lab rats, and crap shows like ANT Farm, sonny with a chance, and basically anything on Disney channel and nickelodeon. Kickin' it's previews and advertisements were weak. I watch the first episode and I was utterly impressed with the use of violence and martial arts rather than just one punch. I liked that they showed action but I'm confused with they didn't rate this show TV-Y7(FV) because there are fight scenes and violence in the majority of the episodes. They've gotten better until season 4. The fight scenes in seasons 2 and 3 were really good and it was entertaining. I watched 7 episodes of season 4 and there were no fight scenes in any of them. I was glad that Eddie's character was written because his character wasn't funny, interesting, or any physical capabilities. I was extremely saddened when Kim left because I liked her as a character as a positive, sassy, and confidently awkward person. Her relationship with jack was glossed over a lot but I wanted to see character development. Milton and jerry are annoying because their characters cannot be worked with. They can't fight but Disney XD can't trick me into thinking he can fight. Jerry was just obnoxious and idiotic. He can be funny but he just comes off as irritating. Jack's character is especially weak. Him being an expert close to Rudy's was bad because it made Rudy look like a bad sensei for him just showing up and being able to kick just as much butt as Rudy. Jack being a ""flawless"" character leaves no room for development or believability that he's in danger or has a problem. Rudy is a great sensei as where a mentor is supposed to discipline his students but that is played on as he's the most immature. He puts himself into weird situations and reacts as immaturely as possible. He can fight which is good and expected from a sensei. He's a funny likable character. He's my favorite. The show is genuinely funny with some good ideas.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,6 March 2015
1293,Kickin' It, Kickin' It a really nice surprise...,"When I saw that Disney was producing a ""Karate"" show, I didn't expect much. After watching several episodes, I discovered it was good program. The young cast meshed well, the stunts were well executed, the stories were palatable.<br/><br/>Over the years I watched the cast grow up, while the stories shrank. The kids have done their best, Jack is strong and powerful, but remains humble, Jerry is hilarious, I missed Kim when she left, she added balance to the team. In what seemed like its final year, the character Milton seemed to have pages of dialogue and talked endlessly. The innocence of the early years was gone.<br/><br/>But even worse, the show just seemed to fade out. You'd think that Disney would give a program that worked hard for four years to give the channel its best, would get a good send off. Disney XD gave Zeke and Luther a proper good-bye and final episodes; Kickin' it certainly deserved it. There were many great episodes, but if I had to select just one, I think it would be when Jack fell asleep in Rudy's office and he had a dream that they were all in a 70s detective episode. It was extremely well done.<br/><br/>Kickin' it episodes will replay for years. I'm sure kids, not even born, will enjoy the adventures of Jack,Jerry, Kim and Milton as Wasabi Warriors.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,22 February 2015
1294,Kickin' It," An incredibly condescending, lazy and at times upsetting children's sitcom, ""Kickin' It"" is atrocious all around...","Whatever happened to quality kid's programming? I grew up in the early 90's, with classics like ""The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete"", ""Animaniacs"" and one of the best TV-series of all time, ""Batman: The Animated Series"", which was arguably better than any of the films at the time.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, I watched the pilot and clips from other episodes of the Disney XD sitcom ""Kickin' It"" the other day. This is the definition of what is wrong with entertainment these days, particularly entertainment aimed at children.<br/><br/>It's one of the most condescending, lazy, and at times even blatantly upsetting children's shows I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The series basically follows Jack, a martial arts expert and the new kid at school. He joins the Bobby Wasabi (Ugh) Katate Accademy along with other social misfits, and the series follows the group, headed by Rudy, an irritating character who is a walking clumsy 20-somethign cliché.<br/><br/>The characters are all lowest-common-denominator clichés. Ex. Jerry, an annoying lone-wolf type who oozes nothing but lines of dialog we've heard hundreds of times before. Or Milton, who along with a father is clearly a fairly racist, geeky depiction of a certain religion.<br/><br/>Ad to that the incompetent writing (the pilot is almost a word-for-word rip-off of ""The Karate Kid"" at times), and some truly awful ""Yellow Face"" racism by the character of Bobby Wasabi who pops up from time to time, (I don't care if the character is meant to be Asian or White, he's clearly a white man in Yellowface) and the show actually becomes upsetting to watch for older viewers.<br/><br/>The production is also incredibly lazy. From the aforementioned rip-off scripts, to the DOA jokes, there's no effort put into the production at all.<br/><br/>What happened to quality children's programming? Seriously.

I watched some episode in witch the children of the dojo go to the arcade and become masters of some game similar to the kinect for XBOX360 because its about karate and they happen to be black belts in some type of martial arts. Disney is really doing a bad job coming up with good sitcoms ever since Miley Cyrusleft. Disney once had a lot of good shows witch a lot of children watched, but now its just like making random shows witch no kids watch at all.

The group of geek/nerds guy are simply insulting, I always was considered one and I kicked ass of any bully who tried to intimidate me almost getting expelled for letting some of them crying. what's wrong with Disney and stereotypes ? The protagonist ? oh dear god .... no men, I don't care with who you train with, I don't care if he was the friggin Mister Miyagi, you can't be even better than teachers in your short life !. The only reason they make him so perfect, is because they wanted him to be an idol, and example to follow, they wanted to every kid to relate themselves with Jack-ass, he is the hero and the protagonist, and even when kids might like that, it bores me to death.<br/><br/>The comedy ? oh dear god why, I don't know if I have seen another show abuse so much of the resource of CL, literally, is canned laugh every 5 seconds the characters talk, its like the producers are right behind you, screaming to your ears '' Laugh ! Laugh !!! Laugh!!!!!!!!!'' If you are 6 years old or can get related to any of the characters you are possible giving this a 8. If you don't, you are possible hating this.

Until yesterday when I heard Rudy utter this line: ""Here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women"". No one is a bigger fan of Jaws than me. I'm Pavlovian, in fact, and now have to watch it again for the hundredth time. But this joke (apropos of nothing by the way) about peering between a women's legs is not appropriate for age 7+.

The new actors are alright, there's bailey who's a pretty good addition kind of funny and pretty much the (hot) girl of the show, and then there's Woody who is pretty crazy and like a wild card. I was a little worried at first that they had said the show was going to be completely different. But its the same old Zack and Cody and the other actors that moved on which really made me happy. I also want to point out that I am sure a majority of kids are watching the episodes on the computer and not the T.V. so there are a lot of viewers.

I was satisfied, I guess...<br/><br/>The episodes were definitely much weaker than the original series in my opinion and the show as a whole was not as good, but its certainly watchable and enjoyable. There are a few irritating characters, most notably Debby Ryan's ANNOYING, LAME AND FRUSTRATING character called Bailey Pickett. Seriously, Debby Ryan replaced Ashley Tisdale's Maddie and was a horrible replacement character. She's plain annoying, bad actress and just not funny at all. Another annoying replacement, at times, is Ms Tuttweiler. Though her character is good, we all would much rather have Carey as that type of character. Estaban himself was replaced by a funny character named Kirby, but he wasn't anywhere near as great as Estaban. I was so glad that Mr Moseby was not replaced or I just wouldn't have watched the show.<br/><br/>The idea of twins on a sea school was not totally believable but it worked well. The acting in this show is brilliant by most, except for Debby Ryan. Another positive aspect is that there were a few double length episodes and a trilogy episode.

No, I am not a creeper, I just enjoy the dynamic of the show and the twin's antics remind me of the stuff I used to do when I was younger. The show is sort of a nostalgic piece for me, a modern show of a more innocent time of moral family programming. Although my girlfriend despises the show and protests fiercely when she walks in and I am watching it, I find myself apathetic to he pleas. I guess I am just immature.<br/><br/>The dynamics between the characters is entertaining. Brenda Song is excellent and as soon as she figures out how to remove that Disney exploding neck collar and branch out, she will do well . The show is pretty funny as I did mention before I am pretty immature.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes the show great is that Brenda Song is hot. Not a very important production element or plot device, but important nonetheless.<br/><br/>The show as whole, like all Disney shows, does not entirely relate to young people.

1309,The Suite Life on Deck, Typical Disney show production ... great outcome!,"As with all Disney shows produced ""The Suite Life on Deck"" is a great show for kids and teens. The Sprouse brothers and the whole cast does a great job as well as the casting director by looking for guest stars and co-stars. As I already mentioned in the title - it is a typical Disney show production - so it is very likely that adults won't be tho thrilled with it. If you are not an adult in the entertainment business and watch it for the purpose to keep up with Disney and Nick style you have a real boring life. It is made for kids and teens and it is good. The show also, for adults maybe not so obvious, points out problems and issues of teenagers in our society. As it is with all shows and films it might be a bit overdone ... The show is obviously a bit campy - but in a good way - kids enjoy it watching fun and this is the only way to bring these issues closer to them. By observing the content and the plots we can filter out the issues of growing up teenage boys (also in some ways of girls) and the American issue of masculinity and femininity. Further we see the problems of school and leisure time and how it is supposed to look like in our society. Of course not everything in the show is great. It is not the most expensive production which of course takes away some of the quality. Some of the cast members from The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody are not in this show. In some ways that's positive in some it is negative. Ashley Tisdale is missing to play the opposite of Brenda Song. Casting did a good job to find a substitute and therefore a new cast member with Debby Ryan. Still Tisdale is missing.<br/><br/>All in all the show is very well made for KIDS and TEENS and I am pretty sure that they will enjoy watching it.

Zack ripping off the girls shirt, and when Woody asks how they have a baby and their teacher says ""that's another class"", etc).

And they didn't purposely get rid of Maddie, people move on. And sure Bailey isn't Maddie, but that's the point. She's Bailey, not Maddie. Stop being such snobs. Oh, AND this is a Spin off.

Surprisingly Zach annoys me less than what I would have thought, in fact I would say he is the best character and he is only getting better (however, Dylan does get ridiculous story lines like in 'Breakup in Paris'). Cody is frustrating, he whines way too much. Still funny, but a bit extravagant if you ask me. London, while albeit funny as well, her air-headedness is taken to the extreme. She wasn't this bad in the first season of the original Zach and Cody. I also can't stand the way she makes fun of Ms. Tutwiler, her teacher. Erin, who plays Emma Tutwiler is a beautiful woman, and in no way is she ugly! How can her students get off with making fun of her? It shouldn't bother me, but it does.<br/><br/>As for Woody, Kirby, and Marcus – they are unnecessary characters. Zach is already a bit ditzy, and London completely daft. When you put in Woody and Kirby, it is just foolish. They add nothing to the show. We could have had great supporting characters like Esteban (not saying bring him in the show but someone like him). And Marcus, he just popped up out of nowhere and there is nothing special about him.<br/><br/>I like Bailey but I am tired of the excessive talk of home life back in Kettlecorn. She is a less than mediocre replacement of Maddie.<br/><br/>The reason for my high rating is because it is an entertaining show, stupid, but something to laugh at.",9 out of 16 found this helpful.,8.0,1 July 2010

The jokes are corny and terrible, London's stupidity is just plain annoying (is she mentally retarded or something?), Bailey is too sweet (made me want to throw up)... the only saving grace is Phil Lewis who plays Mr Moseby.<br/><br/>And Disney needs to stop it with the adult jokes. This is not freaking HBO!<br/><br/>Replacing Ashley Tisdale was a big mistake. There was no chemistry between London and Bailey. It's like Disney wanted to shove it down our throats how cool/cute/funny Bailey is. FYI, Disney, no, she's not.<br/><br/>Dylan and Cole, skip Disney and move on to the big screen.

And Third, The show is so darn corny, the Jokes are not even funny. They are the sort of Jokes a 4th grader, might laugh at, not the mention the Disney channel aimed this shows for viewers between the age of 8 and 14. My seven year old brother stopped watching this show. This show should have ended after episode 1. Mr. Mosby is pointless in the show, Zach is a wanna be bad ass.

The writing is so horrible I wouldn't be surprised to learn a barrel is filled with phrases and punchlines then a chimp randomly selects and assembles the plot. The character of Tipton makes Lovie Howell look like Mother Theresa, just so over the top annoying I don't understand how she alone doesn't kill the ratings. The other characters are shallow and mainly seem to rely on being cute more than likable. I can't say about the actor's talents based on what they have to work with. Actually they must be good to sell this sort of poor material.

1323,The Suite Life on Deck, Brings your mood up,"I actually kind of enjoy this show. Its a guilty pleasure for me. I usually am not a fan of the Disney channel shows these days, but this one is just.... happy and nice. I struggle with depression, and this show surprisingly helps. When I get depressed, I like to watch TV to get my mind off things, but I don't like watching dramatic, or sad things when I'm in a depressed mood obviously. So, I turn to this show. It has stupid characters, and cheesy comedy, but I get a few laughs out of it sometimes. I think that the Sprouse twins are hilarious, surprisingly. They are super cute, and funny to watch. I mean, twins on TV are usually funny, but I really enjoy watching these Twins. Brenda Song is good for her role, London Tipton. She portrays her character as Stupid, Rich, Selfish, and mostly mean. You need a mean girl in every TV show though, right? Anyway, this show really just lifts up your mood, no matter how cheesy it is. If you enjoy Disney channel, then you will enjoy this show.

The characters are funny, and I love how honest they are. They talk about things that I never would've thought Disney would have. They also have a lot of humor that you wouldn't believe they would say. The episode where Cody went to live with Monks, Woody makes a joke about a ""little dingy"" (a small rowboat). I just love how they aren't trying to shelter kids, and give them good jokes. Another reason why this show is so wonderful is how educational it is. They travel around the world, showing kids different heritages. I also love how good the characters are. They aren't bratty or snobby... well besides London ;) The characters are such good role models. I also love how they accept each other. All of the characters are so different, yet their good friends. London and Addison are airheads, Bailey and Cody are smart, Mr. Moseby and Ms. Tutweiler are great adult figures, Maya and Marcus are cool, and Zack and Woody are goofy.

1326,Rush, Off to a great start...,"Last time I wrote a review I did it in defense of a show that deserved to be defended. This time I'm likely the first (amongst IMDb users that is).<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't have heard about this show if I hadn't stumbled on it's premiere by accident. Which would have been a shame to be honest.<br/><br/>I was very positively surprised watching the premiere episode unlike with most shows these days where the hype gets built up by promos and trailers only for it all to end with a big disappointment come premiere day.<br/><br/>One thing that I don't get about the general information on the show is the genre. It's listed as Action/Drama, which is accurate but what is missing here is a Comedy tag. <br/><br/>The show is genuinely funny!<br/><br/>But it's the Joss Whedon meets Nathan Fillion meets House M.D. kind of funny for people who know what I mean. Comedy here is how the characters - or rather the main character - handles day to day situations and interacts with others.<br/><br/>For some reason Comedy genre tag has lately been reserved for those 20- something minute dumb sitcoms which I honestly cannot bear to watch. The quality of humour in those is below what I'd qualify as pathetic.<br/><br/>The show is very entertaining and pleasant to watch. However as I've mentioned before only a single episode premiered so far, offering everyone who enjoyed it so far a great opportunity to feel disappointed still.<br/><br/>This one's from USA so I'm hoping that will not be the case.",61 out of 65 found this helpful.,10.0,20 July 2014

I have to admit I am a fan of his which makes me biased. I have read the other reviews and cannot understand why anyone would comment on his bad behaviour. It's his bad behaviour that makes his character, we are watching a doctor disillusioned by the way he has been treated and who then takes his actions into his own hands. He has a conscience, but he keeps it under lock and key, he helps people even if he doesn't want to, his humanity is still there. I like Rush as a character. People seem to think if you are a doctor you do it out of the goodness of your heart and helping is a calling. That is obviously true in some cases, and maybe with Rush at one time as well, but a great percentage do it for the money.

In the real world people do this kind of crap. I have seem it myself in the 30 years of nursing. It is better than Grays Anatomy. Not just pretty people and made up unbelievable situations. I can see some of this happening. Keep up the good work. I do hope they keep this program going. They should drop the satisfaction if they need space for a program.. It is so slow and poor writing.

I stuck with it, however, to see what direction it would go in, and am happy to say that it improved. As we gained more background knowledge of the characters and the stories focused less on the ""bad boy"" behaviour, it started to pull me in. There is good chemistry between the characters, except for Sarah, who remains one-dimensional.<br/><br/>I used to love House and really don't see the comparison, so should you decide to view this show, don't compare, just treat it for what it is, light entertainment.

It has the same flow as Royal Pains with the edginess of House. <br/><br/>With every cable channel getting new scripted shows, there are few that hold my interest. Rush is one of the few that does.

Finally, his patients are the rich &amp; famous who have a reason for not wanting mainstream medical care. It all combines for a fascinating storyline in my opinion.

The first episode of this show is very entertaining to say the least with all the drug use, violence and witty dialect that is well scripted. Without revealing TOO much spoilers, the show finally picked up and Dr. Rush finally quit smoking weed, pills, cocaine and all of the absurd drinking for his love of his life which really is a great plot twist because the show is based off being a badass but shows every badass has a soft side and a reason why they became the badass they're known to be.

It's more than likely that stretching it out past a second season would have been a pretty big challenge, but it would have been fun to see what would have happened in season two.

Acting is okay, but the premise is an obvious attempt to mix House MD, ER, Royal Pains and maybe even a little Breaking Bad. Perhaps the concept was a decent idea to begin with, but it has not been built out with strong stories and characters so it is not playing out well. Bottom line, there simply aren't enough new ideas mixed into the concept to bring great intrigue and growth to the show. There's little chemistry between the characters and actors, which is sad because there are some very pretty and handsome people in the cast. The story lines thus far are predicable. No, I won't give spoilers, but I haven't seen anything remotely believable nor a character that makes me want to root for them, regardless if they are a good guy or bad guy. The stories are not even exciting or suspenseful. I was very bored, but tried to give the actors my attention because they were trying to make things work.

1342,Rush," Nice-Looking, Crisply-Directed, Not Fun To Watch","USA Network has taken a significant leap from their ""Lite"" entertainment formula genre shows this summer with the addition of new series Satisfaction and Rush. Apparently someone in the Fox cable division wants to vacate their seat at the kids' table and join the grown-ups who produce edgier, sexier programming. While neither show is all that fun to watch, something regular USA viewers have come to expect, both feature strong supporting casts surrounding a ""fauxmerican""-accented male lead. This works beautifully for A&amp;E's Longmire, with Australian actor Robert Taylor in the title role. Not so well for either of these shows, with Australian Matt Passmore repeating all of the same vocal beats from his The Glades performance and a hint of UK in the utterances of doctor Rush. I am still watching Satisfaction, but I am not hooked. I stopped watching Rush early in episode two when Tom Ellis began singing along to Michael Bolton's ""How Am I Supposed To Live Without You"" and now I am asking you to stop watching as well.

I've only seen the first 2 episodes and it is at best very mildly interesting, but I have no idea in what direction it is going. The acting is uneven and it seems to be a fairly low-budget production and looks it.

And Gregg Araki does not make easy roles: the tone needs to be just right, kind of self-conscious and arrogant and earnest. In other words...very young.

""Catch"" follows the crews of several crab boats as they and the rest of the fleet rush to catch as many crab as possible in the ever-shortening Alaskan crab season. The show gives you an in-depth view of the trouble the crew faces doing everyday tasks, like baiting and dropping crab pots, and how these tasks are made harder by the unforgiving Bering Sea. We see everyone from the ""greenhorns"" (rookies) to the ""old salts"" and the danger they face every day. As evidence of this, as Discovery was filming one boat sank and another lost a crewman overboard, totaling six deaths in the first episode of the Opilio season.

A highly addicting show as you see the struggles, hours and long shift these brave men throw forward in order to meet their quota of crab. (They're braver than I am, I hate the cold.)You also get to know the crew and the different personalities. As serious and dangerous as a job as this is it's nice to see the lightened mood, and the subtle pranks played on each other, and the pots of other boats. This beats the heck out of tired reality shows with rich has been celebrities wining about everything and anything (never watched them anyhow). If you want to see real people, and exciting situations, I highly suggest this show! 10/10. <br/><br/>Discovery channel makes more of a fan out of me each year, first ""Mythbusters"", ""Dirty Jobs"" and the occasional mini series event (ie: ""Planet Earth"") The Medical Mystery programs are also fascinating.",23 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,25 April 2007
1371,Deadliest Catch, Highly addictive.,"This 10-part series came out about a year after ""America's Deadliest Season."" It is interesting how the profession is presented in so many different perspectives - from the captains, the crews, and the greenhorns (rookies). Of particular interest are the traditions and superstitions of the various crews. You will be drawn in and will find yourself so concerned about a ship that has gone down or about an injured deckhand, that you almost have to keep watching just to find out how things turn out. You will find yourself rooting for your favorite boat as the crab counts come in.<br/><br/>Once again, we get to follow the dangerous lives of fishermen hunting for Alaskan Crab. You get to see a first-hand account of several boats journeying hundreds of miles from the beautiful Aleutian Islands into the unpredictably treacherous waters of the Bering Sea. These brave men demonstrate unbelievable endurance as they fish non-stop (day and night). They fish ""derby style,"" which means every boat is competing to catch as much as possible in a fixed amount of time. They hope to earn up to a year's worth of salary in one week in what some call America's last great Gold Rush.<br/><br/>This series has the potential to appeal to a broad audience - whether the taste is for action, adventure, sport, drama, documentary, or reality.

1377,Deadliest Catch," I Used To Love This Show! Sadly, The Last Few Seasons Have Gone Downhill!","Deadliest Catch is a prime example of a good show that stayed on the air too long. The first 8-10 years were great. Then it became 'drama city'. To me, the show was about the families, and shipmates. I'm a retired oilfield and shipyard worker. And, many times when jobs were scarce in those fields, I worked on fishing boats. Even on a few in the Bering Sea (no crab boats though). I mention this because it helps me understand the 'real' from the 'scripted drama'. The series has become almost nothing other than bad behavior and manufactured drama. You have Jake who's a crybaby and admitted addict. He didn't earn his place as captain and is only there because the producers think he'll bring in younger viewers. I've watched him abuse his workers to the point of now, I record the program and fast forward past his segments. Respect is earned Jake, you haven't earned any respect. Then you have Keith. I've watched him belittle and abuse his brother for years. Casey and Josh. They're co-owners. Why is Josh referred to as 'Owner' and Casey as 'co-captain' I like the younger guy Sean. He's a little shady. But, a good guy for the most. The ONLY reason I still watch the program. Then we have a new captain (can't remember his name) who 'checks' other peoples pots. Make no mistake here. If the cameras weren't rolling, he would empty them also. No one makes a long-standing habit of doing that just for a 'looksie'. Then you have the Hansen's. Use to be my favorite guys on the show. Then all the secrets about them came out. One of Sig's daughters says he molested her for years during her child hood. And Edgar just confessed to a sex-crime against a minor last year in a sweet-heart deal that only gave him probation. Hey, the perks of being rich!

1378,Deadliest Catch," Still entertaining, but some of the edge is gone","This review contains reported analysis of some of the story lines in Deadliest Catch that may not be as they have been presented to be.<br/><br/>I have been a big fan of this show from the beginning. Even with the relative sameness of the fishing part of the series, the personal situations and the adversity the crews face with mechanical problems, injuries, fatigue, the weather and the sea keeps it entertaining. More bothersome is the license that Discovery has apparently started to take with this supposedly most realistic of their reality shows. While some things cannot be staged, I have read reports that the network has begun manipulating story lines for entertainment purposes (or perhaps they always have, and we are just now finding out about it).<br/><br/>A couple of examples: DC reported that Captain Elliot Neese was fired from the Ramblin' Rose after last season and that he bought his own boat, the Saga. There are just two problems with this: The head of the company that owns the Ramblin' Rose describes Elliot as ""a fine young man"" and a ""very capable"" captain (just the opposite of how he is portrayed on the show). It has also come out that not only was Ellot not fired from the Ramblin' Rose, the company who owns the RR is also the registered owner of the Saga - not Elliot. He was given the Saga to run because it is considered to be a better boat than the RR. So much for the ""new boat owner"".<br/><br/>In an episode earlier this season it was reported that Elliot told his crew not to knock ice off the Saga as it began listing to one side. As the story goes, the crew ignored his instructions and deiced the boat anyway. First of all, if there is enough ice on a boat to make it list, no captain is going to order his crew not to take an action that might prevent it from capsizing. Second, it also came to light that the footage that supposedly shows Elliot's crew defying his orders was shot during a previous episode and it was spliced in to fit the fabricated story.<br/><br/>There have also been rumors that some of the conflicts aboard the boats are orchestrated for television, and that some of the dialog in the wheelhouses with the captains, instead of being spontaneous and real, is in fact scripted and may be shot in more than one take. Given all of this, I also have to wonder about the portrayal of the personal drama of Elliot Neese of the Saga and his multiple girlfriends, and of Scott ""Junior"" Campbell of the Seabrooke as a double-crossing liar who enters into alliances with other captains and then betrays their trust.<br/><br/>Discovery used to be a network I could count on for scientifically solid, entertaining television. They are rapidly becoming the television equivalent of the trash tabloids you see at the grocery store checkout line (maybe their next series will tell us that space aliens really did visit the President at the White House). They are neck deep in dubious reality shows. They have developed all variety of ""monster"" shows with various groups chasing creatures that probably don't exist, and now they feel the need to lie about what is going on aboard the crab boats. I guess that the Bering Sea just isn't exciting enough anymore.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,1 August 2013
1379,Deadliest Catch, More and more compelling each season,"I first started watching this show a couple of years back, around 2007. Initially I watched it with a sense of amazement about what these people went through weather and working condition wise in order to make a living. As I got sucked in and watched the show develop over the ensuing seasons it has become, in my opinion, one of the most gripping a riveting shows on TV. The personalities of the different boats, the conflict between the crew members on the different boats where they are stuck together for weeks and months in a violently rolling, pitching prison became an even more compelling reason to watch the show. The savage Alaskan weather and stark scenery that I originally watched the show for started to take a back seat to the people involved. Finally with this latest season (written mid 2010) and the death of Captain Phil so poignantly and tastefully documented, along with some other serious problems for other boats and crews, this show has become the most heartfelt, compelling thing I can find to watch.

The third episode, Dynoman and the volt brought me back to my childhood and the last episode, Signs of Life brought back the Sci-Fi touch.

Sadly, it didn't leave me with the same feelings as the original series. It wasn't an Amazing Story, only a Good One. The basic plot had everything you could want. But, the dialogue was a little too PC (aren't we all getting a little tired of that?) and the acting wasn't top notch. I'm hopeful for future episodes though. UPDATE: Just finished watching episode 2 and it was okay. That's about it. Being brutally honest, this reboot could be renamed 'Mediocre Stories'. When the original series premiered 35 years ago, it was ground breaking. They were spending over $1 Million Dollars an episode on the best talent to do the best stories. That's just not happening on the reboot. They're okay shows and I've enjoyed both of them. But, they're nothing special. I wouldn't want to watch them again.

1418,Amazing Stories, In reply to the 1/10s,"Declaration: I am 28. No teenager. And not too much into cheesy stuff.
The first episode 'The cellar' is basically a story of human relationships entwined over time due to something unexplained. It's not sci-fiction. So don't Watch if you are looking for a video game feel in the name of the title being 'Amazing stories'. That is what is wrong with all the critic reviews because they can't stop comparing it to other stuff that is much darker and hardly even is going to feel the same. However, If you want a good watch that makes you feel for the heart inside you, go on watching.
In this world, no one is a villain. People don't misuse technology. The world isn't about to end. Instead, we get characters that care for one another. It's a love story but not just that. The director has done a fine job. Cinematography is also decent as the episode is really easy on the eyes. In a total 50 minutes episode you get to see three time zones that can be discerned from each other and I consider that itself a win.
POSITIVES:
1.The relatable vibe of the characters
2.The acting - Really, someone give Dylan o'Brien some bigger n better projects. The guy never stops surprising with what he can do to a role. Here also, he was brilliant with the innocent yet charming mannerism of Sam Taylor in the first half and as a heartbroken man in love in the emotional scenes. Victoria Pedretti is a giant talent. She just ate any scene she was in. And the chemistry was cute and palpable enough.
3.Victoria's singing (never knew she was that good!)
4.No negativity in the larger picture.
5.beautiful portrayal of 1919.
6.It doesn't try too hard to explain the time travel as some magnificent technology. Here it's a simple concept, and in nobody's control.
7.Even when the ending will not be okay for many viewers, it leaves you wanting more. And you know it's good if you din't want it to end.
8.Beautiful message.<br/><br/>Negatives:
1. Could have been still better script wise. The characters had their moments but I was so in love with the lead couple that I really wanted a bit more light thrown on their bond.
2. Unnecessary brand placement from apple. Not appreciated.
3. Can't think of anything much apart from this.<br/><br/>Normally I would rate it a solid 8 or 8.5 . However, gave it a 10 considering the brutal bashing it's enduring from the critics and reviewers. Reviews should not be written by comparing it to something you wanted it to be. And the creators never intended it to be black mirror or Twilight Zone. And it's beautiful in what it wanted to be. Pure, Positive and Optimistic.",34 out of 82 found this helpful.,10.0,7 March 2020

1421,Bitten, a tentatively decent pilot.,"REVIEW:<br/><br/>So the pilot for this show is fairly strong. Its a very generic werewolf themed program that features all the cliché's we've come to expect, I still enjoyed it but it's highly derivative. Ultimately there wasn't enough meat in this proverbial entree to really make any concrete deductions from, we will have to continue watching and hope.<br/><br/>The female lead hates that she is a werewolf and seeks to delude herself into thinking she is human. This is a theme common amongst not only werewolf shows but also vampire genre shows, such as Dracula or the Vampire Diaries. She has a partner whom shes in a long term committed relationship with and feels guilty about not telling the truth to, again highly derivative. There is a mysterious force moving against her ""pack"". It appears to be vaguely antiestablishmentarian. <br/><br/>As with basically every supernatural show starting out they use the well established (or cliché) method of being deliberately vague. In this case the protagonist is running from her ""pack"" or family, it is suggested, primarily because of the action of one bearded individual, but we aren't really given a glimpse at why (although one feels it likely to be an abusive romantic relationship). The villains or ""others"" are upset with the main characters for a completely unknown reason. As with seemingly every supernatural show out in contemporary television it features a list of aesthetically pleasing men and women, the idea being I'm sure that if their writers or actors are substandard then they have the fallback draw of being attractive enough for the less discerning audience members.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of originality, as a supernatural / fantasy enthusiast i will undoubtedly watch more episodes, with the goal of proving it as either worthwhile or too flawed to be viewed further. If like me you latch onto any remotely promising story involving supernatural elements you should (and probably would have regardless of my advise) check it out, as of yet there isn't any glaring problem with the show. If you are a discerning or picky viewer with finite viewing time i would suggest sticking to television programs proved to contain high quality content, and let this one prove its worth before giving it the gift of investing your time.",50 out of 70 found this helpful.,,12 January 2014
1422,Bitten," Somewhat good, somewhat not.","Another in a long line of overwrought fantasies penned by sexually frustrated female novelists targeting an audience of vapid teenaged girls.<br/><br/>After a somewhat limp and bargain-basement pilot, featuring truly awful CGI wolves, the first season found its feet within three or four episodes and actually became quite good (for someone in the mood for this sort of show).<br/><br/>What kept me watching was the unique lack of teenagers in the cast, making the whole thing more grown-up and less of the mindless angst-fest that one is generally obliged to endure. The plot wasn't all about teenage melodrama either, and for the most part the supernatural elements were kept to a minimum, allowing for a more interesting story about the politics of werewolf culture. Despite an obviously restrictive budget it was really quite watchable.<br/><br/>Then season two arrived, and for reasons presumably book-based (I haven't read them), it abandoned the grown-up storytelling of the first season and plunged headfirst into a poor imitation of The Vampire Diaries, complete with teenagers (the annoying, pouty, petulant kind) and worse, witches, (and all the irritating chanting and writhing around in trances that modern depictions seem to demand).<br/><br/>The narrative, when not bogged down with prophecies (yawn), dream-sequences (yuck), dead-eyed cultists (mega-yawn), and, of course, objects floating around (oh, boy!), was all but abandoned in favour of teenaged girls writhing, grunting and whining through endless mind-numbing minutes, sometimes with white contact lenses (how original!)<br/><br/>Season three, by comparison, was a welcome relief, returning to less arcane storytelling. Focusing on politics, revenge, and mostly werewolf-based material (apart from a few lingering witchy threads), this was almost a good season. However, after the insults of season two I was unable to forgive the truly appalling writing and endless scenes of moronic expositional dialogue, and was very glad when it finally ended.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,6.0,9 July 2018

While they may not be my idea of the character, again, I don't expect a TV or move to meet my expectation of what I think Clay or Jeremy or any of the others might look like. <br/><br/>It's too bad they didn't do more of the flash backs during the first show because I think people who don't know the history may not get some of the relationships, but I'll still be watching all of them and I am pretty sure I'll enjoy it, along with some of my friends.",28 out of 38 found this helpful.,,21 January 2014
1424,Bitten," Well, it was a good book...","This series is based on a book (series) by Canadian author Kelley Armstrong. Like many an urban fantasy tale, it was told in first person by the main character, Elena Michaels. And, like most urban fantasy brought to life, it has to be converted into third person. This is where most book-to-screen adaptations end up losing the meat of the original story. But alright, lets see what they got right.<br/><br/>Elena is a werewolf. Check. She's a journalist in Toronto. Wait, they already screwed up. In the show she's a model, I think? Her best friend in the werewolf world is Logan, a lawyer in LA. They got that wrong too; in the show, he's a psychologist? And apparently he also lives in Toronto and hangs out with Elena. Whatever, meaningless details at this point. So Elena is living with her boyfriend Philip, and we sort of meet his family. There's some werewolfy stuff in Toronto. All of that is close enough to the book.<br/><br/>We also meet a few other pack members. Oh yeah, there's this thing called the Pack. They're werewolves and basically control all of the territory in North America, leaving a few small sections to ""mutts"", which are non-Pack werewolves. So the leader, or Alpha, is Jeremy Danvers. His adopted son is Clayton (or Clay if you don't wanna get your ass kicked), who is indeed an anthropologist in the book and show, and the father/son duo of Antonio and Nick. Though I was sorta thrown at the point where we meet Nick. There's a lot of TV sex in this show.<br/><br/>So everyone in the pack is summoned home to deal with a murder thought to have been carried out by a mutt. Elena doesn't wanna go home because she's sort of estranged from the Pack and doesn't enjoy werewolf life, but Logan tries to convince her it's for the good of the Pack.<br/><br/>While this story is way more fun when told by Elena herself, it's always interesting to see a book brought to life on TV or film. The first episode didn't seem so bad, since I knew what was going on already, but I can see how this might not be a hook for those unfamiliar with Armstrong's novels. To them, definitely go read Bitten.<br/><br/>Hopefully this show will stay more canonish than something like Legend of the Seeker.

I can see the potential of greatness that the show sets up for in the first 2 episodes and can't wait to see what it morphs into. Glancing over the book series it seems like there is an interesting plot line for the show to follow if it chooses to do so and hopefully they will. It is safe to say that the Elena and Clay romance will drive the show to success above all else, I find them believable and engaging. There are things that can be improved sure, but I'm focusing on the positive.

I liked her in Smallville and a few other things I have seen her in. I think she is a likable and decent actress. She was also the only recognizable actor in the cast and might have what it takes to carry a series. Watching Bitten was proof to me that no one can carry a crap script. All of the characters are poorly written. Everyone except for the lead( who I consider to be two dimensional ) is very one dimensional or are trying way too hard to be ""Cool"". Nobody seems genuine. The show is no better than a daytime soap opera.<br/><br/>So much melodrama. Such generic story telling. If you watch much supernatural movies or television, you will see exactly were this story is going. Most key character motivation is so vague that nothing makes sense.

1428,Bitten, Garbage,"I will not compare Bitten to the collection of books by Kelley Armstrong. It's an incredible disservice. <br/><br/>Laura Vandervoort plays the main character Elena Michaels, a werewolf journalist in Toronto, with the same passion as one wakes up on a Monday morning to go to work.<br/><br/>Vandervoort is a terrible actress and unfortunately there's no one in this cast that can help. Production attempts to balance the lack of talent in 'Bitten' with plenty of PG nudity, sex scenes &amp; CGI. We're presented with the cable channel version of what they think is CGI in the form of animated wolves ... No, not werewolves ... a damn dog.<br/><br/>Elena Michaels is a blonde dog that doesn't want to be a dog. Elena Michaels' problem with not wanting to be a blonde dog means she fights the transformation into a blonde dog, so now it happens in random moments. It happened in the beginning while she was having sex. Is that a spoiler? I better check the box then ...<br/><br/>Elena Michaels has a boyfriend who doesn't know she's a dog even though he having sex with her before she transforms and then have sex when she came home the next morning. Yes. The guy had sex with her after she was out running all night eating rabbits or whatever ... She may have killed a woman. It doesn't bother explaining. The nighttime seems to last all of 5 minutes in this world.<br/><br/>The storyline is about a bunch of murders caused by a CGI dog that's not a member of the ""Pack"" or family, whatever they're alluring to. All the ""Pack"" guys are called back ""home"" by the Head Dog (or whatever) so they can talk about it or go into hiding ... I don't know ... It doesn't bother explaining. If you read the book, you know, but why bother informing the illiterate? <br/><br/>So wow, there you have it. A show with bad acting, terrible CGI &amp; no werewolves (or even a big pants exploding wolf like the Twilight abortions did). Yeah.

1430,Bitten, S1 is truly excellent but should have stuck closer to book; S2 sucks eggs.,"I love Kelley Armstrong's Otherworld series and I was a little concerned when I found this whether the TV series would really do justice to the books. Loyal readers need not worry - at least for the first season. S1 is brilliantly cast, scripted and directed with - dare I say it? - perhaps even more dramatic flair than in the book, which is written entirely from Elena's perspective; something that tends to work better in books than on screen.<br/><br/>Now this is very important: this is a re-edit from my first review, in which I had only seen the first season. I've started watching the second season and already, 2 episodes in, I'm reeling from disillusionment. From this point only 20% of the content seems to bear any relation to the book (being based on the storyline of 'Stolen') and the new script and plot-line are awful. It's as though Armstrong's characters have been hijacked and transplanted into dire fan- fiction. HBO sponsored fan-fiction, to judge by the amount of gratuitous sex and nudity. Maybe there isn't any more than there was in S1, but the better dialogue helped it along. Anyway this brought my initial 9/10 down to a 6. I'd have been harsher but I don't want to put people off from watching S1; I'd recommend you watch S1 as a standalone and then walk away.<br/><br/>So to return to the good start. I was particularly impressed by Greyston Holt's performance as Clay - at first I thought ""what have you done, Clay doesn't have a beard!"" but this tiny detail quickly becomes irrelevant as he is pitch perfect. Clay's character is very unique and complex - a ferocious, animalistic and brutal killer, yet intensely loyal to his family and also extremely intelligent; antisocial (towards humanity) and yet capable of holding down a job as a university professor. It would take a rare actor to be able to show all these facets with believable consistency, and Holt's performance throughout is masterful; but the whole cast is excellent besides. <br/><br/>My one caveat is that this season doesn't always stick to the book's storyline (perhaps a dark foreshadowing of the travesty to come). Armstrong writes a strong, tight story and the popularity of her books attests to her skills, so I don't really understand why the producers felt it necessary to change anything for dramatic or narrative purposes; however, all reproductions tend to tweak their sources, and I could forgive (for example) the death of an important pack member as it did have a lot of plot integrity. But at the end, there is a huge plot twist with a major character revealed behind the scenes, directing the mutts, which owes nothing whatsoever to the books and then carries on into the next season! It is also a terrible cliché. <br/><br/>To me however, the most egregious change was in them revealing the ""true reason"" behind Clay's decision to bite Elena. I suppose they thought it would make him more palatable to viewers; to show him in a nobler, exculpatory light. I'm sorry but that's just nonsense, and completely inexcusable. Jeremy would never have hurt Elena; he was merely going to forbid their relationship and send her away. Clay bit her (in the book) because he loves her and doesn't want to lose her. It's that simple. He wasn't thinking of consequences, because that's Clay; he is a true werewolf, more animal than man, and the bittersweet romance of the entire series rests on Elena's coming to terms with that fact - he has no excuse for what he did, except that he loves her, absolutely. He was entirely selfish, only protecting his own interests at the time, not hers. It doesn't make him a knight in shining armour, but it is also one of the definitive reasons he isn't a monster, despite his actions; and this makes him much more realistic as a person. There was no need to sugar-coat that act and pander to the audience; they might have credited us with a little more intelligence and imagination as the author originally intended. Clay's wayward love of Elena makes him who he is, and one of the best characters of the books, and part of their charm is being able to sympathise with both of them simultaneously even though they are at such odds. It is also, ultimately, his mistake which makes Elena who she is, and powers every story in which she has a part. It is a story about coming to terms with each other, with their past, with what they have become - surmounting mistakes and bad decisions to build a solid and loving relationship. Turning what Clay did into heroic necessity strips that dimension from the story and cheapens it. Bad call there; very bad call. <br/><br/>This is only revealed close to the end of the season, along with the surprise appearance of (not-so-) Mystery Master Villain, and in a way these perfidies herald the massacre of the second book, 'Stolen'. I wonder whether they changed the writing team, or lost the approval (and input?) of Ms. Armstrong, from this point onward. Or perhaps, knowing the first book as well as I do, and because they did stick to it closely for the most part, I subconsciously masked all but the worst errors and perceived it to be better than it was. Because it's really quite hard to believe that the first and second seasons were made by the same people.<br/><br/>Thus concludes my rather disappointed re-edit.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,6.0,22 January 2016
1431,Bitten, How on earth does this show have such a high rating? 7 stars?,"This show brings nothing new to the table, right down to the name of the lead actress. Why is every book-turned-TV-show with a supernatural theme centered around a chick named Elena? I can think of two, outside of this show, right off the top of my head. <br/><br/>Vandervoot is as unlikeable and unnatural as I've ever seen an actress be. She has some odd quality that makes her really unlikeable; I just can't place my finger on it. Maybe it's just because she isn't a very good actress.<br/><br/>The show was clichéd and trite. Vandervoot doesn't pull off the ""smart lone-wolf"" thing well at all, which makes every time that she does well or insults someone or calls someone out incredibly annoying; it's not even laughable because it's so annoying. <br/><br/>The CGI is atrocious and unnatural looking. I understand the use of wolves in scenes that require interaction between characters, but I feel it would be a cheaper and better production decision if they would use trained wolf-hybrids the rest of the time. I used to have a neighbor who had two wolf-hybrids that were very well trained; additionally, the things were huge, beautiful creatures. They could have easily passed as full-blooded wolves and would have been far more terrifying than the existing ""solution"". If they were worried about danger, that's what stuntmen and CGI are for. A trained, domesticated wolf-hybrid padding across a street and running through the woods, is not cause for concern. Huge letdown.<br/><br/>There is an excessive amount of unnecessary and oddly placed nudity and sexual content. I'm not offended by it; it just seems very odd. It seems like it's only being used as a ploy. I also don't really want to see an O-face with an offscreen handjob being syndicated by two actors filling up the screen. There are far sexier things to be done. This seemed to be straight up shock-jock.<br/><br/>Also, the way that the main character's reaction of self-defense was treated was downright demeaning. If a man goes to grab your ass without your permission, you have every right to stop him in self defense. They handled it very poorly, as if it isn't normal for a woman to know how to take care of herself- which Elena did without violence, only with deflection and holds; as if she overreacted. It's her ass! No one has a right to it but her and she has every right to deflect unwanted attention and groping. The whole scene seemed out of place and, again, purely for the ""shock"".<br/><br/>It was like they tried to cram everything into the first episode. If the story is good enough, then the writer's shouldn't have to overtly Demonstrate or state characteristics of the main characters, or any of the characters, for that matter. We should be able to sense that she's a tough bad-ass; we shouldn't have to have it laid out in Hooked On Phonics. We should be able to sense a tough past without having to be told about the abuse.<br/><br/>Further, I really can't stand it when a show tries to prove its worth by establishing a difficult past for the lead character; it isn't the past that we must watch each week. It is the present; that's the part that absolutely has to be entertaining. This just purveys and validates the concept of selfvictiimization that is constantly reinforced and vindicated by our media and society. Also, why is the lead the only one being given any sort of drama? And why can't the drama be a part of her personality, instead of her past? Vandervoot's character has zero personality.<br/><br/>All in all, the writers have no idea how to build a character and/or leave room for character development; the actors and characters are entirely one dimensional; the plot and characters are clichéd Hollywood stock and, frankly, the whole thing is utter tripe. The writers attempted to shock us but, instead, explained the drama, suspense, and other empathy motivators away. These are simple, boring characters being played by pretty magazine faces. Oh and Mr. ""I'm Here to Break Them/Because You're a Slut"", you should think twice before taking a role that requires you to call a girl a slut and then have a threesome with strangers in the same episode. Really. Also, why on earth did you take this part? Your lines are horrid.",32 out of 57 found this helpful.,,13 January 2014

You don't want to see them hook up. <br/><br/>And now, I have no one to 'root' for. I think Elena is a whore. I think Clay is completely undeserving of anything.

1434,Bitten, Cartoon dogs killed it for me...,"The problems with Bitten were just too large for me to overlook. The animation was just too corny looking and there was no reason for it in this day and age. It looked like it was done on someone's home computer. You can't build suspense with a cartoon werewolf. They could have used some real dogs of wolf hybrids just as easily and it would have looked so much better. It really looked to me like they were trying to sell this one on sex. I was hoping for a little more intelligent take on the popular novels, but it was not to be. The target audience was obviously teens. The lead actress Laura Vandervoort did a decent job, better than some of the actors on the immensely popular ""TVD"" and she was good on the cancelled ""V"". I just couldn't watch Bitten though...

I'm currently at episode 6 of watching Bitten and what should have grown on me has grown annoying.<br/><br/>I'm starting to dislike the show #Bitten. All the characters are losing likability especially with that cruel teeth ripping out and the graphic details we get of it later. Whoever wrote this knows very little about wolf nature to think any wolf could torture another wolf or render it unable to hunt like that, I'm speaking of natural, real wolf nature, obviously. Even when there is a challenge for alpha they don't usually... NEVER mutilate each other as ""punishment."" Animal instinct for wolves is actually usually fiercely protective of it's own kind.<br/><br/>I usually like wolves but right now the ""heroes"" are disgusting me...<br/><br/>I was watching because I liked that they take actual wolf form but now every character disgusts me on some level.<br/><br/>And then there's the mother issues and subtle sexism. ""There's only one reason a woman would know moves like that."" And ""There's two"" as if that's a GOOD response that?! And then it turns out, yes, there is ""That"" reason why she knows those moves because God forbid a WOMAN be into self-defense or be in the armed forces or know those moves for anything other than that she was a victim or wants to prevent herself from being a victim. When was this written? 1952 in Middle America or the Victorian era? No, Victorian female protagonists were less whiny! I'm sorry... I am trying to like it. I want to like it but the more I think about it the angrier I get.<br/><br/>I'm not a troll. I came to the IMDb board defending the literal wolf transformations as being true Germanic and French folklore weeks ago but now the writing is turning my stomach.<br/><br/>I think I'll stick with Lost Girl, despite what some people think of Lost Girl because of how it's advertised, it actually knows how to make likable female protagonists.",20 out of 34 found this helpful.,1.0,18 February 2014
1436,Bitten, Better than Expected,"When I first realized that they had made Elena's story into a TV show I was sceptical, as very rarely the show can match with the Books. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised, there were a few things that I am personally a little critical off, as I don't believe the actors portray the description, but again that is just personal opinion. However they have managed to keep the story line well on track, and I will continue watching and keeping an eye out for future series on this set of books. Well done, well made and all around very pleasant viewing. Not recommended for under 13-15s though.

1438,Bitten, Bored out of my mind,"Just finished watching the first episode. And it was really boring. Storyline is so generic and unoriginal as can be. The hero who just cannot accept what they are, has been done to death. Making the hero a female does not change that. And yes I do know it has been adapted from a series of books. Just like so many other Twilight wannabe films or series the last few years. Everyone is looking for the next Hunger Games or Twilight instead of just making a good story. Special effects are terrible, the wolves look so wooden not getting the decent effect like the have in Teen Wolf. Acting lame to bad, nobody seems to be interested in their character everyone knows where this is going and they just seem to do it on autopilot. Don't get me wrong I love supernatural shows like Supernatural, Vampire Dairies and Teen Wolf even. But this one's just not doing it for me. I will probably watch a few more episodes.

1439,Bitten, The Game of Sex with Wolves,"The first episode of Bitten, the highly hyped and long awaited Canadian television series, opens with Elena wrapping her legs around Philip in bed. Elena is about to climax, but then stops, gets bitchy and tells Philip she just remembered she was supposed to be at a nude photo shoot at midnight with some friends in the woods. She promises to make it up to him. <br/><br/>Next we find Elena walking through the streets of Toronto with some edgy Toronto music sound track. Maybe the music turns Elena on, because she gets to take her clothes off twice before the credits stop rolling. Then Elena becomes a werewolf. <br/><br/>Meanwhile in a cool Toronto bar, a hot chick is coming on to a guy looking to get laid. The chick and guy talk about back story so we don't get confused later on when the script goes off the rails. <br/><br/>The horny chick invites the dude back to her place, but he rejects her because he's tired of getting dumped by woman who are unavailable to men. Cut to a wolf dragging her body away.<br/><br/>In the morning, Elena is back in her scantily clad human form bringing Philip coffee. After a full breakfast, she finishes banging him in gymnastic morning sex. Cue the super-cool to hip Toronto music soundtrack. <br/><br/>They both go to their jobs. She's a photographer who never takes photos and Philip stands around in a bath towel and flexing his abs into a mirror. <br/><br/>We cut to a group of handsome academics who know Elena to establish that Elena is smart. Later, in a meeting with her friend\therapist she confesses she needs more sex than once a month or she's going to turn into a monster, but the therapist thinks she's just talking in metaphor and hopes he can get some tail. Instead he is pushes into the friend's zone.<br/><br/>There are a lot of scenes with Elena being super bright, witty and adored. She hangs out with a lot of people, and shops without much enthusiasm. Maybe she's on anti-depressants.<br/><br/>Cut to a hunter and his dog who just happen to find the mauled body on a large expanse of heavily wooded forest. The cops are predictably stupid and have no theory.<br/><br/>Cut to a group of bare chested hunks in a wolf type fraternity, their hair is ""perfect"". They mumble a lot and the sound track is so loud we miss a lot of expository buddy talk and towel snapping.<br/><br/>We get the idea they must work out together. It seems that two of the guys, Clay and Jeremy, miss having sex with Elena. They do a lot of explaining about what's already in the book. They come to the conclusion that everybody in the pack has had a go with Elena and want her to return to their lair.<br/><br/>After all, it's been more than a year and the guys, well, you know, miss her. They text her and tell her they need her. ""Come home, you're our best tracker."" Elena says ""Ok.""<br/><br/>Soon, Elena has told everybody in Toronto she's going back home except Philip. He says he'll wait for her and they can get married. Elena then goes shopping, meeting cool people and stuff.<br/><br/>Cut to: Elena at a hotel where she beats up a guy who came on to her. She brushes herself off and explains to everyone that she's into UFC cage fighting.<br/><br/>Back at the Man Cave frat house, the guys are getting restless waiting for Elena's return. <br/><br/>Elena buys lots of things but only carries a small hand bag for a long trip, and Philip remains clueless. When she finally tells him she has to go be with her sick cousin Philip remembers Elena saying she had no family. She tells Philip she was too embarrassed to have him meet her family.<br/><br/>Before she leaves she tells her therapist she feels guilty about lying to Philip all the time. Then a coyote jumps the therapist for no reason other than to wake up the audience. Elena goes all Viking on the coyote to show her prowess. There is some more talk so we can figure where we were before we were distracted by some aimless plotting. <br/><br/>Eventually,Elena arrives in her small town. Strange that the dudes who were all hot for her return don't fetch her in a car, so she has to take a taxi to the gigantic house. She tells the taxi driver to stop outside the gate. She gets out and starts walking and she has a long way to go when she sniffs something rotten.<br/><br/>One of the guys she knows (they all look the same, can't tell them apart) comes out of nowhere and we get a sense they have a history -- Elena has a history with every guy in the house -- and she's not a bit happy about seeing him.<br/><br/>Cut to a slummy apartment where the same guy Elena beat up in the Toronto bar has a woman in bed. He goes to the toilet and is making a lot of noise in there, but the girl decides to open the door. Then the first episode runs out of words.",20 out of 36 found this helpful.,1.0,15 January 2014
1440,Bitten, Bad,"This show is everything that is wrong with television narration and sci-fi shows. The writing is horrible, it caters to young stupid people.

I feel sorry for the people who are responsible for it. There are maybe a hundred really good TV-shows in short TV history. This one is not even among the thousand mediocre ones. It is in the rare category of: should not have aired at all. I can conceive a more interesting plot line in this review just by claiming that the only reason such a show got on the air is either by a doomsday mastermind who paid off the network or some of the show-runners has dirt on studio executives, probably something about a Puerto Ricon hand-job.

The attention to detail - NY plates on the cars, American flags flying, newspaper racks on the sidewalks &amp; individualistic costuming all add to the sense of authenticity. Usually I can spot a Canadian production pretending to be in an American location very rapidly - this one had no ""tells"". As our heroine was morphing into her lupine alter ego she somehow reminded me of Ann Coulter - that would have been real horror! The family values espoused seem closer to Don Corleone's than Ward Cleaver's which adds another layer to the plot(s). The Horror genre isn't usually my thing, but I love a good gangster flick.

1465,Doctor Doctor, Another review on 'Doctor Doctor',"Touted as a family-oriented series I was expecting a highly entertaining episode (#1) of this new series. It NEARLY came up to my expectation: 1 - I was expecting someone maybe a little more 'hardened' - an example being when he wrestled with his brother and seemingly 'over-nursed' his sore hand from the wrestle (I was hoping that Hugh would cream him); and 2 - I wasn't sure if some of the language used was appropriate for a so-called family show!!! However, I was reasonably entertained, and expect to enjoy the series for the rest of the season. Moreover, I DID find myself having a few laughs during this initial episode, and Rodger Corser does a good job - his cowboy attitude displayed in Dr Hugh Knight is definitely a sure winner nevertheless. I DO commend the Australian television industry to CONTINUE producing quality drama to not only an existing acceptable level - but an OUTSTANDING level. * * (Update) * * HOWEVER - the series went on for a few weeks I have warmed up to this show even further. It has become VERY entertaining (although a bit far-fetched in places). Well done to Roger Corser. Filmed in a part of the Central West of NSW it provides for a breathtaking backdrop for the fictional town of Wyhope. Claudia Karvan has been an acclaimed actress and I commend her on her work in this series. It's about to come to an end for this season - I HOPE that there is a Season 2! * * I also couldn't help notice the blue 2016 Hyundai Elantra that Roger Corser drives in the show. Is that a co-incidence or does it have something to do with the Hyundai commercials that he used to do ... ? lol.",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,14 September 2016

1467,Doctor Doctor, Childish writing and overall silliness,"This is like a 1950s American sitcom, silly, sickly sweet to the point of being cloying. The acting is poor as is the level of writing for the script. As the series progresses, the characters become predictable and the episodes formula driven. The lead actors have a very limited range and result in very two dimensional characters. After a couple of episodes, the repetitive silly grimacing that Hugh Corser does with his mouth and face becomes tedious and one wonders if it's due to some dental or oral issue that he has. The handling of medical events are laughable and pretty much up there in fantasy land. It's surprising that it's lasted 3 seasons but I guess it's appealing mainly to the Australian market and so that's kept it going. Overall, it's just a bit too childish and silly.",10 out of 19 found this helpful.,3.0,21 November 2018

Kill off his wife, who was the only bright point on the show, bring back his former King of Queens co-star Leah Remini, and Kevin goes back to work. Completely veering from the original premise. They are trying to recreate King of Queens with another name. Period.

1478,Kevin Can Wait, Leah Remini killed this show,"One of the most often heard complaints about ""Kevin Can Wait"" was that Kevin James did not carry ""King of Queens"" by himself alone.

Apparently Kevin's wife was identified as the main issue of the show by its producers.<br/><br/>However, Erinn Hayes was never the problem in Kevin Can Wait. It were Kevin's extremely bland ex-cop buddies, who couldn't even hope to measure up to Spence, Deacon or Richie.<br/><br/>Instead of fixing that problem, the producers decided to literally kill off Kevin's wife between season one and two with a one-line elegy. They then replaced her with Leah Remini, Kevin James' wife from King of Queens.<br/><br/>What was a fun encounter in the finale of the first season turned out to be a disaster when Leah replaced Erinn in season 2. She is nothing like she was in King of Queens anymore.<br/><br/>She turned out to be a botox'd up has-been with the voice of a chain-smoking alcoholic and the facial expression of a brick wall. There is no chemistry, no charisma, no character.

There is absolutely no chemistry between the cast members and too many of the cast members add absolutely nothing to the show. <br/><br/>I have to say that this is probably the first sitcom that I've ever watched without cracking a smile. I hoped that it would get better as the season went on but it hasn't and frankly, I've lost interest in watching it. In fact, the only reason I've watched it for as long as I have is because Kevin James is in it.

1486,Kevin Can Wait, Don't Fire the Actress for This Sitcom's Woes,"Kevin James was much better in his previous sitcom, ""The King of Queens."" Here, he plays a retired Long Island New York cop in Long Island. The actress, Erinn Hayes, did the best with the weak script and has be cut from the series for the second season. Sadly, they are going to kill off the character. First, she was miscast for the role. Sadly, she doesn't deserve the entire blame for the series. It still has a chance but I think if the characters divorced, it would be better for the series than a death. Nothing makes a sitcom worse than a needless death. Good Times was never the same without the father figure. They should write the character off and send her away. Kevin can restart dating or moving on with his life. I wish the best for the show but I don't think it would get much better. ""The Millers"" were a fine show until they brought in an unnecessary character by a well known comedic actor.

1493,Kevin Can Wait, Good start,"Why the hate? For whatever reason, lots of individuals feel that there is no room on television for old school sitcoms. Always complaining about the laugh track, or the formulas often times used such as the goofy husband with a strong character wife. I too have felt that way at times, but that is because TV is currently at it's all time best, so many different genre of shows available out there, and the comedies are so much more in depth and it's refreshing to see the new styles we get to witness each week (such as Modern Family, It's always sunny in Philadelphia), but I also enjoy being able to lay back and watch a good old school sitcom with newer material or recent topics. There should always be room for the Friends, Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld type sitcoms. <br/><br/>The pilot was decent, it's a pilot therefore obviously the chemistry isn't what it is after a handful of episodes (same as any other comedy). The 2nd episode I can honestly say had me laughing out loud most of it. Is it unique? No. Is it smart comedy? No. In fact, it's familiar which is nice. I enjoyed it as it brought me back to watching King of Queens and reminded me of just how much fun it was.<br/><br/>I suggest to those who want to watch it, avoid the message boards as unfortunately it's the people that have nothing better to do than troll and bash shows that they apparently don't like (although somehow watch the entire series ???) that share their input.<br/><br/>Again, good show and looking forward to seeing a full season.<br/><br/>Cheers!",24 out of 43 found this helpful.,10.0,30 September 2016

Although she had written the bible for ""All My Children"" first, her passionate love for the study of human relationships began with this show which crossed not only class and race issues, but religion as well. There were Catholics, Protestants and Jews, and even a story-line where a young black woman (the beautiful Ellen Holly) pretended to be an Italian American so she could be accepted in society. Holly's Carla (real name Clara) was one of two dominant original female characters, and had a major part in the show's critical success. Tony Winning actress Lillian Hayman was outstanding as her hard-working mother. Political upheaval on the show in the mid 1980's saw the write-out of these characters in a rather cruel way, especially for Hayman who was literally fired in a parking lot.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the show for 43 years was the character of Victoria Lord, a complex young woman who was eventually revealed to be suffering from a split personality and dealt with secrets from her childhood for the show's entire run. Fans were thrilled by her long rivalry with the former Dr. Dorian Cramer (most notably played by Emmy Winner Robin Strasser) which often crossed the line into occasional friendship when the characters would make amends for hurts of the past. As played by Erika Slezak for 40 years, the character was complex in every detail, and she would go onto win more Emmys than any other actress on the soaps. <br/><br/>For the first decade, Vicki was part of the super-couple pairing with Joe Riley, although that term didn't become widely used until years after Joe died. Her later relationship with Clint Buchannan (Clint Ritchie, Jerry Ver Dorn) pretty much surpassed it. The first decade of the show was traditional class conflict soap, with Carla and her major love interest, Police Lt. Ed Hall (veteran stage actor Al Freeman Jr.) providing one of the few black couples on daytime. (Sister soap ""AMC"" was the only other, with Nancy and Frank Grant equally as popular as Carla and Ed.) ""OLTL"" got some major publicity when it cast two ousted ""AW"" stars, George Reinholt and Jacqueline Courtney, who at least for a time also dominated the airwaves. <br/><br/>By the late 1970's, daytime was changing, and a ""Dallas"" type story began with the introduction of the Buchannan family, lead by veteran movie actor Philip Carey as the ruthless J.R. Ewing like patriarch and Robert S. Woods remaining for decades as his younger son, Bo. The mob infiltrated Llanview for a while, and Judith Light's Karen Wolek became the miserable long suffering character that fans tuned into see cry and emote every day. Light deservedly won two Emmy's before moving into prime-time. I started watching in late 1981 when the show had a masked ball that lasted for a month, with Asa's supposedly dead wife, Olympia (stage and screen vet Taina Elg) revealing her husband's evil deeds. A great story-line had Bo involved with old enemies of his father's, the Ralston clan, whom he thought for a while was his real family. ""Dark Shadows"" vet Grayson Hall provided real camp as the scheming Euphemia Ralston, with the gorgeous Shelley Burch as her sexpot daughter Delila who married both Asa and Bo, then ended up happy with Asa's nephew, Rafe.<br/><br/>The story-line headed back to its roots for a while with the blue collar O'Neill family, but later went into ""Dynasty"" territory with the introduction of the wealthy Sanders family, featuring a scene- stealing performance by Lois Kibbee as the wealthy matriarch, with Louise Sorel going from scheming Augusta on ""Santa Barbara"" to the noble Judith, a victim of anti-Semitic comments from her mother-in-law Elizabeth (Kibbee). After the Sanders family faded out, wealthy Michael Grande (Dennis Parlato) became another temporary villain, later replaced by mobster Carlo Hesser (Thom Christopher) who had a rivalry with Asa over Asa's wife, Renee (Patricia Elliott). The schemes of Dorian continued, as did those of Vicki's sister, Tina Clayton and the psychotic Alex Olanov who ended up marrying both Carlo and Asa. <br/><br/>As the show buckled with current soap trends that went far out from the world of reality, they did add two families to add diversity to the show-the Hispanic Vega's and the black Gannon's. Secrets of Vicki's long dead father Victor continued to come to light, such as the revelation that bad boy Todd Manning was another one of his illegitimate offspring and that Victor had molested Vicki as a child which lead to her killing him in 1976, a crime that was often thought to have been committed by Dorian. Slezak's number of alters increased, and her gut wrenching performance was perhaps the most spellbinding single performance since Karen Wolek's confession on the stand in court back in 1980. <br/><br/>The last years of the show had its convoluted moments, but was highlighted by the comical malapropisms from Ilene Kristen's Roxie who had audiences in stitches. Returns of former actors long gone from the show such as Kim Zimmer's Echo Di Savoy and Roscoe Borne's Mitch Lawrence kept the show's history continuously explored, although the mystery of who the real Todd Manning was when two actors who played the part ended up on screen together. Returns of the dead by Victor Lord and Irene Manning were panned, but the mixing of young actors with the veterans kept the audience intrigued. ABC announced that it was canceling both ""AMC"" and ""OLTL"" on the same day, but both shows later went briefly onto the web.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,15 September 2016
1499,One Life to Live, The Greatest Television Show Of All Time!,"ONE LIFE TO LIVE on ABC, Brought to you by the Colgate-Palmolive Company, is the BEST TV show, or soap opera, that has EVER been on the air. Two O' Clock P.M. has always been my favorite hour in the day; the one hour that I can be in Llanview, and check in on everyone... Viki, Bo, Asa, Dorian, Nora... If there was no ONE LIFE TO LIVE I would be much less happy. The stories are always intriguing and never boring. Even after nearly 38 years, the story lines are as fresh and exciting as they were in 1968. Agnes Nixon is a pure genius for creating such a gem in the realm of television. One Life To Live is perfect in every way. Its actors are superb; Erika Slezak has won more Emmys for her role as Victoria Lord Riley Burke Riley Buchannon Buchannon Davidson than any other actor in the history of television. The theme to One Life To Live as well as the other music by David Nitctern is magnificent too.

1500,One Life to Live, One life to live,"One life to live was a wonderful soap set in Landview p.a. centering around heiress Vicky Davidson and the eccentric townsfolk who inhabited the town.<br/><br/>Some of the most exciting story lines stemmed from Vicky's alters appearing during times of stress or danger to protect the host until her mind could heal. Leading to the main villain Mitch Perkins taking advantage of her having a child, Jessica who later developed the same condition, and wrapped up an exciting baby swap story where she finds out Natalie and Jessica both being fernal twins. Other stories tackled were cults, underground cities, time travel and even two lovers getting a second chance at happiness involving reincarnation. <br/><br/>One life to live usually found ways to bring back long lost characters you cared about, keep exciting story lines going for months and keeping with current affairs by making them part of the show like Dorean running for mayor holding gay rallies or Starr singing number one hits at her mother's club. <br/><br/>I started watching the show back in 2002 when I was off for summer break quickly catching up on who the characters were, their pasts and the current story lines until I was hooked. It broke my heart when it was announced it would be canceled and leave life forever. I still remember the last episode with the prison break and trying to wrap up all the characters lives into an hour feeling rushed, which it was, leaving us on a reading cliff hanger in case prospect place became a reality.<br/><br/>At this point I have never been able to enjoy another soap or find a nice alternative to fill the void and still search for a new uploaded scene to relive the magic once more.

1501,One Life to Live," Good-bye,Old Friend","Unlike All My children, As The World Turns and Guiding Light, all of which went off the air in September, One Life To Live opted to end its run in January, two weeks after Christmas and on Friday the 13th.<br/><br/>Go figure.<br/><br/>By ending in Sepember, it almost felt like when we would go back to school and miss the shows anyway (tho I only started watching ATWT and GL when I was out of high school), but it didn't matter.<br/><br/>By ending OLTL two weeks after the holiday season, it caught me off-guard.<br/><br/>First the Christmas episode ended with rolling credits (as opposed to those quick-flash names and duties run at the bottom of the screen each and every other time).<br/><br/>Christmas and soaps developed a strange fantasy meaning to me, ever since Myrtle Fairgate on All My Children, with all the year-long chaos of Palmer trying to break up Cliff and Nina, still managed to quietly stand alone in her home, look out at the snow, and sing a nice a capella Christmas tune to herself.<br/><br/>The OLTL Christmas episode ran the credits with a lovely slow version of Hark The Herald Angel Sings. I felt the tug.<br/><br/>Then two weeks before the show goes off the air, various prison escapees terrorize the citizens of Llanview.<br/><br/>Talk about going out in a bang. Even tho the only two actors who were on the show when I started watching are Slezak and Woods, the only three characters are Bo, Clint and Viki, I was spell-bound, especially when marvelous scene-stealer Patrick J Gibbon, as Sam Manning, was playing with his toys and being watched by the psychotic Hannah.<br/><br/>When Starr Manning prayed and sang a song, One Life To Live (tho I didn't realize she was the singer, I had FFed thru some bits), that's all it took. I stood at the front door and cried like a baby. <br/><br/>From over 30 years ago, I started watching when Samantha Vernon and Pat Ashley were taken hostage by (who was that guy? I've always called him Bruce Davison), I've watched off and on (sometimes more off when I didn't like how it was rolling).<br/><br/>No, I was not watching when Karen Wolek broke down on the stand during Viki's trial for murdering Marco Dane (turned out it wasn't Marco at all, but his goody twin brother, Mario).<br/><br/>But I do remember the revelation that former nun Jenny's baby, Karen's sister, really belonged to prostitute Katrina.<br/><br/>I was watching before Buchanan appeared on the show.<br/><br/>It's been a fun ride, a good ride. I hated stories (Clint's Back To the Future, Eterna was really goofy too) and there were clearly some better than others (The gang-rape storyline).<br/><br/>I do hate to see them end tho. With the departure of One Life To Live and All My Children, there will be two less hours of 'reality' in my household.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,10.0,13 January 2012

1504,The Sandhamn Murders, Another Scandi Success,"Very enjoyable crime series featuring an intelligent woman as the main protagonist.<br/><br/>Established actress Alexandra Rapaport plays Nora, a lawyer living on the the picturesque island of Sandhamn, in the Stockholm Archipelago. Yes, murders happen and Nora gets involved through her sharp-minded curiosity and friendship with police detective Thomas Andreasson. But there is more to the series than just a Midsomer Murders-like repetition of convoluted events in a fictional village<br/><br/>Nora splits with her first husband and becomes a single mother with shared custody. Much of the narrative deals with Nora's relationships and journey to find happiness on an island that is suitable for recluses, but not for Nora who is an attractive, gregarious and well-adjusted individual. Her friendship with policeman Thomas Andreasson always seems to be on the verge of something more intimate except, like her, his past gets in the way .<br/><br/>The murder stories are not perfect or without criticism, but they are acceptable and the character of Nora overrides any plot deficiencies or doubts that may arise. I just enjoyed what was on offer. I believe there will be four more movie-length episodes made next year.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,29 September 2019
1505,The Sandhamn Murders, Surprisingly pleasant and versatile human relation narrations,"/refers to Seasons 1-5/<br/><br/>I am fond of Scandinavian crime series, but as the recent decade has seen so many high-level ones, I have become picky to watch something ""around"" e.g. Bro/Broen or Millennium... In advance, I was also cautious about the fact that crimes would happen in a limited space, a small and cosy area making it the one of the most violent places in the world (as often perceived in Miss Marple or Lewis, although skilfully accomplished). But no, the felonies committed were rare, suitable and seasonable, and the main emphasis was mainly on human aspects and issues prevalent in a wealthy Western society. The crimes handled were not over-sophisticated, rather realistic, and exiting viewers' interest improved during the seasons (Season 1 crime and it's solution were most trivial).<br/><br/>All the performances were good at least, if not more, most I liked Alexandra Rapaport as Nora Linde and Lotta Tejle as Claire. Moreover, this series helped me better to acknowledge the popularity of Jacob Cedegren (he has participated in several films I have seen but, for me, somehow always remained in the shadow of other male actors). Here, his character's nature was perfectly in harmony with the general mood of the creation and the qualities a Swedish policeman working in a small recreational area could and should have.<br/><br/>Thus, Morden i Sandhamn is a more-than-okay drama, with lots of human aspects and some crime in the background. As for crime level and depiction, it is in the line of e.g. Maria Wern or Anna Pihl, for example.<br/><br/>PS More or less, Seasons 6 and 7 follow the same path. Yet, in Season 7, Nicolai Cleve Broch as a new leading character is a step forward.",28 out of 33 found this helpful.,7.0,24 January 2016
1506,The Sandhamn Murders, Predictability takes away suspense,"This is a miniseries in three episodes that is based on the novel ""I de lugnaste vatten"" by the Swedish detective writer Viveca Sten.<br/><br/>The series is professionally made. It utilises the idyllic scenery of the Stockholm archipelago to good effect and the cast does as good a job with the script as they can. The main performers, Cedergren and Rapaport, do have some chemistry, even if the former is overdoing the ""manly-male-who-suffers-in_silence"" thing.<br/><br/>The let-down is in the plot, however. It is a rather cliché story featuring a silent cop who keeps on breaking all the rules of policing and yet never gets suspended. His young side-kick still has to learn that a real cop goes by gut feeling and does not bother with methodical work with such boring stuff as, ehm, evidence? By simple elimination the viewer can soon figure out who is the culprit, if only because the plot does not present enough possible candidates, which is deadly for the suspense. Hence, the story very soon fails to engage.<br/><br/>In Sweden the series was a success nonetheless.",32 out of 41 found this helpful.,5.0,5 August 2012
1507,The Sandhamn Murders," Beautiful to look at, but...","This is just such a strange series.<br/><br/>Let me be honest that I love Scandinavian mystery series. Some of the best television ever made (Beck, Wallander, etc.) come from Sweden and are amazing. The Danes, Norwegians and Finns make very good television as well.<br/><br/>This is not quite that. It is beautiful to look at, to be sure. Especially (if I can be honest) the hunky male lead who has gorgeous blue eyes that match his beautiful blue shirts.<br/><br/>There's a lot of the male lead (police investigator ""Thomas"" -- played by the fine actor Jakob Cedergren) handsomely strutting around on docks in his sneakers, and flying over the water in his motor boat. It's okay. Really. It's kind of ""harmless"" TV that you forget about once the show is over (unlike another series Cedergren is in which gave me terrible nightmares).<br/><br/>The female lead annoys me. She's too perfect and yet sort of useless. The men she surrounds herself with (other than Thomas) annoy me. The ""other"" woman in Thomas' life annoys me. The crimes are sort of annoying (especially the one involving the horrible teenagers during Midsommer). So I'm not really quite sure why I continued to watch this. I can only say that I was entertained enough to get past my annoyances. Plus... there are those beautiful blue eyes.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of Moonlighting here -- will Thomas and Nora (the female lead) ever get ""horizontal""? Who knows? Do we care? Maybe. A little. I am just vapid enough to hope it happens before they end the show.<br/><br/>So, this is just kind of fun but obviously not to be taken as a top-shelf example of the genre. I wish watching Cedergren speed around in his boat was enough to give this ten stars, but it is not.<br/><br/>I am grateful for my membership in the MHz streaming service that makes these gloriously subtitled series available to me. No matter how much I criticize in a review like this, it is true that in general these shows far outshine most US shows of this genre.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,,24 December 2018

1511,The Sandhamn Murders," Scandinavian version of ""Midsomer Murders""","The stunning scenery of the Stockholm Archipelago is what carries this series. It's not the acting or the scripts which are childish and amateurish. The setting is breathtaking as is the picture perfect little towns on the islands which all appear to be Summer playgrounds for the very wealthy in Sweden. The episodes are all predictable and it is probably the undercurrents of the private lives of the two lead actors that is more interesting. It's a kind of ""will they, won they"" ever get together. Compared to the more sophisticated Scandi-noir offerings like ""The Killing"" or ""The Bridge"", or their more in-depth dramas like ""Borgen"", this is a light-hearted, not to be taken seriously genre, crime mystery that is more along the lines of the English series ""Agatha Raisin"".

1512,The Sandhamn Murders, Jejune Loveliness*,"*UPDATE: For season six they've made some great changes. There are four episodes, each one a stand-alone 1.5 hour account instead of three 45 minute episodes struggling to complete the plot. Better flow, condensed storylines with more substance. And Thomas's annoying neighbor has actually added some decent comic relief. Compared to most of what's out there Sandhamm Murders is worth checking out. Season 6 has been a big improvement. Adding 2 stars.<br/><br/>Seasons 1-5: Many Swedish series have been on my favorites list since day one but there's something missing here. It's like reading The Nancy Drew Mysteries after binging on Laura Lippmann's Tess Monaghan novels. Pleasant enough with no alternatives but largely forgettable. Sandhamm Murders has beautiful cinematography and male/female leads, but a lot of unnecessary and irritating time-fillers. Speaking of time fillers... poor Thomas has a whiney ex-wife &amp; what has to be one of the most annoying neighbors in tv history, although she is a bit funny at times. Also annoying that the writers think that the Nora character who's a bank lawyer would read texts and then admit to it, or persistently ask a guy who he'd had dinner with or where he was the night before when they're not even a thing. A lot of very implausible scenarios and dialogs for professionals. After Forbrydelsen, um, would it be a bit harsh to (affectionately) describe Sandhamm as vacuous drivel? Somewhere in the middle would have sufficed. Most of us are good with a relatively creative, rational plot and a few sensible side stories thrown in, and when there's nothing intelligent left to say, end it.

1524,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure," Awesome series continuation, has a Princess Bride feel","As a fan of the original Tangled, I was curious where they were going with this series. Happy to say if you're a Tangled fan the series follows the film almost seamlessly.<br/><br/>First there's the TV movie, Tangled: Before Ever After, which I personally didn't care for too much. It was a bit too hammy and moralistic, low on humor and cliché. ""Stubborn princess disobeys father. Father doesn't understand stubborn princess."" We've seen this story play out so many times.<br/><br/>Now the SERIES on the other hand really gets things going. I would still recommend watching Before Ever After because you get explanations for some major plot elements of the series. <br/><br/>First there's the humor. I think Tangled the Series is really funny. It's anchored by being set in a renaissance / medieval period and it manages to work the period into its humor, which is really great because it reminds me of things like The Princess Bride or Monty Python and the Holy Grail, other films that did well with not taking the setting seriously. That's a huge plus for Tangled.<br/><br/>Then there's the voice cast which is awesome since it's being helmed by the original voices. You never get a sense that you're not seeing Rapunzel or Flynn being the way they are, and the voices really help with that. In fact one of the best things about Tangled is that we get to see more of Flynn and especially Rapunzel. As much the film developed her character, it was still limited by the runtime. The series really fleshes her out and we have a more defined idea of who Rapunzel is. Flynn was always flashy and we get a lot more of Flynn, the arrogant side and the deeper ""Eugene"" part of him. Although we really should be calling him Eugene since that's what he goes by in the series. There's also a new character who is just fantastic, Cassandra. The banter being Cassandra and Eugene is one of the running jokes that the series plays with really well. As a trio, they work really well together.<br/><br/>It's also nice to see Rapunzel and Eugene ""dating"" in a sense. Since the film went by so fast, we have more of a chance to see what their relationship is like.<br/><br/>So far I've been really loving this. It's like an expansion pack of the original movie - more insight into the kingdom, more insight into the characters and a bigger setting to play around with.",17 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,11 June 2017

1526,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, Genuinely good series!,"I don't know what I expected from a series made from Tangled, to be honest. I liked Tangled, didn't think it was the best thing ever but definitely a good time. This series however went up and abound my expectations!
I didn't expect it to start (in the Before Ever After-movie) with Rapunzel feeling trapped again and not liking her happy ever after, even though Flynn/Eugene settles in like it's the best thing ever. It's so realistic though, for a character that have always been locked up and a character that used to have nothing. Not to mention I have yet to see a tv series EVER to portray such a good, healthy relationship as Raps and Eugenes.
All the characters are cool, though slightly more one dimensional at times than the movie. The new characters (Cassandra and Varian especially) are interesting and gives us fun relationship dynamics. 
There is some silliness that might be a bit much at times but mostly the jokes are genuinely funny. The animation is really nice, and the colour setting in this series is to die for!

1527,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, I love it so much!,"Although I can't really tell what audience this show is aiming for, it is quite enjoyable. As many other reviews tell you, ""Tangled: The Series"" is an overall combination of warm-hearted, fun scenes that are found in the typical children's show and some other scenes that may frighten kids. That combination is a little unusual; nevertheless, the show is still amazing. I'd say pre-teens would enjoy it the most.<br/><br/>As you might have also seen other reviews say, this series contains MANY fillers. Not sure if I would recommend this show to people who want to get straight to the point. Most of the fillers do include character development, though.<br/><br/>One thing I also want to mention that I saw in another review is that the protagonists are a little different than in the movie. Rapunzel's innocence is quirky and lovable in the movie; in the series, to many (not necessarily to me), it just makes her seem annoying and naïve. Which, she was definitely naïve in the movie, but you'd think after all that she'd been through, she would be much less. She was only the slightest bit less. It makes it even more ironic that she mentions quite a few times in the show that she isn't naïve anymore. Eugene, well, is just her go-to guy for emotional support. He wasn't much of an ""emotions"" guy in the movie, though I understand he could've grown to be like that the more time he spent with Rapunzel. It's just weird to me to go suddenly from an orphan/thief to a sort-of therapist.<br/><br/>One reason I enjoy this show probably a little more than I should is simply because I am a Tangled lover. Definitely recommend to any Tangled lover. Overall wonderful show!",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,24 July 2020

1530,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, A wonderful addition to a wonderful movie!,"The original movie is my favourite Disney film and when they announced the series I was obviously skeptical. However, this series has proved time and time again that it isn't just a money grab. It's so well thought out and planned and you can really tell that the creative team care about these characters and their stories. The twists and turns are greater than that of a movie sequel could ever wish to achieve and I for one am so glad that we get even more plot than we would have had in a feature length movie sequel. There are some glorious songs written by the wonderful Alan Menken and Glen Slater, and with original voice actors Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi back, there's nothing to deter you! As a theatre fan I really appreciate the additions of Eden Espinosa, Jeremy Jordan, and James M. Iglehart just to name a few - all of which are wonderful in their roles! This show is not only for children but also the fans who resonate with the original movie and want more from these beloved characters.

Cassandra and Varian are great additions to the story. I want to address bhzan's review critiquing some late first season writing. WARNING SPOILERS START NOW.<br/><br/>Varian becoming a villain is not out of nowhere or inconsistent. They were hinting at it all season. Varian is first introduced as ""a dangerous wizard,"" which seems like a subversion when we discover he's a good hearted kid. Turns out, that's foreshadowing.<br/><br/>We see in subsequent episodes how dangerous alchemy and magic are, hinting at how dangerous he too could be. Also, people who aren't the main characters don't usually get songs, so that was a dead giveaway. Plus, he sees his dad lying to the king and gets in a moral dilemma, then later he's the one making the dubious choice to lie to the princess Rapunzel.<br/><br/>Varian plotting after feeling he'd been betrayed by his friends and losing his only parent is a MUCH better reason for wrongdoing than many over villains in fiction, and it's definitely not out of nowhere.<br/><br/>10/10 I'm a screenwriter, and I endorse this show.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,7 December 2019
1533,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure," Starts Slow, but Finishes Amazing","Tangled: The Series may at first seem like a generic slice-of-life cartoon with mediocre animation, but give the show a chance and you will find a surprisingly compelling story waiting to be discovered.<br/><br/>Animation:<br/><br/>Probably one of the weaker aspects of the show. The animation is merely serviceable, but isn't ugly. I appreciate the choice to use 2D animation, but it doesn't seem like the show was given the budget to really take full advantage of the medium.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>At first, I was worried that the main character Rapunzel would turn out to be a Mary Sue, and her character can come off that way in earlier episodes. However, the writers thankfully decided to give her flaws such as irresponsibility, naivete, and being pushy. Not only that, Rapunzel must make difficult decisions, and reacts to tragedy and grows in an organic manner.<br/><br/>The two other main characters, action girl Cassandra and the dashing but vain rogue Eugene, are also delightful. Their enmity and repartee are a joy to watch, and they both come in handy to Rapunzel when she needs them. I like that Cassandra doesn't hate femininity like many warrior women in media, and also faces pressures from trying to live up to her father. Eugene also faces a tough road while trying move beyond his criminal past.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is serviceable. Rapunzel's father King Frederic is one of the highlights, as an overbearing yet ultimately loving man who constantly butts heads with the free spirited Rapunzel.<br/><br/>However, overshadowing even the main cast is the character of Varian. A brilliant young inventor whose impulsiveness often gets him into trouble, Varian is an adorkable character you can't help falling in love with. Varian's resourcefulness and the lengths he will go to help the one's he cares about make him the best thing about this show.<br/><br/>Music: The soundtrack is decent, and many of the songs that are included are a bit unmemorable. However, two songs in particular are stunning and practically cinematic. Jeremy Jordan, who plays Varian, stands out as an amazing singer who can really use song to help the audience relate to his character's struggles.<br/><br/>Story: The story of Tangled begins light and episodic, with a focus on comedy over drama. Sometimes the main characters will come off too one note in these early episodes, and in a few episodes Rapunzel comes off as a Mary Sue. However, once the show finds it's footing, it really gets good. Around Episode 16, the show shifts in a more dark direction and Rapunzel must make hard choices with lasting repercussions. From that episode onward, the show only gets better and better as twists and challenges culminate in an emotionally charged and powerful climax.<br/><br/>Verdict: I would like to give this show a higher score for its final episodes, however it is held back by a weak opening. Too often, children's entertainment is afraid to take risks. Tangled: The Series shows that when television trusts its audience to handle a more serious story, the result can be magical.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,8.0,5 April 2019
1534,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, Best Disney Channel Animated Show!!!,"Fun, funny and entertaining. Disney needs to air more of this show. I've rewatched season 1 and 2 twice so far. Hopefully more coming soon !!!",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,28 January 2019
1535,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure," With beautiful musical numbers, solid character development, and very deep storylines, Tangled The Series is a perfect continuation","Back at 2010, Disney released Tangled, a movie about Rapunzel, after being in the tower for a long time since childhood, goes out with a thief named Flynn Rider in order to pursue the lanterns on her birthday. Her biological mother, Mother Gothel, however, intends to use Rapunzel's hair in order to retain her youth. It became a box office success and thus plans for a television series were made.<br/><br/>Originally spun off from Tangled: Before Ever After, the series continues the adventures of Rapunzel during her adjustments to the life of a princess while encountering a mysterious return of her 70 feet magical golden hair. Little did she know that mysteries surrounding the world of Corona lie ahead as she tries to uncover them along with Cassandra, Eugene, and many others.<br/><br/>Now that it's been nearly 6 months since the show ended, I'm not going to do any spoilers and give the show some praise. Not only is this one of the best animated Disney channel series, but it's a great continuation of the movie. I know there's many people out there that either love it or hate it, but as a person who loved the movie back at the early 2010s, I personally love this show.<br/><br/>Not only does it expand on the original film with very deep storylines, it provides some solid character development for not only for Rapunzel and Eugene, but every other character in the entire show notably Cassandra. In fact, the characters are both likeable and relatable with some engaging and heartfelt voice work from Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Eden Espinosa and everyone else including Julie Bowen, Clancy Brown, and Jeremy Jordan. The pacing for every episode so far has been solid as it provides some atmosphere.<br/><br/>The animation is also another great aspect. The character designs of Rapunzel Eugene, Maximus, and Pascal along with the other characters from the movie are good while the new character designs are also good. Not to mention that the visuals are perfectly colored especially the look of Corona.<br/><br/>And last but not least the music. Alan Menken, who composed the music and songs for the movie, returns for the show and provides some great new songs with Kevin Kliesch notably ""Wind in My Hair"" in the opening intro. Also, the music score is haunting uplifting, and poignant.<br/><br/>Overall, Tangled: The Series is a great show. To those who haven't seen the show yet, check out the movie first.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,26 August 2020

And then the cassandra story line for a third movie.with all the songs from the second season. That wouldv'e been a trilogy worth watching.instead it's an underrated tv show that most teens and adults won't watch. Such interesting themes, also loved the episode about pascal feeling left out, related so much and it was fun to see his back story. I loved the series, even though I skipped a few of the filler episodes.

The show brings back the original characters (including their amazing voice cast Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi) but also adds new lovely ones.

1540,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, Seen only two episodes of this show so far good,"As you probably know I love the 2010 film Tangled. Its my all time favourite movie from the 00s and I loved everything about it. The animation,the music,the charcthers,the voice acting everything was top notch in this movie. In 2012 we got a short on Rapunzel(voiced by former pop star Mandy Moore)and Eugene Fitzherbert(voiced by Zachary Levi)who get married,and then that was it, until in 2017 Disney decided to bring back Tangled again,except make it into a TV show/special with Tangled Before Ever After which centres on Rapunzel dealing with being a princess and now we have come to this TV series dubbed Tangled:The Series. So is it any good since I only seen 2 episodes of it so far. Well lets find out.<br/><br/>Season 1 What The Hair: Is about Rapunzel who dreams that Mother Gothel comes back again to get her back to the tower again,and Rapunzel and her friend Cassandra visit this eccentric inventor that tries to help Rapunzel with her magical hair that grows back again since the Before Ever After TV special movie and it backfires. Rapunzel doesn't tell Eugene about her hair because he has a habit of not keeping secrets. Overall this episode was good and enjoyable. Eugene is still hilarious as he is in the 2010 film.<br/><br/>Season 2 Rapunzel's Enemy: This one is about Rapunzel who gets booed by a man named Monty who dislikes her for some strange reason,and Rapunzel's partner in crime Eugene Fitzherbert tells her that its OK that no one will love you and not everyone will. So Rapunzel tries her best to impress Monty even donning a disguise as Missy sporting a brown wig and a ridiculous dress(how she was able to put her 70 feet of hair under that wig was beyond me). But will Monty ever like Rapunzel?<br/><br/>Overall you guys I am happy with Tangled coming back again. I loved the film since 2011 and I was always a fan of Mandy Moore.Zachary Levi(who stole the film from the original)was still the same as he was back then.<br/><br/>Now I have to come clean. I just can't get this hand-drawn style of this show. I wished they used another software so that it can have its true animation like its original counterpart. Yes I know that the original film used expensive technology but how come How To Train Your Dragon got a TV show and kept its animation and Tangled didn't.<br/><br/>But still I did enjoy the show so far. I hope they will add new songs soon cause I miss the songs from the original film.Mandy Moore does the theme song for this show titled Wind In My Hair,while UK singer/songwriter Natasha Bedingfield sings More Of Me To Give during the ending credits. <br/><br/>My final rating a 7/10",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,7.0,1 April 2017
1541,Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, Best Show Ever!,"This is such a great show and this last season was EPIC. Everyone should watch it, it's much more than a kids show. It has great songs, both Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi reprise their roles, as does almost every other side character from the film. Eden Espinosa and James Monroe Iglehart (Broadway) are both series regulars with amazing roles and Jeremy Jordan is the voice of a well beloved side character.
The visuals are beautiful and the animation is spectacular, it keeps getting better and better. It's as good and probably better than some of the original animated movies we have from the 1940s-70s. The style may throw you off for a second because it's not how the movie looks, but they can't make a whole show using the same tech for a film. The style is so beautiful and is meant to mimic Rapunzel's drawing style, and it does a great job.

However in episode 16, the writers went into a completely different direction with the story, making unbelievable changes in the characters and events.

When Fauna Hodel finally confronts her dastardly father, the words that spew from her lips do not sound remotely like anything her character could ever say -- totally unbelievable. The final scene is a hoot -- only from the perspective of absurdity.

1562,I Am the Night, Into the Night,"Reel Review: I Am the Night
Producer Patty Jenkins
Starring: Chris Pine, India Eisley, Jefferson Mays
A new limited series from filmmaker Patty Jenkins (Monster, Wonder Woman) detailing the real life events surrounding the infamous 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short otherwise known as The Black Dahlia. Next to the Ripper murders the Black Dahlia has captured the imaginations of armchair detectives through the decades and is equally as infamous.
The first of six episodes premiered tonight on TNT starring Chris Pine as a down and out news reporter who has fallen from grace after rubbing certain powerful parties the wrong way after running an expose on one George Hodel who is very well connected. George is believed by many including his son (a former LAPD detective) to be the slayer of Elizabeth Short.
A young woman raised all her life in Nevada comes to learn that her past is a lie and that George Hodel is her grandfather and leaves home in search of her roots to the chagrin of her adoptive mother. The episode ends with the young woman making it to LA seeking to reconnect with her grandfather and journalist Jay Singletary once again set upon the trail of Dr. Hodel and the secrets that he may be hiding.
This is episode one of six and is planting the seeds of what is to come in the series going forward. Chris Pine as usual gives a stellar performance as the disgraced journalist brings both his comedic chops and a sense of tragedy to his character. India Eisley is also great as a young woman whose life is turned upside down and the ending of tonight's episode has me stoked as to what is to come this season.
I am a long time true crime buff and the Black Dahlia case is one that has fascinated me for a very long time. Especially in recent years George Hodel's name has figured prominently as the preeminent suspect in the murder of Elizabeth Short. Just google the name George Hodel and you can read a little bit about some of the accusations lobbed against him that will make your stomach turn. If your a student of true crime or just a fan of mystery thrillers then chances are I Am the Night will probably be to your liking.",28 out of 47 found this helpful.,7.0,29 January 2019

Seriously the scenes with the editor are boring and ridiculous. Who would employ this maniac and keep giving him assignments that won't be done? This went nowhere and instead of focusing on the real meat of the story I've had to watch these two idiots bumble along. I'm assuming when he enters the room with the paintings in ep 4 that was supposed to be a pivotal ah ha scene except it wasn't. The audience has seen the paintings and knows the Dr is involved. Another episode where nothing new is brought to the table. The only interesting character is Dr Hodel and he is barely to be seen.

Walter White had initiated a methamphetamine trafficking in order to offer a fortune after his imminent death to his family, and Moritz does the same to lure his forever love back. That makes sense, doesn't it?

1579,How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)," I'm impressed, especially for a German show","As a German myself, I know that we are far from the best, when it comes to Movies and TV-Shows. That's probably not because we don't have talented actors or directors; I rather believe that we lack good novelists. If it's largely based on a true story, like this show and many great German movies, it can turn out really well, but if the story is completely fabricated, it also feels completely fabricated to the viewer.<br/><br/>This show doesn't feel fabricated at all though. It feels really authentic in its portrayal of our current youth, social media, current technology, and also the soundtrack feels on spot.
There are a few things that are a bit odd, like the Police not being able to recover data from a Windows notebook (really guys, cracking the password of a windows machine is one Google request away ... that OS has next to no security measures), but it's mostly very well researched.
With writers in their 30s and directors that are almost 50, I'm really impressed at how accurate the show is.<br/><br/>The show also makes me feel a bit sad, because apparently I was 10 years ahead of my time. In my youth I was an outcast, but I would've fit right in if I was born 10 years later.<br/><br/>Last but not least, this show has some informational value about drugs and drug use. As so often, the best prevention strategy is education, not prohibition.<br/><br/>Over all a great show.

With exciting CG dinosaurs and cleverly woven plot lines (which carry through each episode), this is an amazing new series that deserves to go on! Some have commented that the acting is poor, yet I think these guys and girls do extremely well, given that they are acting to CG for a large amount of time, and that is an extremely difficult thing to do.<br/><br/>The plot lines are well thought out and well written, throwing everyday people into the path of prehistoric monsters and seeing how they deal with it. A wonderful combination of acting, writing and our own desire to occasionally escape the ""real"" world makes this a gripping series that you have to tune into each week.<br/><br/>Great show, can't wait for series 2!!!",103 out of 118 found this helpful.,10.0,25 March 2007
1598,Primeval, Really good ideas and excellent CGI,"I must confess I just watched this mini-series because I watch any film with monsters in it. I didn't expect anything much, but the 6 episodes of series 1 turned out to be a real surprise which left me wanting a series 2! PRIMEVAL is a flawless combination of comedy elements (with cute dinosaurs) and action elements (with big bad dinosaurs), and it manages successfully to appeal to both kids and mature viewers. The special FX are excellent, and conflicts make the human characters interesting. PRIMEVAL also has a whole bunch of really good ideas: let the creatures appear in the neighborhood, maybe next to your washing machine - not on a distant tropical island! Instead of the typical T-Rex, let's have a little known creature from the Perm age or even a predator from the future (so, they aren't even dinosaurs from the scientific POV). Instead of killing all the creatures, try preserve them and bring them back home to the age they came from, as any change in the past is potentially dangerous. Clever entertainment! Which also shows in the characters, since they are far from stereotypes. Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) for example. On one hand, she saves lives and gives help, but on the other hand she won't speak the truth, is unscrupulous and cannot be trusted. Primeval - haven't seen any better series recently!",53 out of 64 found this helpful.,,23 September 2007
1599,Primeval, Surprising,"Prior to watching it I had low expectations. It sounded like an afternoon kids show but I was very wrong.<br/><br/>The concept is well imagined and it seems to be aiming at an older audience. Curiously the first two episodes had a zero body count, then they suddenly seemed to change their mind and the bodies started stacking up.<br/><br/>The largely unknown actors put in pretty good performances. Surprisingly ex ""S Club 7"" member Hannah Spearritt is a capable actress. The DVD extras reveal she is less capable at throwing rocks though - the one she was meant to throw at a creature hits the cameraman! The CGI effects are excellent for a TV series with a strictly limited budget, almost film standard largely thanks to the previous ground breaking Walking With Dinosaurs, with only the occasional wobble.<br/><br/>However while the overall story is engaging the script writer ought to be fired for the details. Our belief in the characters is disrupted at regular intervals when they do something unbelievably stupid just to keep the story running. For example when being told to run for the trees the character can be clearly seen running along side them, and after armed special forces are driven off by creatures they are content to let unarmed scientists face them alone, not intervening even when hearing they are in trouble on the radio. Every episode has such incidents which require forceful suspension of belief.<br/><br/>The characters also need to be developed more and their strengths played to to justify their continued participation in the project, as some of them are tenuous.<br/><br/>Despite these script failings the series shows a huge amount of promise and I am delighted to hear a second series has been commissioned which I will certainly be watching.<br/><br/>I recommend you give it a try.

1600,Primeval, An unexpected surprise.,"After seeing the trailer for this six-part ITV series. I thought it to be another cheesy attempt to cash in on the current British sci-fi phenomenon. The tag line 'Time For Adventure' was the real put-off for me, though. And I thought it to be another clumsy clone of the massively popular re-make of 'Doctor Who' After watching the first episode (mainly out of pity) I had a change of heart. Sure, the special effects could use some dusting-up, but the show seems to have it all. Massive dinosaur fight scenes for the kids, a love-triangle for older viewers, witty one-liners even a missing wife for all you 'Lost' fans out there. The one thing that worried me, though, is the scenes of Abby jiggling around in her panties due to her humid flat. Now, I have no personal problem against this, but it seems like ITV are just asking for trouble from over-worrying mum's by making a show for kids at around eight on a Saturday night and then going straight on and plonking that in there. My underline: May not be to everyones tastes, but worth a shot for any 'Doctor Who' or 'Life On Mars' fans.",46 out of 60 found this helpful.,9.0,20 February 2007
1601,Primeval, ITV's answer to the Who phenomenon,"Okay, so the dinosaurs are a little hokey, but I really enjoyed the first episode of Primeval. The fact of the matter, you've got to look at it from the perspective that it's a UK-based fantasy series - so you've got to make sure you've taken a huge dollop of irony with the hole thing. I mean Torchwood is set in Cardiff - and making it look like a dynamic city took some hefty salt pinching on the viewer's behalf. So the Forest of Dean being the site of a portal to the past where dinosaurs can hide is really a walk in the park. So,getting past the dinosaur that moved like a Doberman - and the flying dinosaur that seem to have been taking cute lessons from my cat, the cast were interesting. Only Ben Murray and Hannah Spearitt were actors that I immediately recognised. I kind of knew Douglas Henshall's name. But the stand out actor of the first series was James Murray as Stephen Hardy. The tracker and hunter, with a penchant for playing chicken with huge carnivorous dinosaurs, is a good looking bloke. I reckon that he out-charisma-ed everyone off the screen. Ultimately, I laughed my socks off at the machismo, but that didn't stop me enjoying it.",57 out of 76 found this helpful.,7.0,10 February 2007
1602,Primeval, Fun from our friends at ITV,"Interesting premise - 'anomalies' popping up in diverse parts of London. These anomalies are naturally (one supposes) occurring portals to the past. The perfect plot devices - they remain for a limited time only. Just long enough for creatures to arrive and create a bit of mayhem. To date these have been prehistoric eras that ensure dinosaurs and other rabid fauna can come through and wreak havoc. We've had a diverse array of battling creatures that include giant centipedes, spiders and dodos. Yes, dodos. But, if you're looking for originality, you can stop reading and look elsewhere. Everything is game for these writers. Episode 4, with our rambunctious dodos, included hilarious thievery from Stargate, SG1.<br/><br/>The cast is adequate with stock characters. The suited bureaucrat who thrives on secrecy and SWAT teams; tousle haired professor who touts various theories; goofy geekoid student who insinuates himself into the proceedings. Et al. All moving under the premise, as with SG1, that all of this can be kept secret from a public sure to panic and riot if revealed. A rather more interesting character is the professor's long lost wife - found to be jumping among timelines and having the ability to predict where and when one will open.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is this: it's fun. It's not great, and it's not replete with originality. But you will probably go back each week for more. After all, what competition is there?

I loved the pilot episode and I certainly will continue watching. The graphics are fascinatingly nice bearing in mind that this is not a heavy Hollywood-Production. In addition, the soundtrack is carefully chosen. All the actresses and actors play their part exceptionally good.

1606,Primeval, Primevil,"It's just evil to make you get hooked to this series, and force you to sit through the end. Nothing less. The first few episodes were watchable mostly because of the eye-candy. The animation is superb, and I got to admit... I absolutely love Hannah Spearitt (Abby).<br/><br/>It's like a mix of Jurassic Park, a random horror series, and Stargate without the clever twists. It all seems a bit new in the first couple of episodes, and all the inconsistencies and intelligence-insulting story lines is forgivable.<br/><br/>As the episodes progress, all the holes in the script begin to become all too obvious though. Now, in season 3, it's like watching a science fiction parody. It simply seems like the writers did'nt even bother to go through the script a second time, just passing it along to the director without any thought! Episode 2, and they have hired a woman to do research into mythology behind the 'anomalies', trying to find patterns in order to make educated guesses on when and where the next anomaly will appear. But apparently, she did'nt even bother to give the team that investigates the site any information about it whatsoever.<br/><br/>The prehistoric animals are all messed up. Apparently nothing can scare them, and they attack anything in sight. I remember a scene where a group of citizens got horribly mauled by some worms that went through an anomaly, but when it attacked the heroes, it barely made any mark.<br/><br/>I could name so many problems with the script, but it's easier to just give the summary: Clearly, the concept of the series was to make a show that had dinosaurs in them which really looked good - and they succeeded. It does look pretty nice. But there is no new ideas, they took it all from various previous shows creating the most uninspired Hollywood text-book science fiction series I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The acting is alright, but all the duologue's are boring attempts at creating a would-be chemistry that we all have seen far too many times.<br/><br/>If you're really bored, then watch it.

The casting is excellent and story lines, although sometimes far-fetched, are nevertheless highly enjoyable. It's the little gem on Saturday night TV which these days are pretty much few and far between.<br/><br/>For those who are keen to compare it to Doctor Who and Torchwood, I must say I personally don't think it's similar to either of them. Yes, it's the same genre but give the thing a chance! -- I'm not sure half the people who have slated this have even watched it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Primeval was never going to be groundbreaking - and, to its credit, I don't think it sets out to be anything of the sort - but it is a great piece of telly fluff that'll certainly keep me tuned for series two.",19 out of 29 found this helpful.,7.0,15 March 2007
1608,Primeval, Fresh counts in food ... and television,"This show took me by surprise, and that's hard to do. As clever as the current crop of TV writers may THINK they are, they are essentially riffing on someone else's stories. (Like the man once said, there are only 4 basic plots anyway). And then along comes this. It was fabulously clever. Temporal anomalies. Beasties popping through. All kinds of strange dynamics among the group, strange motives, conspiracies, love triangles. When Juliet Aubrey turned out to be bad, that was good. When Hannah Spearritt ignored the protocols and ""adopted"" one of the creatures, that was ever better (and later episodes put the little guy's life in jeopardy more than once). The high rating is for the concept, the execution, and holding interest over several seasons. On DVD or streaming, this should be more fun than a barrel of hammers. And here is a tip -- I peeked at the IMDb page for the sequel, which was little more than an attempt to resurrect a dead show in North America using complete unknowns (something they tried to do, believe it or not, with THE AVENGERS decades ago).

But the lack of character development coupled with constant turnover of characters leaves us with a science fiction show with a premise grounded without story and characters that as soon as you care whether they are even in the show getting consistently killed off.

1610,Primeval, Not clever enough,"The first episode of Primeval went to air in New Zealand last night and I'm afraid I'm joining the ""disappointed"" team. I was looking forward to this as a fan of British TV but it quickly lost my vote, and not just because it looks like a cross between Jurassic Park and Stargate. That wouldn't have been a problem if the writers and director had shown any degree of patience with their plot. Instead, they rushed headlong into the story as if in fear of the viewers getting away if they stopped for breath. So there was no tension, no build-up, no clever mind games with the viewer and, by the end of the first fifteen minutes, we already knew far too much - as did the characters. And what the characters discovered didn't scare them anywhere near enough. The main ones are supposed to be serious scientists but they were far too ready to accept things that should have thrown their world-view into chaos. Big, scary creature? Well, clearly it's a dinosaur that's somehow found its way into the present day. Oh, look - big sparkly thing in the forest. It must be a space-time anomaly. We've all heard about those! And yes, let's go through the big sparkly thing despite the fact that we have absolutely no idea what it will do to us or what, if anything, is on the other side. (At least Stargate had the nous to send a mechanical probe through first). And the scenes with the boy were just plain lazy and crude. A dinosaur manages to track the boy right back to his bedroom in suburban England and then proceeds to smash its way through his window and wreck his room without anyone in the other houses noticing. And when his mother comes up to tell the boy off for making so much noise, she doesn't even bother to ask how the bedroom window frame came to be smashed to pieces! Pu-lease! Yes, I know that sci-fi demands a suspension of disbelief but good sci-fi doesn't insult your intelligence along the way. What it should do is challenge your imagination. Primeval doesn't do that - at least not for the adult viewer - so I won't be tuning in next week.",14 out of 24 found this helpful.,3.0,11 July 2007
1611,Primeval," A Worth Watching TV show, until Series 4 (May contain spoilers!)","*May contain a person rambling on for a bit*<br/><br/>When I first watched this show I fell in love with it. The episodes had fantastic stories, and really cool characters. Abby and Connor are the best, and Nick Cutter was a close runner-up. The effects are a bit cheesy, I admit, but it's a good show... Seasons 1,2 and 3 were awesome, and are seriously worth watching! But... It WAS a good TV series Until Season 4 popped up. (DOn't get me wrong, I still like 1,2 and 3) The first episode of Season 4 was OK, with the Spinosaurus and Abby and Connor trapped in the past for a year... But after that it just began to fail miserably.<br/><br/>You can tell it was made by a different team of people, by all the camera shots used (Those little not needed slight zooms), the getting-worse-by-episode-acting, the stories that make no sense and seem pointless, and the dialogue is spoken in episodes is cut in too suddenly, making un-realistic speaking in a conversation.<br/><br/>The believable sci-fi/mild-horror show Primeval has gone to fast-speaking-unable-to-keep-up-with-what's-happening rubbish! And they've changed Connor's character so he's gone from geeky-but-likable to near-useless! And what's up with that girl who sits at the annomoly detecting screen? She's only there to wear short skirts, and she's not needed at all! They all get in these buildings and places, no questions asked, no one there to wonder why people with guns have charged in! In the older series, they're asked questions about why something's happened, why they're going into a building/have to close somewhere off, while now they go where ever the hell they like, and no one cares!<br/><br/>When it came to Season 4 episode four, with the kids in the school... Man, the continuity in that was stinkin' terrible! First, the team get in the school building, then the kids lock the doors. So what happens in the next shot? The ARC team are shown walking through a door, which had been locked, then next when they try going through a door 'It's locked!' And that keeps happening throughout the episode UNTIL NEARLY THE END (But even that had a horrible continuity error) the end, where Connor has reset the system, so all the doors are unlocked, and then after that they ask 'Connor, can you get these doors unlocked?' 'YEah, I'm doing it now' (HE's already unlocked them by reseting the system! DUH! They've been unlocked for about 5 minutes, you could have gone through that door! *Face-palm* <br/><br/>The fourth series completely sucks, with dialogue spoken/cut in too fast, terrible continuity, and the people from the past (forgot about them)are annoying and seem pointless, I'd give Series 4 -10/10, but the first 3 series, with more of a sci-fi/mild horror element are a definite 10/10.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,5.0,2 February 2011
1612,Primeval, Pretty good to start with but ran out of ideas,"When Primeval first started it was pretty good and very interesting in its concept. However, in my view the show is getting worse and worse. The special effects are great, I like the theme tune and Andrew Lee Potts does what he can. But sadly, I wish I can say the same for the rest. The first series was good, after that it was clear the series was running out of ideas. There is a lack of atmosphere, because the scares are so predictably done. Then there is the camera work, which is very frantic and rushed to the point it is dizzying, the writing is now clichéd and banal and the story lines are dully paced, lame and unoriginal. Other than Potts, the other acting is often lacking and it doesn't help that I can't connect to the characters. So overall, to start it wasn't bad, now other than the effects and two or three other things it is rather dull and unoriginal. 3/10 Bethany Cox",10 out of 18 found this helpful.,3.0,18 June 2011

Spoilers Ahead! <br/><br/>""Primeval"" ranks up there with ""Fringe"" as one of the best time travel/alternate universe genre SF TV series ever made. Far, far better than paint by the numbers shows such as ""Quantum Leap."" I still can't believe however that the creators of the show killed off every one of their leading characters.<br/><br/>Killing off the adorable Claudia Brown by changing the time line was bad enough. Admittedly they reincarnated her, sort of, as Jenny Lewis. But then they wrote her out of the show too by having her resign.<br/><br/>Killing off the unflappable, too cool for school Stephen Hart and even the living, beating heart of the show Nick Cutter was just too much. That is no way to keep a franchise going.<br/><br/>I suppose the creators of the show should be given credit for their ruthlessness. The shockingly unexpected deaths of these beloved main characters leave holes in our hearts. They evoke the inner emptiness that accompanies the loss of a loved one.<br/><br/>But unless the actors wanted out for career reasons, killing their characters off was definitely a bad move.",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,8 July 2012
1614,Primeval," Sorry, but hardly worth watching.","Without a doubt, the special effects in this series are pretty good. The rest isn't really. It's just very weak stories with many predictable 'scare' moments. Kids might enjoy this, adults have to turn off their brains to a max. It's all been done/seen before. I personally am prepared to overlook these kind of defects, when compensated, for instance, by some interesting lead characters with personalities (the 'A-team' would be a good example here). However, except for Connor Temple and maybe James Lester, these people are utterly boring. I find myself not really caring for any of them, should they die or something.<br/><br/>So why am I watching this in the first place, one might ask. Andrew-Lee Potts would be the answer. In Syfy's mini series 'Alice', he managed to steal every scene and I keep hoping to see some of that magic here. But he hardly gets the chance. Those camera shots keep flashing about to get too many characters into 45 minutes, together with all those dinosaurs and other primeval creatures.

1617,Primeval, Inept Annoying Bimbo Connor,"I try to enjoy this show, but the sub-moronic, inept, annoying she-boy Andrew Lee Potts keeps ruining the show with his incompetence and stupidity. Around episode 3 he gets his best friend killed. It never ends with Connor's insipid mistakes, gaffs, and other hapless goofs.<br/><br/>Worse than that, he forces himself into the home of co-worker Abby Maitland (played by Hannah Spearitt), and never leaves. That is stalking and sexual assault in our modern age. I did not find that attitude acceptable. I did not like Connor, or how he treats people. He uses and abuses everyone, and then acts like he never knew what he was doing, because he is too dumb to be a b*stard.<br/><br/>Overall, the Primeval show had a good concept, but the casting made it hard to watch. In addition to the obnoxious Connor, there is Helen Cutter (played by Juliet Aubrey). She is way too old for the role, and she plays a vile hag who found the anomolies into the past and then never came back and told her husband. This went on for eight years, and yet she is dressed in modern clothing all the time, and apparently she was returning to London regularly, but just wanted to be a nasty b*tch and never told her husband that she was fine.<br/><br/>There is way too much soap opera on this show for anything that is science fiction or action. In season 2, Claudia Brown (played by Lucy Brown) disappears and comes back as Jenny Lewis, a totally different person who looks the same as Claudia Brown. Only Nick Cutter remembers, and everyone thinks he is insane. What is the point of this story-line? It was just a big annoying waste of time.<br/><br/>Primeval is a show that had potential and some good GCI dinosaurs (and some really bad CGI too). It was ruined by the endless soap opera and comedy mix that made this show into some kind of diarrhea.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,5 July 2020
1618,Primeval," Lightweight , fun series. Poor camera work","I enjoyed the light hearted action of the first series. Hannah Spearritt certainly is easy on the eyes, especially when caught running around in her undies.<br/><br/>But by the beginning of series 3 I felt like I was seeing the same thing rehashed and recycled every week. So I quit watching.<br/><br/>I decided to go back later and start series 4. Again, nothing deep, but more fun than reality TV. However, I don't know if I will watch any more than the 1st episode because of the horrible camera work. Did they go out looking for a cameraman with palsy? Whenever there is any action, of which there is plenty since that is the meat of the series, the camera bounces around enough to make watching unpleasant. Apparently this is someone's idea of informing the viewer that something exciting is happening. If I watch a car careening down the street I don't bob my head vigorously to make the sight more exciting. It really aggravates me that an otherwise mild to moderately entertaining 45 minutes becomes instead annoying because some director thinks it is cool bounce and jerk the camera.<br/><br/>If that is not a problem for you, and you expect that the plot and action will be pretty formula you'll find this passably entertaining.<br/><br/>I would have been willing to give it a 5 1/2, but amateur camera work reduces it to a 4.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,4.0,5 June 2011
1619,Primeval, Just not up to par...,"When I saw the Primeval commercials on BBC America, I was ""chuffed"". It looked like it had a great sci-fi concept and I was prepared to see an innovative UK television series.<br/><br/>The first episode aired this weekend in the states (I had my DVR system set up to record the series) and what an abysmal failure this show is. It's hard for me to even find a place to start.<br/><br/>The first couple of minutes start off with a bang as a woman is being chased by a prehistoric creature. But after that, the plot moves forward WAY too quickly to be believed by anyone.<br/><br/>The professor seems restrained and by the time he sees his first dinosaur, I still don't know anything about him except that his wife disappeared (which he seems to harp on at every moment) and that it appears he works in a lab with a bunch of fossils.<br/><br/>The annoying ""conspiracy"" theory college student is just that. Annoying. And somehow he's allowed to tag along with the ""professor"". If I was the professor, a restraining order would have been implemented a long time ago.<br/><br/>The hunky teacher's assistant seems to just be around as eye candy. Otherwise I'm at a loss as to why he's even there.<br/><br/>The platinum-haired female seems to be the only saving grace as we know more about her than the supposed main character.<br/><br/>Editing and the flow of the story is jilted. Jumps to short bursts of conversations does not make an interesting story. Just a confusing mess of dialogue scattered about lest we forget about the other characters. In some moments the jump cuts to other scenes are so distracting that I thought at first that is was probably just my DVR screwing up on me. But as the hour progressed I dismally realized that it was the show itself.<br/><br/>Onward to character actions. A kid runs to his home, goes to his bedroom, and sits under the window after wandering around in the forest being chased by a dinosaur. Said dinosaur follows him home (of course). Enter Jurassic Park mode and the dinosaur breaks through the window and tries to eat the kid. What does the kid do? He jumps on his bed instead of flying straight out of his bedroom via the door he just came in. All the while the dino is trying to eat the kid while he's sitting on his bed throwing things at it. I mean, come on!! The most inane part though is when the professor and his entourage of stooges attempt to cover up the incident with the kid's mom. A dinosaur punched through the window of a kid's room leaving a gaping hole, possibly some saliva, and even some skin fragments of where he was trying to push through, but nnnoooo. The professor and the gang said it wasn't a dinosaur just to appease Mom despite the kid's lamentations that it was. So what the hell exactly punched through his window that sounds like a reasonable explanation? Swamp gas? A weather balloon?? Also, I love how the mom comes up AFTER the attack. ""Jimmy? What are you doing in there? You better not be messing up your room!"" Sheesh.<br/><br/>Needless to say I scrubbed my DVR of that episode and promptly canceled the series from recording. I would say ""Nice try"" to the creators, but then I would be lying. I say back to the drawing board.",14 out of 32 found this helpful.,1.0,12 August 2008

1622,Silk Stalkings, Rob &amp; Mitzi: More Chemistry than duPont!,"Silk Stalkings will go down in TV history as the little cable show that really scored in the ratings.  Rob Estes and Mitzi<br/><br/>Kapture had more genuine, honest and passionate on-screen chemistry than any TV characters I've ever seen before or since.  It was magical.  The friendship.  The caring. The support.  The professional competence of this team was just something to behold.  The show also featured great supporting players like Charlie Brill and William Anton.  But all good things eventually come to an end.  When Rob &amp; Mitzi left in the middle of the 5th season the new team was totally unable to continue on in any way even close their predecessors. To be charitable, they were awful.  But it only got worse.  As<br/><br/>the 6th season started Executive Producer David Peckinpah left the series.  He had been the controlling force in the 1st 5 seasons.  Season 6 gave us new producers, directors, writers, supporting players, and a new team of detectives. Across the board the show collapsed!  We were supposed to<br/><br/>believe that a divorced couple were now the number one detective team in Palm Beach.  We were supposed to believe that no one in the Police Dept. had ever even known Chris and Rita.  The writing and directing were absolutely awful! Rob &amp; Mitzi had more chemistry and heat sitting at their desks than Potter and Gunn could ever hope to muster. We tried to give the last team chances to impress but the fun and magic were gone.

1623,Silk Stalkings, A cop show that brings a colorful twist to law and order.,"Before I offer any description of this TV show, I want to point out that the 'opening sequence' rates in my top 10. It is a sexy and overt grabber sequence that rivals that of ""Hawaii Five-O"", ""Miami Vice"", and even ""Mission Impossible"".<br/><br/>It is usually followed by Rita's narrative of what is yet to come.<br/><br/>So... we have this pair of police detectives. They are based in Palm Beach Florida. They are undoubtedly solving a murder that takes place before they even run the credits. A formula that remains in use.<br/><br/>Chris and Rita, the two main cop partner characters continue to have a professional but close relationship which adds some spark to the show. Others will acknowledge a real chemistry there, though perhaps awkward. When fire was added to the relationship it burned out the show. Keep the spark, prevent the fire, now that keeps us wondering what will happen next week.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the actors were done. The show still went on to much disappointment (at least by me). Forget the 'second cast'. The formula doesn't mix. Please don't dismiss the first few years.<br/><br/>Silk Stalkings presented a very new and different scene for a police detective environment which borrows from ""Miami Vice"" and then takes it over the top. It never takes itself too seriously, which really adds to the enjoyment.<br/><br/>I am pleased that it is now offered on DVD, and can now be rented. When you get sick of commercials, just pop a Silk in the DVD player and enjoy. Sure it is fluff... but when you get to the commercial break YOU DON'T GET ANY COMMERCIALS. You are right back into the show. Pause to pee if you like, but it does not really matter, you'll pick it right back up.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am biased somewhat... I used to watch it when it was actually on TV. This is a landmark show in my opinion. The outrageous police department decor and the dress of the main characters helped keep me interested.<br/><br/>Ignore the predictability, ""Silk Stalkings"" is a one of a kind, and worth a few enjoyable hours.",19 out of 21 found this helpful.,6.0,11 October 2006

1631,Silk Stalkings, Erotic crime drama series. Close to excellence.,"Stephen J. Cannell created one my most favorite TV series SILK STALKINGS. Stalking ran from 1991 to 1999 on CBS and then USA. Mitzi Kapture as Detective Rita Lance and Rob Estes as Detective Chris Lorenzo made the show what it was. Two detectives solving sexually-based crimes in Palm Beach, Florida(although the show was filmed in Sand Diego, California). It was this duo's job to catch killers among the rich and well-known among sharp dressed men and scantily-clad bomb shells. Although the budget was said to be tight, the screen always seemed to be filled with vivid color and modern eye candy. The close working relationship between Estes and Kapture at times pseudo erotic is so smooth and easy to watch.<br/><br/>The series became very mediocre when the original duo left for other projects. First being replaced by Nick Kokatkis and Tyler Layton; who would be replaced with Chris Potter and Janet Gunn. Ben Vereen was versatile as Lorenzo and Lance's first supervising Captain. He later would be replaced by the very apt Charlie Brill. Catch SILK STALKINGS on DVD at BlockBuster. You will really enjoy it or even fall in love with it all over again.

1632,Silk Stalkings, A USA Network guilty pleasure that actually had quality,"Spoilers ahead--probably.<br/><br/>I'm in a rather unique position. I'm a fan of both vintage Silk (Chris and Rita--played by Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture) and New Silk (Tom and Cassy played by Chris Potter and Janet Gunn). The writing quality was--respectable, I guess and the on screen chemistry between the characters of Chris and Rita was superb. So there was some intelligence mixed in with the eye candy. Then both stars quit in 1995. The ending of vintage Silk was extraordinarily depressing, particularly because they couldn't decide which ending to use. They had the dream sequence kiss that was such a tremendous relief and fun to watch and then the stark news that Chris had died (I think in surgery). The closing shot of the ep was of Rita looking through the hospital window, absolutely spiritually destroyed. Their replacements (Holly &amp; Mike?) were absolutely horrible. They were beautiful physical specimens, of course, but neither of them could act very well--(though, by the by, I did see Tyler Layton guest-star on Charmed that one time and she succeeded rather well, so maybe she improved her technique in the ensuing 2-3 years after she left this show). Tom and Cassy were nowhere near as engaging as the original pair and the writing dropped off seriously at the end, but it was still an enjoyable hour of television. I didn't realize that Peckinpah was the creative force behind vintage Silk. Die-hard Chris and Rita fans claim the loss of his influence killed the show. Trust me, it didn't. And I've also watched Peckinpah drive other successful series into the ground (like Sliders). Still, now that USA has gone respectable, don't expect to see them marketing anything like this or Pac Blue or anything resembling Sunday Night Heat ever again. That isn't a bad thing, but it's a fact that should be accepted.",12 out of 16 found this helpful.,,5 September 2004
1633,Silk Stalkings," Not very believable, but entertaining","This was hardly a high concept cop show. In a nutshell, it's a knockoff of ""Miami Vice"" set in Palm Beach, only with less substance and credibility. Two young, glamorous cops investigate and solve murders committed by snooty Palm Beach socialites, and do so without messing up their hairstyles or expensive wardrobes. The portrayal of the wealthy suspects was never believable. Most of the women wore form-fitting spandex, packed obvious silicone implants, and look like hookers masquerading as royalty. To put it mildly, it's hardly typical of Palm Beach society women. Most of the men were stereotypical greedy, perverted sleaze-balls, like pimps who won the lottery. Indeed, the film seems to say that all rich people are scum and it's fun to watch their downfall. Many of the clues seem to fall into the cops' laps, making it hard not to solve the murders. A number of the cases are obviously based on real life.<br/><br/>In spite of these many and obvious shortcomings, it's a fun show. I watched it faithfully for a few years. Much of the credit goes to Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture. As detectives Christopher Lorenzo and Rita Lance, they give a genuinely convincing portrayal of dedicated detectives and supportive partners. They truly seem to want justice and be the best of friends. And there are other compensations--the background music is chilling and the location work is well-done. Unfortunately, the producers had to ruin it by having them become lovers. After they left the show, it just wasn't very interesting. New characters were introduced, and the show sank to the level of ""Ken and Barbie play cops."" Still, the series ground on for four more years, which says much about the quality of the USA Network's programming.<br/><br/>Would I watch it again? Absolutely! To those interested, I say get the first four seasons and enjoy. You won't believe a minute of it, but you'll have a good time anyway.",17 out of 26 found this helpful.,5.0,5 April 2006

1637,Silk Stalkings, The best show ever.,"Silk Stalkings is the best show I have ever seen, it's been my favorite for 5 years now. It's about a platonic relationship between Sgt. Christopher Lorenzo(Rob Estes, now Melrose Place) and his partner Sgt. (later on Lt.) Rita Lee Lance(Mitzi Kapture, now Baywatch), that work in the Palm Beach Police Department, they work on the high society crimes of passion (Silk Stalkings). In the end Rita and Chris marry and Chris dies a short while afterwards while trying to protect Rita and their unborn child. Rita that wants to guarantee a safe life for her baby lives Palm Beach. Ok that's a short summary of the show. I think the show is so special because it was mainly about a great friendship built between Chris and Rita. In the end they did end up together, but I loved the fact that they were best friends for so long, so they had something to build the relationship on. Rob and Mitzi have such a great Chemistry and I hope they'll work together again in the future. The last thing I have to say is that if you haven't watched the show go and watch it, because you're losing the best TV show ever.

1638,Silk Stalkings, A well remembered guilty pleasure of mine a treat to view some very sexy eye candy!,"I remember growing up in the 90's as a young man I was glued to this series which was properly and rightfully called ""Silk Stalkings"". It first started on a late night trial run on ""CBS"" then it would quickly move over as a regular series at the ""USA Network"" and would run strong all thru the 90's. The key players would change hands a few times yet the first and best cop team was that of Sgt. Rita Lance(Mitzi Kapture)and Sgt. Chris Lorenzo(Rob Estes)and later I remember the attractive Janet Gunn as a cop. The series centered around the team of cops investigating murders, blackmail, scandal, white collar crime, drugs, and sex crimes involving high class escorts all of this happening with the ultra and very premium rich and well to do of Palm Beach, Florida(yet the series was mostly filmed in San Diego, California and Arizona).<br/><br/>The thing that stuck with me the most from this series was the hot sexy scenes of eye candy with hot sexy high society socialite women wearing very sexy colored bras and underwear! That was a dream come true for a young man. Most memorable episodes that featured hot actresses that sported hot sexy colored bras were ones that involved Paula Trickey, Brittney Powell, Erin Gray(of ""Buck Rogers"" fame and she's still hot!) and Debbie Dunning(of ""Home Improvement"" fame)and southern character actress Kim Morgan Greene was hot in one episode wearing a silk sexy green bra! Need I say more the series had it all it had drama and suspense with crimes of passion with the very rich and it was spiced up and treated with very sexy scenes that were eye candy treats and most episodes had plot twist. To bad that series this excellent aren't made anymore as ""Silk Stalkings"" was clearly a seduction and guilty pleasure for a viewer to watch.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,3 April 2016

While the actors are probably good and the women certainly beautiful, I get bored. This show seems to be all about showing as many beautiful women as possible, preferably in lingerie or bikini. It gets boring as the plots are nearly indistinguishable. This show also suffers from an overabundance of sex-scenes, most of which puzzle me greatly since everyone has at least underwear on. Even I know it has to come off for interesting things to happen. If I wanted to see women in their underwear I'd tune in to the Playboy channel. The plots are dull and the co-stars ought to take an acting class or two, because they are usually only taken for their looks, certainly not the ability. Also, I've noticed several actresses starring in different roles on this show as different characters, who usually end up dead. Not that that's much of a problem.<br/><br/>My greatest complaint about this show is the constant use of the colour blue. It seems weird that everything in this show has to be a nuance of the one colour from the clothes to the garishly painted police-station.

1647,Dominion, What you need to know,"I have no idea why these reviewers that are trashing this show are so hard on it. It's a really decent TV show. I did not find it overly talkative or boring.

I've enjoyed the first 3 episodes, good plot, good acting , good sets, good cgi.<br/><br/>This is definitely a show to watch if you like sci fi/fantasy Not for kids tho, definitely. I watch a show to be entertained not to take it as an attack on my religion or to learn what God is about. If they want to make angels the enemy I got no problem with that.

1649,Dominion, tentatively promising pilot.,"Dominion seems to be the successor to the 2010 film ""Legion"". <br/><br/>For those that don't remember it the plot is as follows, God abandons the Angels and they decide its mankind's fault, and thus the apocalypse is born. One angel alone amongst his brethren sides with humanity, and comes to a remote diner to protect one expecting mother whose child is prophesized to be mankind's only hope of survival.<br/><br/>Dominion is set a significant while after the invasion, where by all accounts the demonic (angelic) invasion wiped out all but a few walled off highly defensible cities holding the last of human kind (the one we see bares a strong resemblance to Fallout's New Vegas), and then became somewhat dormant.<br/><br/>The show has believable sets and effects, some interesting stylistic choices on armor and swords and city architecture. The plot isn't incredibly unique, but its not derivative enough that you will know the seasons plot after one episode. Although you likely will guess whats happening throughout the episode 30 seconds before it does happen, nothing is all that surprising. <br/><br/>Decent fight scenes, acting that's up to par, multiple sources of adversity from the Angelic threat to your own people, with one particularly self deluded villain that you will instantly not like. They highlight some social issues like caste systems and economic disparities, which might become important to the story later down the road.<br/><br/>Everything about the pilot is promising, if you're into fantasy entertainment this probably will excite you. Word of caution, only the pilot is released, and its from the Syfy network which doesn't bring its A game often (ever?). The only recently decent show from Syfy was Helix, which started out equally powerfully with no overt mistakes and a promising premise, but the more episodes of it you saw the more obvious it was that the possibilities you imagined in response to all the mysteries the show introduced were vastly superior to the illogical garbled mess the story turned into by the end of the season. I enjoyed the pilot, but if you're short on time wait for a while to see if the show maintains its quality.",113 out of 139 found this helpful.,,19 June 2014
1650,Dominion, I love it,"As far as I can see people love or hate this show. There aren't many moderate opinions in the reviews. I can see why people who are religious may be offended by the idea that angels can turn evil and try to kill people and God would just leave but you should try to relax and not take it so seriously .<br/><br/>I love this show. The actors do a decent job, I like the characters , there are many ways they can develop the plot and the special effects are not so bad (I like the wings).<br/><br/>So God disappeared , no one knows where and why, and Gabriel and many other angels blame humans for it . Gabriel thinks God was very disappointed in humans but didn't had the heart to send another flood or something to kill them so he just left so he does not have to see them anymore . They say that hell is not fire but the pain of not being in the presence of God (or something like that) so probably for the angels in this show who spent all their life in the presence of God to suddenly be alone must be hell. That can make someone go a little crazy.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the next episodes . I can't wait to see what the Whele family will do next in their quest to control the town, find out more about other towns and the tattoos . I hope we get to see Michael fight a lot in the future .<br/><br/>There is also talking about some black worshipers in town . It looks like some people worship Gabriel now as God and William Whele may be one of them.<br/><br/>If God leaving was a test many angels and humans are failing it.",76 out of 95 found this helpful.,9.0,30 June 2014

1652,Dominion, A promising followup to Legion,"First a disclaimer: I have no desire to be a movie critic, and I auto-avoid 'user' reviews made by wannabe critics who like to drop impressive words to show of their knowledge of the dictionary. So, I won't.<br/><br/>Now, here's a secondary disclaimer. I *ENJOYED* the movie 'Legion', and I had resigned myself to not getting a sequel made. A TV series? Better. Much, much better. TV gives an idea room to breathe and evolve over time.<br/><br/>This series took me by surprise, as I hadn't heard about it before. As soon as I finished watching the pilot, I immediately dug out Legion and watched that again. The series is entirely a continuation of the movie, set some years after. The plot makes sense, and the densely packed pilot served to set the scene very well. Then again, I watch for entertainment and don't go looking for errors, so your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>The set, costumes and props are all of a high standard, and there wasn't anything that caught your eye as being out of place or of poor quality. The CGI was very good, with the exception of one high-speed death scene near the beginning which flits by so fast many of you won't notice it.<br/><br/>There is a lot of implied sensuality, though (so far) nothing pornographic other than one costume. I feel they found a good balance there, without being crass for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Now, the acting. I've seen a number of shows featuring Anthony Head (David Whele), and this is his crowning achievement, I believe. In one episode, he gets you to hate him, sympathize with him, pity him... twice I flipped, from rooting against him to siding with him and back again. All this was achieved in a relatively low number of scenes. He isn't the soft touch we've become used to seeing him portray. The love interest, Claire (Roxanne McKee) has shown better abilities than Alex the lead (Christopher Egan) though I think it won't be long before he finds his place once his 'role' in the story is more firm. Casting there was an excellent choice - she even looks like her on-screen father, Alan Dale.<br/><br/>So far, after one episode, this has killed Defiance as it is truly Fantasy/SF, instead of just a Western with SF bits stapled on. Also, it's not a formulaic, monster-of-the-week or crime-of-the-week show... you'll have to follow to keep up.<br/><br/>That makes it expensive, though, and a risk for the studio.<br/><br/>Now. This is SyFy. Call me jaded, but the odds of this not getting canned after one or two seasons aren't great.",126 out of 171 found this helpful.,10.0,20 June 2014
1653,Dominion," If you like gritty, post-apocalyptic mythology with a great level of depth, this is the show for you!","25 years ago, God disappeared. That's Dominion's opening line, and the introduction to the show's mythology. Now, you may be thinking, okay, this is a show about religion and angels and Christian belief. But before you judge all too quickly, let me stop you right there. Because it's not.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Dominion is a show about humanity trying to survive in a harsh, post-apocalyptic world. Mankind is caught in the middle of an ugly war waging between the Archangel Gabriel and the Archangel Michael. What is left of society is trying to overcome the hardships they face every day in the few cordoned off enclaves that withstood the invasion of Gabriel's lower angels. And it's Michael who tries to protect them to the best of his ability, waiting for the Chosen One, the savior of mankind, to be revealed.<br/><br/>Dominion is based on the movie Legion and continues the film's mythology, jumping ahead 25 years in time. Season 1 shows us the world of Vega (the former Las Vegas), which gives a home to many of the survivors of the Extermination War. While the people in the lower castes lives a rather measly life, the royalty of the city plot their schemes and get caught up in politics. It's ugly and complicated and ultimately explosive in these unstable times.<br/><br/>And while it's the political battles that keep Vega busy, Gabriel is plotting his next strike against the humans with his surviving army of higher and lower angels. All hope is now upon the Chosen One, who goes by the name of Alex Lannon, and who is struggling to understand what role the tattoos on his body may be playing in saving the earth and mankind from further destruction.<br/><br/>As we move into season 2, the show gets darker, grittier, and more powerful. The Dominion universe is extended to other cities and towns in what's left of North America. We discover the seemingly peaceful town of Mallory, AL, which raises a lot of questions. And then there's the unruly, messy underground city of New Delphi with its eccentric leader Julian. The power play has only just begun.<br/><br/>Would I recommend Dominion as a show to watch? Yes, absolutely! Its universe draws you in and wants you to learn more about the world of Vega and the Cradle. The characters are all intriguing with a lot of depth to them. I was hooked from the very first episode, and that says a lot because I was more than skeptical when I started watching it (and only did so because it came highly recommended by a friend).<br/><br/>If you haven't given it a try yourself, I can only recommend that you do so to form your own opinion. And if you're interested in learning more about the show, drop by dominionfans.com or syfy.com/dominion, which are both excellent starting points for finding out just what exactly you're in for.",25 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,19 July 2015
1654,Dominion, Good Show,"There's nothing immediately spectacular about Dominion that has me raving about it, but its entertaining, and has some very nice cinematography. There's a well developed world, and its unique to the premise, and the visuals are no doubt inspired in part by baroque and renaissance art. Its actually quite different from Legion, though it takes place around 2 decades after the events in the movie, it explores a lot more and humanizes the villains and their motivations. I actually like dominion more than the movie because it paints the ""8 balls"" as they've come to be called, as more than monsters.<br/><br/>Basically the premise is, the archangel Gabriel led the host of lower angels in a war against humanity, basically blaming them for god leaving, just like Lucifer did millennia before, and Michael was the only angel to stand against them and defend humanity, helping to found the city of Vega and protect them from the possessed humans, who basically destroy most of the world, minus a few well protected cities. His solution isn't perfect, and what was meant to be a temporary caste system ends up in a full blown economic segregation leaving the ultra rich living in luxury, with the poor and abandoned living in squalor beneath. Over the years word has spread about a ""chosen one"" who will save mankind and end the war, with some believers, and some believing it is nothing more than a fantasy. Enter the main character, who grows up a penniless orphan, enlisting in the military just to have something to eat, who finds out he is the child they had spoken of. And then there's the higher ranks of angels who don't have black eyes, and sometimes bear wings, who up until that point hadn't been forced to pick a side.<br/><br/>There's definitely some movie clichés in there, but they play out in a way thats somewhat new and interesting, and touch on some topics that haven't been covered. One of the things that i like about this series is the main antagonist is a part of the ruling bureaucracy, and despite being your cliché diabolical politician, everyone basically sees through his bullshit already and tells him to cut the crap whenever he starts spouting off some lies or blackmail. Its a nice change of pace to see characters who aren't stupid and overly trusting. On the other hand, i wish there was a bit more skewed logic behind gabriel's assertion ""its humanities fault god left"". You'd expect a bit more from a once near omniscient being thats thousands of years old. Maybe some overly complex overthought justification, nothing near that simple and small minded. At any rate i think the directors can take some hints from the show supernatural, which at some points bears a similar premise, because they've got the angel mindset down to a science already. But its nice to see they're taking it in a different direction, and i'd be curious to see if Gabriel has any plans to release Lucifer from the pit to fight along side him. It'd certainly be in his favor.<br/><br/>All in all, its pretty good. The cinematography is probably the best part about this show, its very deep, saturated, elegant and classical. The opening titles especially reflect the theme, that this show might be something you'd see through the frame of a renaissance painting, rather than something of the modern age.",32 out of 42 found this helpful.,7.0,24 July 2014

Even if you see a ""good"" angel it has a dark lining around it.<br/><br/>The storyline is interesting and doesn't lose momentum on the go. Not once does it get boring or predictive. There are plot twists and unexpected moves. Very interesting.<br/><br/>The acting work is done pretty well.

1656,Dominion, Could be good,"Must admit I do not remember having seen the film (Legion) but it did ring a bell so I was up for a new series about, once again, saving mankind. I am a Supernatural fan and that has the same principle, bad angels, good angels, demons, God gone etc but on a more down to earth basis, and it can be really funny. This however seems to be more doomsday. It is well made, at the moment, but that can change. The main characters are OK. I am getting a bit frustrated with the same twists in plots, there seems to be so few surprises these days, you are always waiting for the traitor, the hero, who doesn't want to be a hero, and as always the love interest. If this does make it to a full season I hope the writers will at least try to surprise us. A little bit of humour would be nice too as life in what ever stage is not always deadly serious. Saw that some one mentioned all the actors are British? Not quite true but there does seem to be a a lot of Aussies staring in things these days, I'm all for it, I think they are refreshingly unpretentious, which makes their characters more believable.<br/><br/>Might have to re-vote depending on which way this goes.",52 out of 74 found this helpful.,4.0,20 June 2014

The show isn't about religion in the preaching sense, nor does it strictly follow the bible or any other doctrine. It has its own canon and own set of rules.

1660,Dominion, Marginally watchable,"A series that draws its plot from a liberal interpretation of the biblical tradition is bound to attract some attention. A big fan of the Prophecy saga with Walken in the role of Gabriel I was excited to hear about this show that would indulge my craving for bigger doses of heretic theology.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the show failed to deliver. It brings nothing new to the scene, no new ideas or concepts; it simply recycles the age old cliché of the war of good and evil and some ""chosen one"". Add a trivial love story to the mix along with some kitsch aesthetics and pompous acting and presto! You get Dominion.<br/><br/>I could have overlooked the trivial plot had the Dominion offered it in a more enticing package. Unfortunately such a thing didn't happen. The show is burdened with a slow pace, many uninteresting subplots, undeveloped characters that you'll never miss once they're gone and to top it all up, unbearable pretentious British accent for no bloody good reason!<br/><br/>I am surprised this show saw a second season when other much more interesting series get cancelled.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,5.0,14 February 2016
1661,Dominion, Dumbinion...,"So, knowing this was a spin off I went back and watched Legion before watching the pilot of this series. I then lowered my expectations (going from film to TV is always going to be a little disappointing) and sat down to watch.<br/><br/>Oh my! There is a good idea in the basic premise of the show, but good lord did they do their best to kill it.<br/><br/>For starters, it's been just twenty years or so since the destruction of civilisation at the hands of angels. Humans are clustered into small enclaves for survival. Angels are everywhere and they hate us. And so on and so forth...<br/><br/>So why, in such a short time span, did the humans feel it necessary to rename Las Vegas to just Vega? Do their scavenging parties get lost when they go outside the walls? I can imagine someone looking at a map (which they probably still use to navigate) and going ""Hmmm. Can't find Vega on the map, just this Las Vegas place. How do we get home?"" It's just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Equally ridiculous (and laugh-worthy) are the angels themselves. Having decided to ""Kill All Humans!"", they seem, for the most part, to have been turned into drooling, demonic caricatures of themselves. There is little frightening about watching such a black-eyed, soulless demon murdering innocents on TV. How about if they'd actually retained the angels more traditional image of a shining paragon of good, radiating power? Wouldn't that have had more impact than some frothing, drooling thing? Okay, back to the twenty years have passed thing...<br/><br/>The survivors seem, in this limited time frame, to have reverted to a form of upper and lower caste system mish-mashed together with a healthy dose of ancient Rome. It's a pitiful attempt at showing a dystopian society that just makes you shake your head all the time they spam it in your face.<br/><br/>And just who was it that decided that all such societies have to have manipulating, power-hungry people in them that serve their own ends rather than the people they supposedly protect? It just shrieks of lazy writing. Save me from writers that think political intrigue is required in every show. Just cause Game of Thrones has it doesn't mean you need it in everything.<br/><br/>So, the pilot plods along pedestrianly for the most part, introducing us to the cast and the setting but doing little to keep your interest. The characters are uniformly bland and uninteresting and it is difficult to like any of them, except maybe for the ""Newt"" analogue.<br/><br/>Towards the end, our hero receives the gift of magic tattoos that will reveal to him how to save humanity from the evil angel scourge. Except, going on the strength of the first bit that he deciphers I suspect the tattoos are going to be a Macguffin designed to further the plot whenever needed by telling the hero where to go and what to do. Either that or he's just gotten himself a full body Magic Eight Ball to dispense pearls of needless wisdom such as the ""Beware those closest to you"" as happened at the end here. Sheesh!<br/><br/>I had hopes for this show after re-watching Legion, but this is just dire. It's going to bog down in political machination and not go anywhere fast. It will be interminable. Expect nothing much to happen all season. If I were writing it there'd at least be a season's end payoff - maybe a Pompeii-like destruction of Vega and the survivors left having to fend for themselves in the ""outdoors"" in the last episode. Something worth watching all the dreary in-between episodes that we are sure to get. But I doubt that will happen.<br/><br/>EDIT: So I forced myself to watch episodes two and three. Briefly, we are allowed to leave the drearily-envisioned Vega, but only so that the hero can be forced to return there. Oh God! It's so tedious and obvious! Three episodes, I'm afraid, is my limit, which makes it even less watchable than Helix, in my book.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Tries hard not to be a formula show, but fails very quickly. A nice idea, maybe, but hampered by dire-logue and stupidity, it is sure to have a short run.",39 out of 72 found this helpful.,4.0,26 June 2014
1662,Dominion, Best new show this season.,"I heard about this show because of a random review on io9. It's great, a worth successor to the movie 'Legion'. As a television series it plays very well to the plot introduced in the movie. So much so that I went back and watched Legion again just to catch any details I may have missed the first time through, and even just to appreciate the attention to detail they have put in to this new series. Be warned if you do go back and watch the movie, there will be some give-a ways. The depth is there, and the continuation of the plot line from the movie is rewarding and engaging. Fingers crossed that the writing, production, everything keeps getting better and better.",24 out of 42 found this helpful.,8.0,9 July 2014
1663,Dominion, Couldn't Sit through it,"I enjoy shows like doctor who, stargate, farscape, and outer limits. These were great shows with wonderful writing, acting, and stories that would unfold and eventually reveal a depth that connects everything. At the core of these shows was something important, a story that made you think and feel connected after watching it.<br/><br/>The motion picture was fine, it wasn't anything I would make a series about but it was interesting and held my attention. The first 5 minutes of the spin off Dominion was painful. The inconsistencies consist of a large demonic woman jumping at least 20 feet high and running sideways across wall but she couldn't quite catch a guy on foot or do anything once he got in a car.<br/><br/>I was hoping the style would shift, or acting would get better or maybe the story would reveal itself but the series seems to be relying on its ties to the motion picture to hook the audience rather than putting any effort into creating something enjoyable for science fictions fans. I kept thinking of random things to look up online as that was more interesting then what I was seeing on screen.",35 out of 66 found this helpful.,1.0,21 June 2014
1664,Dominion, Asinine (/ˈasəˌnīn/ - extremely stupid or foolish),"I would just say ""this is just plain dumb"" but that wouldn't fill my quota. So here are the TOP 10 ASININITIES (yes I made up that word) about this show, in order of least to greatest:<br/><br/>10. The ""Chosen One's"" dad gets absolutely no chance to reveal any sort of depth. Maybe keep the dude around for just a bit before killing him off with a butter knife (see #9 and #4).<br/><br/>9. Even if you worship trees, the very nature of an angel turned evil makes it a demon (in most religious and folklore ramblings). So wouldn't Gabriel and his vast minions be considered demons and not angels? But hey, perhaps I'm too hung up on semantics.<br/><br/>8. They made Gabriel seem extremely wicked, to the point of laughing demonically while sitting on a dark throne. I'm sorry, but making him seem like Satan just doesn't go with the premise. He wants humans wiped out, but to make his character maniacal adds a completely different layer not explained at ALL in the opening narrative (nor anywhere else in the episode).<br/><br/>7. They call the city ""Vega"" when it was Las Vegas before. Even in ruins, people don't just rename cities. It's not like it's been centuries. They'd still call the blasted place Las Vegas, or at least Vegas. It was probably 3am one morning when the writers giggled together, peed themselves a bit and said, ""hey, let's drop the 's' off of 'Vegas' to make the city sound cool."" Sigh.<br/><br/>6. This show does the absolutely lame thing that so many are doing lately: mixing in archaic ""tech"" with modern tech. They have a flippin' nuclear reactor powering the city (that can withstand massive explosions without leaking) and some sort of presidential bunker, yet they have piddly machine guns to try to ward off flying angels. Heck, if 3 angels can do all that damage, this show is over by the end of episode 2.<br/><br/>5. They're in the bunker with craziness all around, and yet some nice maid somewhere has put out some tasty cheese and crackers. Which of course is necessary because the writers said, ""Hey, we need to kill someone with a butter knife"" and then, ""Gee, how in sam hill are we gonna get a butter knife into the shot?""<br/><br/>4. The writers made it very clear that having children was extremely important, to the point of having a city filled with ""child-bearing"" girls as an important part of the plot. At one point the Happy Chosen One is angry with his father for leaving him an orphan, because they don't get food or a place to sleep. And YET, orphans (which last time I checked were CHILDREN) are somehow relegated to the lowest ""caste"" in this sudden new ""system"" of who is more important than whom. So if having children is so (absent)god-durned important, why the heck would they be Untouchables?<br/><br/>3. God and Satan have somehow ceased to exist, and now there are just a bunch of Wicked- Angels-Formerly-Known-As-Good flyin' all over the place trying to kill humans. It's like the writers said, ""Gee, we better get rid of God, or else this show could end as soon as He merely speaks."" And then, ""Uh, but what about Satan? Wouldn't he win if God is gone?"" And then, ""Um, yeah, so maybe we better just not mention Satan at all...""<br/><br/>2. Somehow Michael knows these tattoos are supposed to lead mankind to victory, yet he says not even he knows what they say. So, if there is no God, no Satan, just a bunch of angels (see #3 above), then how the heck does he know these tattoos mean squat? No one can read them, and yet peeps can transfer them all over each other like bad Copperfield and SOMEHOW they hold the key to EVERYTHING! Redrum! <br/><br/>1. The writers felt compelled to show a man's butt in the shower scene so they could be ""current"" (read: PC). Next thing you know they'll make sure no side wins (angels or man) because winning and losing hurts people's feelings and isn't fair. Then again, this entire show hurts and isn't fair to subject anyone to (PC or not).",68 out of 139 found this helpful.,2.0,20 June 2014
1665,Dominion, This Was AWFUL!,"The story could have been great. The acting saw that this did not happen. How I sat through the whole episode is beyond me. Anthony Head was clearly phoning it in with an atrocious American accent. Even Buffy would have staked him for that dead performance. The pilot itself made things way more complicated than they had to be. Castes, arranged marriages, resentful offspring and clandestine angel spies. What the hell were you guys thinking? And now...angels without bodies who can possess humans and wreak havoc that way. Sounds a lot like demons in Gabriel's control. So, wait...he's the new Lucifer? Argh. The whole damned thing made my head hurt. Jeep dies, although you barely recognize the character from Legion. Giles is a dick and the Savior is a love struck school boy, who happens to be in the Army. In Las Vegas. With tattoos that send him messages only HE can read.

1666,Dominion, Awful,"*** May contain spoilers *** This seems like a rush job. Poorly developed characters and a host of shells (characters that are more of a ""type"" that they are individuals). It was dreadful. Not only was the half-hearted acting average at best, but the plot just went along showing us the stereotypical hero who was wronged as a child and doesn't want the power that has now been bestowed upon him.<br/><br/>Vega? Seriously? It's been about 20 years! Are you kidding me? The buildings are still standing so the name, Las Vegas, is probably still printed everywhere! Why would people cut it to Vega? It would, at least, be Vegas.<br/><br/>Also, if three angels could seriously damage the city, why haven't they just attacked already. The premise is that they want to destroy mankind. Gabriel and the others are slavering at the mouth for the opportunity. Well, it looks like they could probably do it. It also looks like they haven't done it because the writers don't want them to.<br/><br/>Michael, the tortured soul. I'm not even sure where to begin with this. The enigmatic fallen angel who is tortured by his desires, etc. Stoic with a caring heart - another stereotype, this time it's the tortured caretaker.<br/><br/>The ""evil"" angels are also silly, not scary. Angels are thought of as pure and Satan is said to be beautiful (according to the Bible), so what's up with the black eyes, cackling, and grotesque nonsense. Yes, only the ""higher"" angels can retain their own forms; however, all of the unnecessary effects added to ""scare"" the viewers were a miss. Speaking of Satan, where the hell is he? If God isn't around to stop him, wouldn't he be running amok? Instead, no God and no Satan. Just a ""evil"" laughing Gabriel sitting on his version of the Iron Throne trying to destroy ""Vega."" This could have been a great series and they really missed with this one. I am very disappointed.",27 out of 52 found this helpful.,2.0,2 July 2014
1667,Dominion, Much much better than expected,"I've just watched episode 4 and can't wait for the next. The first thing I saw about this show was the cheesy cover art with the roman armored angel standing over this guy who is dressed like a 80s cop and I thought ""meh"". After a while I came across the page again and saw that Anthony Head is in it so I watched the trailer. This is when I started to like what I saw. The effects are pretty good for TV standards (it's not as well made as something like Game of Thrones but I guess that's more of an exception) and the setting is rather dark and grim.<br/><br/>Seeing ""older"" actors like Anthony Head or Alan Dale taking a big part in a series is refreshing. Most of the times they just have a supporting role and the rest is done by the generic pretty faces. If you think a series about angels gone bad sounds interesting you should definitely give this one a try. Now to the parts I didn't like. Yes, they renamed the city ""Vega"" which isn't that believable after just 20 years of war but I think this is something most people should be able to live with. This is after all a fantasy show and it's packed with ancient Greece themed stuff like Helena or the whole political structure of those cities so people should bare in mind that although the show seems to take place in modern day USA it's still fantasy based and not everything has to be exactly the same as we know it.",11 out of 18 found this helpful.,7.0,14 July 2014
1668,Dominion," *YAWN* Wait, was there supposed to be a plot here?","I saw the movie ""Legion"" that Dominion is supposed to be based on. This horrible spin off series does it no justice. The characters are one dimensional, poorly conceptualized, and just plain idiotic. If these were the remaining warriors that survived an angelic apocalypse, driving off a hoard of raving psychotic angels hell bent on their destruction, then how did they get so stupid and careless in just 25 years?<br/><br/>I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to justify Dominion's premise or plot (if there actually is one). Michael the archangel just broods a lot and flaps his wings every now and then; Gabriel, the I'm-so-evil-I-wring- my-hands-together, is just simply not believable as a super villain. I mean COME ON - He has a freaking ARMY of angels, and he hasn't already destroyed a piddly little run down Las Vegas? Population what- maybe 5000? And why, because Michael the archangel might flap his wings and brood at them? Nooooope, sorry, I don't buy it. Especially when in the MOVIE, the freaking ARMY of angels tore through civilization like hell on wings! How in the world did this society manage to grow and thrive without getting demolished, especially considering how absolutely moronic their actions are throughout the entire season premiere? <br/><br/>The premise is thin, and asks too much of the viewer. Dominion requires that you forget everything you have ever thought you would do if the world came to an apocalyptic style end, and instead replace it with their version of reality. Don't turn into a warrior, don't seek like minded individuals and band together, and certainly don't think for yourself. Just join an oppressive regime that starves its citizens and took style tips from old Dune re-runs. While you're at it, also don't bother to protect yourself from FLYING ANGELS, because building so much as a simple aviary out of barbed wire over your city would be stupid. I mean, it's not like FLYING ANGELS could EVER, you know, fly into your city. Ever. Put up a couple turrets ala Mad Max, clap your hands together, and call it a day. Because angels can never breach such fool proof measures. Ever.<br/><br/>Just one last diatribe before I stop ranting. Dominion had such great promise. The end of the world at the hands of angels has such awesome connotations. But for the love of everything holy, at least make your angels halfway competent and believable. And make your cast worthy of being cared about by the viewer. Because halfway through the premiere, I was seriously rooting for Gabriel to wipe out the entire cast out of sheer boredom. Oh, and to put an end to trying to force myself to believe any of those people could have ever survived an assault by a pack a rabid squirrels, nevertheless an angelic invasion.",36 out of 74 found this helpful.,1.0,20 June 2014
1669,Dominion, Post-apocalyptic mayhem meets The Birds,"A nice twist on the ever-so-tedious end of days story. Of course the catch here is that it helps if you buy into Christian mythology. So ... we have the good angels and the not so good angels. Naturally, we gotta have the good mortals and the not so good mortals....<br/><br/>Okay --that's as far as I've gotten with this review.
I've been attempting to watch this show that promises to be very entertaining (I'm a sucker for uber sexy men with wings), but the streaming service, IMDb-Tv has this incredibly nasty, obscene if you will, habit of interrupting the program EVERY FOUR TO SEVEN MINUTES for commercial breaks! Sweet jeezus on a boogie board! Commercial television doesn't even go that far.

1670,Dominion, I'm even surprised this show got 3 stars,"You know, i stopped watching SyFy many years ago. I love anything unexplainable, creatures and scientific mysteries so naturally Syfy drew me in but after a while the terrible use of CGI (computer generated images) terrible plot and story telling with undeveloped characters and bad acting ultimately drove me away. Well let me be the first to tell you if Dominion wanted to be indicative of the makeup and fabric of Syfy they accomplished it. Here's the top 5 blemishes from bad to worst that made this show an epic fail. There's more but i wanted to keep it limited to 5.<br/><br/>5) After the first episode it wasn't quite what i thought. I was expecting the picture to have the look and feel of Greek/roman storytelling. Like Game of Thrones. The picture just looked cheap. Something just kept throwing me off, i couldn't keep my eyes fixated onto the screen enough to be engulfed in the story telling. Maybe part of it was the movement and positioning of the camera in some scenes.<br/><br/>4.) Clichés and more of them! Nothing destroys a good story like clichés. Alex is upset that he was abandoned and doesn't want the responsibility of the chosen one. People that are on the brink (main characters) manage to someone get saved at the last minute. Shock us! Kill off someone we didn't expect, pull a Game of Thrones!<br/><br/>3.) Acting is sub-par to terrible! Smh<br/><br/>2.) The shoot set up was terrible!! Every time they show buildings for example the one representing Vega supposedly, looked like a cardboard model they built, the market square looked staged and fake, ughh it was awful.<br/><br/>1.) I don't know why this irked me more than anything, maybe i've just developed a clinical sense to pay attention to the obvious and not the big picture but when the higher angels, like Michael for example constrict their wings where does it go? Does it magically retreat back into their backs?? If so fine..i can rock with that but wouldn't there be an opening either created by design or a sheer tear and rip left in the wake of their explosive wings expanding out of their back on the back of their clothes??

Most other user reviews have been glowing but there are a couple of one star reviews, please ignore these as they have been written by ""would be"" film critics using big words in an attempt to show off.

1672,The Next Step, It's OK,"Interesting concept and style. Acting isn't the greatest but most of the actors are pretty young and are most likely working on their first network show. With a little work it could be a pretty decent series. I'm from Canada and I know how much slack we get for our TV shows,but without the proper funds and expensive scenery that the other American Disney shows have this show does well with what it has. I'm guessing for most of them dancing came before acting which is why they may be a little underdeveloped in that area.

But as every season goes by the show constantly changes, it has lost it's mockumentary style, it focuses on Jiley ALOTT, the story lines are getting repetitive (too much love triangles),a lot of new cast members are introduced but leave the following season, new characters aren't engaging nor is the drama and too much boring fillers.

1686,The Next Step, I love it!!,"This show gets way too much hate. When it first started out of course, like any show, it wasn't at its best as most of the actors had this as their first role on a show, but it was still entertaining. As the series progressed, the acting improved, the dancing improved, the dialogue improved, everything improved. There has also been an amazing amount of character development across the current four season, and this show must be good as it's getting a fifth season, along with going on their third world tour. The current dancers are amazing and all of them have won dance awards outside of the show throughout their career's, and to the few who complain about the dancing... IT'S FOR THE SHOW! you see characters improve throughout the season so when they first start their character won't be able to do everything the actor does so development can take place. And it is a show made for kids and they are always engrossed in it, not to mention the diversity of dancers, showing the watcher that there is not just one ""right"" way to dance and to have fun with it. The trick is to not take this show to seriously and just enjoy it!It's also something that can surprisingly engage all ages, as a 15 year old myself, even i enjoy the show and all the fun that comes with it!!",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,18 March 2017

1688,The Next Step, The Show is SAD,"My chief complaint is what the subject matter is teaching children, or the age bracket this is supposed to attract. Blackmail, lying, cheating, arguments, sneaky underhanded actions are rewarded. Bullying and mean girls are cool and the adults are oblivious! Love is falling for one person, and 5 minutes later you are in love with another. What young man is going to have a dance off with the prize for the winner being the a fore boys girlfriend. Seriously, are girls tokens or a prize that can be won? That is demeaning and derogatory. Where are the adults when all of this bickering and back biting is going on, to include their parents? That being sneaky and underhanded gets you ahead. Who is choreographing the routines? The adults in this are portrayed as sitting in their office and once in a blue moon coming out to see what is going on. Now you have a girl who is the captain of Elite Studio pretending to be a member of Next Step studio. Sneaking to another studio to record the competitions routines. The kids having injuries but not consulting the adults. Kids in life circumstances making horrible decisions and not seeking advice from anyone who may have a clue. Thankfully my children and grand children have always felt comfortable enough to talk to me about anything and everything. I could go on with my complaints but I think you get what I am trying to say. Improve the acting, dialog, and the subject matter of the show. Kids are not stupid but impressionable. The advice you are giving in many situations is bad advice.

1689,The Next Step, The Next Misstep,"You know, I am a guy who likes movies and television, because they can make you feel something that you may not feel in the first place, and because of that the Next Step is a big pile of garbage.<br/><br/>I have some major issues and some minor issues, let me present them to you.<br/><br/>Major issue no. 1: the show is unintelligent. The most recurring thing in the series is a cut to one of the actors sitting in a chair talking about the thing they just experienced (just like in reality shows), that idea could work, but it doesn't. The way it is used is the cheapest way of explaining the specific character's motivation I have ever seen, for example if an evil girl wants a good girl to break up with a guy (for unspecific reasons for the most part) it will cut to the evil girl sitting in a chair saying that the other girl must break up with the guy because of something, then it cuts to the evil girl saying to the other girl to break up, then it cuts to the good girl saying that she is really shocked and so on. The point is, that if this had been in some quality entertainment, her thoughts and actions would have been implied, so that the viewer could figure it out for themselves. <br/><br/>This is also seen in the way we get to know that the characters have secrets, because if this is supposed to be a show, the other ones, who don't know of the secret, will know the secret because they see it explained. Stupid. they also spontaneously change their clothes as it cuts from the scene to the actor sitting in the chair.<br/><br/>What further proves the stupidity of the show is the constant stream of drama and conflicts that seem to pop up everywhere, it's so unrealistic! you must assume that the adults in charge of this wild horde of teens could do something to stop it, but no, no no no, they do nothing.<br/><br/>Major issue no. 2: the dancing, acting and characters. The show is about dancing, so it should have some good dancing right? No. the dancing is fine, but the problem is the style. The main team consists of hip hop dancers, break dancers, freestyle dancers, ballet dancers etc. how the heck do you make a choreography that suits everybody? It would make more sense to have a team who danced the same kind of dancing.<br/><br/>The acting is of course terrible, but with this kind of show it is expected. They overreact to every single thing, and it gets annoying very fast.<br/><br/>The characters are plain and boring, you don't fell sorry for any of them at all, with the exception of two characters, Chloe and Emily. Their stories stand out and kinda makes you root and feel sad for them, and they are the reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 star.<br/><br/>Major Issue 3: the story. In the first season they win the regionals, which means they are the best studio in their region. End of show, but no. They continue and get to the nationals, where they win again. OK fine, end the show, NO! in the third season they go to the internationals, where they win. Sigh. announcing season 4: this time, we go to the galactic finals, where we win!<br/><br/>I have some more minor issues, but the biggest one is the use of songs, they use the same song over and over and over again, that is just annoying.",5 out of 11 found this helpful.,2.0,14 May 2016
1690,The Next Step, My view on The Next Step,I am a 15 year old girl who lives in the United Kingdom and I myself have never watched any dance programs but I think that this is a great show that encourages people to dance no matter what style or how you look. This show is great for teenagers who are looking into dance as a future passion of theirs. This show has helped me to build up my confidence even though I have only seen a few episodes at the moment and have encouraged me to keep dancing. Also the show is giving me a understanding of contemporary because in a few weeks time I have my GCSE Dance Exam and I have to come up with two contemporary dance and ever since I started watching the show I can take into consideration that no matter what you look like people are not judging the way look but the way you dance as a person.,5 out of 11 found this helpful.,5.0,14 April 2014
1691,The Next Step," Ebola is deadly, this show's writing is deadlier","Armpits stink. Pigs stink. Corpses stink. Sewers stink. Poop stinks. This show stinks even more. Normally, you'd expect a school play to have the worst acting possible but alas, this show exists. Watch Sharknado and then watch a few episodes of this, the Sharknado cast will seem a lot more talented in comparison. None of the cast show any range or believably portray their individual, one-dimensional characters who display the emotional maturity of a two year old with anger management issues.<br/><br/>This show is extremely boring and repetitive - each episode normally has the same routine (no pun intended); badly choreographed dancing, terrible dialog, underwritten and pointless relationship drama, badly choreographed dancing, end. Nothing ever happens on this show and that makes it boring.<br/><br/>The characters are well and beyond shallow and as such, you can't give a damn about any of their exploits, including their hopelessly dysfunctional relationships. The adults on the show are beyond irresponsible, never noticing the troupe threatening conflicts on the show and it doesn't help that they're generally just negligent.<br/><br/>You wanna know something else about this show's conflicts? They're more contrived than creationism. Random characters turn up, random characters conspire against each other. In the second season, there's endless talk about ""nationals"" and ""the challenge"". Neither of these things cause tension and they just become annoying after a while - Every other line of dialog is ""Nationals, nationals, nationals"". If you used CTRL+F to find every use of ""nationals"" and ""the challenge"" in the show's scripts, you end up with a show that's about fifteen minutes long and fifteen minutes TOO long.<br/><br/>In summary, this show lacks in character development and compelling story lines, replacing both of those with terrible dance choreography and terrible relationship drama which makes the relationship drama in Godzilla (2014) seem realistic in comparison.

Whilst I am a fan of both, when I saw Black Books, I loved it!

Thanks to Comedy Central for airing the first series of this show (and the second coming up in August), for I would probably have never seen it if they had not.  Most British sitcoms (Britcoms?) I've seen have been funny, but I usually forget about them rather quick (probably due to the cultural differences) but Black Books stuck with me so much that I was forced to buy a bootleg VHS of the first series. Luckily, the tapes included the outtakes and running commentary for each episode on a separate tape so I wouldn't have to buy a region-free DVD player to see them (which I probably would have done!).

So when I knew about this series, I just had to see it. Now that I have seen it, there is only one thing I can say about it: Black books is absolutely great and hilarious. It proves that the UK is still the best breeding ground for humoristic series. <br/><br/>Bernard Black - an anti-social, boozing and smoking sarcastic pessimist - runs his own book store. He doesn't like people who buy books and hates his customers. He has one employee: Manny. Manny looks more like a bum, never stands up for himself when he is the target of Bernard's sarcasm and is always full of stress. Next door to Bernard's shop is the Nifty Gifty gift shop run by Fran, probably the only friend Bernard has.<br/><br/>The humor is perhaps not to everybody's taste.

1701,Black Books," ""Leave town with an orange and pretend you're laughing at it""","It's a crime in my opinion that each season is only six episodes long. Then again I suppose I'm used to American sitcoms and their 'spew out 22 episodes and they'll lap it up' method. Limiting it to just six episodes makes the comedy concentrated and instead of having a few good moments in an episode, the whole episode is memorable.<br/><br/>In real life Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) the owner of his own book shop would be horrible. He'd be hated the world over, but in this natty little sitcom he's thigh-slapping hilarious. Most of the time Manny (Bill Bailey) doesn't need to say anything, his facial expressions are enough to have you rolling on the floor with tears of laughter. I once saw Bill Bailey doing stand up and thought he was great so I'm pleased to see him in something like this. Fran (Tamsin Grieg) is almost the straight man of the group. She's not as cranky as Bernard and she's not as out there as Manny, she's a nice blend. The episode in which she did yoga and declared she was 'so relaxed you could pour me into a bowl' was a definite highlight.<br/><br/>As a reviewer said before - the more you watch it the funnier it gets!

Next door to Bernard's shop is the Nifty Gifty gift shop run by Fran, probably Bernard's only friend in the world.  When Bernard's accountant goes on the run Bernard employs stress victim, Manny to help in his shop.  This leads to a series of surreal adventures around the shop.<br/><br/>This series (soon to return for a second series!) was poorly promoted by channel 4 (usually so good at getting great little comedies recognised - Spaced, Father Ted etc), and didn't get seen by anywhere near the audience it deserved.  The storylines are always pretty wild - Manny absorbing the Little Book of Calm into his system in the first show - and never set in reality, ever.  However they are never stupid because they are so wildly funny!  The surreal adventures of Bernard and Manny are excellent - full of movie references, full of great dialogue and surreal action.  As a sitcom it just sparkles with ideas, energy and imagination - for the first showing Ch 4 had it following Friends and it totally showed Friends up to be mass-produced, thoughtless entertainment.  Sure, BB doesn't have the gloss of Friends and can feel a bit rough round the edges but you can't beat the fact that it feels fresh and new compared to all that gloss.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Bernard and Manny is great - even if their dialogue is mad at times.  Bill Bailey is very funny doing stand-up and here he is really suited to Manny.  Moran as Bernard is also great as the abusive drunk Irishman and is just so manically funny - not manic like Phoebe in Friends but manic like Jack in Father Ted.  Tamsin Greig is also good as Fran, despite being a smaller character.<br/><br/>Overall this is a flagship for all that is good about channel 4 comedies - British, clever, imaginative, daring and very funny.

1707,Black Books, You can find work and sort out your life at any time. The pub closes in five hours,"SPOILERS We've all been there. Some dank and gloomy book shop in the outskirts of London with an owner you can describe as ""that miserable Irish b**tard"". Obviously so has comedian Dylan Moran. An award winning comedian, Moran made his television debut in 1999's ""How Do You Want Me?"", but it would be this hilarious series in 2000 which would get him the most attention. At three series and 18 episodes long, ""Black Books"" is often hilarious. Dropping in standard slightly during it's second series, the show will be remembered for some killer lines in it's first and final runs. Welcome, to ""Black Books"".<br/><br/>Manny Bianco (Bill Bailey) is a kind hearted accountant with a stress problem. After accidentally swallowing 'The Little Book of Calm', Manny wanders aimlessly into a London book shop. Meeting eccentric, miserable Bernard L Black (Moran), Manny begins a new and infinitely more torturous life. Teaming up with Bernard's old friend Fran Katzenjammer (Tamsin Greig), the two spend their days hanging around the shop, getting drunk and above all else, trying not to sell books.<br/><br/>From the first moments of the opening episode through to the last moment of season three, nothing prepares you for the wit and visual humour of this series. Often ridiculing the types of people you see on the street, Moran's series has always thrived on it's dark character.<br/><br/>Led by a brilliant performance by Moran himself, the series is well stocked with performances by British televisions finest sitcom comedians. Graham Linehan, Simon Pegg, Martin Freeman, David Walliams and Kevin Eldon, all wonderful comedians in their own rights, all make cameo appearances throughout the series. Ultimately though, we watch it to see how Manny will suffer next and how Bernand will respond to a perfectly harmless comment. Bernard L Black is an anti-hero of the finest calibre.<br/><br/>The series is self contained as well. A fan of ""Fawlty Towers"", Dylan Moran has suggested that the series would follow that route and finish on a high. So with no more episodes after the known 18, it's possible to examine ""Black Books"" as a completed article.<br/><br/>Every comedy series does have it's low points, and sadly ""Black Books"" is no exception. Just like the later series of ""Red Dwarf"" or the final few years of ""Allo Allo"", this wonderful comedy dropped a bit in it's standards during it's middle season. With a group of episodes that, while occasionally funny, were mostly badly thought out, the second series is a permanent blip on this masterful series.<br/><br/>Luckily for fans however, unlike those series which do get increasingly worse after a cut off point, Moran released a third series of ""Black Books"" which was admittedly different in tone to it's predecessors, but which is rejuvenated and fresh. Beginning with a masterful episode called ""Manny Come Home"", series three gets off to a brilliant start and rides the waves to an equally hilarious conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Black Books"" is mostly hilarious. With plots which dipped during the second series, it still managed to keep the humour throughout. This is mostly due to a masterful performance by Dylan Moran as the miserable and alcoholic Bernard L Black. Supported by excellent performances by Bill Bailey and Tamsin Greig, Moran thrives in the dank and dirty world of ""Black Books"". Whether this series will last as long as other classic British comedy remains unknown, but for now it's absolutely wonderful.",11 out of 12 found this helpful.,,4 May 2005

I love father Ted, i Love Monty Python, Are you being served, Black Adder, all the classic britcoms, but this one is by far the best. The Brits make the best TV in the world and this is, in my opinion, their penultimate achievement. The cast is perfect and work incredibly well together, their chemistry and timing is impeccable. the sets, while limited are so perfectly lit and dressed you almost feel like you're in the shop. And, of course, the writing is genius, i cant think of a better way of putting i (not being a writer myself of course), its just genius. I am continuously amazed at how the British can make hilarious and entertaining television on a limited budget with a very small cast and a single set (maybe two), compared to American sitcoms that have huge budgets, ridiculous casts, expansive sets, and still manage to be barely giggle worthy. If you don't like the dry British humor then don't bother, but if you're what I like call ""inteligent and worth talking to"" then you will love this show, and be doing yourself a great disservice by not checking it out.

Then there is his assistant Manny who will do what ever Bernard says. Lastly there is Fran who is always drinking wine and trying to find a relationship.<br/><br/>These 3 characters all compliment each other well and provide the audience with plenty of laughs. Some of the stuff they go through is hilarious as well as something that most can relate to. I would say it's a mix between Bottom and The IT Crowd.<br/><br/>The 1st and 2nd series where extremely funny and it felt like it was a laugh a minute. The 3rd series was also very good apart from 1 or 2 episodes which didn't quite hit the spot for the entire episode. One of my favourite scenes is Manny making toast in the bath!

I finally bit the bullet and pre-ordered the 3-disc set that JUST came out. I got it in the mail last night and proceeded to watch the whole first season plus the first episode of season 2. With the weak US dollar, 28.5 GBP was a bit steep, but worth it now that I have the DVDs. I was worried after not seeing the show for so long that I had built up the show too much, but I was relieved as soon as I was laughing hysterically at the antics on the show. Absolutely hilarious show and the 3-disc Black Books DVD set is an awesome addition to my DVD collection. HIGHLY recommended.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,,8 October 2004
1714,Black Books, I laughed so hard I missed bits!,"I was introduced to Black Books by my father-in-law who knew I liked Bill Bailey. I watched the whole first series in one sitting and ordered the DVD this morning!<br/><br/>This is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time, and, in my opinion, ranks alongside Spaced. The humour is brilliantly surreal, the first episode featuring Bernard picking a fight with a group of skinheads to avoid filling out his tax returns ""Which one of you bitches wants to dance?"", and Manny accidentally swallowing and absorbing ""The Little Book of Calm"". This leaves him wandering the streets in a peaced-out fugue, wearing a hospital gown and sandals.<br/><br/>It's only a shame I missed the first two series when they were broadcast, as the third series is about to start and I've not seen the second.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,,10 March 2004
1715,Black Books," An odd, yet amazingly hilarious, comedy show","STORY<br/><br/>The storyline found within Black Books is fairly straight forward, following the lives of three characters: Bernard Black, an alcoholic, short-tempered bookstore owner (the bookshop in question being the show's title, Black Books), Manny, his employee/slave and Fran, a friend of Bernard's that regularly hangs out with them. The show follows of life of Bernard's book-shop, with the series almost exclusively set within or around the bookshop. The various plots revolve around the idea that Bernard is, for all intents and purposes, a cranky alcoholic bastard that treats his only employee, Manny, terribly and expects him to wait on him hand and foot. The group go through life trying to be cool and trying to succeed and this leads to quite a few funny situations. <br/><br/>ACTING<br/><br/>The acting is just superb, in fact after watching this it would be difficult to see Dylan Moran (who plays Bernard) in any other role than a cranky, alcoholic bookshop owner. Bill Bailey's portrayal of Manny is equally amazing, with neither actor breaking character for even a second. The third key character (and, indeed, the only time another character is ever seen they are around for one episode and vanish, giving the whole show the entire focus on just the key characters), that of Fran, is equally played well, though the character herself is not quite as interesting, as such she often comes off as somewhat of a less significant character than the two men. <br/><br/>HUMOUR<br/><br/>The humour found within Black Books is, at times, very odd. In fact, unless you can laugh at the mistreatment of a character to the extent of Manny's suffering or find the constant and never-ending failure of their lives entertaining then you may not find much to laugh about in this show. The main focus on the humour is rather downtrodden, there is rarely any success of joy found in the show and even when there it is inevitably leads to even greater failure. However this is also compelling and actually makes for great comedy, despite how absolutely dull it may seem. <br/><br/>OVERALL<br/><br/>If you are somewhat on the fence about this show then I'd highly suggest watching an episode or two, regardless of in which order as nothing really progresses in an overall sense. The humour can be rather bizarre at times and the overall feeling is that life is depressing, but it somehow combines to make an almost charming comedy about a grumpy bookshop owner and a lively, eager assistant. There is never a moment that feels forced and even when the humour doesn't work it still adds something. I highly recommend this, there is almost no reason not to at least give it a try!<br/><br/>RATING: 9/10- An almost must watch for fans of British comedy.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,21 July 2013

1717,Black Books, Just brilliant. Hilarious. Buy it on DVD now.,"This is so bloody good. I was first introduced to it by my older cousin and I now have every series. I'm only 13 so I didn't watch it on Channel 4. It is the best comedy I have ever seen. In my school drama group we did the first episode (Cooking the Books) and I played Bernard so I can quote that whole episode (or Bernards lines at least). Anyway, the characters in this are great.<br/><br/>There's Bernard Black, the owner of a small bookshop in London, a grumpy irish man who loves to drink, smoke and complain about life. He hates customers and his only contact with the world outside is his best friend, Fran Katzenjammer who owns Nifty Gifty, the shop next door (at least, for the first series). Finally there is Manny, Bernards accountant/assistant. He cooks, cleans and does about everything else for Bernard. He is usually happy but is sometimes quite immature (cutting his toast into soldiers and putting them into rank!).<br/><br/>Black Books, aired on Channel 4 (as far as I know) in 2000, followed their hilarious, drunken and stupid adventures in and outside Bernard'd shop.

1720,Black Books, 2nd series slow to get going.,"It was welcome to see the return of Black Books. At least the second series got a little bit more hype (due to the BAFTA win). However it's been a little slow to get back on its feet. The first thing of note is that Graham Linehan is no longer writing, Dylan Moran taking the whole task on his own which I think may have contributed to the slowness of pace of the beginning of series 2 as he had to get upto speed on all the characters. But after saying all that, when the 2nd series did hit its stride it did so very well. 'Blood' is THE episode of series 2. I'm not saying that the earlier episodes in the series were without their good points- Manny in the piano with the spoons, the comfy sofa ""consuming"" a child and what is 'Dave's Syndrome'???<br/><br/>Further good news, series 1 is now out on DVD and video and also a third series has been green-lighted.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,9 April 2002
1721,Black Books, Definately Tedist (with added Withnail),"Watching the Channel4 re-run at the moment. (Aparently there is another series on the way but for a series thats won a BAFTA the lack of pubilicity is amazing)<br/><br/>The most immediate thing fans of Father Ted will appreciate is the casting and the direction. Its a sign of perfect comic timing and performances when you've seen the same scene over and over and it just gets funnier.<br/><br/>The other thing will be the idiotic surrealism - for instance Manny in episode one swallowing and absorbing The Little Book of Calm. Completely stupid in a recognisably Craggy Island fashion.<br/><br/>I'm not one to say Black Books is better than Father Ted but there is one thing BB has in its favour and that is the familiar miasma of drunken excess and bleery eyed London squalor you will probably have seen before in WITHNAIL &amp; I (And maybe Jeffry Bernard Is Unwell). Craggy Island is a great setting but for extra contrast between the irratingly pompous and the militantly pi**ed a bookstore is London is pretty much spot on.<br/><br/>

1731,Bless This Mess, More Entertaining Than I Thought It Would Be,"I've grown a liking to Dax Shepard since his podcast, but I haven't liked him in that much, other than Parenthood, and Lake Bell is kind of an indie gal, so, I thought this would be a stinker. Correction, CHIPs was amusing. Not great, but, it's based on a '70s show for kids with a man named Poncherello, so, not like I was expecting art. Anyway, I only gave it a chance because of my new fondness for Dax, and I liked Bell in Wet Hot Summer. I found it surprisingly funny. It's basically Money Pit meets Funny Farm with Chevy Chase, and I figured the writer must be a big fun of '80s B movies like Overboard, Baby Boom, Doc Hollywood, etc., all dealing with city folk ending up in the country.<br/><br/>For the people complaining about mocking people from the fly over states, you're missing the point. The main characters are by far the most bumbling and inept. This, like Money Pit and the other '80s schtick, is more of a screwball comedy, and not a realistic portrayal. Every character is dialed up a bit, including Bell's Kavetching mother, which was pretty funny. And points were made along the way, like Bell saying this was the first time she got to meet her neighbors, and in the end, everyone comes to help them with their roof problem. The takeaway was, that people from fly over states are good people. It was showing the juxtapose between their two lives. And speaking as someone who left the Big City, and moved to a small Southern town for a year, it is a weird adjustment and people do seem like characters, in a way, because you're not used to it. So, in that sense I think they did a nice portrayal, especially with the amount of people that are actually leaving NYC to start up farms. There's a documentary coming out about city folk moving to a farm and bumbling their way to making a living, so, this is actually a thing.<br/><br/>Pam Grier was my favorite in the show. I don't think I've seen her since the L Word, and I didn't know she could do comedy, but she did a great job. I liked Ed Beagley's weird, quirky character and his awkward flirtation with Grier. I also like David Koechner as the rancher type. In general, I thought it was cute and kind of funny. Not Modern Family or The Goldbergs kind of funny, but something I would watch. And really, it gets tiring seeing things based in Los Angeles or NYC, like nowhere else exists. I was happy to see Roseanne come back to see other parts of America, but then they canceled it and the Connors replaced it, which was basically, dressed down Los Angeles and didn't reflect middle America in anyway. And I'm fascinated with that part of the country after seeing Godless, and have tried pretty much anything that comes up that has that kind of setting. That part of the country really hasn't been explored since City Slickers and it's a shame to put so much focus on only 2 cities in the country (LA &amp; NYC) when there is so much out there.",36 out of 54 found this helpful.,7.0,20 April 2019

1752,Wisting, Really 2 'mini-series' (One not very good!),"I kept willing 'Wisting' to follow in the footsteps of Scandi-noir series like 'The Bridge', 'The Killing' &amp; 'Wallander'. A sympathetic lead detective, intricate suspenseful plot (at the beginning, at least), interesting clash of cultures between the investigating officers (Norway-US), evil lurking in lots of places, all very promising ... but then the crime is solved and FBI Agent Maggie Griffin (Carrie Anne Moss) and her partner are back in the US after just 5 episodes! What an anti-climax! I'm now watching the rest of the series, another sub-plot apparently 'appended'. Scarcely believable, but I just don't really care anymore!<br/><br/>In my view, the drop in quality of recent Scandi-noir is due to sub-standard writing. 'Wisting' itself is based on a pair of novels by Norwegian crime fiction writer Jørn Lier Horst, but I wonder how faithfully the programme makers have adapted his work (I must admit I'm not familiar with Horst's writing, so I can't comment on that)? I don't so much blame the actors or the film-makers. There's great technique shown in the production of this series, but without a decent storyline it's got nowhere to go. We get to know very little about the characters in 'Wisting', dialogue is rather stilted at times and the plot (sub-plots) doesn't create enough intensity and excitement. This surely is the fault of the script writers? Some IMDB reviews criticize the relationship between Wisting and his daughter Line, but that's beside the point really. You can make great drama by developing the characters and the stories, it's all in the imagination and creativity of the writers. And the 5 + 5 episodes format ... better to make two 'mini-series' out of it, label them clearly parts 1 &amp; 2, then we end on a 'high' each time rather than low-high-low-high!

This turned out to be quite the undertaking for me to find them along with working English subtitles. Not an easy task, especially if you live in the US. I felt like an investigator myself with all the work I did hunting them down. This series is in Norwegan with some English mixed in during the first 5 episodes that Carrie Moss appeared in. Second 5 episodes, Carrie is gone and so is whatever English there was. Show is not watchable if you don't have those English Subtitles unless you want to guess the whole series what is being said. The story, plot, acting is all very good. I like Carrie but she was a pretty unenthusiastic ho hum in this, everybody else in the series put out stronger acting than she did. She pretty much looked like she didn't want to be there. Watch the Jessica Jones series for a comparison with Carrie's acting and you will see what I mean. All in all, I enjoyed watching this series. Unlike so many ""fake"" interviewers in here, I don't give out many 10s. I'll give one to this. If you can actually find this series, give it a go, it's pretty good.",33 out of 48 found this helpful.,10.0,27 July 2019
1758,Wisting, Irrelevant father-daughter sub-plots,"Why could Wisting not go about his investigation without the impediment of the annoying daughter? This sub-plot appears in detective series that span continents: Harrow and Jack Irish (tiresome ward) in Australia; dreadful Cally in Midsommer Murders, in Shetland and the daughter in Loch Ness (UK) and even Wallander and several other Scandinavian crime shows.

1759,Wisting, By the book,"'Wisting' is a detective series that certainly doesn't shy from the tired conventions of the genre. Weary middle-aged man as protagonist? Check. His family bafflingly involved in his investigations? Check. Creepy colleagues among the suspects? Check. Unlikely serial killers on the loose in beautiful, remote locations? You get the idea. One thing uplifts some entries in this genre is an interesting lead investigator, but Wisting himself is a fundamentally boring everyman, with none of the character of Inspectors Morse or Montalbano. The result is a fairly formulaic and unremarkable programme. There have been some great Scandinavian crime dramas in recent years; but this one is by the book.",12 out of 16 found this helpful.,5.0,27 January 2020

1765,Wisting," Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear","After a great first episode that boasted real potential (great setting, intriguing glimpses of backstory between the various small-town Police officers, and a decent enough if somewhat run-of-the-mill dose of family tensions between the central characters of chief investigator and rising journalist, his cocky daughter) this initial 5-part mini-series quickly developed into risibly bad serial killer hunt, complete with caricature FBI agents flown in from the States, multiple growling and gurning locals, a second-in-command we are supposed to think (but never do) might himself be the sought-after bad guy, and some of the worst plotting, dialogue and characterisation to make it past the rough draft blackboard in years.<br/><br/>That said, and this gives nothing much away that is not obvious and inevitable from the outset, episode 5 (in which the hunt for the serial killer is finally resolved) is so bad, so hammy in its delivery, so silly in the movements (literally) of its monstrous villain (complete with set-piece barn-fire resulting from, believe it or not, an accident with a paraffin lamp and matches that appear out of nowhere ), it has to be seen to be believed. Boris Karloff would have blanched. Lon Chaney would have sniggered. Bela Lugosi would have been completely embarrassed.<br/><br/>But what is even worse, after all the many victims of this evil sadist have been found in abandoned wells the length and breadth of Norway and Sweden, would anyone be surprised when the hero father despatches the ghoul, in fact by accident, by tipping him over into a well of his own, thereby closing the case, and summoning the much snticipated living embrace with his daughter, just in time for the closing credits?<br/><br/>Hey, I love crime series. That's why I watched this, in hope and trust. But what the heck! Did it have to be this dumb? Really? Scandi Noir has had an easy ride since The Killing and, to a much lesser extent, The Bridge. But it ends here, or should. Forget the helicopters and sweeping shots of deserted forests and fjords and farms.

1767,Wisting, International series just became so much more 'user friendly',"I applaude the idea behind this one. They 'faded in' the subtitles, having a team of FBI agents involved in episodes 1-5, with sometimes Americans and Norwegian cast all speaking English, and sometimes all speaking Norwegian with subtitles. By episode 5 of 10, the FBI involvement was done and the rest of the series was 100% subtitles. Although I enjoy exploring international drama, I mostly stick to languages where I have a smattering of understanding. This was really clever. By the time they stopped the English language I was totally invested in the characters and plot. Very clever. Obviously the story and characters have to be great too, but with this production that went without saying. Can't wait for the next series.",12 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,26 January 2020

The writers manage to make everyone sound silly.<br/><br/>The first half of the season is the opposite of murder mysteries where everyone is briefly a suspect and you wonder who it will finally be. Here, though there are one or two red herrings, you'll probably figure out the solution fairly early on. And some of the coincidences are annoying.

1772,The Untamed, Perfect.,"I was looking for some Mandarin-language TV show to improve my Chinese, and I stumbled across the Untamed. The actors seemed okay, the scenography was cool and I started watching. However, after just a few episodes, I was so into the story. The relationships between the characters are beautiful, and the story keeps on getting more and more sad but I couldn't stop watching.
I really liked the Lan Zhan and Wei Ying relationship. The way Wei WuXian says ""Lan Zhan"" in the beginning is so enthusiastic and kind of annoying, however - at the end of the series it becomes so gentle and caring.
Ironically, the reason I started watching this TV show was just to improve my Chinese. But now I want to improve my Chinese BECAUSE of this series.",50 out of 51 found this helpful.,10.0,28 November 2019
1773,The Untamed," An astonishing series, much to learn for a European","I have just finished watching this epic on Netflix and, in short, I have to say it is well worth sticking with it, as ultimately it is hugely rewarding on so many levels. Looking at a show like this with a western sensibility, we have to talk of some elephants wandering around the room.
Firstly the era in which this drama takes place means the depiction of strong class and social positioning, showing a degree of respect and politeness rarely seen in the west, except perhaps in the 18th century. The mannerisms and dress take some getting used to. The viewer must also get used to the fact that everyone has at least two names: given name, courtesy name, and sometimes a formal name. All the major characters belong to one of five clans.
Secondly the pacing of this series is likely to be difficult for a generation with a short attention span and a video-game paced expectation. This series has many periods of long glances, involved speeches and lengthy exposition. Sometimes it's difficult to know why some characters get so upset over things that are apparently so trivial. These social orders are strict indeed.
Then we spot that there are fifty one-hour episodes, a daunting thought, but more of that later. I would advise checking out more knowledgable reviewers to gain more insight into the clans and the people in them.
I cannot speak to the original novel. I have searched but cannot locate an English translation. Much is made of the relationship between the two male leads and, by all accounts, this is much more explicit in the novel. Nonetheless it became clear to me early on that there was attraction between the two that was more than just brotherly love.
The story begins with events leading to the death of Wei Wuxian (aka Wei Ying and the Yiling Patriarch). After this we are taken on a lengthy flashback detailing the development of the friendship between Wei Wuxian, the demonic cultivator, and noble and intriguing Lan Zhan (also Lan Wangji and Lord Hanguang). We learn how Wei Wuxian is framed for misdeeds and killings he did not really do. Some years after his death Wei Wuxian is revived by illegal means, is reunited with Lan Zhan and they embark on an investigation as to who is behind all the feuding and the discredit of Wei Wuxian, although this has been hinted to the viewer already.
Many of the confusions of earlier episodes begin to get resolved; you will easily find spoilers elsewhere if you want them. Suffice to say the final half-dozen episodes reveal a great deal and the end is satisfying.
The spectacular scenery, stunning costume design and and decidedly attractive cast make this whole journey unique and exciting. I have found the animated version online and have started watching that too.
The two leading actors, Xiao Zhan as Wei Wuxian and Wang Yibo as Lan Zhan, are mega-stars, across east Asia these days and they appear together on all kinds of tv shows (see YouTube). The intensity of their performances, coupled with the nuanced nods to more than just a bromance is enjoyable and skilfully done in a climate of censorship.
I can thoroughly recommend this, although it is unlikely that many westerners will commit to a fifty episode series and that is a shame. There is much to discover about a very different society and we could all learn much from it.",27 out of 27 found this helpful.,10.0,2 January 2020
1774,The Untamed, A truly binge-worthy series with superb plot and character development,"From the perspective of a novel fan, ""The Untamed"" truly surpassed my expectations as the live adaptations of Mo Dao Zhushi (Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation). The synopsis: A fantasy story set in ancient China about two young idealistic paladins who found themselves entangled in a bloody rebellion against an evil clan. One became a powerful demonologist and died tragically, until a strange event reunited these two friends years later. They joined force to solve the mystery behind a series of deaths, but unexpectedly uncovered a sinister conspiracy and many startling revelations about each other.<br/><br/>""The Untamed"" brought this fantasy world to life with visually stunning scenery and set design, outstanding soundtrack, great plot and character development, as well as a team of talented new actors (major bonus points for giving us a parade of eye candies). I was a bit turned off by the substandard CGI...but I get that it's not a big budget production and funding must had been tight after the studio caught on fire.<br/><br/>So what made ""The Untamed"" the biggest runaway hit of 2019 in the world of Chinese television? It has a well written script with a perfect balance between comedy and drama, as well as action and intrigue. I'm also very impressed by how the screen writers managed to fill some of the original novel's plot holes and reorganize the timeline to make the story less confusing. However, it's not flawless and some episodes had issues with pacing. For example, the first two episodes were bogged down by too many subplots and flashbacks at times. The last episode also had several repetitive and out of order sequences that felt like fillers before the final scene (nevertheless it's still a pretty good finale).<br/><br/>Here's another element that made this a truly binge-worthy series. The casting directors of ""The Untamed"" did a superb job finding two talented lead actors who also had outstanding chemistry together on screen. Xiao Zhan is the perfect embodiment of the playful, dark, and passionate Wei Wuxian. He captivated audiences from the very first scene and was the main reason that kept me going pass the first two confusing episodes. Then there's the interesting casting choice for our second lead character...It's hard to picture a vibrant 21-year-old pop artist/TV host portraying the stoic and graceful Lan Wanji, but Wang Yibo's ability to convey a plethora of emotions with few words and very subtle expressions cemented his status as an up and coming actor. It goes without saying that directors Zheng Weiwen and Chen Jialin played a huge part in these actors' remarkable performance.<br/><br/>It's also important to mention that ""The Untamed "" has one of the most well-rounded supporting roles with their own stories and character arcs. Their relationships with the protagonists were pivotal in the story's central themes: the fine line between good versus evil and the enduring love that exists between siblings, friends, and adopted families. There were talented supporting actors who were outstanding from the start while the rest took some time to get into their characters. Nevertheless, it's a pleasure to watch these young actors bring out the best in each other as the series goes on. Although there were some comically bad villains, but the screen writers managed to redeem themselves by creating complex antagonists with motivations and perspectives tht we can all relate in real life.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend giving ""The Untamed"" a whirl even if you are not familiar with Chinese costume drama. You'll be rewarded with a thoroughly unique and entertaining viewing experience once you get over the heavy makeup and over-the-top choreography typical of traditional martial art series. So grab a couple of your fun loving friends (group reactions and comments will be a blast, I guarantee), sit back and enjoy the 50-episode fantasy adventure that is ""The Untamed"".",80 out of 85 found this helpful.,10.0,18 November 2019

1777,The Untamed, Absolutely fascinating Chinese drama,"I can't remember seeing tv series that afected me so much. I don't know if that is because of the different style (Chinese movies have a unique approach to the viewers) or because of the drama plot itself but it was so good.
The first few episodes I've struggled with because there was so much information I had hard time remembering and a lot of names which I couldn't remember but after a few episodes it was easier for me to watch. I think the most interesting thing about the drama were the characters and their development through the episodes. There was a hidden message behind every scene which I found absolutely fascinating. The two main leads executed their roles perfectly. I was captivated by Wang Yibo's performance as Lan Zhan. To have a few lines and to have to count on the facial expressions it's the most difficult role to play. Good job!
Abou the plot - it was interesting, it touched very powerful and meaningful themes such as family relationships, brotherhood and even love. Some the scenes in the series were one of the most romantic things I have ever watched, even though there were only hints. I found that approach very powerful.
The costumes were great, the atmosphere was like a fairytale, the OST was perfect. And yes, after 30th episode when everything started to come to place I cried a lot and I'm not a movie crier at all. Every little detail moved me and after the last episode I can't stop thinking about that drama.",45 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,30 October 2019
1778,The Untamed," Slow to catch on, but now I'm so hooked","At first, I almost gave up after the first few episodes, but I'm so glad I gave this series a chance. Fifty episodes later, I'm still obsessing over not only the two lead characters but also the actors who embodied them. I haven't read the novel nor seen the anime version, so there were no expectations going in. I won't go into the story as so many others have already done so. I'll just provide my opinion only.<br/><br/>The various plot lines held no big secrets--predictable and routine for a xianxia story with often long drawn scenes which didn't make sense nor push the plot through. The CGI was under par but did the job. What held it together and won me over was the ever so strong chemistry between the two leads, supported by a very talented supporting cast. The BL arc didn't hit me until I did my research. I initially interpreted it simply as brotherhood love, strong friendship and bonding between soulmates (not in the romantic sense) that has been written in so many wuxia novels that came before this one. Then after reading reviews and other info, I had to go back and rewatch episodes to pick up on what really was happening. The longing gazes, the tortured internal conflicts, the array of emotions unspoken but seen through the slightest smile or nod or simple act...these little crumbs spoke volumes if you understand what's going on. Rematching and looking for these clues were Eureka! moments for me. I actually really appreciated the fact that, due to censorship or not, the production portrayed this aspect of BL so subtlety and poetically, unlike the in-your-face presentations that would leave nothing to the imagination. Bravo! The actor who portrayed the ""ultimate villain and mastermind"" behind the plot deserved his own shout-out...his acting was at once convincing yet heartrending! The emotions in which his portrayal evoked literally gave me a vertigo spin.<br/><br/>Here's wishing much success to the two leads in their professional and private lives!!

Wei Wuxian is the character for whom you feel pity in the entire running minutes, and Lan Wangji's slight smile while looking at him is worth mentioning. Yanli as the sister is awesome too, she never loosened her faith in her brother, even when everyone blamed him for his demonic cultivation, she was worried about him. Wen Qing and Wen Ning make you cry sometimes, being always misunderstood(poor thing). I want to add more, but I think I am being too emotional.

1782,The Untamed," Engaging, soul crushing and rewarding series","A series with very strong, multidimensional main characters fleshed out by skilled actors who were able to capture the very essence of their psychology and motivations. If you're here for easy dynamics and simple divides between good and evil, this series is not for you. Complicated human decisions, complicated human emotions... they're all explored through the eyes of the two main leads (who have one of the most compelling love stories that I've had the chance to enjoy and it's all portrayed in this series despite the limitations that censorship has imposed on it) and a strong supporting cast. You cannot help but feel for many of the characters. You cannot help but question what's really right and what's wrong.<br/><br/>Watching this without any prior knowledge of any other formats this series may come in, I have to say that this is the type of work that does not need to rely on the original source material to deliver it's message across, therefore if one doesn't have the time to watch/read the other pieces of content, they will still get to fully enjoy the story. That being said, this story and it's characters are so compelling that you cannot help searching for more, so those other formats (lacking the above-mentioned limitations) and even rewatches of the series itself are something that many people have enjoyed after finishing it. Those aren't necessary in order to enjoy and understand the drama, but they're certainly a different way to revive the story and explore some things more in detail.<br/><br/>The first few episodes may be confusing, but the more you watch, the more you start seeing. When I was halfway in, I went back and rewatched the first two episodes and it was so deeply touching to understand the characters and dynamics there, the details and symbolism.<br/><br/>The CGI isn't the best - that's due to the limited budget - but the show makes up for it with the compelling story and characters, interesting themes and great directing choices in impactful moments of the story.<br/><br/>You can feel that each person who worked on this series put their 200% and passion into delivering the best they could despite limitations from censorship and budget.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how deserving this series is of being watched and enjoyed fully.<br/><br/>
P.S.: This series treat the bond between the leads with the utmost care and it's stunning to see how much of the romantic side of it made it into the desries despite the censorship. And the novel this is based on is 100% upfront about the leads' relationship. I won't say more to avoid spoilers.",17 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,31 December 2019

1786,The Untamed, Amazing series!,"I'll admit that I've never read the original story, or seen the animated series, so I was going into this completely blind (basically; all I knew about the series before I watched it was all the guys have long, luxurious hair and fight each other graceful with swords whilst flying through the air... Oh, that and the fact the main two characters are in love...), but I have to say it really exceeded my expectations in many aspects!<br/><br/>I don't think I'm the only one who'll say that the first few episodes are a bit confusing to get into (especially when you're not familiar with the source material) which makes them drag just a little bit. But I'd say if you're feeling this way at the start, definitely try to stick with it! The story continues to get more interesting and intense, as well as things get explained as it goes on! And the characters all go through some really great development through the 50 episodes, which makes them more relatable!<br/><br/>As far as complaints go; my main issue is with some of the ways scenes are filmed and framed, particularly in very emotional scenes... It wasn't necessarily bad or too jarring, but it did pull you away from the immersion a little bit! The cgi isn't the best, but that's to be expected considering this didn't have a massive budget... It wasn't too bad to pull you out of the story, though, so I'd say it wasn't too big of an issue!<br/><br/>The biggest thing I'll commend the series on is something I imagine everyone has already said: that being the handling of the relationship between characters, particularly the main two! It's no secret that this is based on an lgbt ('bl') novel, and that China have strict censorship laws that don't allow depictions of that on screen. However, the producers and scriptwriters really were able to develop a believable and touching dynamic between the two main characters throughout the span of the series in subtle and well done ways! And more than that, the other friendships and relationships of the series were made believable and touching too!<br/><br/>Overall; it's an emotionally invested and well made drama, with some pretty decent acting on the most part and a bunch of really engaging and interesting characters!",21 out of 22 found this helpful.,9.0,30 October 2019

It was the most cherished bonding I have ever watched💖 The way their friendship gradually developed from being just 2 opposite poles to relying on each other, taking care of each other, protecting each other, even giving up their reputation &amp; ready to cut ties with the entire world just to stay by each others' side took my heart away 💘
Thanks you team Chén Qíng Lìng for choosing such a beautiful story and also depicting it so mesmerizingly. Thanks to all crew members whom were behind the scenes, u guys worked really hard to get us such a delightful series .
I have already watched it many times and still like to rewatch it... Highly Recommend 💖

1788,The Untamed, The best series I have ever seen,"I have never ever seen such beautiful drama! This is the first Chinese drama I've ever watched and already finished it watching 5th time. Never have I ever thought I would be so much addicted to it and the main leads specially Wang Yibo as Lan Wangji, I just can't get over them. Watching this drama made my days so enjoyable now I really miss this. Hopefully able to watch the main leafs together again and yeah forever WANGXIAN!",30 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,31 October 2019
1789,The Untamed, Best drama of all time,"Literally the most amazing drama. I cried, laughed and fell completely in love with the entire cast. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable and they're such amazing actors that they completely brought the characters to life. 50 episodes, 44m each is definitely NOT enough, I was left wanting even more considering I binged this show and finished it within 3 days. 10/10 recommend and I lowkey want amnesia so I can rewatch everything.",19 out of 20 found this helpful.,,31 December 2019
1790,The Untamed, So beautifully made 😍,I have not enjoyed a series like this ever. The characters bring out the emotions that will bring you on a roller coaster ride with twist and turns. The series closes very well with most loose ends explained. Very well written and directed. I wish there is a follow up season to this series as I am going through big time withdrawals now.,19 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,26 December 2019
1791,The Untamed," Great story, funny, romantic, emotional, definitely entertaining","Not quite sure how I found out about this Chinese fantasy drama but thankfully, I did. I'm a bit late to the game and not all that familiar with the background but from what I understand now, it was a book or web based story that was turned into an anime series. It's now been recreated live for the screen.<br/><br/>At first, it's a lot to take in. I'm not familiar with Chinese shows so wasn't quite sure what to expect. There's a lot of information in the first few episodes and they're more on the silly/fun side. I was worried the whole show was going to be like that but it's not at all. It really builds who the characters are and the relationship foundations. I think it was around the mid teen eps where it started to become more serious and at some point along the way, I became so hooked. This is a binge worthy show which sucked because there are 50 episodes. I did not want to stop watching at all!<br/><br/>The special effects can be quite funny at times however the acrobatics are cool, fun, interesting and overall, you forget how low budget some of it seems. The costuming is absolutely gorgeous. It's almost like they put the biggest part of the budget towards costuming rather than CGI. So worth it.<br/><br/>The dynamic between the main character, Wei Wuxian and his significant counterpart, Lan Wangji, is beautifully developed and told as well as his familial bonds. The story creates these breathtakingly heartbreaking, emotional scenes that balance well with the lighter humourous scenes in between. I was impressed by the main actors range and with the limited facial expressions of Lan Zhan, that actor really did a great job in expressing so much by doing so little. Excellent!<br/><br/>There's a lot to the story and a lot of characters which I had a hard time keeping up with. I'm now watching it again to catch what I missed and the show is just as good, if not better, the second time around. This is an intriguing, entertaining, addictive show that you will stay with you even after it's over. I highly recommend giving it a go.",12 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,2 March 2020
1792,The Untamed, Almost Indescribable Charm,"I have no idea why this came up as a recommended title for me on Netflix, but I am so glad it did. I've never shown an interest in non-English titles, let alone those in Chinese, and I almost gave it a pass. I'm now blessing my lack of impulse control. I was charmed almost immediately, even if the first two episodes left me pretty much completely lost. I was still mesmerized. Sticking with it, I was able to piece together the story, and I enjoyed it tremendously.<br/><br/>The lavish scenery, the music, the sets and costumes create a fascinating world, but the actors are enchanting beyond belief, and they sell this story like they were born for it. They all play their characters with an earnestness that makes the heart squeeze. Seeing the two leads bond throughout the series is a joy to watch, even throughout the emotionally wrenching periods of turmoil that drive the plot and the mysteries. There is something wholly profound, almost deliriously romantic in a way, about their relationship and how it deepens and evolves.<br/><br/>Whenever the mischievous Wei WuXian smiles, it feels like sunshine bursting from the screen. When we finally see the ridiculously stoic Lan WanJi smile, it's breathtaking for all its quiet honesty. It leaves you sorely wanting more.<br/><br/>It's not exactly perfect, though, this series. The effects are frankly sometimes silly. But it doesn't matter, with a story this captivating. The often fast dialogue can be tough to catch via the subtitles, but you do follow the gist. One serious negative is how the story treats the women on the whole. For any other series, it would be a deal-breaker for me. But I was otherwise so completely taken by the series that I can look past that. What I love about the series outweighs the negatives so much that I have no hesitation to give it a ten. It's earned that ten from me.<br/><br/>This series was actually more of an experience, and I intend to go through it again. I'm not ready to let go.",12 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,21 February 2020
1793,The Untamed, On a level of its own,"This story is a masterpiece. The love and loyalty between the 2 main characters Lan zhan and Wei Ying really has an impact on you as a viewer. From the first episode on you are immediately invested in their story. The plot and side plots are strong, but the casting of Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo in these 2 lead roles is such a stroke of genius, that it takes the series to a whole other level, an unbelievable performance, from both of them. The soundtrack by Lin Hai is also beautiful, especially the tracks with guqin music. I have listened to it many times. This series is so unique, that I hope it has a breakthrough also in the west. I don't randomly gives 10's. But this show deserves it.",12 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,10 January 2020

1796,The Untamed," Clever plot, good character arcs","Astonishingly good acting accompanied incredible character development. Every character felt like complex, realistic people, and everyone had their own motives. Every step of Wei Wuxian's journey was heartfelt and believable. It is all too easy to fall in love with the selfless, outgoing, adorable character played by Xiao Zhan. The untamed had a surprisingly good plot, good script and was well-executed. Wang Yibo and Xiao Zhan outdid themselves with this live action portrayal of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian. The tv show maintains enough closeness to the original source material, while carefully skirting the limitations of china's censorship rules. The characters go through numerous hardships and grows onto you. Definitely a show to remember. A must watch.",11 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,31 December 2019
1797,Louie," Welcome to the Pantheon, Louis C.K.","I hate giving the 10-star rating because it appears exaggerated and the best I can do to avoid people looking down on the review/plea for people to watch this program is to say, ""It's the best at what it's trying to be."" I'm not going to use that statement to save my ass here because I'm not sure what this show is trying to be other than honest.<br/><br/>'Louie' is the first show I've come across that I absolutely refuse to let myself wait for DVD to see. It's the first show that I don't sit down to watch with the sole anticipation of having it either cheer me up with comedy or shock me with dramatic twists. 'Louie' is simply something I watch because it feels like I'm gaining life experience from it, which is impressive considering Louis C.K., or at least the Louie character's self-proclaimed life goals are to raise his kids and hold his title as World's Best Masturbator.<br/><br/>It's also impressive considering that I, and I'm sure many viewers, have already experienced nearly every situation this show covers, from being forced out of the house with no plans to being on a date with someone who thinks less of you for doing the right thing despite saying that he/she valued righteousness. So what's to gain from reliving these unpleasant situations every Tuesday evening? <br/><br/>Great shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm bank on this question by allowing the main character to vengefully act on his everyday irritations only to have it bite him in the ass by the episode's end. This way you can laugh at the absurdity while saying, ""I know what he's feeling, man,"" followed by, ""but I'm sure glad *I* didn't act on it."" It's a winning formula because the audience always comes out unscathed. 'Louie' makes that show look like it's playing too safe (which it isn't, by the way.)<br/><br/>If the Louie character ever acts on his irritations, he does it in a way that almost feels like he's seen Curb, and thus trying to avoid any unnecessary harm while still following his gut instinct. In other words, he's a coward sometimes, just like we are. Curb's Larry David states in interviews that his eponymous character is more like him than he is. Louie is simply Louis, and perhaps, Louis is simply everybody, and PERHAPS that can be a little discomforting. But that's okay, because at least, just like when we look back on mistakes or simply situations that we wish we could have handled differently (so that we could've gotten laid that night), it's almost always hilarious. The difference here is that it's *always* hilarious. . . though it's still unbelievably discomforting. <br/><br/>For that, I'm more than happy to not save my ass on this one. Enjoy chewing on it, critics.",198 out of 228 found this helpful.,10.0,7 September 2010
1798,Louie," I Laughed, I Cried. Then I Watched Louie, and Really F$@#ing Laughed.","Louis C.K. has found his voice. He's always been unaffected, without gimmicks, both as a stand up and as a comedic actor, but he now speaks and acts with near elegant confidence. His old HBO show ""Lucky Louie"" was original, edgy and often hilarious, but it was basically a sitcom, and even though it thoroughly mocked its own premises, it felt constrained by its traditional format. He was also quite raw as an actor and his rhythm was often awkward and rushed. But this latest project has him portraying a much more genuine version of himself and it takes its sweet time setting up and delivering its original punchlines. The humor now is very organic, arising not from slapstick absurdity but from honesty of character. Integrity is a word that just might pop up in a more competent review.<br/><br/>Like Seinfeld who inter-cut his show with staged fragments of his live routine, Louie uses his nightly club sessions to vent his daily frustrations, but the mood and feel is very different because Louis C.K. is not just riffing on airline peanuts and oddly buttoning shirts. He's also describing his complex, often extreme reactions to being alive. His carefully argued opinions on the inane and demoralizing nature of modern urban life are brilliant. Taboos are the targets at which the better comics aim their lacerating wit most emphatically, and the taboo that Louis mercilessly eviscerates most is fatherhood. If his frequently profane and sinister comments on parenting weren't so poignantly true and uncomfortably familiar they'd qualify as grounds for denial of custody. His honesty in expressing just how tedious, cold, and bland so much of his waking time actually is only works to heighten the comedic impact of his concise eloquent rants. His pacing and timing are at expert level now, as he has relaxed into himself; his aging, decaying, disappointing self. That's the kind of truth that ""reality"" TV could never pick out of a police line up.<br/><br/>The supporting players are all sensational and equally genuine. His friends, cohorts, and sociopath side kicks are marvelously candid and natural. Together they have some of the most entertaining, informative and enlightened discussions on life's more sensitive subjects. And they do it while exchanging great dick jokes. Pamela Adlon, who played his tough, often stressed working wife on the old HBO show, joins him again but now as a more crass and disillusioned fellow single parent. And the recurring visits of Ricky Gervais' maniacally demented doctor are sublimely outrageous, positively some of the most excruciatingly intense laughter I've ever experienced. That pudgy Brit is deranged!<br/><br/>What else can I add to this near solemn memorial I've contrived for this most enjoyable, most satisfying show? Just the fact that it is without a doubt the quickest passing twenty two minutes of quality comedy I've ever enjoyed. Yeah, it flies by way too fast.",122 out of 143 found this helpful.,9.0,27 February 2011
1799,Louie, An Everyman's Misanthrope,"Seinfeld revolved around a stand-up comedian constantly sabotaged by the catastrophic social faux pas of himself and the people inextricably involved in his life, intercut with performance sets by the actual comic. So is Louie. But where Seinfeld was purportedly ""a show about nothing,"" Louie is a show in which from moment to moment, you can safely expect nothing. Not only does Louis C.K. straddle the gaps in social protocol and everyday confrontations we all understand, but also the extremes of comedy and tragedy. It's a gallows comedy, in which we can find ourselves laughing in elation at the both wry and surreal absurdity of one moment, then clenching our chair arms in both tension and incredulity at moments of agonizing pain and even at times a true sense of impending brutality.<br/><br/>There is no continuity from one episode to the next, or even from one vignette to the next. Each episode is comprised of usually two scenarios book-ended by stand-up sets by Louie, which may or may not turn out to be part of one of the scenes. It's the direct inversion by an observant everyman's misanthrope of the TV sitcom. Whereas every sitcom we've ever seen has one essential soundstage, an ongoing play-like farce that runs before two cameras, all the same characters show up and everything not only works out but is just the same as before by the end, each week Louie will give a stream of consciousness an unsystematic narrative silhouette almost invariably a sequence of encounters with characters who enter and exit, yet very few ever return. Some actors and actresses return in different roles. Louie's mother is at one point played by an old woman as an appalling malignant narcissist and in another episode a humble, warm-hearted young working-class woman.<br/><br/>The show is written, directed and edited by its star, and he creates a visually realistic look and atmosphere for his small stories, captured quite cinematically. In the God episode, arguably the boldest, most powerful episode, he injects solemn amber tones, almost I dare say comparable to Gordon Willis' work on the Godfather films. There is a considerable proliferation of long takes in which two characters will share dialogue that sounds and feels no less real than that which we'll share with someone tomorrow. Sometimes, he's bold enough to prolong a single, stationary take in which nothing is being said on-camera, but all the action that affects the character in the shot is occurring off-camera, and in that very single take, we're carried seamlessly and steadily from deadpan absurdity to genuine terror. Then comes the cut: Life goes on; nothing's really that big of a deal. Simply put, each week, C.K. delivers one or two of the most powerful and memorable short films you may ever see.",83 out of 102 found this helpful.,10.0,4 April 2011
1800,Louie, The most bizarrely refreshing show on TV today,"Louie is a very weird show. I can honestly say I have never seen such an unorthodox approach to directing and editing in television. Comparisons to Curb Your Enthusiasm have their merit, as the show often thrives on propelling awkward moments, but the focus of the show is in a much different direction.<br/><br/>Louie has a knack for blurring surrealism with reality. Many times in the series, the viewer can enjoy scenes that seem to scream 'it was going so bad, this might as well have happened,' except there are no visual or audio cues as to when the show transitions into such moments. As such, at least in my experience, there are several moments of jaw dropping, I-can't-believe-that-just-happened ecstatic laughter in every episode.<br/><br/>The writing is as sharp and precise as Louie's stand-up, of which live bits are heavily incorporated into the show. The casting thus far has also been great. Perhaps it's due to the direction of the series, but the acting seems far superior to that of the also hilarious Lucky Louie, even in scenes with actors from that show--exchanges between Louie and Nick DiPaolo, for example, are much more believable than the HBO series. Louis CK is by no means a world class actor, but for one who describes himself as a man who ""hates acting"" and is ""bad at it,"" he delivers the goods more than well enough.<br/><br/>I recommend this show to just about everyone. I would practically instruct any fan of dirty comedy to watch this show, as not only do many fantastic comics appear on the series, but the show has a sense of humor that seems distinctly tailored to stand-up comedy fans. FX allows for some coarse language, and the series takes advantage of that; however, the show is accessible for any adult with even a moderate sense of humor. Watch this show, and re-watch it again.",56 out of 68 found this helpful.,10.0,9 August 2010
1801,Louie," Louie, please save comedy for us!","Louis CK is a genius and he once again proves it by making this miraculously humorous show.<br/><br/>The humor is of the best kind - dry and effective, and Louie faces some real problems that are common for all of us at one point - aging and going through tough (but hilarious) changes in life... Seeing THAT from Louie's point of view is particularly interesting... The show itself is refreshing new gem in the sea of mediocre popular boringness that we see today on TV.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that this show is underrated and needs more reviews...<br/><br/>Can't wait for the second season!",63 out of 79 found this helpful.,10.0,16 December 2010
1802,Louie, Started Slow But Faith in Louie,"This show as everything else can be compared to other shows but it is its own in many ways.

His comedy is genuine and honest and i know it sounds corny but his show feels very real the dialogue and the situations are how real life i think would be. I've heard it be compared to seinfeld but the only comparison is that there are clips of louie doing stand up, the actual show is nothing like it. Also id like to commend FX on giving it time to grow, they are a very good network for that, same with SUNNY IN PHILLY, that show grew into an excellent show. Shows get canceled to quickly. Anyways to sum up. Louie gets a 10/10, its just my opinion.",56 out of 72 found this helpful.,10.0,14 September 2010
1803,Louie, One of today's best comic's raises the bar for all future situation comedies,"Louis CK began his career as a writer for various show's like the Ben Stiller Show and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. He also made several surrealist style short films which I highly recommend you look up on YouTube. With ""Louie"", CK has essentially perfected what he's been working at for over twenty years: short films/comedy sketches. <br/><br/>While the show retains an overarching structure revolving around Louis' daughters and his stand up comedy, the actual content of the episodes can cover virtually anything CK chooses, a sense of freedom he clearly loves. In fact, in a recent interview with Jimmy Kimmel, CK talked about the inconsistencies on his show: how characters appear out of nowhere and then disappear, never to be seen or spoken of ever again. Why? CK lost interest or couldn't think of anything funny to do with them. Other shows require their less interesting characters to have scenes in each episode, forcing the writing staff to jimmy them into the plot just so the actor can have a line of dialogue. CK views this as an unnecessary formality that it's about time television moves on from. I heartily agree.<br/><br/>If you enjoy laughter, watch Louie. If you hate boring, dull characters, watch Louie. If you're fed up with every character speaking like a comedy writer and having their conversations broken up by the requirement of canned laughs so that you, the stupid viewer, will know when to laugh, then watch Louie. Finally, if you like to ruminate on topics like inevitable death, the tragedy of aging, the annoying yet fulfilling requirements of parenthood, and then after much brooding, find yourself laughing at the absurdity of it all, then watch Louie. Because that's the show.",55 out of 72 found this helpful.,10.0,1 July 2011
1804,Louie, Disturbingly refreshing,"I watched this show for the first time last week after Wilfred (another great new show), and I must say - Louie is wondrously on a WHOLE new level. Where have I been?! Yes, the show is quite explicit, vulgar, and just plain dirty - all of which I'm not a huge fan, but the writing/dialogue depicts the everyday thoughts and issues that are really running in the minds of the rest of us, but we're just too afraid to speak our minds. That's what really amazes/captures me about this show. It is rough around the edges submerged with complex, bizarre, vulgar situations, yet the overall tone of the show is so...simple, mundane. This very stark contrast is not only captivating and mind-blowing, it is very intense and disturbing to the human psyche. It is just a whole new level of comedy. I am thoroughly and mindbogglingly wow-ed.",54 out of 71 found this helpful.,10.0,2 July 2011
1805,Louie, A promising start to quite possibly a great show.,"I was watching Rescue Me tonight, and I saw the previews of this show. I didn't know if it was old or new. I later checked on the cable box and saw it was new. I gave it a shot, and I was a bit surprised that there might be another great show on TV. <br/><br/>While I am not going to sit here and say this is the next Seinfeld, it had certain feelings to it, like the stand up comedy part in the start and the end. But ""Louie"" seems more edgier and more explicit than Seinfeld's method of 'beating around the bush' of what they want to say due to restrictions. The jokes I would say are more like Curb Your Enthusiasm.<br/><br/>I will not try to spoil much for those who haven't seen it, but the show is basically about a middle-aged man who has two children, both girls, and recently split up with his wife. He is a stand up comedian for a living, and while off the job -- he is looking for a rebound for his break up with his wife. His character symbolizes Larry David's to a degree, although I don't see his good will like Larry shows time to time, yet he's still a very sympathetic character and one who is easy to get behind.<br/><br/>I love the comparisons to Seinfeld and CYE, because I think they are both excellent shows, thus I hope this show can use that type of formula but also be able to come up with some innovative and compelling ideas on its own. It's already did its main job with me: making me want to see it again. I am looking forward to see if this show becomes something epic or something that epic fails.<br/><br/>Worth checking out, especially if you're a Seinfeld and/or CYE fan.",80 out of 111 found this helpful.,8.0,30 June 2010

But I am forced to maintain an integrity? Yes! And, so, I must give highest of rating for this because I feel it is deserving. You will not know what to expect or how to expect it to be delivered on any given episode. Everything comes anew and is very refreshing. It is not stuck in format like most sitcoms and sketch comedies you find. I find those often bore. This, I am no bore, you see? I plan to watch until they cancel!

1807,Louie," Unique, hilarious, touching and true-to-life; ""Louie"" is a masterpiece that mixes comedy, drama and tragedy seamlessly","Say what you will about Louis C.K. but his talents as a director, writer and actor are truly incredible. The writing in ""Louie"" is at times hilariously vulgar and other times touching and sad; there are moments of sincere honesty and other times of complete bizarreness. That is one of the ways the show is truly one-of-a-kind - you simply don't know what you'll get in any particular episode.

1809,Louie," Promises, promises","Ricky Gervais called Louis C.K. ""the funniest comedian working in America today"", so it's fitting that Louis should repay the compliment with a guest spot for Gervais on his show. And what a guest spot! Gervais is allowed to do what Gervais does best, say ridiculously sublime and horribly tasteless things while still remaining oddly endearing. Ricky's jokes in anyone else's hands could seem the punch lines of a sociopath. Whether Louis C.K. will fulfill Ricky's pronouncement as ""the funniest comedian working in America today"" remains to be seen, but he's off to a good start. Each episode of Louis is presented in two vignettes, two seemingly random episodes connected by a greater theme, such as aging, love, death, health, wealth and happiness, etc. And so far, Louis C.K. has surrounded himself with excellent playmates (Gervais, for one). Now let us hope that he takes a cue from Ricky Gervais and keeps his comedy grounded in a painfully bittersweet hyper reality, as opposed to a Jerry Seinfeld/ Larry David world of snarky cynicism. The random quirkiness of his show has already drawn Seinfeld comparisons, but it's pretty obvious Louis has a hope for humanity his predecessors have never had. Louis C.K. (the character) is both a schlemiel and a schlimazel, a loser either way you look at it, but he has a dignity befitting a Ricky Gervais character.

But a few weeks before he was gonna come here, he had to cancel due to some TV show he started working on instead. I was so bummed out. However, it turned out that the show was ""Louie"", and after experiencing what an absolutely amazing and brilliant show it was I'm kinda glad he canceled his tour here.

1811,Louie, Louis CK is at a new level,"To preface - i am not one of those people who hand out 10 star reviews. I rarely if ever write reviews. With that said, here are my impressions of this modern masterpiece. <br/><br/>I think it is quite evident that Louis CK has moved on to the next level of comedy with this shows efforts. I feel like he has reached a place where he is now not just a comedian, but a voice. He isn't going for gags (this guy makes being funny look so effortless). Some episodes you don't laugh out loud once, but come out of the experience thinking about what you saw, and the humor exists as a whole, not as individual jokes (it has those too though). It feels like he really has tried to say something about growing up and assimilating into adulthood together. <br/><br/>It sounds so serious from my review - but not all of it is. There are so many moments that are just so funny you want to rewatch the episodes again. But, even as ridiculous parts of it are, you end up really caring about the Louie character, because it is so believable. I really didn't realize what a genuine experience the show was until the last moment of the last episode. It was like, tear inducing if you could believe. I really feel like it was a classic moment in modern TV, and I don't feel like I am exaggerating. <br/><br/>The more I watch this show, the more I understand what he was going for, and the more I appreciate it. This will be one of those shows I come back to decade after decade, and will probably appreciate even more when i become a father.",15 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,10 December 2010
1812,Louie, Comedic mastermind,"In a nutshell....It can be as funny and uncomfortable as Curb Your Enthusiasm, and maybe even more so. The big difference is that the show is heartfelt. Louie has a soul but his life sucks! Louis C.K.'s stand-up comedy is also shown throughout each episode. The show is filmed in sepia/dark tone so it has a somewhat depressing feel, which fits in with Louie's life. If you're expecting a lighthearted, silly show, you may be disappointed. It delves into some uncomfortable topics at times, but, it's always a topic worth considering. It remains as comically fresh and no-holds-barred as prior seasons were. As far as I'm concerned, Louie C.K. is this generation's George Carlin. Whereas Jerry Seinfeld points out the comic infrastructure of every potential situation, Louie shows us parts of ourselves we'd rather not look at. (Consider Vanessa's speech on fat women.) George Carlin made us blush (and made history) with ""the seven words"" -- Louie's observations make that bit seem tame by comparison. But that's Louie. Louie is about life. And sometimes life is messy. He makes us laugh about it. He embodies the mans mans and the comics comic! I can relate to him on so many levels in this series and this series is without a doubt terrain of, rather than comedy or drama or simply dramedy, it's simply life! Don't underestimate this man because you see him on stage with a mic with such offensive vulgarity to some. This man is a genius and makes very heavy emotional episodes that have very deep meaning. he injects a soul into this series that has such a pulse and it beats with a rare brilliance!

All his friend are stand-up comedians, so their conversation is equivalent to a Netflix special. Talk about Louie's kids, neighbors or his doctor (Ricky Gervais) are just treat to watch on different levels. I cannot stress on ""AUTHENTICITY"" of the subject matter.

I never would have guessed Louis had this kind of talent in him. It's so surreal that while watching I had to check if David Lynch was part of the production. No wonder he agreed for the cameo, he must be a big fan!<br/><br/>For this series alone Louis C.K. shall be remembered as THE comedy genius of our time and not only for his killer standup specials.

1817,Louie, A show about you and me,"I've been sitting here trying to come up with a word that best describes 'Louie' and 'honest' is the best I could do. This show is a comedian's life for all to see and it's surprisingly not that different from yours and mine. I never thought that the life of a simple unremarkable man could be so engaging and funny when seen from different eyes. I guess the thing I liked the most about the show is how it doesn't try too hard. It doesn't try too hard to make you laugh or to rope you in. It's like an art in the museum that speaks to you even though it doesn't and you get sucked in. The show's just there and you just keep watching it and a few episodes in, you'll say to yourself ""yeah man, that's so true"" and it'll probably hit you then what a masterpiece Louis C K has created. Louie is like a painting without all the artsy paraphernalia. It's like a perfect stroke of single colour (life) by an anonymous artist. So, if you're looking for a show that'll make you laugh your eyes out or a show full of witty one liners, this is not for you. It's for the people who rejoice in simple things and don't mind admitting that you've no control over your life but still strive hard to be better at their jobs, at being a better father, a better friend. To me the show says ""this is my life and this is how I go about it"" and that's it. It doesn't preach you about living your life a certain way, to start eating healthy, to hit the gym, to do your chores and embrace all your duties happily. It's just a show about a man and I hardly think it's important that he's a comedian, living his life. I am going to go ahead and call 'Louie' the best depiction of life. If somebody asked me ""what is life?"" I would hand them the DVD set of this show as an answer. 'Louie' reminds me a lot of Woody Allen's movies and it's because there's a common thread,' New York'. Now, I am not an American and have never been to the States but from what I've seen in the movies it's pretty evident that people from New York truly love it there. The romanticism that Woody Allen shares with New York was pretty evident in his movies and I think it holds true for Louie too. The show is shot beautifully and you get to see why it is that this city has captured the hearts of so many people All in all, 'Louie' is a great show and I can't recommend it enough. So, if you are alive and healthy watch it.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,11 September 2016

Its so wrong, yet so real, yet so surreal it feels fake.

1819,Louie, Never go full retard.,"I loved this show until episode 4 of this latest (4th) season. It seems Louie has now gone full retard in his show now and has broken those sacred words of wisdom. I'm now on episode 7 and I haven't even chuckled since episode 3. The show has gone from uncomfortable comedy to just unbearably painful to watch and zero funny. He barely speaks anymore, and when he does he barely puts a coherent sentence together. The episode where his daughter get's into trouble at school is one of the most ridiculous scenes I've ever seen in TV history. She violently rips a dress off of a teacher at her school and when he gets there to pick her up no one says anything to him about it!? Give me a break. That is just infuriating unrealistic. He needs to stop forcing these situations to prove his dumb points. Its getting really old and predictable now. Furthermore the idiotic relationship with his Hungarian neighbors is just pointless, stupid, and worst of all not funny. Louie has forgotten you never go full retard, and a comedy can never go full darkness. Without at least 20% funny in his show, the formula falls apart and it just becomes watching a pathetic retard in a fat mans body doing things that make people angry and embarrassed for him. Even Louie's biggest influence Woody Allen would never dare leave out the funny. If Louie is going to pull this show out of its tailspin, he must bring back the funny. With that said Louie is a brilliant and extremely talented comedian and I will keep watching and rooting for him that he turns this ship around.",15 out of 33 found this helpful.,6.0,24 May 2014

But then the taxi driver just took off. I mean i understand that sometimes life can be crappy but this just reminded of very badly written German satire. It just was not entertaining or funny.

1830,The Twelve, It just needed to do one thing...,"This story is complex. The characters are complex and have a lot on their plate, even on a lazy day. The case is *very* complex. All relationships displayed on this show is complex.<br/><br/>I'm not mad at that. I'm not mad that the jury is the worst jury I have ever seen. And if any real life jury share any percentage of similarities of this fictional jury, I myself, will cry. No body paid attention. When its time to make a decision, they called the accused women, ""The jealous type"". ""Its obvious she's jealous"". Last time I checked jealousy is a common emotion and not every who been jealous ends up killing their best friend. One even said, I knew she was guilty from the start and nothing could have change his mind. I personally hate this jury. They do have strong characters and a strong story, but they were amazingly lazy on a life-changing decision. Bringing themselves into the pictures, ignoring the reality of the accused women and evidence presented. They couldn't even put her there at the crime scenes, only in theory and speculation, MAYBE, she was there, said the jury. She had a motive said the jury (Every one had a motive on this case. I question why she was the only one accused?). I hate it.<br/><br/>But I'm not mad at that. I'm mad that the show didn't disclose what actually happen. All the ""victims"", lie when they open their mouth. I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them. The court relies on other sources like the jury and evidence to make an opinion, and people in charge of them were bias and had a tinted reality. The lady with the abusive husband, God bless her soul, couldn't point out the red in a basket of tomatoes. The police played replay on a crime scene where the accused women mysterious never left any trace of herself anywhere. Is she a ghost? Three hours is a small amount o time to stage a hostage situation, ride a bike, call a officer to fake an emergency, and go back to a house party, again without leaving a speck of hair. I could go on and on, but if the show just showed us what happened, I would be happy. I invested 10 hours into a mystery I cannot solved.

1831,The Twelve, Makes you think,"At first I was really pissed about the last episode as it seemed to leave all these things unresolved. However, after thinking about it I think I understand what the writers did here. Throughout the series you are made to feel compassion for Frie and you are shown all the lies and mistakes the others involved made. By the last episode I was convinced she was completely innocent and the one that was wronged despite the accusations that she is mentally ill and able to fool others. The last episode, or really the last few minutes, brings all of this into doubt. I think it shows you that Frie is perhaps guilty and that the audience was duped by this emotional woman.

1835,The Twelve," Even if it's Tuesday, please do not choose Belgium","Netflix should be more careful about the products that produces or endorses. A ten hours legal drama requires no plot loopholes and a better legal scrutiny thru expert and better paid script reviewers. If not please avoid Belgium, because if you happen to be accused there of any crime, must be aware that:
a) Neither any solid evidence is required for the prosecutors to open a case, nor the judges to accept a trial,
b) The defense attorney must deal not only with the Q&amp;A from prosecutors and their witnesses, but a bench of judges, the jurors and a bunch of lawyers supporting each witness. In fact he will be surrounded by these attorneys without even having them at clear sight.
c) Anyway, this guy will accept any juror without prior investigation; even if his or her name is true or not.
d) It does not matter if the evidence is weak and could be used as a proof against other suspects or persons of interest; it is only important when used against you.
e) You will be asked once and again to rebut what prosecutors demand, the (lying) witness state and/or the bench-judges inquire, what compels you to risk incriminating yourself every five or ten minutes, much more if you really do not know the answer, because any doubt will probably be considered a signal of guilt. Hey, you are not properly a defendant, but the accused chap struggling for your claim of innocence!
f) If the jurors do not arrive to a clear majority, two outsider bench-judges will vote to decide (and I already warned you about the fact that the judges are not worried by smallnesses as lack of solid evidence, or its probable or clear manipulation). I concede that the story does not display any interference from the magistrates during the jurors debate, but it seems something very plausible
in real life.
g) Moreover, whatever the number of days or weeks the trial has lasted, the jury has only one day to decide; they vote just once and the party is over.
h) There is zero hope for mitigating factors, the accusation has a closed wording which does not accept graduations, so you are running for wining or losing all at the table in just one move.
i) Do not expect all jurors will produce important opinions; even when they think you are not guilty they will be satisfied by voicing generalities and doubts (many-sided views help no one).
j) Finally, the motto 'without any reasonable doubt' is just a formality; nobody really cares about it.
k) Oh, yes, I forgot this one: a witness and his/her lawyer may stab you over and over, but cannot be involved together in an intimate relationship. This seems to be quite unacceptable (at least, though preposterous, some rule applies).
Of course, the ending shows that the quasi-bigoted judges and the police-evidence-creative officer were right, and the jurors were only partly wrong. But the holes in the plot are so huge that I would need to write a second review about them. Do not attempt to solve the mystery by abductive reasoning; lots of strong clues are just for distraction, and then forgotten.
Why I gave a 5 rating? Because the story has a high point when fostering a discussion about the dubious role and risks of a trial-by-jury system. These folks are dealing with a lot of personal issues, quickly arrive to primary conclusions and show reluctance to check facts and rethink about them, while mixing up the case with their own moral disturbances.
Carl takes notes, makes outlines and even introduce a clever question during the trial, but at the end is just as confused as his other mates (reasonable doubt is an unintelligible concept for him). Holly makes a contribution (the non-existent graduation scale) but, in fact, she is trying to lend a hand to Joeri, another troubled juror. Noël yields his place to Delphine, whose life saved from his
abusive husband, just to discover that - despite the appeal her agony escorted us during nine hours- she demonstrates a very poor level of attention and judgement. The only focused and lucid member turns out suddenly to be Arnold, a man with a complex of not being taken into account, but his arguments are dismissed without major fuss (as prophesized).
My conclusion does not entirely disapprove the trial by jurors procedure, but the series helps to better understand its stakes and potential weaknesses. Anyway, ten hours for such an achievement are too much, and I am not even sure the writers pretended it.",23 out of 40 found this helpful.,5.0,23 July 2020

1838,The Twelve, So many holes in so little time,"I really don't understand the high rating, nor the award this show received. It must be due to how corrupt the film industry is. That is the only sense I can logically make from this, because I must of said WTF to myself several times during episode one. When the episode ended I realized there's so many holes to fill, it'd be too much like work to continue watching the rest of the series. I'll explain a few of the holes.<br/><br/>
An alternate juror tries to hide that she's been selected from her husband. Hubby didn't want her to be selected and had her appear as an undesirable juror. So, how the hell is she supposed hide her jury role from hubby in one of the most media covered events in the country? And then one night at home while the wife's using the bathroom, hubby's watching the news and sees her on the tv. So, he gets pissed off and locks her in the bathroom from the outside of the bathroom. Why would anyone install a bathroom doorknob that locks from outside of a bathroom? WTF? It makes no sense whatsoever. Perhaps in following episodes the viewers discover that the husband's some kind of freak who likes to lock people in his bathroom forcing his stink upon them.<br/><br/>
Then there's the scene that takes place at the hospital with a detective and a mother who arrives in a panic because of her child's ER admission. The frantic mother is desperately trying to find out what happened to her child when the lead detective tells her she must sign some paperwork. The mother's confused but she signs it anyway probably with the hopes it'll bring her to her child. That's when detective Bitter B¡tch tells the mother she's going to make sure she's found responsible for the murder of her own child. WTF? The alleged crime just happened and any possible evidence hasn't had time to be gathered and processed. Does detective Bitter B¡tch have psychic abilities? Maybe the frantic mother's ex husband caused her to be suspect, but still, anything he said needs to be properly investigated.<br/><br/>
These are only a few of the many holes in episode one. There are so many strange holes in the show's premiere episode, there's no way to write enough material for the remaining episodes to fill all of them with any sense.

1840,The Twelve," Compelling character, interesting story but has issues","Story is very complex, with lots of characters who have interesting stories, from which some are connected, some are not. Acting is on point, well done. Case of double murder is very interesting and got my attention from the start. I was hooked from episode 1. Also, Belgian series like in all other northern European countries, have that cold, grey winter quality, which gives a sense of hopelessness and depression. There is no usual glamour we are used to from Hollywood movies, most colors are grey, black and possibly brown. There is a certain sense of doom. Characters look like ordinary people, which I like. They have their own life and personal stories, nothing glamorous about it, just like in real life. But they still manage to be interesting to follow.
However, on the bad side, spoilers coming... some character's stories have absolutely nothing to do with the case and go nowhere. They just show us how personal lives of jury can affect the case. Problem is, in such high profile case, most of jury looks totally not interested in case. They are too obsessed with their own problems and look at the case through their own issues. Maybe that was a point though. The most problematic is the last episode. After so much investment into showing us how many witnesses actually lied and how much inconsistencies are in all the testimonies, and how even police detective lied (personally, I really hated her! She was so unprofessional), and social worker lied, and all witnesses lied. Most ""professionals"" were totally unprofessional. That detective woman lied, planted ""evidences"", and without any doubt from the start of investigation had one single person decided as suspect. Then she led investigation strictly into proving she is right. Even if she was, that is scary and unprofessional. Social worker forged case against mother because her dad was in relationship with mother of woman who is step mom of murdered child. How is she not arrested? Lawyer in case who is in relationship with witness? For God's sake! Then they just served us surprise ending in last 2 minutes and left us audience feeling like idiots. I was very disappointed, nothing was explained! If you pack crime case in 10 hours at least bother to explain whole case in details, and end it properly.

Additionally, the logical questions postulated regarding aspects of freewill and whether or not a person can be judged before they commit a crime were magnificent! Furthermore, every character added a significant element that made them both likable and unforgettable. Finally, the animation was beautiful, and the music significantly heightened every situation. In many ways I would say this series is already comparable to a series like ""Cowboy Bebop"".<br/><br/>In short, Psycho-Pass is a juicy sophisticated anime that will appeal to many mystery/sci-fi fans. It is animated craftsmanship and definitely worth the watch.",69 out of 75 found this helpful.,9.0,6 November 2014
1848,Psycho-Pass, Cyberpunk anime when it is best.,"This is an anime that will undoubtedly be among the best of the best in the near future with its excellent plot, character development and intelligence. It is expected by the viewer that he/she has a certain knowledge of classic literature like 1984 and Gulliver's Travels in order to fully appreciate the story. GITS SOC brings to the table the question about AI, Robotics and social disruption/cohesion. This delves much deeper into the issues about what is the absolute best political/social order? Is it like in Foucault's panoptican where you have as few guardians as possible who watch from their watchtower the entire prison/society? Or Weber's thought on the political elites who must be the most unbiased in the society in order to lessen corruption as much as possible? <br/><br/>This series will be appreciated by the viewer who searches for depth, suspense and action. <br/><br/>You like Blade Runner, GITS SOC, Neon Genesis?

1849,Psycho-Pass, Incredible,"In a dystopian Japan, the so-called ""Sybil System"", an autarkic omnipresent surveillance framework, controls the lives of the country's population in the pursuit of optimal happiness. It monitors aptitude, potential, and psychic health of its inhabitants. By means of the Psycho-Pass, an individual psychological fingerprint, stress levels are measured and preemptive measures are taken, should a citizen display anomalous behavior such as depression or the intent/latency to commit a crime. The latter finds expression in a number called the ""Crime Coefficient"", a characteristic showing the latent criminal potential of a person. Once this number surpasses a certain threshold, this person is branded since there is virtually no chance of reducing this number again. Set against this background, a crime unit investigates into a series of murders that set the stage for what I find to be one the most compelling and complex Anime series in recent years.<br/><br/>What begins as a well-executed alteration of Orwell and Dick, soon turns out to touch so many additional topics that I was actually surprised and happy to see that the shear audacity to put all this into one show did neither ruin the flow nor the arc of suspense. On the contrary, all the references to literature, the philosophical discourse, the sociological aspects are woven astoundingly well into the plot. Name it, it's there: Kantian ethics, Max Weber's sociology of domination, Sartre's existentialism, Foucault, etc. All this is combined with contemporary phenomena such as the loss of privacy, alienation in urban areas, and the boundlessness of human beings that are overwhelmed by an overly complex reality.<br/><br/>The show is action-packed and VERY graphic, has brilliant character development and is emotionally very demanding to say the least.<br/><br/>Watch it and be blown away!",58 out of 79 found this helpful.,10.0,11 March 2013
1850,Psycho-Pass, Brilliant story and lines!,"""Ghost In The Shell,"" ""Innocence,"" or ""Blade Runner"" fans, those who seek thought-provoking realities into a story, or people who like watching stories that make you think about technology and humanity. Then, you may also like to watch ""Psycho-Pass.""<br/><br/>Technological advancement and lack of humanity is an open question all- time throughout the history. While we are seeking to enrich our lives by using gadgets and machines, we may lose something important as human beings. What if we are born in a safe society where criminals and even potential criminals are managed and isolated from the society in order not to harm other good citizens, and they are guaranteed to live in the society with given happiness. We may not even have questions about morality.<br/><br/>In the story, a person's mental state is simultaneously measured, and the value is determined whether the person is potentially a criminal and is killed depending on the state level. The police officers use a gun, but the gun is only fired if the targeting person's mental state is measured as dangerous, seemingly it also helps them avoid shooting the wrong person. Akane Tsunemori is a novice officer who is in charge of solving crimes with other members.<br/><br/>One of the things that astonishes me is the dialogues where characters talk, referring to quotes from famous authors such as Philip K. Dick, George Orwell, Gulliver Travels, Wiliam Gibson, Macbeth, Humlet, etc. The lines that characters speak casts philosophical questions as to what is justice and what is an ideal society.<br/><br/>I really like the story in which it depicts a different aspect of the technological world from Ghost In the Shell or Blade Runner, yet somehow it reminds me of those epic anime and films.",23 out of 32 found this helpful.,9.0,28 May 2014
1851,Psycho-Pass, Best anime of 2012!!!!! By far!!,"Well little to say here except that this series is by far the best of 2012(anime).<br/><br/>The plot is: In the near future, it is possible to instantaneously measure a person's mental state, personality, and the probability that a person will commit crimes with a device installed on each citizen's body called the Psycho-Pass. When this probability, measured by the ""Crime Coefficient"" index, is too high in some individuals those individuals are pursued and apprehended—with lethal force, if necessary. This task is performed by a special team of potential criminals called Enforcers, who are supervised by police officers known as Inspectors; the Inspectors ensure that Enforcers perform their duties within the constraints of the law. Enforcers and Inspectors employ special weapons called ""Dominators"" that are designed to fire only on those with a higher than normal Crime Coefficient. The story follows Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division.<br/><br/>I give it a 10/10 for story/animation/characters/and even soundtrack.

1857,Psycho-Pass, An interesting premise that provides closure,"I am primarily taking the time to review this, as while the only other review here at the time of writing, makes good points, I disagree on it's quality, and the issues are fresh in my mind, as the last episode is presently still on my screen. <br/><br/>I was extremely pleased to learn the series had continued, I felt the first Psycho Pass was a surprising hit, which attempted to add to the GITS, Deus Ex or cyberpunk societal dystopia type anime, which is among the most interesting style of anime entertainment, IMO. <br/><br/>I do not believe Psycho Pass managed to reach '9/10' heights, but it did pose interesting questions and I did want more.<br/><br/>For Psycho Pass 2... the assistant inspector character is simply so illogically blind to the obviousness of the truths around here, from the beginning, that it is somewhat immersion breaking. <br/><br/>The previous reviewer seemed to feel that was explainable by only fools being chosen to be police officers. I'm seeing a bit of disconnect there however. Perhaps that is how this series chose to present the situation, but I didn't get that vibe from the original series, and it's just too ridiculous. The 'hounds' are far more capable thinkers, as were the officers originally. That is poor writing, bending the reality of the world they created to serve their point. <br/><br/>(Which better writing could've avoided)<br/><br/>Additionally there are, IMO, several aspects that are poorly written justifications for scenarios. <br/><br/>Although overall, I am still pleased there was more of this world to watch, I enjoyed the literary and historical references and the overall warnings the show presents. <br/><br/>I would simply argue that Psycho Pass '1' was the superior work. <br/><br/>I don't think anything plot or characterisation wise was better done here, and of course, Psycho Pass 1 was great, because it was better than many other things, not because it was actually an amazingly cerebral work of art, to the standards of GITS. <br/><br/>There are too many 'plot sheep', but I suppose there are in life as well. <br/><br/>However unlike our reality, the evils of society, are extremely obvious, unchanging and clear cut. IMO, more black and white, than a show discussing these themes should have - and far moreso than Psycho Pass 1 - but then this IS a continuation. <br/><br/>Still worth watching!",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,7.0,29 July 2015
1858,Psycho-Pass, A dystopian masterpiece,"This anime deserves a standing ovation for its compelling story telling and its mastery of plot twists. The story has a similar premise to Blockbuster movie Minority Report and also has a resemblance to iRobot . Psycho-Pass is set in a dystopian future where crime deterrence and crime punishment is very severe. The Sibyl system - an artificial intelligence network - is a supposedly impartial law enforcing ""entity"" that is able to discern the mental state of a human, enabling it to judge the criminal activity of their mind. A person with a very cloudy Psycho-Pass - an undesirable murky discolouration manifested on an electronic device - is deemed mentally unstable and needs to be dealt with immediately. Victims and criminals alike may be judged, all at the mercy of the Sibyl system. <br/><br/>The police force consists of intellectuals who work with a select few criminals, known as enforcers, who are responsible for the tracking of other criminals. The notion of working alongside criminals because criminals have a greater intuition when needing to anticipate the actions of another criminal is intriguing. Akane is the female protagonist in the show. She is very clever but lacks the killer- instinct to track down criminals. Her main role is to supervise the enforcers and she has the discretion to kill an enforcer who deviates from their line of duty. Each police force member and enforcer that are on missions, carry a weapon called a dominator which can read the crime coefficient of a target. If the target is judged to be very dangerous, a lethal mode status is declared which primes the dominator for a life ending shot.<br/><br/>Akanae throughout the story is troubled by moral decisions. Her main enforcer partner Kogami is difficult to read. He has his own agenda on his mind and is hell bent on solving an old case that matters a lot to him. What is his dark and sad past? Be prepared to see the development of Akane as she deals with challenging situations and faces predicaments that push her to the very limits. What future awaits Kogami? Will he solve his case?<br/><br/>The anime has many literary and philosophical references e.g. The Most dangerous game, a book by Richard Connell. These references add an extra intellectual dimension to this great anime.<br/><br/>Several crime are committed and there is a mastermind who pulls the strings and orchestrates most of the crimes. The villain is fascinating. He reminded me of Light from Death Note and Johann from Monster. Easily one of the greatest villains conceived.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Sybil system is very mysterious. What is it? How does it function? These are questions you might ponder and there will be an answer. <br/><br/>The opening theme is very unique. It might take time to get used to it but it fits the dystopian theme really well. Additionally, the animation quality is great which should not be surprising considering that it is a relatively new anime in the grand scheme of things. This anime has great pacing and does not peak early like for example Death Note which suffered from a premature peak after a certain character died. <br/><br/>Overall, if you like dystopian anime, suspense, action and like being intellectually engaged, this anime will grant you immense joy. The plot is just awe-inspiring. What are you waiting for? Go watch it! Oh... and by the way, a second season is already being worked on. Can not wait for it.",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,9.0,23 June 2014
1859,Psycho-Pass, Great but season three was unnecessary,"I really enjoyed this anime and the unique concept. I loved the idea of a futuristic society obsessed with maintaining peace and order and how we saw the characters question the legitimacy of the Sibyl system. I thoroughly enjoyed season one, and was shocked that I enjoyed season two as much as I did as a significant character was no longer present. But season three was completely unnecessary. All of the original characters were pretty much removed from the show without a trace and it failed to answer the questions I would've thought would have been answered in the final season. It was a real shame as I would've rated the anime much higher if the third season didn't exist. Personally, I would recommend still watching season 1 and 2, but I'd skip 3 unless you're okay with your experience being ruined.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,12 July 2020
1860,Psycho-Pass, Sybil system was a mistake,"I love anime that put my brain into gear such as: Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost in the Shell... even though most of the time I don't understand the hidden meaning behind the anime it still left a deep impression on me so it no surprise that after discovering Psycho-Pass a few days later I managed to marathon the hell out of the series and now it has become one of my favorite anime series of all time. There 2 season, each one deal with a different anti protagonist and each one ask the character and the audience a good question about what is right and wrong in our beliefs but in my opinion season 1 is superior because the main villain Shougo Makishima honestly is the best anime villain I've seen in a long time while Kirito Kamui of season 2 is just okay. I also don't flat out hate the main character Akane despite her self-righteous personality got herself and the team into big trouble because after all she is the one us audience supposed to be related the most but to see her make the same mistakes over and over kind of annoying not gonna lie",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,15 February 2019
1861,Psycho-Pass, Intelligent and disturbing,"The anime really is something else. Although it starts off as rather fast-paced, it truly compensates for it by letting you make up your own mind on the issues depicted instead of having them dished on a silver platter. The viewer is introduced to a world, where every person is scanned for their Psycho-Pass, a 'hue' that reflects their current affinity towards crimes. <br/><br/>Law enforcement is based on the Sibyl system (calculating these crime coefficients) in the people and directing the 'police' towards those with very clouded hues (reaching crime coefficients above 100). The 'police' consists of investigators (detectives) and enforcers (former detectives whose hues have permanently clouded or potentially criminal individuals with useful abilities) and they incapacitate (for mandatory rehabilitation) or eliminate the criminals according to their Psycho-Pass, which can be scanned by aiming a specialized weapon at the target. The investigators and enforcers each must synch with their weapon beforehand and the target can only be shot when their crime coefficient reaches a critical value, which means that investigators or enforcers cannot act without the permission of the Sybil system.<br/><br/>At first glance it seems a little outlandish and the concept of such a Psycho-Pass is debatable. But as we follow a newly assigned female investigator on her quest to fulfill her duty, one realizes that the anime is much, much darker than anticipated and it raises several central questions about how far humanity should go to enforce order and harmony, how much personal freedom a given individual should be allowed and whether or not that freedom is more important than safety. <br/><br/>The conversations throughout the anime are intelligent, well constructed and not over the top. The protagonists are likable, capable and each of them is in his/her own way unique and relevant. Even the villain is a highly intriguing, interesting and well-read individual. There is character development in all the protagonists and the action scenes are amazing and thrilling. Some scenes are deeply disturbing and although not overly gory, still quite violent in nature. There is no boring minute in this anime and the mysterious tone just adds to the suspense of it all. <br/><br/> I therefore recommend it to anyone who's an attentive watcher, has a passion for thrillers and likes to think about deeper questions regarding human nature and the ideal society.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,12 October 2018
1862,Psycho-Pass, Amazing,"this anime was amazing, first the setting.(also i am an avid anime viewer so i have watched enough to judge this) Setting and Story -the cyber punk world of Psycho-Pass is extraordinary the 'Sibyl System' has great philosophy and poses really good questions about society, law judgment and order etc. also the visuals for the setting of japan in this anime is beautiful. The Sibyl System is actively measuring the people's mental states, personalities, that will commit crimes, using a ""cymatic scan"" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a 'Psycho-Pass' . When the chance of a person engaging in crimes measured by the Crime Coefficient exceeds a certain level in an individual, he or she is pursued and/or killed if necessary. This concept is just amazing.<br/><br/>Characters and Characterization- so are main female lead is Akane Tsunemori, he is a headstrong believer when it comes to justice her views really shape the series as a whole, as the series progresses she becomes aware of her boundaries and she is a very well shaped character and not your average anime girl which i can accept. and then there is are male lead Shinya Kogami a sort of rebel cop who really has strong views to society and his dialog is amazing, he also is a person of great value to the series but he stays for season 1 though, he is another well rounded character and this stays consistent through the series, on a side note the characterization of sibyl system a collective entity is a very nice step forward than your average hive mind villain or terminator sky-net.<br/><br/>Animation and Sound- Should i say more Porduction IG has out did them selves when it comes to the animation and the choice of soundtrack they went for is a different approach but it was good none the less, and yeah that is much i can say about it. oh and this anime is not for the light hearted because the leave no censorship when it came to its violent and gory nature.<br/><br/>The Villains- Shogo Makashima a criminally asymptomatic individual whose primary goal was to liberate the Japan of the Sibyl System. He is one f the best villain in all of anime. he is complex but sharp and mentions many pieces if classic literature e.g Gulliver's's travels and many others, Makishima is a humanist on the dark side: someone hopelessly in love with cruelty, savagery but he make you wonder. Kirito Kamui- He is a unique villain unlike Shogo Makashima he is a collective entity of one being who is like the Sibyl System, He is similar to the Sibyl System because in that he is also a collective mind housed in a physical body. Because of this, Sibyl is unable to render neither a Psycho-Pass nor a Crime Coefficient on Kamui, which leads him to deduce that Sibyl is a flawed system of justice. He believes, rightly or wrongly, that a perfect judge should be able to evaluate itself, as well as others.and this is just brilliant concept that should be explored further.(note Kamui is the main villain for season 2)<br/><br/>this anime has a very good English dub that is enjoyable and the sub is also very good i like them both but i just love the concept for the series as a whole. but this anime is not for the light hearted i mind you that, the shear blood and gore is understandable i would recommend anyone who is interested or who just love sci fi to check it out and as an anime it is beautiful, did i forget to mention the writing for this series is beautiful and they mentioned things like the Onimpetence Paradox.<br/><br/>I loved it and i understand if people wouldn't watch this or dislike the anime for any reason.

1863,Psycho-Pass, Is it Utopia or Dystopia - Psychology Philosophy Mystery at it's best,"I enjoyed both the seasons, well made, very cleaver in using paradox's to build up the superb plots. The mind game between the police and criminals along with the justice theme reminds me of Death Note, just instead of magic we have technology this time around. The series is based on a future where technology has progressed so much that by a Psycho scan the state of mind of an individual can be predicted and action can be taken to prevent them from becoming criminals. Further to maintain the sanity of the detectives, they are encouraged not to do the killings, instead latent criminals who are already considered to be criminals do it for dirty work and are called enforcers. Psyco Pass got a lot of philosophy with deep meaning underlining the plots. Philip K. Dick, George Orwell and Jonathan Swift work are mentioned and discussed.

1864,Psycho-Pass, A series every politician and cop needs to be watching right now,"If the premise of this series seems vaguely familiar to you, you have probably read or seen The Minority Report by Phillip K Dick. Having said that, this series takes the original concepts and runs to places with them that even PKD didn't go. Extremely well-thought out ideas abound about the future of the web, everyday hologram use, future criminal behavior, intelligent weapons and the ultimate uses of wearable tech are both ever-present and scattered everywhere in this series like easter eggs, and if you are interested in the direction our interactions with politics, technology, surveillance and the internet are going, this is required viewing.<br/><br/>The characters do stick, by and large, to traditional Japanese animation conventions, but I found that in this particular series they were more in line with Western expectations for a crime drama and were fascinating and believable once you adjust to the usual subtitle issues. This anime could be remade tomorrow as a western TV show or film and I believe it would do well (even after we censored the crap out of it); this is very accessible, emotional, and beautiful film making. The problems they face are solved in believable ways and that alone is extraordinary for an anime series. The violence is very adult and I would not let a child or even a weak stomached adult watch this. It's simply far too bloody and the situations are both adult and emotionally difficult. Throw in the serious questions this series poses about human behavior, the government's place in shaping it and government oversight, and it's a tough brew to process all at once.<br/><br/>Much of what this series has to say are things we really need to be thinking about right now: The effect of violence on both victims and the police who choose to protect them, the undue focus and prejudice of the police, press and society on minorities and the poor, and the ability of corporations and the wealthy to ignore or shield themselves from the law and the massive injustices that this ultimately causes are all issues touched on by this VERY adult series.<br/><br/>As far as anime goes, this is a 10.

1869,Psycho-Pass, Fascinating and ambitious themes for one solid anime,"In a future not that far away, Japan is administered by ""Sibyl"", a presumably inerrable system that monitors the population according to their mental health, which can be instantaneously determined by ""cymatic scans"". Persons whose potential for crime exceeds regulation values (""latent criminals"") are taken in preventive isolation from society, where they can get treatment or be executed if their ""Crime Coefficient"", in short psycho-pass, oversteps a threshold. <br/><br/>The series follows the Public Safety Bureau that is in charge of carrying out Sybil's order and taking care of rogue latent criminals, making this a sci-fi, noiresque detective story. <br/><br/>Throughout the episodes the flaws and limitations of the Sibyl System and this hyper-controlling society are explored in depth, fostering cunning philosophical debates on freedom, human nature, justice and the optimal workings of society. This is made possible by clever, educated characters who throw political theory and literary quotes at each other's head like its their hobby. The whole idea of dividing society according to mental health is like a dark twist on ""the value of inner beauty"": here characters compliment each other on the ""beautiful hue"" of their psycho-pass. The story never indulges in manicheanism, thanks to a charismatic and highly intelligent antagonist, and also thanks to the varied moralities of the main cast that are all equally justified.<br/><br/>I love this series because of its very consistent and clever world-building, never deviating too far from our world but rather increasing worrying tendencies that already exists. The people that inhabit it have values and attitudes that in part differ wildly from our own but that are the logical consequence of the way their society works, so much that some viewers apparently have trouble considering their behaviors ""realistic"". Still, people are people, and ""Psycho-Pass"" manages to convey a very humane story in a setting that many would consider sterile, and show off many facets of that entrancing world.<br/><br/>I also love the underlying grim and sad tone of this anime; there's a sense of tragedy to see the characters struggle to find sense and dignity in a very cold and impersonal system, and it is rendered beautifully. Also, the connection between cops and criminals way of thinking is explored, which I found very interesting.<br/><br/>My main reservations concerning this anime is that I didn't really empathize with the characters, at least not in the first half of the series. The more likable characters have secondary roles, while it took me quite a long while to warm up to Akane and Kogami, the main dudes. But I did in the end, so be patient! Also, the story-line of the first episodes isn't particularly compelling; I went on watching because I saw the potential in it, and wasn't disappointed since it really takes flight and soars high in the second half of the series. <br/><br/>The animation is ambitious, with gorgeous scenery and lightning, although the characters feel a bit stiff at time and some of the faces lack diversity (I'm especially thinking of the episode at an all-girl boarding school). The voice acting is excellent. The fight scenes are dynamic (but beware the gore, especially aimed at women), the music is great. <br/><br/>Verdict: this anime rewards the patient viewer in many ways, and gives more food for thoughts than anything I've seen or read lately, and that's a big deal for me. If you like it when a media takes its audience seriously and doesn't spoon feed you everything, than this is for you.<br/><br/>P.S: haven't seen season 2, don't intend to either, so this review only is about Psycho-Pass Season 1",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,13 February 2017
1870,Psycho-Pass," An impressive blend of crime, psychology and philosophy.","There is probably nothing I like more than stories that further develop and question sociological and philosophical ideas of freedom, justice and prosperity. And when the concept is entirely turned around like in this anime, it is bound to get me interested.
""What would happen if our society was ruled by an allknowing device that judges who is bad and who is good?"" is the question this anime answers, and it does it very well.<br/><br/>To start off with the negatives...
I didn't feel like I wanted to continue watching after the first few episodes. In the beginning, a lot of exposition gets splashed at you, making it a bit hard to follow and slightly confusing. The good thing is though, that the protagonist Akane is just as confused as you are, and you get to experience the conflicts in the story together with her. I was also put off by the gory presentation of how the main weapons in the anime work, thinking it was a bit too exaggerating for an anime focused on solving crimes. However, once you really start to grasp what kinds of twisted things happen in the background, the gore of the weapon is the last thing that troubles you.<br/><br/>And now the good parts.
The writers did an outstanding job in evolving Akane's character. Through interaction with her fellow colleagues, both inspectors and enforcers, she questions her job, the validity of the system she had sworn to serve and her own purpose in this world. At the end of season one, on the very last scene, I believe you will find yourself extremely satisfied with the way the story has done a full circle and with the way Akane has developed into a respected inspector.<br/><br/>The villain? Picture The Dark Knight's Joker; remove the silly costume, add more philosophy into his criminal intents - and Shogo Makashima is born. The same chills you get by watching Heath Ledger's performance will pass through your spine once again, perhaps even slightly amplified due to the fact that this show doesn't hold back on gore. However this time, there will be no one who can pass judgement on Makashima; and that is the spark that lights the fire of this anime.<br/><br/>This is the first crime-related anime I've seen, and I can say I am satisfied with the way it ended. And should you be interested in answering the question above, or just want to find a nice way to spend your in-front-of-the-screen time, I will recommend it to you.

The story line was also a surprise because what I anticipated, was not important because there's no way to predict how any of this will pan out for anyone involved in this story. There's a good cross-section of sub-plots that works well and the Direction and editing makes this a very slick production indeed. There is nothing left to question at the end and I suppose all this together makes it feel very real and at times very heart breaking. While not all will rate the series as highly as myself, I think there will be very few who are not satisfied story and production.

Great acting, writing and an interesting setting, based in my very hometown of Berlin. What made this show so great though was that the dialogues and characters were very believeable.<br/><br/>It seems that all of this died along with Vince at the end of the fist season.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the second season I sensed something was off. None of the characters are likeable anymore. They are rendered to either one-dimensional overly macho aggressive sexists, cowards or wives that stick for whatever reasons to these idiots.
The story is way over top at lost all of the believeabilty that made the first season so great.<br/><br/>This adds to my experience that eventually every TV series is loosing it's spirit at some point. (Breaking Bad is the rare exception). For some this happens in season 5 or 6, for others early on. Unfortunately 4Blocks falls in the the latter category. So do yourself a favour, just stop after the first season and remember it as one of Germany's finest TV moments.",17 out of 53 found this helpful.,5.0,16 November 2018

Women are shown as weak, subservient, and lacking in every way. I can only presume anyone giving this programme a high score has childish visions of manly bravado being important to watch.

1895,4 Blocks, Painfully bad,"While the expectations for this series are carried by the general interest in lurid topics, the series itself fails miserably at telling a gripping story while displaying an authentic portrayal of an urban demimonde. Instead of showing a harsh reality or to surprise with an unexpected twist, the whole story suffers from the constant attempt at staying politically correct. While convulsively avoiding any negative clichés, the series itself has become the cliché of the overly ambitious filmmaker who is rather interested in shaping the viewers opinion than creating an interesting plot. The dull acting doesn't help much, but the depiction of the antagonist ""rocker-gang"" - as one of many examples - is beyond ridiculous. The migrant thugs talk like primary school teachers, a quick research on youtube would have given the filmmakers a realistic insight into the habitus of streetwise criminals, i don't see any shortage in rapper-interviews to inquire. Even a daytrip to Berlins Neukölln district would make you question the authentic angle of the series pretty quickly.
While other productions like ""Gomorrha"" or ""Top Boy"" don't shy away from showing somewhat realistic scenarios (perhaps because ""Gomorrha"" is based on a book that covers actual events, and ""4 Blocks"" is basically fantasy), ""4 Blocks"" stays in the soft realm of the non-credible but socially accepted good/evil-narrative.",43 out of 187 found this helpful.,1.0,13 February 2018
1896,4 Blocks," Best, good, and could be better","4 Blocks kicks off as one of the most engaging crime series I have ever seen. Interesting premise, convincing performances, gripping storyline. By the end of Season 1, I was sure this was gonna be one of my all-time favs. Regrettably, the creators failed to live up to the standards they set up in Season 1. Season 2 never delivered anything as exciting, but some of the twists were questionable, to say the least. Season 3 continued its journey downhill as it became as desperate attempt at re-making what we already saw. One of the toughest tasks for show runners, ending the series properly,was the lowest moment in all three seasons.
However, I am still giving it 7 out of 10, because acting was truly great, and the series did a great job showing me just one other side to Berlin. This is one is just a gem for fans of Gomorra or Subura or even The Sopranos. Just be ready for some serious hole in the story in later parts of the show.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,7.0,23 March 2021

It is always refreshing to watch another episode, and the new episodes are always better than the last episode, which is entertaining because we can always look forward to the next episode and the show supplies a constant supply of new and episodes that are always funny and engaging. Because K.C is a spy, this allows the show to explore and interact with a variety of unique and different locations and situations, different from other shows, which makes the series far more entertaining and engaging. I believe that K.C Undercover is suitable for children and always makes me laugh. The show's characters all have a unique character, and they all blend well with each other and allow the show to explore these new locations and interact in the funniest way possible, and the jokes always make me laugh.

It brings back old Disney in a nice way and the humor is refreshing as well. The characters are interesting and dynamic, and the sibling teasing is playful and amusing. Hopefully, it stays on air for longer than two years, unlike I Didn't Do It, which I still don't understand why it was cut off air. It was probably one of the better Disney shows at the time, anyway. And it would have been better if they had wrapped up the series in a nice, finale episode, but no, instead it was just cancelled out of nowhere. That kind of annoyed me for a while. Hopefully, that's not the case with this show, though.

1901,K.C. Undercover, Best Show Currently On,"Disney Channel surprised many with the introduction of ""Girl Meets World"" and especially ""K.C. Undercover,"" when network and cable series were in a yawning, cliché rut, chasing trends. Here you have a teen in highschool who isn't a behavioral disappointment with her oppositional mood disorder dissing common sense. She's smart, she's athletic, her government trusts her with important secrets as she's good at thinking on her feet, and she can't dance (a reference to the star's previous show, a dance competition, where she placed second, actually). The parents aren't cut from the same cloth as all the other one-dimensional, ineffective parents in TV heaven.<br/><br/>Some episodes do seem padded out (the retirement home episode, for one) but all generally are watchable even during rerun season. Ernie, the brother, is the most cliché character, being he's her opposite in every way, though he's learning to become a successful ladies-man. <br/><br/>Hopefully the biracial Ms. Coleman will embrace her bi-racialness one day and bring that to the forefront of her public statements, in that biracial people are torn between their white friends, who pull them to the Caucasian culture, and their black friends, who pull them to their black culture, while being biracial is its own culture altogether and should be celebrated, not ignored and abandoned, an ambassador to both sides as it also could be. Of course, as an actress others will try to push Zendaya into the drug culture moreover, unfortunately, so this lovely, classy, multi-talented entertainer has a lot of stress factors to deal with I'm sure. This fan hopes she as successful as her K.C character in traversing the minefield of show business!<br/><br/>UPDATE. The long-awaited last season is proving to be a big disappointment, with padded-out scenarios and disinterested acting. The one with the crying baby managed to displace the old folks home episode as worst-ever! The only highlight of Season 3 is seeing Ms Coleman in a black Homecoming Dance gown slit to her thighs, and showing off those fabulous legs, an acknowledgement that the actress is more beautiful than how she presents herself at movie premiers, award ceremonies and gala balls. Can't wait to see her in ""A While Lie"" coming soon to the big screen.<br/><br/>SECOND UPDATE. Is the show over already by Thanksgiving 2017? The clip show beat the crying baby episode as the worst-ever. Third season is getting to be a big disappointment. ""Stuck In The Middle"" had a better clip show, and that's not a great show normally.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION. How they dumped the second half of the final season on a two week window with little advanced notice! It seems all abandoned the project long before it ended. At least ""Hannah Montana"" ""Jesse"" and ""Girl Meets World"" stuck with it until the end. If Miley can be dedicated enough to care right until the final show, then the cast and writers and producers here should have too.

1904,K.C. Undercover, A Very Refreshing Show with a Strong Main Character,"K.C. Undercover is a refreshing, detective-based sitcom that introduces very different characters with many personalities. It's pretty funny and has diabolical schemes that hold one's attention; however, it can also be a bit boring at times. K.C.'s acting is very well done and her fighting is excellent. She is very energetic and realistic when she fights and her determination is very sharp. But, because her character outside of her spying is distant from people, the show can get a bit boring to watch. She doesn't participate in anything more than her spy work, which creates a monotony. The seriousness of K.C. is balanced well by her friend, Marissa, who does a good job of looking foolish. Every character acts very well, and there is no over the top screaming or obnoxiousness.<br/><br/>What stands out is K.C.'s strong fighting skills and power. Many shows that take 'females' in such roles don't do a good job, when the wimps can't even wield a sword with force, obviously because they had no encouragement or open participation in sports as children and because of shitty stereotypes, etc. Zendaya, however, has all the power, energy, and strength needed to look strong. Her moves are very precise. And instead of wearing irritating, little pink skirts everywhere, she actually looks like a normal person who has more brain resources for important, real things.

Dog with a Blog for crying out loud is a show! However, I started to watch KC Undercover and at first I was grudgingly thinking okay...that was kinda funny. To chuckling to snorting to actual laughter to rewinding because it was so funny. Her parents are cool and actually quite funny and smart. KC is mathematician nerd who can't talk yet is quite proud of being a girl AND defeating villains. Plus, the show's fight scenes are AWESOME. I adore KC and Clarisa's relationship as well as adorkable Ernie. My only problem is that I would like Ernie to have more shining moments. Nerd little brother is a little cliché, real character development would be cool. That goes for Clarisa too. She's fun and bubbly but I would like her to have more brains than beauty.

1909,K.C. Undercover," A really refreshing and interesting, fun show.","This show is very refreshing and features interesting ideas and motives for the characters. Only some characters have very bad acting, such as marissa and ernie. Still, because ernie can pull of being funny, he is tolerable and not bad. The main actress could have been better, even though her personality is supposed to be serious and uninterested, she could still be interesting. Being dull the entire time or pretending like you're misunderstood makes you annoying to watch. Other than that, the martial arts are very fun to watch, very real and interesting plots that involve the parents as well, not as irritating intervening people but as actual characters with important roles and personalities who enhance the show. It's amazing that this show is featuring a strong female character, very likable. What shows like this have to focus on is not demoting their own 'female empowerment' by making repulsive, sexist statements, like 'man up', or some female complaining about 'getting muscles', etc. Doing those type of things just makes the entire idea of the female lead being a strong fighter lame and fake, something for just entertainment and not achievable in the real world. This is another problem with my babysitter's a vampire, in which the female vampires are so powerful, yet sexist bullshi* is everywhere in the show, made by both the female and male characters. Other than that, k.c. undercover is really interesting to watch because the plots and acting, for the most part, are great. the scenes are too rushed, however, because they have to fit so much in a single episode.

When I saw commercial after commercial of this show, I thought I was going to HATE it. But Disney proved me wrong, because this is a fantastic show for some one like Zendaya. If you don't know Zendaya, #1, shame on you, and #2, she's an actress that is not unfamiliar to the Disney Channel crowd. She was in Shake It Up!, Frenemies, and Zapped. She is also a really great dancer, so it's not a big leap from dancing to kicks and punches. Zendaya plays K.C., a regular straight A student that wouldn't seem out of place on a TGIF sitcom. But, like in Hannah Montana, she also lives a double life as a SPY! So the show is mostly a Spy Kids version of Hannah Montana, but much funnier than Spy Kids and less musical than Hannah Montana. The show also has some other funny characters like K.C.'s parents, Ernie, Marisa, and J.U.D.Y., who all have great lines and mostly don't move into the stereotypical characters we've seen in other Disney Channel shows. They also have great guest stars, such as Bella Thorne, who played Zendaya's friend in Shake It Up!, and Raven from That's So Raven, one of my favorite shows from the early 2000s! Now this review is becoming too positive.I'm gonna have to nitpick. The only nitpick I have is that Marisa isn't a good enough character. She just seems like a useless character that could've been scraped. But even though I think that way, I don't HATE Marisa. In fact, I think that this show might be one of my top 5 favorite shows!

The only difference between this show and Kim is that it's live action with less suspense. Oh, yeah, and Kim Possible is actually GOOD.

There are some episodes where you get very hyped up and includes laughter and exceptional moments but it fails to include subtext and fails to drag viewers to love this series. K.C Undercover needs to have the capability of making viewers get more into their series and so far, it is not only failing but is showing weakness throughout the episodes. The reason I put a 5/10 is because I praise Zendaya's acting and funny scenes but the other characters are just making me lose my mind.

1921,K.C. Undercover, This show should have stayed undercover,"Disney's record hasn't exactly been stellar lately. Unfortunately, K.C. is another lackluster program to add to the list.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, this show smacks of unoriginality. There's a kid with a secret double life (similar to Hannah Montana, Phil of the Future, and Wizards of Waverly Place) and she has to choose between being normal and helping her family. Not only is the premise recycled, but the plots are too. The same awful special effects from ""Wizards"" and ""Phil of the Future"" (though I actually liked the latter show) linger. Nothing new here. <br/><br/>Sometimes, a show with a tired concept can shine because the actors salvage something. Certainly that is not the case here. The parents make other Disney parents look like Emmy winners, and the rest of the family just doesn't have it. The lead doesn't lend any charm to her part, and her friend plays the dumb blonde poorly.<br/><br/>Also, the writing, like so many other Disney programs of late, is filled with clichés and jokes that would only get a laugh from the laugh track. <br/><br/>Disney's concepts are getting more and more outlandish. No longer is Disney the premier channel for family entertainment. Barring ""Girl Meets World"" and ""Phineas and Ferb,"" there's nothing interesting on Disney now. I'd advise you to watch those shows with your kids or find some reruns of ""Even Stevens"" or ""Good Luck Charlie.""

1922,Grace Under Fire, My Favorite Sitcom,"""Grace Under Fire"" was a great sitcom. It had unique characters and a wonderful story line. Brett Butler was able to use some of her own life experiences to make the show realistic, yet funny. She did an excellent job of portraying Grace Kelly. Brett is the only comedian that I think fitted the role of Grace perfectly. The other cast members of the show were just as perfect for their roles. This show had a lot of talented people on it, and I wish the show was still on. This is, and always will be my favorite sitcom.",34 out of 40 found this helpful.,,13 October 2000

Just goes to show how fragile men and their little egos can be. This show was the best of the best. I'm sad the Big Recession had to end and all these Strong Women shows are over, and the Man Shows are back... because we NEED more brassy know-it-all women like Grace. We need an alternative to show our daughters on TV, to keep them from developing bulimia and learning phrases like ""Math is hard! Let's go shopping!""<br/><br/>If you had a hideous screeching racist mother-in-law, delinquent kids, a retarded deadbeat ex-husband, and a bunch of goober co-workers at the oil refinery, what would stop YOU from getting loaded? The fact that Grace stays sober under all this is as perfect a role model as you could wish for. The character doesn't (because she's a TV character), and I frankly don't care what the actress does. Grace is brilliant, incisive, witty, vulnerable, and after all, human.<br/><br/>Where else can you hear lines like: ""When we're married, we treat our men like vegetables; when we're divorced, we treat our vegetables like men""?

1925,Grace Under Fire, A Fire that needed stoking by the end,"I loved this series, starring Brett Butler as a strong, yet fallible, recovering alcoholic with three children and a history suitable for talk shows. Or I loved the first few seasons, anyway - my local station messed the show around so much that, when I finally got to see it again, the characters had changed, and most of the humour had gone. With the initial seasons of 'Grace Under Fire', I found it hard to believe the rumours about Butler's personal life intruding onto the set. In fact, I found it hard to believe that Grace Kelly (with a mother-in-law called 'Jean' Kelly - I loved those subtle references, and contradictions - how different could Grace have been from her film star namesake?) wasn't a real person. Everyone on the show in the early years were very believable and very, very funny, Butler and Dave Thomas (Russell, the pharmacist) especially. And far from being another cliched show about 'survivor'-type women, I admired the character of Grace in a way that I didn't with 'Roseanne', a show with a similar premise of a woman (and mother) battling against life. But, as with anything, I think Grace finally ran out of steam, and introducing an older, illegitimate son tipped the balance, in my opinion.",19 out of 23 found this helpful.,,16 August 2001

1929,Grace Under Fire, Underrated,"I think that Grace Under Fire was an underrated gem of a situational comedy series. Maybe it is because it was always pretty much overshadowed by the much more successful (and just as good) series Roseanne, which also featured a lower middle class struggling/working mom in middle America played by a quality standup comedienne. Roseanne Barr/Arnold's show actually probably was better but it got all the accolades and Grace Under Fire got none. I guess it's kind of like playing in the NBA when Michael Jordan's Bulls were dominating the sport. Brett Butler was great though, the story lines were realistic and meaningful, the jokes were very funny, the supporting cast was great. It's too bad the show completely fell apart in the end, I guess due to some personal problems of its star, because it was a great sitcom.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,9 January 2018
1930,Grace Under Fire, Watching the demise of a good comedy,"I remember thinking that 'Grace Under Fire' was a very funny show when I saw it on television years ago. Now, amazon prime has it for viewing free to Prime members, so I watched it again.<br/><br/>Today, with streaming and seasons on DVD, it's easy to binge-watch a series (watch all the episodes in chronological order). I did this, and enjoyed 'Grace' almost as much the second-time around. However, there is a tragic subtext to the episodes now. I knew that Brett Butler had some addiction issues but now it is evident how powerfully those problems can change a person's life - no matter what they have, or are given, or do. <br/><br/>Brett Butler is very, very funny. Once the writing comes together and you have watched several episodes, you will want to stick it out for the season and move on to the next. Mid-series, the writing starts to falter, the plots struggle, and Brett's problems in her real life start to intrude. By the end of the series, which was canceled mid-season (season 5), you feel like you are watching a horse about to be put down or sent to the glue factory. She's still got the lines, still makes you smile (sometimes) but she's deteriorating as a performer. She's forcing lines that shouldn't be forced. She's making you think of Judy Garland. <br/><br/>Other actors are jumping ship. The writers are throwing together notecards with key events summarized in one line and thrown away in the dialogue. Brett even has a bad haircut! A cardinal sin for an actress - have I said enough? The only thing missing is weight gain. I would feel sorry for this talented comedienne if it weren't for the waste of her gifts. Such a waste.<br/><br/>
Behind all this lurked the producers and writers who suffered while this very good series took a dramatic senseless dive. I have little sympathy for them. There were very big names attached to this project and they failed. Distracted, no doubt, by other shows they were producing that were easier to manage. But this: a perfect example of how anyone can make a show work if you throw enough money at it but real skill is needed when the signs are all there that this is not going to be a walk in the park. <br/><br/>
All the actors were fine (even Brett, when she was functioning well). Dave Thomas will always be a gold-star actor in any ensemble, and the same can be said of Tom Poston. Even the saccharine Libby (the character who was Grace's daughter) delivered reliably good performances. What happened to the writers that they wove plot lines into tangled messes and ignored some very strong themes that could have strengthened the show? As the team and the production of 'Grace Under Fire' got increasingly sloppy, the worst happened: Brett Butler became even more the center of every story and every scene. Which, as a person in the throes of addiction, she may have wanted desperately. So she got that - much to the detriment of the series. It ended, mercifully, before she had total meltdown on camera, as producers and writers stood by and watched (expressionless, I would imagine). <br/><br/>
I hope to see Brett in a series as funny as this started out to be - someday - with truly talented support behind her. Because she will need it!",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,6 May 2018

There are Grace's sisters Faith and Evie, and her intrusive mother-in-law Jean Kelly. There is Russell's father Floyd (Tom Poston). Grace is a recovering alcoholic since giving birth to Quentin and had given up Matthew (Tom Everett Scott) for adoption.<br/><br/>This Chuck Lorre show is similar to Roseanne if Roseanne got beaten by her drunken husband and left him. I can do without the abuse background which is hard for any comedy. There is good irreverent sarcasm from Butler. Thomas is a veteran who delivers. The cast sometimes barely hold back laughing at their own jokes. Libby and Quentin #2 are great. They're allowed to be little angels and devils. It's a good white trash sitcom.

So I watched it, even though I found Grace to be highly irritating and unbearable.<br/><br/>The only one redeeming factor to this show is Dave Thomas.

However, I still have nagging guilt and anxiety from growing up in the Midwest where ""good people"" don't smoke weed. ""Disjointed"" has characters and story lines that nearly anyone can relate to in some way. This show educates about, legitimizes, and normalizes marijuana use. The humor ranges from gentle empathy to in-your-face hilarity! I can't count how many different emotions I feel from one moment to the next.<br/><br/>Most of the time the jokes and banter are mundane and realistic, then you are hit with psychedelic animation, and finally, a giant dose of adolescent ridiculousness that smacks you in the head with the characters of Dank and Dabby. At first, I was taken aback by them, but now I can't wait until they show up! They represent the child-like joy and wonder that abuse victims rarely get to experience. I wrote this review to thank the creators of this show for helping me give myself permission to feel happy :) Ruth's Alternative Care (the fictional cannabis shop in the show) has indirectly cared for me for real.",36 out of 42 found this helpful.,10.0,3 September 2017
1943,Disjointed, It really is recorded in front of a live audience - I was there!,"I attended live recordings of the last two shows (#19/#20) of this series in June (2017) at Warner Studios, Burbank. I can assure you that the laughter you hear is from a live audience. The expense to produce a multi-camera sitcom in front of a live audience is not insignificant. I don't understand how reviewers can be so confident that the laughter is canned. <br/><br/>Watching it on TV is even funnier because I can pause it and give myself time to complete my laugh before moving on. And I can replay it as well.<br/><br/>The show is funny and goofy yet it has a heart and soul too. If you stick with it for a few shows, it will definitely grow on you. It takes some time to understand the individual characters and their relationships. The last taping we saw, which was the 20th and last show of this series, contained some very heart rending moments with beautiful resolutions.<br/><br/>This last recording was also few days from Kathy Bates' birthday. The staff brought out a cake and we all sang happy birthday to her. It was a very nice vibe.<br/><br/>My big question is how does Betsy Sodaro (Dabby) create those crazy expressions? Does she practice in front of a mirror or do they just come naturally? She is sooooo funny.",46 out of 57 found this helpful.,9.0,5 September 2017
1944,Disjointed, Only in the 5.0 Ratings? Yea right!,"I have no clue how this has such a relatively low rating...Hope gets better rated in time. This comedy is actually pretty funny and I really love how they went more rated pg-13/R instead of a pg like Big Bang or other 30 minute comedies. At first (For first few minutes) I admit, I was disappointed that this was one of those comedies where you can hear the audience laughing and such (Dont know proper term for that kind), BUT, after first episode it laid my doubts to rest and its a great comedy show to watch, with Kathy Bates playing her character wonderfully. If you like 30 min comedies that would air on channels such as HBO, or Showtime (not really for kids) and if you enjoy Big Bang Theory and comedies like that, this will tickle your funny bone and you should really enjoy it. Just watch through first episode, give it a chance, and I really doubt you'll be disappointed.

1951,Disjointed, a tastefully real comedy about legalization,"I think this show is an excellent representation of legalization. As an Army vet, ex-security guard, with a traumatic childhood and someone who used to view smoking as weakness, I truly felt myself in the character of Carter and his journey toward inner piece and dealing with PTSD. (It's a bit shameful to admit but I wept like a baby through many of the situations with Carter)<br/><br/>Though this is a comedy, it deals with real things that people (especially those who are on the fence about legalization) have struggled with in regards to pot use while keeping things lighthearted. The show has a diverse set of situations that the average American relate to and help them understand why many people are turning to medical (or recreational) Marijuana to deal with stress, pain, trauma, and so much more. From a mom trying to keep from going off the deep end, to a person terrified that weed is going to be their gateway drug to worse things like her parents, this show has touched on several fears and questions I myself have had:<br/><br/>What will happen to me if I start smoking? My family has a history of drug use, what if I start something harder because of this? How much is too much for me? Does smoking pot change me as a person?<br/><br/>I think that many people don't understand how to relate to this show yet unfortunately and take it only as a comedy and not as what it really is: A voice for people like me who use this drug as a way to level out and be a functioning member of society.<br/><br/>However, That is not to say the show is not funny, (though obviously more so if you are high) as it often breaks the forth wall and makes fun of itself through the nearly 3 hour movie (oh, right this is a show.... I forget that when I binge, haha). However I would say there is a lot of ""in"" jokes that make it difficult for those who have not started their own journeys of self discovery to relate to.<br/><br/>All in all, I will recommend it to anyone who smokes, anyone who is on the fence about it, and anyone interested in it's legalization.

1956,Disjointed, Chuck Lorre's redemption?,"The series is simply great! It's true that it starts in a very juvenile way, but suddenly evolves to something really mature and smart. I myself never enjoyed Chuck Lorre, since that plagiarizing attempt of Absolutely Fabulous that he called Cybill. Thus, I completely and purposefully ignored any of his latest works, such as 2 and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. I displayed contempt under the mention of these TV shows, as if they were mere residue of our culture. Given the pervasiveness of them, though, in order to please some friends, I even watched two or three episodes with them and pretended to enjoy the allegedly ""witty dialogue and social commentary"" (as if there was some, right?) in it. Everything was just out of place with those narratives.<br/><br/>But with Disjointed the thing is totally different! I am not one of those people who write a description for the plot but instead I like to bring up the sensation this story might trigger. And trust me, it's an experience -- a sort of like when you're watching a kind of Louis C.K gig and you feel good about laughing at human condition's peculiarities. A cynicism maybe a little too dark, but precisely because of that it feels like a delight, from the sharp text to the tripping artwork.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just stoned. (Which I doubt, of course. So watch it and enjoy it. Before it gets, well you know, one of those predictions we're not allowed to write here.)",39 out of 65 found this helpful.,10.0,25 August 2017

This is not 2 Broke Girls territory, but some great comedic writing. True, older, more formed tastes might disagree - but if you approach Disjointed with an open mind (and maybe a bit stoned), you'll get what you came for and almost forget about the canned laughter.<br/><br/>Kathy Bates almost made me cry at the funeral episode - yes, even in a crappy sitcom with canned laughter, a true diamond finds a way to shine through. <br/><br/>Best part is the season finale, where things take the turn towards drama - I don't want to spoil anything, just watch the show. <br/><br/>* To appreciate this kind of a show you have to like stoner movies.

Not all people that smoke marijuana act like stoners. Nor do they smoke constantly while they are working, or at a funeral. The constant smoking in the show is just downright stupid.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what this show is trying to do. Are they pro-marijuana, or just trying to perpetuate stereotypes? Seems like a little of both. If they want to be pro-marijuana, the stereotypes need to stop and focus more on reality.

The laugh track (even if it is coming from a live audience) is overly used and even feels out of place, redundant and desperate. Kathy Bates talent was perhaps wasted in this. Turns out to be a show about marijuana made for a very specific market. The market that is Uber obsessed with Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Grace Under Fire, and people that prefer Orange is the New Black to Wentworth or Oz. Joke's on me; what did I really expect when this particular show shares the same creators as those aforementioned shows (with the exception of Orange is the New Black, Wentworth and Oz)? It comes across a bit out of touch for a premise so dependent on reality and it is distracting. To be clear there is nothing wrong if you like these shows, ""different strokes for different folks.""

1963,Disjointed, Breath of fresh air for an invisible generation,"As a cannabis professional in a recently legalized state, I was hopeful that I could enjoy a program that would begin to present Cannabis as the valuable and healing herb that it is in reality. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed initially to see the snippets from ""Reefer Madness"" in the intro. The bulk of my time and efforts in convincing customers that NOTHING in Reefer Madness is real and that they are not going to go uncontrollably crazy with just one puff of weed. <br/><br/>Trying to get a handle on the hook for the series I initially resigned myself to a show that perpetuates the stereotype that keeps pot illegal. To those who are familiar with cannabis use (boomers) who manifested the sexual revolution and free love of the sixties it is spot on with the plot twists psychedelic interludes and excellent graphics excursions. It wasn't until the sixth episode when Carter tried pot for the first time and it helped him begin to distance himself from wartime trauma of PTSD that I could begin to recognize solid redeeming potential for the show Solid writing and exceptional character acting that left me hungry for more. Whichever writer they hired just before episode 5 was a good choice and it probably saved the show.<br/><br/>Keep it up...........Lose the Reefer Madness images in the intro.

1965,Disjointed," Quite Artistic. No really, hear me out.","I rated this show a 9, and no, I wasn't high while watching it! The first couple episodes had me convinced this was just a time waster sit-com with an awesome title sequence (honestly it's genius). But by the fourth or fifth episode they'd gotten rid of the laugh track, and the audience laughter, and focused more on where the story was going, instead of just 20min of bullshit. Kathy Bates is, of course, the best cast member of them all, and her acting shows it. Near the end of the season she has a few moments to really shine, and she makes you sit right up and listen. She brings enough to her character that Ruth herself really keeps you watching the show. Everyone knows that without characters you care about, a show isn't worth watching. The first two episodes really flopped in this area for me, the side actors weren't being shown to have enough oomph to them, and a forced love interest was cringe worthy to say the least. But the INCREDIBLY artistic, and beautiful animated sequences showcasing flashbacks, and life moments, were something that I've never seen before done in a show so well, and with the ability to bring so much gravitas to a show otherwise based around humour. Carter's character continued to surprise me right up until the final credits. Hell I'd watch a spin off show about him alone! <br/><br/>By the end of the season this show has addressed (to an extent) the ability of marijuana to heal, to bring people together, and if anything it's effective at showing how harmless it is. It showcases some great talent, (behind the scenes artistically and creatively), and provides such an interesting vehicle for Kathy Bates, and for a show which I believe that by the second season, would be solidly on its track, and going strong.",11 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,31 August 2017

1967,Perfect Strangers, A show like this is a rare find these days.,"What can I say, except that those were the days! They really don't make it like this anymore-wholesome, scripted comedy, that people of all ages can appreciate.<br/><br/>I have been watching this show since I was around 7 years old, and in my experience, it has only gotten better with age. As a youngster, I think I enjoyed it because of the character of Balki-the naive sheepherder from a small developing island, faced with a massive culture shock when he arrives unexpectedly at the door of his distant cousin, Larry. I laughed along as Balki was dazzled by Western technology, taught Larry his bizarre Myposian rituals, made endless failed attempts at popular American sayings, and had his good nature taken advantage of time and time again. I must admit that at the time, Larry was just a character that was around so Balki could exist, and I really took little notice of him. But now that I am older, it is Balki that has begun to fade into the background. The character of Larry seems kind of straightforward-an average guy in his mid 20s who, despite himself, comes to learn many life lessons from his eccentric cousin. I would have thought they could have gotten any old actor to play someone like that, but now I see that I was wrong. Mark Linn Baker is subtly brilliant as Larry Appleton. He portrays Larry's neurotic, on-edge personality, without becoming tacky and predictable in his mannerisms. And despite being ""the normal one"", his use of physical comedy is hilarious. The 2 lead actors bounce off each other perfectly, and make this show work.<br/><br/>This show is pure fun, but also made a nice statement about morality, which made you care about the 2 lead characters. At the age of 20, I still shed a tear when Balki moves back to Mypos and he and Larry have to say goodbye. And when Jennifer accepts Larry's unrehearsed marriage proposal, over the proposal her new attractive, wealthy boyfriend. And I still laugh when I see Larry and Balki sneaking into Jennifer and Maryanne's apartment at night to swap Jennifer's engagement ring, fix up a house and accidentally get stuck in a chandelier, or dancing to the reworded limbo rock as they attempt to bake 3,000 ""Bippy Bobkas"".<br/><br/>As a disclaimer, I must warn that this show isn't exactly high-brow, to say the least. The story lines are often far from believable, the dialogue isn't always as funny as the raucous canned laughter would have you believe, and a ""straight guy meets wacky guy"" comedy isn't exactly cutting edge. But in all honesty-so what? This show may not be the height of intellectual viewing, but when you're just looking for a show to veg out in front of and forget your troubles for half an hour, then look no further. This show always leaves you with a smile on your face, and is a refreshing change from the myriad of recycled reality shows they beam to us at every opportunity.<br/><br/>Since this show was cancelled, a lot of shows have come and gone that I have loved for various reasons, but I have yet to find another sitcom that can hold the flame to this one. I prey that they will release this series on DVD. And if not, then I hope the reruns I recorded back in the 90s will last long enough for me to show to my children.",64 out of 72 found this helpful.,,8 April 2005

I started watching when I was newly married and then, as I had kids, I really appreciated the wholesomeness of the show.

1972,Perfect Strangers, OK so it's kind of stupid but also super fun!,"There's nothing really special about this show, it's a typical 1980's to 1990's sitcom with not very well developed characters and a really simple premise, but the actors are so likable and the show is so fun that I just don't care.<br/><br/>In this case the characters are Balki Bartokomous (Bronson Pinchot), a naive and very foreign shepherd boy from Mypos (pretty much but technically not really a Greek island) who immigrates to the land of the free America, in the city of Chicago, to build a new life. This is much to the chagrin of ""Cousin Larry"", his (distant) American cousin who is a wannabe photographer who had no idea Balki was coming. Apparently it's customary in their family that they should just take each other in for unknown periods of time. <br/><br/>Cousin Larry obviously has reservations until he's moved by Balki's plight and his kindness and opens his doors (and apartment) to the foreigner. The two work in a nick-knack shop, then at the Chicago Tribune newspaper (after Larry makes it as a photographer/news man), and all along the way they go through the weekly ritual of know-it- all Larry announcing ""I have a plan!"" then forcing Balki, who knows what they should actually do but is too innocent and taken in by Cousin Larry's confidence to object, to get into trouble before clumsily lucking their way out of it. They also have crushes on their two upstairs neighbour girls, beautiful stewardesses, who they pursue (and finally get) during the series' entire run, even buying and fixing up a house. Obviously the plots and situations wear thin by the end (the last season was not very good in my opinion) but even then the characters and simple, fun premise stayed entertaining and just plain fun!<br/><br/>The only really remarkable thing about this show is how enduringly popular it was as it lasted a surprising number of seasons/years (like 10!) and huge numbers of people loved it during its run on ABC's (or was it NBC's?)

The Buddy cop/comedy genre back in the 80's was a really big thing from films like ""Lethal Weapon"", ""48 Hours"", you name it; so, it's no surprise this show would come along.<br/><br/>Not much to say really, it's just a simple premise like any buddy comedy on two very different people living together and trying to make it together. I really like both characters they have really good back and forth, both actors Bronson Pinchot and Mark Lynn Baker are really solid it's too bad both didn't have much else afterward. Both characters are well rounded and are easy to emphasize with.<br/><br/>Larry (Mark Lynn Baker) he is bit of a workaholic, ambitious but very insecure at the same time. I can emphasize a bit with him because even I'm a bit of a workaholic, and his insecurities at times are something we all feel sometimes, and they really aren't always misplaced some of his insecurities are justified. What I really like about him is how ambitious he is, he's always trying out things or starting up ventures to get more money, get a step up, or whatever else in life. And he does actually win sometimes but what's funny is how he loses sometimes, not just from not having the luck of the draw but just letting his ambition cloud his better judgement or letting things get out of hand.<br/><br/>Balki (Bronson Pinchot) is my favorite character, I can sort of emphasize a little with Balka as he's an outsider, he's has sort of childlike sensibilities but what I love about the guy is he's not afraid to be himself, he really puts his home country sensibilities and whatever he loves in life out there. It may seem strange to anyone else, but he honestly doesn't care what anyone else thinks he just want to do his thing. He really is a good for Corson as he really helps bring fun to his life which he probably never has much of and even helps guide him on the right path likewise for Corson sometimes.
I really like the theme song which is an honorable mention if favorite themes songs in my book. It's memorable and perfectly reflects the show.<br/><br/>And these two just get into all kinds of crazy crap, there are a lot of funny memorable episodes like one where they make a crazy amount of pastries called Biba Badkas which is once again another one of Larry's fast business ventures the results well I won't tell you but it's hilarious. Balki dressing up as a ninja and both Larry and him playful fight which is funny but really addressed the ninja craze back in the 80's. Or one where they are invited to a club but overdo it on the tanning and they look like walking oranges, though to me the highlight was seeing them move which was hilarious as even the smallest and simplest movement is painful.<br/><br/>Overall if you're looking for vintage buddy comedies this is a show to check out, it's a perfect good time.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,28 July 2018
1976,Perfect Strangers, Excellent series.,"Best comedy series ever. Enjoyable by many different perspectives! I hope this will be available on DVD. The facial comedy of the main actors, the plot, the supporting actors are perfect. This series has been translated and watched in many countries across the globe and friends living abroad have also commented on their appreciation for this production. My favourate character is Larry Appleton, I particularly like the way he flips out when things go wrong. He is a crack up. Well done to the team who have made this a success.

1977,Perfect Strangers, An absolute ABC classic!,"""PERFECT STRANGERS,"" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Larry (Mark Linn-Baker) and Balki (Bronson Pinchot) get sunburned by some sunbathing beds. If you want to know how and why that happened, you'd have to have seen it for yourself. I also enjoyed the romances between them and their girlfriends (Rebecca Arthur and Melanie Wilson). Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong.

1978,Perfect Strangers, Perfect Friday Night Fare!,"I have to admit that Balki and Larry were the male version of Laverne and Shirley. The show had a unique premise and it worked best with Bronson Pinchot as Balki who reminded me of Andy Kaufman on Taxi. Anyway, the show was never controversial or raised any eyebrows. It had it's moments including the relationship between Larry and Balki that emerged from complete strangers who were distant cousins to best of friends. The cast included the under-rated Ernie Sabella, JoMarie Payton France whose family would spin-off to more successful Family Matters. Friday nights on ABC were reserved for light family comedy fare. I just wish that they would bring sitcoms back. Bronson's role and performance was one of the best in a long time.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,8.0,20 March 2007
1979,Perfect Strangers," Great show, but ran too long","I'd love to give this show a ten, I really would. The first five seasons are an absolute ten. Larry was hilarious, especially when he'd start a scheme. Larry: ""I have..."" Balki: ""Oh, God."" Larry: ""...a plan."" Larry seemed to be hooked on money and live to make a buck. Larry: ""What'll you do with your share of the money?"" Balki: ""Give it to the poor."" Larry: ""Well, they'll be taken care of. I'm going to spend my share on myself."" Balki was very sweet and very naive. He came to America speaking broken English and knowing nothing of how the nation worked. Many times his naivety landed him and Larry in trouble. Because he was so trusting, Larry would often unfairly take advantage of him and use him in his money-grubbing schemes.<br/><br/>Starting with the sixth season though, things started to go downhill. All of a sudden, Larry goes from being money-grubbing, but still somewhat redeemable, to this pathological greedy liar who would never learn any better. Balki goes from being naive but very intelligent to just flat-out stupid.<br/><br/>Also, I detested their girlfriends, Jennifer and Mary Anne. I liked the red-haired girl Susan from the first two seasons. I thought it was so cute when Balki would throw himself at her and Larry would have to keep him from making a fool of himself. I guess the blondes were added to provide sex appeal, but to me it just seems like a sell-out. Susan was a real, down-to-earth and intelligent woman whereas Mary Anne and Jennifer were just superficial and shallow.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a great show in the beginning, but it just ran way too long and was unrecognizable by the end.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,7.0,16 July 2006
1980,Perfect Strangers," Perfect Strangers episode, The 'King' And I is my All-Time Favorite Episode of all Shows!","Immediate address link is http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0672992.

Mcnally' (qv) Lamont Cassidy, their friend &amp; hypnotist. This episode originally televised on ABC, on Friday, February 24th, 1989. It is hypnotically &amp; hysterically humorous, from beginning to end! What occurred in this episode, is Balki, was accidentally hypnotized while watching from the kitchen, as he was going to get a glass of water. Shortly after &amp; while Balki is still in the kitchen, a friend of Larry, that was a hypnotist tried to hypnotize Larry. But Larry decided to act as if he were 'Marlin Brando' (qv), instead of 'Elvis Presley' (qv). 'Bronson Pinchot' (qv)'s first line, was immediate, just after the hypnotist and his date left, the telephone rang. He impersonated 'Elvis Presley' (qv), answering with, ""How did you get this number, lady?"" While Balki was coincidentally and accidentally watching, the hypnosis come onto him! And later in the week, Larry and Balki were to go to their Income Tax agent, named ""Mister Yates"". And Larry tore a telephone up, to keep a bell from going and hypnotize Balki, while they were in the agent's office! But a clock, with an hourly chime went off and the remainder of this episode was twice as funny, at least! In the last five minutes, Balki was wearing a white suit, looking exactly like if he was 'Elvis Presley' (qv)!

1982,Perfect Strangers, top 10 greatest show ever in the 80s,"even though i was born in 1984 i started perfect strangers at the age of 5. this show was brilliant went i first saw it. the theme song was amazing. Perfect strangers was a very hilarious show. The casting was outstanding. Each actor couldn't have done better with their character. Not to mention Bronson Pinchot's flexability as an actor. He showed his great talent by portraying many different types of characters. A shy sheepherder new to America, his cousin Bartok (minus the accent of Balki), TV Game Show host Lance Edwards, Stan Laurel, Ed Norton and more. I enjoyed the chemistry between Bronson Pinchot &amp; Mark Linn Baker. They should have won Emmy awards for their portrayals, but most importantly they won the hearts of the TV public.

1983,Perfect Strangers, An excellent comedy with an exceptionally talented cast,"""Perfect Strangers"" was one of my favorite sitcoms from childhood and remains so until this day.<br/><br/>Bronson Pinchot is truly magnificent in his role as Balki Bartokomous I would consider his portrayal of this role as perhaps his best performance to date and perhaps one of the best comedy performances of all time. Mark Linn-Baker is also a truly wonderful and talented actor who plays his role to perfection and provides his character with a degree of liveliness and enthusiasm that is truly first class. Together they form one of the best comedic duos in modern comedy. A strong supporting cast further enhances this already wonderful particularly Melanie Wilson and Rebecca Arthur in their respective roles as Jennifer and Mary Anne. Each and every member of the cast provides their respective characters with a great deal of depth, dimension and realism that only enhances the quality of an already excellent show The humor in this sitcom is truly priceless and would often have me in fits of hysterical laughter. As well as this, the dialogue between the characters flows naturally and the plots of each episode are both easy to follow and hilarious in how they unfold.<br/><br/>""Perfect Strangers"" was a highly enjoyable, entertaining and wonderful comedy.

Larry's anger was making us cry while laughing. He was getting angry very fast and cooling down so fast too. Their relation was as perfect marriage, full of fun,anger,jealous and trust. Even they played games to each other sometimes, they fully trust each other in heart.

1989,Perfect Strangers, An 80's Classic,"I remember when I was a kid, Perfect Strangers was the show I used to look forward too the most. Balki (delightfully played by Bronson Pinchot) was an immigrant looking to move to New York from his home in Mypos. Larry (Mark Linn-Baker played this stiff contrast a little too well) was a panicky, independent single man taking himself way too seriously as he tried to get ahead in the rat race. When Balki shows up on his doorstep one day, Larry is somehow corralled into taking his more innocent cousin into his home and under his wing, hoping to teach Balki how to live life in the 'real world', and learning a lot more about it himself in the process.<br/><br/>Personally, I can't think of a better classic family program than this (well, actually 'I Love Lucy' is the only one I can think of). The concept isn't altogether unfamiliar. A little 'Odd Couple' and a little 'Laurel and Hardy', Perfect Strangers designs it's own unique formula by adding to the mix the concept of culture shock. The characters gradually become more fleshed out in later seasons, while their more endearing qualities established early on endure throughout.<br/><br/>This, by the way, was one of the shows that began the original 'TGIF' lineup that would later spawn such classic TV hits as Step By Step, Full House, and Famlily Matters.<br/><br/>This show is good fun for all ages, and I heartily recommend it!",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,,1 December 2005

It is what it is, and thats a fun, care-free, entertaining uncomplicated show that deals with issues that all teenagers come across at some stage. The point is its not meant to educate you but to assure you that minor problems in your life can be taken lightly, showing that life doesn't always have to be overly complicated. To me your criticising a show for not being things it never actually set out to be. And as for slating Hillary duff through her make-up, dress sense and acting! your breaking down the show piece by piece taking away the simplicity of it. Just watch it for what it is!

I think it's a really nice show, and if can entertain someone like me, and of my age, then it has to be halfway decent.

I also like it because it's appropriate for anyone while still appealing (at least a little, admit it, it IS addicting!!!) to the older genre. Also, Hilary Duff does a good job playing her part as Lizzie, and her T.V. family seems so real to me, like they really seem like they work together as a ""real"" family.

1993,Lizzie McGuire, I highly disagree,I am the complete opposite with the last commentor on how bad he or she said it was. The show isn't that bad. For one thing I think Hilary Duff and the rest of the cast are fine actors who put alot of hard work into they're roles. La laine (Miranda) is very good. Gordo (can't remember the actor name) has a tough job with trying to pretend to be thirteen (in actuality he is eighteen). The parents are not annoying I think they portray the good mentor's in Lizzie's life. As for matt I think he isn't the best character not by a long shot. It is actually his friend Lanny who is more funny than him. The last commentor is right that they talk to much about Ethan Craft but that is what makes it mildly funny.

The plots are simple and deal more with the every day problems of middle schoolers. There were good morals. The dad was funny, but not a complete doting dad.

The character Lizzie is very likable,pretty and stylish. She wears a lot of colourful clothes and her hair is always styled in a complicated fun way. <br/><br/>The problem with this show is it doesn't really help teens with the struggles of school, since Lizzie's problems are very light-heated and always seem to be resolved in the end. Real life is a lot more complicated than that. When I was struggling with the horrors of school I'd wish that my problems were as simple as Lizzie's, her only experience with bullying is from ex best friend Kate, but shes more of a catty mean girl than anything else. Each episode always has a subplot with Lizzies little brother Matt which I think hurts the show, I always find that part boring and annoying. <br/><br/>The show is very left wing, one of Lizzie's best friend is portrayed as Mexican (the the actress is actually half Philippino) and the other is Jewish. <br/><br/>I still watch this show as an adult and enjoy it a lot, it's really feel good and you feel happy and optimistic once you're done watching it.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,9 April 2017

Miranda is a cool girl who always has to stand up for her best friend.<br/><br/>Gordo, who is like me, BTW, is the ""Please stop trying to be popular"" brain/film-maker. Ethan- heartthrob who is smart in certain areas. AKA, he has street cred. Kate- a popular leader. But she CAN be nice. Claire- popular, but not Queen B. Can be jealous at times. Larry- smart, considered geeky, but he's actually a treasure. Matt is somewhat annoying, but funny. He is always coming up with ideas, therefore, its confirmed he's an evil genius sort of guy. Lanny is the kid who never talks, but its obvious he cares for his friends and always knows whats going to happen. Melina- a girl who gets her potential boyfriend in trouble.

Hilary Duff is the worst actress I have ever seen, she has the most annoying voice and  when it comes to fake crying scenes, she sucks. Now she has become a singer?! After hearing a preview of her songs on Disney, she has got no talent anywhere. She should just give up her flippin career. Her show is way to superficial, I mean honestly, who would have a crush on Ethan whatever his last name is. He is ugly, but she thinks he is so hot, and the dumbest person on the planet, which Lizzie could care less about, she just cares about his looks. And what is the deal with her parents!?! ""Mom, Dad, I just drove a car through the front of our house, and I dont even have my license yet. I am sorry!"" ""Lizzie! What you did was very wrong, and we'll have to get the house fixed, but you're sorry and you know what you did is wrong. Now go to the mall with your 2 friends."" That should seriously be on an episode, because that is what they are like! The parents could not be anymore fake. Way too easy on their kids when they do something wrong. Shows just how stupid they are. Hilary wears way too much makeup, especially eyeliner, and for someone to actually be able to do their hair like that in the morning just shows you how fake the show is. The only reason that she is getting so much publicity is because guys think that she is hot [which, by the way mindless guys, she has a makeup artist. The chances are she isnt that pretty when she doesnt have her specialists following her around] or girls [ages 5-12] think that she is great actress and role model. She is way to overrated for something that she is not. I am very glad that Lizzie McGuire has been cancelled, it was about time. The show is awful. If you want an actually good show, watch something like American Dreams or My Wife and Kids.

I know, you're going to go off saying -oh it's Disney, it's a kid's show! For one thing, they did touch, no more like graze, on the eating disorder thing and shoplifting, but just barely. They could've gone deeper, those would make for an interesting plot line. Also, I don't get why Lizzie got involved in a life of petty crime after ONE trip to detention. And why is detention portrayed as being bad? There are a lot worse things out there. Another thing that bugs me is the fact that Lizzie bitches about her parents, and is rude to them, when they only want to help her and seem OK, but a bit weird maybe. It could be a lot worse. The fact that she is in love with Ethan Craft is disgusting, considering he is ""hot"" but has no brains (BTW Clayton Snyder's hideously ugly). I can't believe that Aaron Carter kissed Lizzie, who he's never met, JUST because she was standing under mistletoe. Which is very disturbing. Also, every single problem Lizzie faces, are like a major deal when they're nothing. And can be solved in half an hour tops. Some sappy music, someone apologizing, follow by a hug-then cut to bloopers. There is also usually a retarded subplot involving Matt McGuire which serves as comic relief, but is pathetic and completely unfunny. What kind of messages are they sending girls? Being popular is your only goal in life, have a crush on the dumbest but cute boy? What is up with Lizzie looking like she stepped out of the salon every day, wearing over the top clothes? Her hair was crimped, straightened, had hair extensions and her clothes are probably designer. The least they could do was make Lizzie look perfectly average, wearing jeans, t-shirts and simple hair, like up in a ponytail instead of these salon-worthy/Rodeo Drive styles. What universe does Lizzie live in, that cheerleaders are popular? They are quite possibly the lowest on the social ladder at my school. Why does Kate, a popular cheerleader &amp; the leader of ""the popular clique"", go out of her way to insult Lizzie? And those insults, they are just plain SAD. Not much character development here-Lizzie's a one dimensional, awful excuse for a 13/14-year-old girl but she was pretty much the same person from episode one to the last episode of Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie falling down and being a klutz is hilariously bad.<br/><br/>I know Hilary Duff had limited material to work with, but she is an absolutely awful actress. She moves stiffly, shows absolutely no emotion in most scenes, has the same two facial expressions, and overacts a lot as well. Honestly, probably one of the most awful actresses I have seen. She better thank her lucky stars that Hallee Hirsh (who was almost Lizzie) thought Lizzie was too shallow.<br/><br/>And why the hell does Hilary Duff think she can sing?",11 out of 26 found this helpful.,,22 October 2005
2007,Lizzie McGuire, not the best but not the worst,"Lizzie McGuire isn't the best show, but it isn't the worst show; it's just somewhere in the middle. It entertains, I'll give it that, but the actors were annoying, especially Hilary Duff, who plays the main character. Also, this show seems to be showing girls that they have to follow the latest trends, have a crush on the most popular boy in school, not have the best relationship with their parents, have a worst enemy, and take forever to get ready for school each morning. Girls should wear what they like, not what a magazine likes. They should not let boys control their lives, but if they have a crush, it needs to be a boy they really like, not who everyone else likes. Girls should have a great relationship with their parents, and not try to avoid them. Girls should try not to have an enemy, but if they do, they shouldn't get distracted by it. And, girls should only take five or ten minutes to get ready for school. Sure, Lizzie does care about presentation and she tries hard academically, but if she was a real girl, she just wouldn't be a good role model.",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,5.0,7 July 2007
2008,Lizzie McGuire, how pathetic,"OK, I am a 16-year-old sophomore girl, so I only recently graduated from the middle school world of Lizzie McGuire.  Let me just say...what the hell?<br/><br/>I can let most of what happens pass by, since it IS a kid's show.  But there's one episode where Lizzie makes friends with this ""tough girl"" named Angel.  Her friends start looking down on her.  Why?  Cause she makes a new friend, wants to hang out with high school kids, and goes off campus.  Wow, cause that's just SO terrible.  And they all but say that if you have an attitude, you're going to end up in trouble one day.  And by attitude, I mean cursing, piercings, and tattoos.  Well, I have a bad mouth, am planning for 6 piercings and two tattoos in the end, and have skipped a million classes, but have I ever ONCE been in trouble the way they're portraying it? No freaking way.  The only cast member I've EVER seen that I could respect is Angel herself, and Matt.  Jake Thomas is going to be such a funny actor when he gets a little bit older.",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,,26 March 2002
2009,Lizzie McGuire, a view at Disney's worst,"This show is possibly the WORST show on Disney channel. The fact that Hillary Duff's character, Lizzie, is shallow and obnoxious proves this show to be intolerable. But, factor in her annoying best 'friend', Miranda (played by Lalaine) and her other somewhat normal friend Gordo (Adam Lamberg) and you're talking horrific. It's obvious that this show is trying to depict the normal everyday life of junior high while trying to be the next Ally McBeal, but it misses by a long-shot.<br/><br/>To start with, the plots are hilariously unrealistic (like how Lizzie trys to be 'bad' and she ends up in detention. Oooh, we have a real rebel on our hands!) or when Miranda is accused of stealing, and Lizzie doesn't know what side to take. Stealing is wrong, but who really cares if your friend so-called stole a lipstick!!! I mean, I know it's Disney and all, but do they really have to make the characters a goodie two shoes all the time? Or the time when Lizzie and Miranda go see the kiddy show, and Kate is there and they are made fun of? The short of it is is that Lizzie stands up on a table and sings a song, and everyone sings along with it.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that Lizzie's hair always looks like she stepped out of a salon is COMPLETELY unrealistic. Who really has time in the morning to pick out a designer outfit, and put hair extensions in, with red streaks, or have a hair style that looks like it would take hours. What's wrong with a ponytail? Then we go to the clothing. Remember that episode where Lizzie was DYING to have that midriff bearing outfit? How unrealistic? First of all, no junior high school would let their students where that. It was trashy, and was possibly the stupidest plot out of all of the episodes. Who cares that much about some trashy outfit that will only allow you to look like a slut? What else...what else...how 'bout her stupid parents? Yes, yes. Lizzie's Mom is overprotective, clueless and just plain DUMB. All of her advice is the same, as well. Be yourself, and everything else will fall into place. Be kind to everyone. Give people a chance. Usually followed by some cheesy story. And her dad is probably the worst aspect of the show. How realistic is it that when he trips on a roller skate and smashes his head or spills feathers on him or WHATEVER he never yells, or says anything mean? I mean come on, who calls their son 'son' every time you ask them something. ""son, what are you doing?"" ""son, let me tell you something."" *gag* Whats even worse is the sound effects. Why would you feel the need to have camera noises every time you show a flashback? Or the boooinnnng noises when someone falls down? I mean, come on. But the music is what really makes me cringe. The slow, soft music that accompanies a cheesy apology, or the bouncy, happy music that accompanies their trips to a mall or their average everyday life at school is enough to make a person gag.<br/><br/>I understand that this show wasn't made to educate people, but why would have such low moral values and stereotypes? Like the fact that Miranda and Lizzie's main goal in life is to be the most popular girl in school, or that all cheerleaders are snobs.<br/><br/>This show makes me gag, and is the worst show one Disney Channel.",8 out of 18 found this helpful.,2.0,16 July 2006
2010,Lizzie McGuire, Oh Boy...,"I don't really know how to sum up this show, but I just have to say that not all teenagers are giggly, perky, whiny ditzes like this show would lead you to believe. We don't always obsess over the latest teen idol or an expensive pair of jeans.<br/><br/>Of course, you could offer the argument that TV shows are not exactly supposed to be completely realistic. I just wish that sometimes, shows might depict teenagers as not being fashion obsessed, boy-crazy airheads.<br/><br/>
The plot lines are juvenile and trivial. Poor Lizzie, she can't go to the dance! So everyone leaves the dance to have a party at her house? Doubtful for someone who is supposedly 'not popular,' and maybe even for someone who is 'popular'.<br/><br/>If this show is supposed to be some sort of representation of the average teenager, I'd say that this show is severely off of the mark.",10 out of 24 found this helpful.,,31 July 2003

I do not have a snobby cheer leader as a rival, I don't trip over my self every five minutes, cheer leaders don't control the school, and Ethan Craft? Who in the world is that dumb? He is the worlds biggest idiot. Matt, is an embarrassment to all guys. They think they have really appealed to teens, they think they are covering all there is to know. But they are not. What they fail to show is the ""REALITY"" of life. Anorexia, Bullying, kids brining guns drugs on and on and on! Of sure they did cover A eating disorder once, but they taped it very lightly.

2012,Lizzie McGuire, It was OK.,"This was not a bad show. Ups: It's funny, charming and and family friendly. Downs: It's to perfect. They are trying to pass Lizzie off as a realistic character, but she is not. Normal kids do have to where the same thing twice, Lizzie dose not. Noemal kids cannot do what she dose with her hair, not without a hair styleist in there room. And unlike in the show, every thing is not always OK. The acting is pretty good,(this show would have sucked without the actors who played Miranda and Gordo). I don't think the show is anything special, or that it is that great. But I do think it is a good pre-teen show, and Matt is really funny. (So is Lanny).",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,,5 March 2005
2013,Lizzie McGuire, Don't watch it. It's just a waste of time,"Sorry guys but this HAS to be the worst show on Disney.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters are the worst of all timelike Lizzie for instance. She's a whiny little brat. Every time her mom won't let her go somewhere she throws a temper tantrum and then winds up sneaking out. When she gets caught, she doesn't even feel guilty! The same goes for Miranda. She's always fallowing Lizzie and doing whatever she says. I mean what kind of friendship is THAT? Kate is a snobby little cone head who thinks she knows it all, even though she doesn't. If Lizzie hates Kate so much, why is she always comparing herself to her? I don't get it. Ethan is probably the most unrealistic character on the show. There's no way he could be THAT dumb. If he were, he would have to be put in a special school. And if you haven't noticed, in some episodes, he acts smart. Even Gordo isn't that great. Like Miranda, he always tags along with Lizzie and does EXACTLY what she says. Why does he spend all this time with 2 girls anyway? <br/><br/>Lizzie needs to sit down and shut up. She's always complaining to her parents and shouting at them ""YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE!"" I don't think so. Take her clothes for example. Just look at them! They look great but she's always saying they aren't cool enough. So in one episode, she sneaked out with Miranda (of coarse) to buy a 50$ pair of pants from the Style Shack and then wound up spilling juice on them. HA! Serves her right. And look at all that junk in her room! Too much if you ask me. There was a girl at my school last year who was practically rich and even SHE didn't have all that!<br/><br/>Another thing I don't like about this show is the stereotyping. I just can't stand it! It seems as if you're a cheerleader, you're mean and snobby. Not all cheerleaders are like that. I have a friend who is a cheerleader and she's the nicest girl in school! <br/><br/>Okay. Here's another problem with the show. The plots. All of them are stupid and unrealistic. Like the episode ""Aaron Carter's Coming To Town"". I mean, what are the chances of AARON CARTER coming to there town and then Lizzie, Miranda and Gordo dance on stage with them? And for no reason Aaron Carter KISSES Lizzie? Oh, please. Like I said, almost all of the episodes are stupid and/or unrealistic but the Lizzie McGuire Movie takes the cake!<br/><br/>Hmmthat's pretty much all I can think of that's wrong with this showright now. This show gives Disney a bad name. That's So Raven is okay but this is just pure trash.",6 out of 14 found this helpful.,,24 June 2004
2014,Blood Drive," Grindhouse done right. If you know and like what that is, then this show is a must","Wow, I'm already in love in the middle of the pilot. Anyone bitching about this being the ""lowest point of television, yadda-yadda..."" has clearly no f---ing clue what a grindhouse flick is. Basically this show is the group sex lovechild of Carmageddon, Fast&amp;Furious, Evil dead, Mad Max, '80s buddy-cop movies, Vampire the Masquerade LARP, Judge Dredd and literally everything Rob Zombie ever made. It's an over the top caricature of a distopia, and it doesn't want to be more than that. But AT that, it excels. Hear me out.

2031,Blood Drive," Exactly what was needed, exactly at the right time.","First of all, rather impeccable timing for the release of a TV show. This review is quite lengthy and if you haven't seen an episode yet, you might want to skip to the last two chapters of this review because what follows is mostly deeper analysis that may or may not have it's meaning lost to someone who hasn't seen the show, to avoid the use of spoilers.<br/><br/>I don't usually think about macro trends when it comes to television in the right here, right now, but when you see an exceptional show like this it really compels you. Usually it's easier to accurately spot such trends afterwards, Blood Drive however is all about the bigger picture, no matter what aspect of the film are we talking about, be it internal or external.<br/><br/>What has modern television evolved into? I feel like during the past few years there has been elements of camp incorporated in all kinds of TV shows, in different amounts and different combinations. Almost like a test to see how we would react, test which we passed. Quite a few of the shows with popular ratings have had a rather serious atmosphere (perhaps because during these competitive times a show needs to be taken seriously). There have been quite surrealistic shows too, but pretty much all of them try to tackle complex issues in our society on their own terms. Things like what exactly is the meaning of religion in the society of today, what's happening with the environment globally, corporatism around the world, even hybrid warfare and most importantly, how do we as people fit in this equation.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, Blood Drive is very much about the same in my opinion, but it's quite the game changer. The other shows I was referring to earlier were in a sense, campy despite being so tasteful while Blood Drive is tasteful despite being so campy. The actors (even majority of the supports) manage to pull off incredibly realistic feeling performances, even though the script is incredibly over-the-top and exaggerated to the point of flirting with surrealism. Quite like the society around us with all the expectations from it's inhabitants which could be metaphorically described as an engine that runs on human blood. In a world like that, the road to decadence is paved with good intentions. Which is the very essence, the bloody race track of Blood Drive. Straight from the first episode probably right to the last one (mid-season review).<br/><br/>This spiral of decadence with all of it's gravity has the characters of the show reacting to it in all manner of human ways. You have the ones trying to resist, even fight it (desperately trying not to fall down that road, only to find themselves right in the middle of the highway), there are the ones embracing it (which naturally feeds it, just like with the ones resisting the decadence), ones trying to benefit from it as much as they can but ultimately feel indifferent about everything except gratification (again only feeding it), the individualist types that get pulled in due to circumstances (willing to go as far as it takes to solve said circumstances, becoming ever-so decadent in the process), victims of a dysfunctional society who adjust so as to not be victims again.<br/><br/>Blood Drive borrows a lot from late nineteenth century literature, transitioning it to a completely different form of art. No easy task there and the implementation is nothing short of genius. Mix &amp; match of various campy genres, given to us in a campy manner by absolutely believable characters living out their stories in an unbelievable world.<br/><br/>Honestly, I have simply too much to say about this masterpiece to properly even review it without using thousands of words, which also means I could probably watch it again straight away (high compliment). I haven't even touched the subject of cinematography which is top of the line, an exceptionally integral part of the whole film which is truly a rare delicacy. Delivery is a delicate form of art in itself, and Blood Drive delivers what it's message in a breath taking manner managing to suck even the viewer right towards decadence and despite being full of characters that are portrayed in a very caricature manner, the viewer will probably find that they actually identify with one or more character type. Not because of who or what these characters are, but what are the ideas and concept they represent (there's even a pet-the-dog scene just to underline how important and meaningless it is at the same time).<br/><br/>Anyway the bottom line is: Whether you like to concentrate on finding a deeper meaning or are just looking for good entertainment, you are in for a hell of a ride that is a sheer pleasure to watch and full of both novel and nostalgic fun. Perhaps not for the faint-hearted, but then again neither is looking out your window or turning on the news channel. It's a jolt of electricity for our numb and often cynical minds. Gallery of postmodern art for pretty much everybody, even if that isn't their usual cup of tea.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Let's get decadent!

2036,Blood Drive, Not for anyone who takes anything seriously,"The original Grindhouse movies were made in 2007 by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino as a double feature ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" that had what was supposedly fake trailers for upcoming attractions for ""Machette"" (which was later made and became a popular cult series in itself) and ""Hobo With a Shotgun."" All these movie were gleefully violent and exploitative films. However they were also exceptionally well made and often with a brilliant sense of humor.<br/><br/>The first episode of Blood Drive labeled ""The F...ing Cop"" already has many of the aspects of what makes a great grindhouse movie. It is crazy, violent, and yet has a coy sense of humor about it. The main two characters are Arthur (the last honest cop in America) and Grace a young woman who is desperate to win a deadly car race with cars that are run on human blood. The two are of course paired together by the race's leader Slink who is quite possibly the run away star of the show. Of course things don't go smoothly as personalities clash but by the end of the pilot episode they both agree to team up to win the race.<br/><br/>This is of course not going to be to everyones tastes. The violence is excessive and often gleefully so. There is also sexual content and an early attempted rape scene. However anyone who loves a good grindhouse film should definitely give this a try. Also if you have access to Twitter there are a couple of fun accounts including one for Heart Industries and another for Smax Candy.

Instead its a pragmatic exploration of unique characters that you will grow to appreciate more as their backgrounds are revealed. Like most unique pieces of story telling it is not for everyone and those looking for traditional plot lines will be confused or frustrated. The story is like an endless rabbit hole, so more mysteries are revealed than are answered.

Hayashida's authentic portrayal of vulnerable, yet powerful protagonists and ""antagonists"" gives us a story in which we root for every character, even those which we would conventionally consider evil. Most importantly, perhaps what reels me in to this series is the large part of the world which still remains unknown to viewers, forcing us to wonder who Kaiman really is.

2063,Dorohedoro, Anime Horror in a dystopian Wizard/Mutant Hellscape,"This has to be one of the strangest animes I've seen, which puts it in the strangest tv/movies since anime tends to be pretty far out there. If you don't like hyper violence and bleak worlds then this isn't for you. I don't even know how I'd describe this show except there are 2x worlds. A world of humans that is post-apocalyptic and where people struggle to get by. They constantly have sorcerers basically warp into their world and practice magic on them. Turning them into strange bugs, giving them lizard heads, etc. The sorcerers come from a relative paradise... something looking like Paris or Belgium. Some sorcerers are powerful magic wise and with that comes power/respect/resources and some groups or families are basically the elite of their world. On the top are devils which are sorcerers who trained to become devils and are sort of like the ultimate rulers and most powerful beings of the world, but they seem to have some rules and sort of come into play rarely.<br/><br/>A human gets his face turned into a lizard head and gets amnesia. Now he hunts sorcerers with a woman who initially helped him and owns a local restaurant in the strange hell hole humans live in.<br/><br/>Like a lot of other anime, violence is completely over the top and many characters love heinous violence. A lot of the most gruesome violence gets healed fairly instantly. It's hard to tell when someone is actually dead or when they can come back through magic or something beyond the viewers' understanding. So in the end the violence isn't all that serious since it seems to rarely lead to a permanent death.<br/><br/>I would watch this if you are not easily offended or disgusted and already enjoy some anime like Akira/ x hunter x/demon hunter/etc. You might still enjoy it if you don't like anime since it's very unique and interesting. I feel like the grotesque curiosity and just trying to figure out how these strange worlds work pulled me in a lot. It kind of reminded me of what got me addicted to Attack on Titan. Bizarre things happen and you want to understand what the **** is happening. I really enjoyed this show because the art is top notch and the universe crafted in this is very unique.

They don't try to tie up plot threads, illuminate the backstory, or even have the characters leave their neighborhood to fight crimes as depicted in the opening and closing credits. None of that is necessary. Instead, they just bring us a stripped-down, personality-driven yukfest that shows encumbered with the usual baggage simply can't match. <br/><br/>ATHF meets---nay, far exceeds!---my personal gold standard for comedy: that the jokes should not only be funny, but be ones I couldn't possibly have thought up for myself, and that there not be a moment's lag time between them.<br/><br/>Watching it is like eating potato chips (um, guess I mean fries) of pure, mindless laughter.

2066,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, I was not put on this earth to listen to meat!,"Whether it is the opening segments with Dr. Weird or the strange ending credit sequence with Abe Lincoln, Aqua Teen Hunger Force will make your mind boggle as you try to wrap your mind around about twenty minutes of some of the most brilliant animation EVER! I first found this while visiting a friend in Oregon. Let's say that we were not thinking clearly when we put it in, but as the opening rap sequence began, all I could do was laugh. The next morning, I thought perhaps it was just a fluke. Nothing could be as funny as characters like Master Shake, Meatwad, Frylock, and my personal favorite Carl! Boy, was I mistaken. <br/><br/>This series is hysterical. Every episode is full of random events that will make you laugh so hard that you will pee your pants. This show goes beyond the normal cartoon and takes humor to a whole new level. I loved the fact that after the first two episodes the structure changed completely. I don't think they ever solved any crimes, they just argued and dealt with random 'enemies' that just happened to appear. I even thought that just maybe they would loose their momentum after the first season, but yet again  I was wrong. The DVD was spectacular and gave a bit more information about the birth of these anti-heroes. <br/><br/>I come from a household without cable, even regular channels are snowed out, so when series like these are released on DVD it is the only opportunity I have to see them. I will say that discovering this series was a high-point in my television on DVD career. I love random chaos, and this is exactly what this show provided. <br/><br/>I would suggest this series to anyone that is a huge fan of social commentary coupled with fast food. While it may not make you hungry, it surely will quench your desire for humor. I still wonder where the writers found the idea for the 'cult' characters the Mooninites.

MC P Pants and Sir Loin are also very good.<br/><br/>Each of the opening bits with Steve and Dr. Weird stand alone as comic tidbits that get each segment going.

2069,Aqua Teen Hunger Force," Look deeper, beneath the absurdity.","Firstly I'd like to say that ""Aqua Teen"" is one of the funniest animated shows, mixing absurd situations with absurd characters who do absurd things. But great comedies (which this is) are more than simply absurd, they're smart. They bring us into the world of the cartoon and have us relate to each character. So I'm going to look into why this is a ""great"" animated comedy, merely because of its characterization.<br/><br/>Carl is a poor, single, overweight man on welfare whose main cares in life consist of the cardboard cutout of a girl advertising beer, his car, lawn, swimming pool, and reminiscing of the old days, when he would get hammered and go to rock concerts. The interesting part about Carl is that he never admits to any kind of friendship with the Hunger Force, yet they are in his swimming pool almost every episode, and all of them, through all the bickering, get along. Even though Carl is always apparently miserable, his true joy comes from the friends he presently has, which he never addresses. How many people do you know who want to go back to the ""good ol' days"" when everything was simpler and sweeter, but fail to see the good things in their present life until they're reminiscing about it twenty years down the line?<br/><br/>Shake is funny. Very funny. Perhaps the funniest character in any cartoon show ever. This is achieved in an ingenious paradox. While he is cruel (esp. to Meatwad), self-indulgent, and egotistical with absolutely no sign of empathy, he is the most likable character in the show. Why? I think it's because of his simplicity, like a more intelligent form of a child (aren't children selfish and always unsatisfied?), and who can blame a child? All you can do is laugh at their behavior.<br/><br/>Meatwad is also like a child, but instead of being the kind that doesn't share (like Shake), he is the kid that gives his toy truck to the new kid in school to play with in the sandbox. While Shake is the most likable, Meatwad is the most lovable, and is even more-so because he is missing a brain (does Shake's intelligence give way to vice? If one looks at the episode where Meatwad becomes smarter than the other two, it would seem so). But we can never ""like"" Meatwad, because we can't associate with him in his stupidity, we can only love him like a small, cuddly dog. Meatwad's voice sounds like a mixture of Yoda and Terrence from SouthPark, which is, somehow, indescribably perfect.<br/><br/>Frylock's character acts many times as the mediator in arguments. He is highly intelligent, humane, but at the same time conceded in his intelligence and humanity (when Meatwad gets a brain and surpasses Frylock's intellect, Frylock becomes jealous and angry). He is individually the least funny of them all, but this is on purpose. He is the sanity in the absurdity, accentuating that absurdity.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best aspect of the cartoon is its lack of development. Nobody changes (at least in character) from one episode to the next. Carl is still poor and resentful, Meatwad is still lovably stupid, Shake still conniving and hilarious, and Frylock still intellectual and, well, normal.<br/><br/>It is impossible to keep a straight face during any episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (most especially when the Mooninites make an appearance). But if one allows himself to watch with an active mind, you will see a satire on human nature, which inclines the characters to do some absurd things. But are we really ones to laugh at these characters in their absurdity? Wouldn't we be actually laughing at ourselves? Of course! That's another part of the genius. It takes human faults and shows how stupid and fruitless they are. And by laughing at ourselves, we are in fact reflecting upon ourselves.",16 out of 18 found this helpful.,,12 November 2008
2070,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Incredible!,"If you are expecting a great cartoon with exciting plotlines and lots of drama, this is not the show for you. If you are expecting a hilarious cartoon filled with lots of random, witty humor, this IS the show for you. There is not one way that one can fully describe AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE. Just take a look at the title; it is random and makes no sense. That is what is so amazing about this show. AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE follows the adventures of Meatwad, a meatball, Frylock, a floating order of fries, and Master Shake, a milkshake. They live in a house next-door to Carl. That is basically the premise of the show. Anyway, AQUA TEEN HUNGERFORCE is an incredible show that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a funny cartoon to watch, besides THE SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY.

2071,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Do they ever stop crime? No. But that doesn't make it any less of a TV show...,"In the very beginning of the show, during the opening song, you see Frylock, (Master) Shake, and Meatwad fighting the bad guys and quite possibly kicking some butt. During the actual show, though, they argue and basically cause some problems for themselves and their in-desperate-need-of-anger-management neighbor, Carl.<br/><br/>And at the beginning, before the opening song, there is a little skit with Dr. Weird and his assistant, Steve. Dr. Weird is always inventing odd and dangerous things which never benefit anyone. In fact, he sometimes end up killing himself (and his assistant) with whatever it was he came up with.<br/><br/>I personally think it's a great show with some really funny material that you can't find anywhere else, such as the Broodwich and the talking trees that put Shake on trial for dumping oil near by.<br/><br/>Frylock's, Shake's, and Meatwad's personalities make the show much more watchable as well. They're so opposite, but they go great together and it wouldn't be right without them. Frylock is the smart one who actually has something going for him: common sense (and the ability to fly). Shake is the trouble-maker. And the idiot. He could be (I believe) successful if he tried but he is waaay too lazy. He always wants to make an easy buck but never wants to do it the honest way and earn it. Meatwad (my personal fav) is kind of the innocent one. He's sweet to a point and likes to dance. He's almost like the child of the trio. Then there's the neighbor, Carl (my second fav). He's obnoxious and says frickin' and freakin' a lot. <br/><br/>Final Thought on ATHF: Disturbing but can't live without it.",26 out of 41 found this helpful.,,30 July 2004
2072,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, One of the greatest shows ever created!!!!,"You could be the smartest person alive, or the dumbest person alive, and this show will make you laugh. The complete and total randomness to the comedy makes it a masterpiece. I would like to shake the hand of the man that created this show. One of my personal favorite episodes was the ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past"". I bought both volumes on DVD and I'm hoping like hell that they release all the episodes on DVD. Sadly, there has been an announcment that the last episode of ATHF will be shown sometime in August. I don't know what they are going to get to replace ATHF, but whatever it is, it better be good. I'd go freakin' crazy if they put some crap on instead of this comedic masterpiece.",29 out of 47 found this helpful.,,7 August 2004
2073,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Instant masterpiece in the classic style!,"If you really think about it, ""ATHF"" subscribes to the classic sitcom format, just like ""Seinfeld.""  There's the brains of the outfit, Frylock (Jerry), the selfish jerk, Master Shake (George), and the eccentric goofball, Meatwad (Kramer).  But what sets this show up there in the pantheon of great cartoons is the one-of-a-kind, surreal, stream-of-consciousness dialogue.  Take a look at the ""Dumber Dolls"" episode with the incomparable David Cross as the most depressed talking doll ever. And his counterpart, Jiggle Billy, a dancing hillbilly doll has a musket, moonshine, and nightvision goggles.  There's the classic comedy writing technique of the ""three's""--with night vision goggles!  That makes me chuckle just writing it.  Or the hilariously obscure pop culture references, e.g., ""Tangerine Dream"" and the Atari 2600...  The smarter you are, the funnier this show is.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's the theory behind it, but trust me, you don't have to analyze it to get it.

2074,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, One of the best.,"This show has been out for almost 12 years. While I love it, I do have to admit that it's later episodes aren't even close to being as good as the originals. <br/><br/>Seasons 1-2: Hysterical. Did not stop laughing.<br/><br/>Season 3: Still amazing. I miss Dr. Weird but Spacecataz is still funny.<br/><br/>Season 4: Where most people think it started going downhill. I like it, although I do admit it isn't as good as the first three. They now have more freedom in the maturity factor, and boy do they abuse it throughout the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Season 5: Bleh. Don't even bother watching the first three episodes of it. This season does get better as it goes on, and I have to admit that ""Bible Fruit"" is one of my favorite episodes. This is where they really start relying on sex jokes and shock humor, but it's still funnier than other shows that attempt to do this.<br/><br/>Season 6: Better than season 5, but still suffers from the same laziness as last time where many of the jokes are just mindless sex jokes rather than actual creative writing. Just not as bad as before.<br/><br/>Season 7: Better than season 6. Has a couple of my favorite episodes and is a step in the right direction, as ""A PE Christmas"" and ""Rabbot Redux"" are two of my favorite episodes.<br/><br/>Season 8 (also known as ""Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1""): A MASSIVE improvement. I thought at this point there was no hope for improvement, but I was completely wrong. Has a nice balance between mature humor and good writing.<br/><br/>Season 9 (also known as ""Aqua Something You Know Whatever): Recoil. Their efforts are going entirely the wrong way. With all the other seasons I complained about, I at least still enjoyed all of them. Not the case here. VERY hit and miss. Literally half the episodes in this series have no redeeming qualities about them, but that does mean that the other half is pretty damn good. Just make sure to skip ""Shirt Herpes"", ""Rocket Horse Jet Chicken"", ""The Granite Family"", ""Fightan Titan"", and ""Totem Pole"". I was bored out of my mind through those.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good show. They just need to refocus their efforts a bit.

2075,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, As Memorable As It Is Dumb,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is quite possibly the stupidest show currently on television. This doesn't mean it's bad in any way, it just takes the dumbest approach to any situation. There are 4 main characters who all live in New Jersey somewhere. The most prominent of which is Master Shake. Shake is the one of the most rude characters that you will find on any show. He cares for no one but himself and is constantly inconveniencing others for his own comfort. For example, he burnt down his neighbor Carl's house because he cut his lawn with matches. Carl, is the everyman, in the sense that he brings out the worst attributes in people. There is also Frylock,the smart one and meatwad, the... dumb one?

2076,Aqua Teen Hunger Force," Truly They Were An Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Number 1 in the Hood G!","I remember watching this show when Adult Swim first came out in 2001. Watching this as a kid I didn't quite get the humor but now I understand the humor better and feel like this show has aged gracefully like a fine wine now. While some or most adult cartoons feel like they are just dick and fart joke after dick and fart joke. Just doesn't FEEL like an ADULT cartoon also might just use dick and fart jokes or bad slapstick because they just want you watch them and not listen to them. Or mention things around their era that will probably be real dated in the future after the show ends.<br/><br/>This show is about a box of fries called Frylock, a milkshake called Master Shake, and a meatball called Meatwad. At first this show makes you think it's a detective show but that was just a way to trick you a little into watching it. There's also their next door neighbor Carl, who's kind of funny and sometimes tags along in the show since he doesn't have much to do at his home. Also there's these Mooninites that mess with the Aqua Teens and Carl every now and then, and the Plutonians as well.<br/><br/>This shows opening song was made by a rapper, Schooly-D, and he later makes cameos in the later seasons in the show. The jokes feel legitimately funny and the acting is done well. They even made a movie out of this show, Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters, but it was okay. Though Adult Swim made a movie out of a 11 minute stoner cartoon so what were you expecting?<br/><br/>This show also has a heart and soul, doesn't just have one note characters like some cartoons now. For example there was this one episode where Frylock gets skin cancer and Master Shake, Meatwad, and Carl, try to cheer him up, help him, and are scared he might die. That feels like they're real people. I feel like if some other show that tries to be mean and not really have a reason for it would go to someone who had that would go, ""HA HA, You Have Cancer!"". Just feels like those shows try too hard to be South Park even after an episode of South Park was over, I'm just noticing a pattern with the cartoon shows that were on Comedy Central after South Park.<br/><br/>There's also an episode called ""The Dickesode"" and there was all these dicks that were censored with colored bars and after seeing the uncensored version. I am glad when that was on tv it was colored bars and not black bars. They even made a video game called Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am where it's basically based off on some kind of older game where you golf and there's ninjas.<br/><br/>Also they made a live action episode where Master Shake was played by H. Jon Benjamin, Frylock was played by rapper T-Pain, Meatwad was played by a yoga ball, and Carl was played by some guy that won a contest for who could play Carl the best. Then after the 100th episode the show reinvented itself as Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1, Aqua Something You Know Whatever, Aqua TV Show Show, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever.<br/><br/>There was also this time Adult Swim did this gurella marketing tactic where they put all these light brights of one of the moonenites in Boston. People thought they were bombs and the bomb squads destroyed them all. The artists had to do community service and I'm glad they didn't go to jail since they weren't hurting anyone. Though when that happened I was in high school and me and my friends were talking about it. I told them that those people who did the art might not go to jail, I said might since I heard at my high school about a year after 9-11 someone saw anthrax in the school but it was actually baking soda for a dumb prank, the prakers went to jail for that.<br/><br/>I heard the Aqua Teen Hunger Force people tried to make an episode of that bomb scare but Ted Turner demand they stop and said if it's ever leaked he'll cancel the show. Though people leaked the unfinished episode online and I guess the show had to end in 2015. With Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever, there was this episode I liked to think WAS the final episode and felt like the show moved on. THEN, the actual last episode was on and it felt kinda mean as a way to end the series but it probably just took advantage of how timeless Aqua Teen Hunger Force is. People still today want this show brought back since it was so good and had a sense they were actually trying. They truly were an Aqua Teen Hunger Force.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,9 February 2020

That worked for the first episodes, then the formula was dropped, and the show has been following a non-linear format ever since.<br/><br/>Much like Family Guy, the show follows it's muse wherever it leads, ignoring all concepts of a coherent story line or that one episode necessarily needs to follow where the previous left off. This openness has led to such insane episodes as a grill that melts the sky, an electrician that doubles as a stripper and ends up in outer space with alien pipe wrenches, and a computer program that creates dogs with severe rapist tendencies.<br/><br/>Characters may suffer severe trauma or even die in every episode, and yet come back for more next time.<br/><br/>Aqua Teen stays funny by not being afraid to be non-linear, and by taking no prisoners.<br/><br/>A ground breaking show that someday will be hailed as visionary.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,2 February 2009

I totally remember when the boys, FryLock and Meatwad plus Shake would end up inside the show 24 hrs....and I totally thought that that was the first season and at that time I hated this show. It was nice to see that the pool behind the house and some of the character development albeit temporary were incorporated. I guess my favorite episodes were the one with the balding action figure that almost got blow torched by shake, like I could totally see that happening and his face turning into like melted wax, but instead they go onto a HIGHLANDER like fairy tale...and the other episode I really enjoyed was the one where Shake is renting a room, and the moonite microfilom chips take over Meatwads room plus get him hookt on cigarettes.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,6.0,4 May 2016

And don't forget Carl, Dr. Weird and every other uniquely strange character that come around.<br/><br/>Master Shake, Meatwad and Frylock live in 'da hood. Supposedly they are detectives that solve crimes around town, but that only lasted about two episodes. Most of the time they're dealing with Shake's made up problems. Shake believes the world revolves around himself, probably the most self-centered person on the planet - especially towards the naive Meatwad. Frylock can shoot fireballs out of his eyes, can fly and is the most sane of the three.<br/><br/>Aquateens never fails to introduce hilarious characters throughout. Most of them appear in more than one episode, and it's always a treat to see them again. Most notable of these are the Mooninites, a pair of two-dimensional inhabitants of the moon who believe the Earth is primitive and wish to spread their advanced ways, namely stealing Earth merchandise, throughout the planet.<br/><br/>This show is too weird for some because, well, the main characters are food, but if you're used to strange humor this show won't fail to keep you laughing hysterically. A lot of people's first impression is that this show is all about fart jokes and stupid, dry humor; but that is an unfortunate misconception. The dialog is smart and timed well, while full of funny references to today's and tomorrow's culture.<br/><br/>Some of the episodes are hit-or-miss, but for the most part Aquateens doesn't fail to deliver on any level.<br/><br/>If you watch Sealab 2021 or Tom Goes to the Mayor, you'll definitely enjoy Aquateen Hunger Force.",9 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,21 January 2005

If at least a learning experience or gain could be had, the show might have something to offer, but regretfully it falls short on this end as well...unless your learning experience is to avoid living anywhere near a talking shake, meatball, and box of fries.",16 out of 34 found this helpful.,3.0,10 September 2006

What you're left with then, are low-brau, intelligence-insulting jokes and random one-shot characters. This show is a lot like experimental music, in a way. You feel clever for liking it just because it defies convention. It could be a work of art, but it could just as well be a lazily thrown-together piece of crap. The latter seems to be the case here.

2088,Aqua Teen Hunger Force," An Adult Swim Classic, With Some Frustratingly Lazy Writing","It's hard to quibble with a show that's only 11-12 minutes length per episode, but Aqua Teen Hunger Force really can be very funny - plenty of surreal situations, witty one-liners, and marvelous voice acting.<br/><br/>But when the writers get lazy, they get lazy.<br/><br/>For every episode like season 2's ""The Shaving,"" which is a master-class in tight, short-form animated comedy writing, there's an episode like season 3's atrocious ""Hypno Germ"" or season 5's dull, dumb ""Sirens."" The problem is that the wittiness of the writing too often crosses into pothead territory, where awkward pauses and the fact that the characters are talking pieces of food are meant to supplant the lack of a substantial script.<br/><br/>It's frustrating precisely because episodes like season 7's ""Rubberman"" and season 5's ""Bible Fruit"" show just how great the writers can be when they put their minds to it. This show at its best is satirical and, yes, smart; at its worst it relies on Carl's sleaziness or even outright sadism in the treatment of its characters, all of which leaves about as much of a comedic impression as a series of fart jokes. It is woefully apparent when you're watching an episode of ATHF that its producers just didn't care about either.<br/><br/>Still, this is a series I'm quite fond of; it is compulsively re-watchable and because it's an animated sitcom full of one-and-done episodes, I can just pick the episodes I want to revisit and leave the rest behind. The voice acting in this show is, for the most part, unimpeachable, with fantastic guest voices (Filmmaker Todd Field as a lump of sentient mold named ""Ol' Drippy"" in season 1 is still one of my favorites in the whole series), and the regular cast is practically iconic at this point. <br/><br/>So many shows have since cribbed (some would say ""ripped off"") the low-fi back-and-forth awkward pause-filled comedic dialogue that this show pioneered; all the ridiculous animated characters speak so casually and matter-of-factly, which is both hilariously surreal and refreshingly frank.<br/><br/>This show's place in comedy history is practically confirmed at this point.

2089,Last Chance U," Good for entertainment, bad for society","Sports documentaries are a personal favourite, but Last Chance U is a rare example of a sport's true colours shown through big budget filmmaking. Set in the collegiate American football setting of small town America, this show highlights everything inherently wrong with the system and the mindset that goes as standard with the sport. Being premier recruitment colleges for those denied a chance in the major leagues (sometimes through bad luck, sometimes through bad choices), they are breeding grounds for dangerous mentalities in children who genuinely know no better.<br/><br/>It starts with the coaches; men who have lived with the sport their entire lives, but who don't always understand the way teenagers think. On top of this, their academic teachers toil to get them almost unattainable grades to give them that slim chance of success, constantly fighting against a tide of setbacks and resistance. Finally, the students - arrogant, boisterous and over-pressured athletes thrown into stardom from the minute they discovered their talent, now deluded into thinking they are untouchable future stars.<br/><br/>The stupidity is that the cameras only enable these kids to act like superstars. Suddenly they have their inner belief of stardom reinforced by a full film crew following their every move - regardless of whether they win or lose. It's even made clear on the show: every single one believes they are going to make it to the NFL, but only the luckiest ever even get close. The teachers know it and try to make it clear, but nothing will dissuade these students of their dreams. You watch it with mixed feelings of pity and anger; they genuinely know no better, but they act so poorly they must know they deserve nothing from these people who give everything to help them in ways they don't appreciate. The few students who do eventually cross the line and are kicked from school all pretend to repent when the cameras are pointed at them, but the follow-up interviews make it clear some of them are just genuinely bad people.<br/><br/>Whilst this makes entertaining television with its various twists, it also presents the damage this society perpetuates. Whole communities suffer: these isolated towns devote their funds entirely to sportsmen they've never met, sacrificing all other academic students and their pursuits. Moreover, these students then push themselves through potentially life-threatening injuries, convinced they can handle ""only another concussion"" or a ""small loss of feeling in their legs"" from being hit repeatedly.<br/><br/>By the close of each season, you wonder if any of those you have seen grow throughout the show will be around for many more years. Some of them cannot resist the vicious cycles of crime and delinquency they have grown up in; others simply can't get the grades needed to take the next step.

2090,Last Chance U," perhaps unintentionally showing the rot at the heart of the ""american dream""","Head coach in first season muses on taking his daughter out to kill a deer - he's a very white guy, big, is a total pussycat to his family. Most of the players come from truly awful home conditions, almost all are African American, some will make it to the ""show"" most won't, virtually none of the students have any real school skills and from what the documentary shows in season 1, for the most part , there is very little practical training for school given at the college, there could be for all I know, but it wasn't shown. The large elephant in the room is the plain fact that this is a business for the local junior college, where most of the people in charge are white and most of the athlete/students/gladiators are black. We feel for the kids, as we should, but most of the time, hard questions aren't really asked. Why do we have this infernal mix of education and athletics with so much of a schools resources going to athletics. It seems like the college has become a half way house/purgatory for wayward athletes rather than an actual college, a microcosm of the general question of how pro football and basketball essentially uses college as a mostly free farm system for the pros and the colleges make bank off major athletic programs that rarely, if ever, filter back into academic needs. The one true moment, which pretty much made the first season, was the fight in the last game where the head coach called the players thugs, the players revolted, as they should have, they got very eloquent very fast in articulating their rage at this unjust outburst and the betrayal it betokens. This was very hard to walk back, and the second season starts with the pall of this acting out hanging over everything. Situating the main room of the movie in the academic coordinator's office is an interesting choice, although it seems like she is there to get these kids educated, she's really there to make sure, to the extent that it's possible, that the kids stay eligible to graduate and get recruited, ( for those lucky enough to have the skills). Most of the kids realize this, most are anything but stupid, no matter their school skills. It's a strange setting, we're kind of witness to something truly gut wrenching, a slow motion train wreck that excruciatingly examines, perhaps without meaning to, the hollowness of the ""American Dream.""

Overall, this a great documentary that is very well put together, but the subjects can certainly aggravate you.<br/><br/>East Mississippi Community College, which you have probably never heard of, is the focus of this documentary. The head coach obviously gets a lot of air time, as well as some of the star players (a few quarterbacks and some other intriguing characters, of course) and their academic adviser. There is no real ""star"" of the documentary, but the person most people rooting for is that academic adviser, Brittany Wagner. She is the only character who seems to fully understand her role at the college and give her best effort in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>The head coach, Buddy Stephens, is like a combination of every negative stereotype of head football coaches. He is loud, overweight, aggressive, mean, and unable or unwilling to understand that kids make mistakes on the football field. In one instance, he reams out a player for missing a block, reams him out some more, then comes back for a third reaming and pushes the kid. The kid says to the coach that he didn't need to push him, which makes Coach Stephens bench him for the rest of the game. Coach Stephens is your classic bully football coach who sees no problem is publicly humiliating his players for even the most minor of offenses.<br/><br/>Of course there are players on the team who are highlighted as well. All have a different story that lead them to a community college, and seem to really have the same goal in mind: getting out of there to someplace better. Skipping classes and not listening are recurring themes. Some players say they are all about the team, but do not sound genuine about it. Overall they want to win, of course, but seem more interested in where that winning will take them.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful. The setup and layout are beautiful.

2092,Last Chance U, Entertaining and Thought-Provoking Documentary,"This is an excellent documentary that truly captures what it is to be a part of a football team in the South. Larger than life personalities mingle and clash unfiltered within the setting of the most ""Southern"" of the southern states, Mississippi, where no two things matter more than Jesus and Football. What makes the South different than most places is that it unabashedly wears its soul on the outside for all to see. It is an impossible Gumbo of compassion, hope, joy, camaraderie and love mixed in with hypocrisy, bombastic narcissism, misplaced priorities, mistrust and deep social issues. At first glance it appears incredibly dysfunctional, but in the end it somehow makes sense. I feel that this documentary captures the reality of the South and of Mississippi.<br/><br/>This documentary also exposes the universal issue of institutions of learning bending to the needs of their Athletic Programs. So often the tail is wagging the dog. Even so it complicates the issue by firmly highlighting that for many Athletics provides the only viable opportunity to escape a life of poverty and violence.<br/><br/>There are people like Brittany Wagner (in the documentary), who devote their lives to forging opportunities for others, and their contributions too often go unnoticed. We live in a screwed up world, it is refreshing to see people like her who refuse to give up on the lives of others.",11 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,5 June 2017
2093,Last Chance U, A well executed insight into Junior College Football,"""Last Chance U"" is a fantastic program in many aspects, but shines the most at a human level. The vast majority of these young men have gone through many hardships in their life, and see EMCC as their golden ticket to a potential future to the NFL. Director Greg Whitely did a fantastic job at capturing the highs and lows, both on and off the field of this band of brothers. You quickly get very invested in the different players as you cheer them on at each touchdown. The show also makes you feel like a disappointed sibling, when some of the players miss class, or fall short from some of their training.<br/><br/>Some might argue that Coach Stephens is the centerpiece to this large and complex puzzle, but in my opinion Brittany Wagner, the school's academic adviser, absolutely steals the show. She is the loving and caring mother figure that many of the players desperately need and pours her heart and soul to make sure all of them keep on track for success.<br/><br/>Another absolute must watch from Netflix, which will keep you engaged from beginning to end.",34 out of 39 found this helpful.,9.0,8 August 2016

2095,Last Chance U, A very interesting and touching look at the life of student athletes,"This series is more of a documentary than a 'netflix-series', and that's the way you should look at this. If you're just looking for a TV-series to lighten you're mood, then this clearly isn't for you. If you are, however interested in the subject of the importance of education, if you want to have a good look at how the American college system works ( especially if you're not from the US this is interesting), than this series might be exactly what you're looking for.<br/><br/>What sets Last Chance U apart from other 'reality-series' is the different angles where it is coming from. From the grad student, to the renominated coach Buddy Stephens, to the concerned tutor of the college athletes who is desperately trying to get them graduated at the end of the year. You really understand the importance of the situation, the legacy that these young athletes are trying to maintain. It also doesn't really feel like a real documentary-series, although you keep getting reminded that this in fact has really happened before.<br/><br/>However Last Chance has a hard time trying to keep my focus, maybe it was just me but I found myself numerous times being distracted while watching the series. and while this is no doubt a real documentary, I couldn't help myself but finding it all a bit by the books. It almost sounds like a classic football story which you have seen so many times before. I couldn't help myself wondering if some things were really scripted.<br/><br/>Still if you can get yourself invested in the stories of these coaches, students and their surroundings, you do really get a real reward out of it, because it does leave a mark. It really gave me satisfaction to get to know the stories of so many lives in this little Mecca of American football. So if this subject is your niche... you should definitely check it out.<br/><br/>7,5/10 Verdict: A very interesting and touching look at the life of student athletes",17 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,30 August 2016
2096,Last Chance U, After Two Seasons of Buddy the Bully.,"My review for ""Last Chance U"" after watching two seasons. <br/><br/>I waited to write this review until I completed the second season of the show because I wanted to see if changes were made by Buddy Stephens. I am glad I waited because I now have even more fuel to throw at that overweight bully. In the first season, Coach Stephens has some choice words for his players after the massive brawl with Delta at the end of the first season. He refers to them as thugs and rednecks. He berates and insults them on a daily basis by telling them to ""Shut Up"" all the time. This man is no coach and it is obviously he only cares about his status as a coach rather than the players he coaches. Season one ends with EMCC being disqualified from the post season.<br/><br/>Season two opens with Buddy Stephens giving his ""Woe is Me"" speech and saying how he is going to change after viewing himself in the first season. He even goes as far and doing push ups for cursing. (That won't last long). After a few episodes he continues to berate his players by constantly telling the to ""shut up"" and goes as far as to tell his own coaching staff that they are terrible. The running back gets a serious injury, concussion, and is treated properly but when he sprains his ankle the coaches call him weak and punish him for being hurt. Coach Stephens is a horrible coach, he doesn't care about his players. He only cares about his National Championship, is JUCO Buddy not the NCAA, relax. At the end of the second season, the finale game, Buddy is shown having a one way conversation with Coach Wood, he is yelling and cursing at him, in front of the players mind you, and kicks him off the sideline. This guy kicked his own OC off the sideline. The show is good but Buddy Stephens is a real piece of work and terrible person. The loss in staff shows you he is impossible to work with and the only sad thing about the second season was Ms. Wagner leaving.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,8 September 2017
2097,Last Chance U, JUCO Life &amp; Football,"Although I routinely read the user reviews for shows and movies, I have never written one. After reading some of the reviews of this sports documentary I felt compelled to make a comment. :Last Chance U"" provides great insight to how life is at Community College and the athletes in the sports programs. <br/><br/>As a life long football love the series didn't catch my interest right away and I really regret that fact, because its an awesome show. The student athlete stories are told with great detail and the directors add just the right amount of game action for balance. <br/><br/>My concern with the comments about the players seem stereotypical. Seems some people really do not understand these players circumstances even after watching the show. 
A lazy student is not the same as one that is ill equipped as a product of a poor educational system. Some have no idea how to study and have not ever learned study skills. Many students simply are not prepared for college after graduating from high school. Brittany Waggoner makes the same assessment after leaving the show that this problem is prevalent and not confined to Mississippi. <br/><br/>I also noticed that she didnt understand why some of the players would basically give up and leave. The feeling of being overwhelmed and behind with trying to catch up is stressful. Many students leave college but their experiences are based on harsh realities that must be dealt with in a caring manner. She does come across and genuinely caring for the students but fails to identify what life is really like for them. I love the show and look forward to watching more seasons !!",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,4 August 2018
2098,Last Chance U, A solid sports reality series,"This was on my watch later literally forever, before I decided to jump in. <br/><br/>The first two seasons follow the East Mississippi Community College Lions, a junior college football team in the less than 1,000 person town of Scooba, MS, not far from the Alabama state line. <br/><br/>The team is a veritable powerhouse, with core players recruited from Division 1 programs, after being dismissed, or leaving of their own accord. The players are predominantly black, poor, from places you've not heard of and struggling badly with college life, particularly academics. A fair number are in Scooba because there is literally nothing to do but play Madden, go to Subway, or meet girls, which for most of them, is far less trouble than they knew before. The viewer, if paying attention, will literally want to throttle at least two players an episode.<br/><br/>Besides the players, two people feature prominently in each episode. Buddy Stephens, the head coach, is a ""large and in charge"" type, who suffers nothing and is all about two interrelated things, winning, and getting players NCAA offers, to ensure new recruits for next season, to keep winning. In the 2nd season, Stephens is somewhat upset with the way he acted during the first and resolves to better himself, although it's not clear how successful he is. <br/><br/>Brittany Wagner, the academic advisor, is probably the most easily liked person on the show, as she basically pushes a boulder uphill in trying to get the players to maintain the GPA they need to be NCAA eligible. It's hard work, players skip classes, don't submit assignments, argue with teachers and so on. It is literally all she can do to get some of them to take a pencil and notebook to class.....in college.....really! By the end of season 2, Wagner clearly is becoming frustrated, but never stops genuinely caring about the players she's paid to help. <br/><br/>The film itself is a well shot documentary, where the crew is able to keep a good handle on the drama within the team week to week. You see a team that wins, making no friends along the way, then that animus boil over, then the team pay for it for the next year and a half. By the end of season two, Wagner is planning to leave EMCC, as are both co-ordinators and a few other coaches, as Stephens' attempts at personal development don't progress very considerably and he begins to openly resent the presence of the film crew. The players mostly get their offers, some don't and one of the main players in Season 2 now stands accused of a murder. I more or less binged 2 seasons(6 and 8 episodes of around an hour each) in a week and a half. Season 3 just wrapped up shooting.....at a JC in Kansas. I'd highly recommend this and eagerly await next season.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,21 April 2018

2102,Last Chance U, Freakishly Fateful Ending was Riveting,"The director made sure there was never too long without some game action, or at least some conflict. That was key to keeping our attention. <br/><br/>This film of course did not reflect well on football players in general. They come across as lazy, self-absorbed, irresponsible, and feeling entitled. Football is not supposed to simply produce or nurture great athletes. It is supposed to build solid men. <br/><br/>The counselor woman had a tough choice. Because the guys were already getting the tough cop routine from their coaches. So she probably didn't want to be too tough on them. She either chose the mom/buddy approach, or it just came naturally, or perhaps we didn't see the tougher side of her off camera. At times I felt frustrated that she wasn't tougher on the players. <br/><br/>One thing this show made me realize, is that pro football should have a minor league. Why should guys who have no interest in school, be forced to attend, just so they can continue playing? It's absurd. Just create a minor league, like baseball has.<br/><br/>A person could have a career in the minor league, or play in the Arena League, or Canada, etc. There are plenty of options. Why do you need college?<br/><br/>Needless to say, this piece of work does not reflect well on African Americans, rednecks, or the South. The coach is a beast, the players seem almost lobotomized, and the culture looks bland and hopeless. The physical geography looked very inviting however.<br/><br/>Lesson to be learned: You can't just swear, fight, lie, and screw, and then say an ""Our Father,"" and wash it all away. You have to try not to do those things in the first place.<br/><br/>But what made the whole thing worth it, and what I never came close to predicting, was how a bizarre chain of events redeemed and jettisoned the career of one player, who seemed to be almost out of the picture.",15 out of 24 found this helpful.,7.0,26 August 2016
2103,Last Chance U, So much going on,"I enjoyed this show right from episode one. I enjoyed Scooba the most of the three programs that were highlighted. Coach Brown was a roller coaster at Independent, and you really jump from being on board with him, to hoping he gets sent on his way. I believe he most likely let the excitement of the cameras dictate his actions and do things that maybe would have been too far prior. Season 5 overall didn't live up to the others for me, although there were some really good stories and characters to cheer for. And so happy that the coaches wife was able to get out of San Diego cos there ""were too many white people and people of privilege"". I'm sure they were happy to get rid of that attitude to be honest.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,29 July 2020
2104,Last Chance U, more subtle than first blush,"Yes, there is a plantation mentality in play, yes major sports in higher education is a massive betrayal of academics but the ICC situation is more complex, notwithstanding the seeming oafishness of head coach Brown. Turns out that ICC is running on fumes before the new football program and that the football program brings in something like 200 new students who would not have been there anyway. So, it's a bit disingenuous to show the broken and denuded music rooms as if the football program was responsible for this. Brown knew this and he knew that the town knew this too. Yes, an unhappy, lost man, leading lost children, like an old, earth bound Peter Pan leading a city of lost boys, literally. And the real news does filter through, the English teacher who fully understands the terrible cost written on the bodies of the boys simply trying to better themselves in the only way they see as viable, tries to warn them that they only get one brain. While we're shown kids suffering repeated concussions and receiving non-existent to crappy medical care that is completely corrupted by the meat grinder needs of the football program. The kids, who are often far from home, have massive trauma in their lives, and little responsible supervision are mostly left to their own devices while all the supposed adults prattle on about how they care about the kids. And there is the $600,000 practice field that almost becomes it's own character throughout the season. More so than the other sad and hopeless seasons of the show, this was a particularly hard season. Especially given echoes of the racist, anti-immigrant sentiment voiced by the town's people regarding supporting ""out of town/out of state"" students..........a worthy, but difficult show to watch.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,9.0,22 July 2019

2106,Last Chance U, Season 3,"This one was way better than the other two seasons. That's because the coach had heart and made some interesting and thoughtful statements. He swears just as much as the guy from the other seasons, but he has a sympathetic personal back story, he's younger, and he's quite intelligent.
One thing that strikes me as odd is how locals take pride in the team, when none of the players or the coach are from the town, or even from the state. Essentially they are just a bunch of guys renting the field in town, with little or no interest in the town or the school or classes. Yet the locals refer to them as ""we."" That's the irony of college and pro sports fan culture. The lady English teacher seems nice, but she doesn't have anything interesting to say, and seems kind of obsessed with ethnic pride. I'm not sure what being the English teacher has to do with counseling these knuckleheads anyways, and surely teaching them ethnic pride is not in her job description. 
But she tries. Look, she did say one good thing, if not grammatically correct. Which is ironic since she is the English teacher. ""Everybody does not make it to the NFL."" It would have been better to day, ""Not everyone makes it."" Anyways, these kids are lazy and stupid. Some of it is the fault of circumstance and some of it is their own fault. But I don't think many will make it to the big league. Some may play in Canada or Europe.

Besides Game of Thrones, I have never watched something so intensely. I really gained a true understanding of why players play and why people watch. I caught myself riding the highs of winning and feeling the lows of loosing. For someone who doesn't really watch sports, I found it extremely entertaining. I couldn't stop watching!

It couldn't have been scripted better! S1 really captures the young American athlete - emerging from rags to one day the riches of D1 college sports - and most of them wont make it. But you root for them anyway. Maybe more interestingly, LCU dives into the mindset of an American football coach - unlikable drill sergeants that validate their tactics with a ""victory at all costs"" philosophy. Coach cant help himself, and in a weird way, that makes him likeable. It leaves the viewer to wonder, is success in sports it worth all this emotional abuse? Are American sports really good for our kids? The answer isn't so obvious. Most of these JUCO kids dont have another option. Many are heroes just for making it this far. And many wont make it. But you care about them, you get transported to the most random town in Mississippi, and you love every minute of it.<br/><br/>Season 2 is good, then Seasons 3 and 4 happened, and they sucked, making you root against the coach - the most despicable of coaches - and even the players - Independent didnt capture the magic of S1/2.

That's where you learn, grow, and display your skills for recruiters. A four-year university (preferably a D1 school) is where you're at the next best thing to the NFL and it's your best chance to get noticed by the NFL. JUCO is where you go when you've screwed up.

No, they blew it in D-1.<br/><br/>The enlightening part is that these guys actually got ""accepted"" to a D-1 school to behind with.

They only care about getting ""offers"".<br/><br/>Even at the JUCO level, they have faculty and advisors to tutor them, and hold their hands all day, everyday.

2114,Saving Hope, Well written medical drama with a big heart,"I first came to this show as a fan of the Vampire Diaries, following Daniel Gillies. I have never before been a big fan of the medical drama genre in general. However, all it took was one episode, and I was completely hooked, and become moreso with each show. Saving Hope draws you in with the wonderful characters, emotions, dialogue, drama, and humor. From just being a Daniel Gillies fan, I've become a fan of the entire cast. <br/><br/>Michael Shanks perfectly portrays Charlie's frustration at being unable to wake up or communicate with Alex, and his frequent surprise and confusion about how things work on ""the other side."" His observations often provide deep insight into both Alex, and sometimes humanity in general, as he is being forced to see everything from a new perspective. <br/><br/>Erica Durance is brilliant as Alex. Every emotion that Alex feels can be seen on Erica's face so clearly you almost don't need words most of the time. She is so believable in this role, it's heartbreaking. You want to cheer her on during her moments of success as a doctor, and cry with her at those times when she breaks down, missing Charlie. <br/><br/>Daniel Gillies is spot-on in the character of Joel, with the perfect balance of confident arrogance in his abilities as a surgeon, and a soft side that drives him to dig into his patients' lives to find out more about them. He wants to know what will help them the most, not just what the statistics say should be done. Joel is also a rock for Alex - always ready to defend her, boost her up, and be a shoulder to cry on when needed. Daniel blends Joel's multi-faceted personality seamlessly. <br/><br/>Beyond these three, there is also an amazing supporting cast. Dr. Shahir Hamza is a brilliant yet delightfully socially awkward brain surgeon. Victor Reis is Shahir's outgoing, wise-cracking nurse boyfriend. Maggie Lyn is a cute, perky medical resident who has her eye on Joel, and is not afraid to go after what she wants. Gavin Murphy is the sweet, kinda nerdy &amp; shy psychiatric resident. Jackson Wade, ICU nurse, provides the best one-liners in the show, hands-down. <br/><br/>There are more regular characters on the show, but you get the idea - the show does not rely solely on its main three, as amazing as they are. We are given a rich variety of characters and personalities, and we come to know them more as individuals with each episode. <br/><br/>Give this show a chance, don't try to constantly compare it to any pre-conceived notion of how it is ""like"" or ""unlike"" other shows, and I really think you'll love it!",43 out of 49 found this helpful.,10.0,11 July 2012

But finally I found a show that has really good actors, it is well made, has entertaining stories, and features compelling characters. In other words, it is a high quality program that can be heart-wrenchingly dramatic, wittingly ironic, and yes, sappy and emotional too when necessary. While the set up of the show is not all together original--what medical show can be so by now?--each episode avoids being predictable. The subtle turns, the character growth, and the interesting challenges all make me care for what happens to the diverse characters in Saving Hope. As an extra element, many of the members of the cast are often on twitter and freely interact with their fans.

It is sort of a mix of the ""Grey's Anatomy""'s medical problems and a hint of ""Awake"". The only thing that does not remind me of another show, is that this show is AMAZING. I have cried for good and bad in every episode so far, and I believe that will continue but I don't mind. It is a tear-jerker for sure, but again I don't mind. The other great aspects of the show, are the excellent cast. Erica Durance and Daniel Gillies are the other main characters and their performance is no less than stunning either. Personally, there is not a single part of ""Saving Hope"" that I do not enjoy week after week, even five shows in.

2117,Saving Hope, An addictive series with heart,"From the creative team that brought us the hit Canadian summer series ""Rookie Blue"" comes ""Saving Hope"", a new hospital drama with a supernatural twist. Boasting the same high quality ensemble cast and plenty of star power, it features the trio of Erica Durance (Smallville), Michael Shanks (Stargate SG-1) &amp; Daniel Gillies (The Vampire Diaries). The hook to this series is not that it's a medical drama, or even the premise of one of the leads living in a parallel universe of sorts while in a coma. What makes ""Saving Hope"" a winner are the characters who roam the halls of Hope Zion. A diverse group of charismatic heroes, each with their own virtues, flaws and most importantly, heart.<br/><br/>Much like its predecessor ""Rookie Blue"", ""Saving Hope"" features a large cast of supporting characters that recur throughout the season, giving a real sense of authenticity to the hospital. We get to know not just our leads but their friends, co-workers and rivals. And in that spirit, each story of the week ties into the overarching love story between Dr. Alex Reid (Durance) &amp; Dr. Charlie Harris (Shanks), and their fight to get back to one another. As a result, you get completely invested in not only their story, but everything going on at Hope Zion.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a fantastic mix of young and veteran Canadian talent, led by accomplished actress Wendy Crewson (Air Force One) as Alex's biggest rival, Dr. Dana Kinney. Daniel Gillies plays Dr. Joel Goran, hotshot surgeon and Alex's ex-boyfriend. Daniel does a wonderful job of balancing Joel's arrogance &amp; heart-breaker tendencies with his caring nature (towards Alex in particular). Michael Shanks plays Dr. Charlie Harris, Alex's fiancé in a coma, stuck between the spirit world and the real world. Charlie is the male protagonist of the series, and it's thanks to Michael's skillful blend of wit, dry humor and genuine emotion that we cheer for Charlie to beat the odds and wake up.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least, the center-point of the series, Dr. Alex Reid played by Erica Durance. Known for her chipper and optimistic spitfire portrayal of Lois Lane on ""Smallville"", here Erica portrays an equally strong woman, but that is where the similarities end. No matter how closely identified she'll always be for her arguably definitive portrayal of the iconic Lois Lane, after watching a couple of episodes of ""Saving Hope"", you'll simply see her here as Alex. A true testament to Erica's talent. She presents Alex as a caring, driven and practical woman whose life is thrust into chaos, and it's this test of her love for and bond with Charlie that leads her to start to question where science ends and hope begins.<br/><br/>""Saving Hope"" is an amazing series which Canadian audiences have discovered &amp; are loving, but which US audiences sadly as of yet are mostly missing out on. In a landscape littered with disposable 'reality' show tripe, this is a high quality, brilliantly acted and emotionally powerful scripted drama with heart. I for one hope that we get to share in the lives of the residents of Hope Zion for many more seasons to come.",32 out of 40 found this helpful.,10.0,7 July 2012
2118,Saving Hope, Disappointed,I was hooked at first but the storyline is now really stupid. So Alex loved Charlie so much but said no to his proposal?? She can't lose him but yet decides to leave him? She loved him but it was so easy to break it off and already ready to date? Really? Wow. What are these writers thinking?? Unrealistic.

And then something extra... <br/><br/>Michael Shanks, so good to see him again doing a wonderful job post Stargate. In fact I love the entire cast and all the extras and side characters. If you haven't found this series yet watch it from the episode one. You won't be sorry.<br/><br/>I found this series by accident on-line and am very happy I did. I love this show! Thank you creators.

2121,Saving Hope," Saving Hope, a gem of a show !","Saving Hope is a rare gem of a show. It not only brings the medical world to life, but also the often overlooked dilemmas which medics,patients and loved ones battle with as life is saved or lost on a daily basis.Not for this show the slick, ultra cool over production of many USA dramas,this show is driven by the emotions. Story and character come first which gives this show a more humane feel. There is a reality, both in the writing and the performances of the actors which drags you into the show and you feel actual empathy with them.<br/><br/>Each episode contains the expected mini story lines which the characters play parts in, but intertwined with those is the main sub plot of the two main characters and their battle to recover what they have lost. There is no ""happy ever after"" answer to their plight, and so their interaction with all is tainted by their emotions. We get to see all sides of the stories told. From the medical practicalities, the patients fear, the recently departed,s regret/anger etc. This is something which is sadly lacking in some medical dramas which can often mean the viewer is left with a rather one sided impression of the situation. The writing, production and acting in the show are consistently to a high standard, with exceptional performances from the main actors. Watching this show makes you want to see more. I hope it continues for further seasons and that the characters continue to evolve. I also hope that Charlie does wake up eventually, but with the long road of recovery that a coma can demand,I,m sure there are many more brilliant episodes to come.......I can only Hope.......",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,7 July 2012
2122,Saving Hope, Great Medical Drama,"I personally find this show very entertaining and demonstrates reliable emotions that occur in everyday life. The actors are excellent choices and the directing is flawless. The plot is well written and demonstrates life for doctors and patients, and the problems they face on a daily bases. But it also focuses on the fiction of what a person may think they are experience while being in a coma. ""Saving Hope"" is an exciting drama, that allows the watchers to expand their knowledge on medical procedures (eg. various surgeries). I personally think many people will enjoy this TV series especially if you have watched and enjoyed shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""ER"" etc.. This show is available to buy on DVD and can also be found on the CTV website. You won't regret watching ""Saving Hope"".",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,28 June 2013
2123,Saving Hope, Pure Awesomeness!,"I'll admit that what first peeked my interest in this show was Michael Shanks. As a HUGH Shanks fan I'd happily listen to him read the phone book. However, I'm not a fan of medical dramas, so I was not expecting to become as gripped in the storyline of Saving Hope as I fast became. Though I could tell from the trailer that this show was going to be good I was not expecting it to be GREAT! Each week I (and many others from the UK) stayed up until 3am to watch the show stream live, completely hocked with the gripping and heartfelt story lines. Erica Durance's performance moved me to tears (not an easy task I can tell you) more than once and the on screen chemistry between her and Shanks is top rate. One moment I'm giggling, next gasping in shock and the next tearing up. This show has something for everyone. Whether you're into medical dramas, supernatural story lines, mushy ""love trying to over come the odds"" plot lines, or simply enjoy good writing and quirky characters, this show has it all. I would highly recommend Saving Hope to anyone.",16 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,8 September 2012
2124,Saving Hope, Changing script.,"I have been watching Saving Hope from the beginning and loved it. However, now it seems Homosexuals are top priority. Is it really necessary to portray that? I seriously doubt that hospitals have that many doctors and patients that are ""gay""?????? Please consider limiting that and get back to a basic great hospital series. On a more positive not, I love how Saving Hope shows that Doctors (mostly) are very concerned about patients and try every means possible to help and save them. The chemistry between different Doctors is great also.....also, the forgiveness shown, emotions on all levels. The acting is incredible.",22 out of 35 found this helpful.,3.0,19 May 2016
2125,Saving Hope, A refreshing take on the medical drama genre,"After siphoning through many of the other Medical dramas out there, and being mostly disappointed with not really finding one that can keep you interested, I stumbled upon Saving Hope. Having been a pretty big Stargate nerd I noticed Michael Shanks, and thought I would give it a shot. Then I also noticed Erica Durance which as it happens I was also a pretty big Smallville nerd. So I was pretty excited to watch this now. The first episode was great. The acting was excellent. Erica as Dr. Reid is very moving. She is, for me, on a level above the rest of the show's characters. Not knocking the rest of the cast but she feels more engrossed in the role as the others. I have seen actors get Emmys for much worse showings. Michael Shanks is also very good. I honestly wish they would have more scenes with the two of them. You can sense real chemistry between them. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is alright as well. Dr. Goran(Daniel Gillies) seems like he has real potential, but his part in the show up to this point(episode 7 for me) isn't all that important yet. He is a great actor and his part in the show needs to be upped for the rest of the season I think. You can sense that him and Dr. Reid had a bumpy past, but there is still something there and I hope they explore this.<br/><br/>Overall I think this show will grow on people, it stays true to the genre but it really adds a new dimension to it. It can be really sad at times and raises some interesting questions. While Dr. Harris(Michael Shanks) is in the coma he meets all kinds of different people who are teetering on the brink like he is, he experiences their problems and sort of guides them and helps them. You get a different understanding of what it may very well be like in a coma. You see his struggles as he sees everyone he loves but he cannot do a single thing to interact with them. You can just feel his want to reach out and kiss his fiancé Dr. Reid(Erica Durance) and to tell her he loves and not to give up on him. You can really feel that when you are watching this show, you can almost touch it, and I think that is what makes this show special to me. <br/><br/>And of course there are some squeamish images in the surgeries. It is a medical drama after all. It's not too bad but if you had little kids watching you might get some surprises with a hamburger looking leg or something like that.<br/><br/>Overall I think the show is a GREAT take on the genre. A genre that needed a spice to survive in my opinion. Great performances by Erica Durance and Michael Shanks are nearly Emmy worthy and while the characters aren't that developed aside from the main two, the show is young and still has plenty of time for that.",14 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,21 July 2012
2126,Saving Hope, Surprisingly mesmerizing,"Considering that I love to spend my free time watching medical dramas with a twist of supernatural, I really can't comprehend how I've missed Saving Hope so far. Being a moderate Stargate SG-1 fan, it's quite natural that Michael Shanks brought me here, but while I was expecting another fairly drama-packed, standardised medical show, I was quite surprised to see a really good character development. And while I resisted in the beginning, I'm really enjoying the dedication of Alex, the reserved but caring demeanor of Joel, the quirkiness of D-r Hamza and the amusing yet adorable way that Charlie deals with his gift/curse.<br/><br/>There are a few things that actually remind me of Grey's Anatomy (the high school-like relationships and dramas around the hospital, the constant endangerment of the hospital staff etc.), but unlike the other show Saving Hope is quite realistic when it's portraying the personal issues and musings of the staff when it's challenged with seemingly unbearable situation. Throughout the three seasons I've watched so far, I was amused, shocked, saddened and caught hoping and coping side by side with the characters - a thing I never do when the spirit of a show just isn't there.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,20 January 2016

2129,Saving Hope, An unexpected winner. Excellent acting and story lines. A must watch.,"As a retired nurse of 50 years, I have watched every medical show from Medic with Richard Boone to the present ones. Somewhere I missed Saving Hope tho until recently, when I found it on ION. I came in early in season 2,but was able to catch up on season 1 on line. I was hooked before the first episode ended. I never watched Stargate or Smallville so was not familiar with the actors portraying Charlie and Alex but immediately felt they were not just actors in a part, they WERE Charlie and Alex. They are excellent! As a nurse, I've seen a lot of hospital ""life"" and what goes on with both patients, and staff, and Saving Hope is right, on both counts. The story lines for the entire cast are believable, because it's life in a hospital, and who knows how many souls are wandering around the halls, trying to ""right"" their lives, before they pass on to a better place? I read all the reviews, even spoilers, and was sorry to find Joel dies at the end of season 3. I will miss him, but am sure the writers will continue to keep me glued to my TV.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,19 April 2016
2130,Saving Hope," Shallow characters, meh script","I usually like medical shows, but this one has some serious flaws . . . aside from the fact that it's no ""Gray's Anatomy"" or even ""ER."" I started watching it because I was a big fan of Stargate. Michael Shanks played a likable enough character on that show, but that was 10 years ago, so I rather expected him to have more depth as an actor by now. Unfortunately he's quite flat as Charlie Harris. Then there are all the unlikeable characters on the show: Alex, who falls in and out of love like a 12-year-old (compare her to Dawn Bell, who has real depth); Dr. Murphy, who's a clone of Sweets from the show ""Bones""and just as naive and vulnerable; Charlie Harris, an overbearing, self-important control freak; Joel Goran, who has no impulse control whatsoever; Dr. Lin, a real throw-away character in this ensemble. The saving graces in this show are the performances of Michelle Nolden as Dr. Bell, and Huse Madhavji as Dr. Hamza.<br/><br/>The only thing different about this show is the supernatural element: Dr. Harris sees and talks to ghosts. That does nothing for me, but with the current emphasis on the supernatural and superheroes, I get why did it. However, what in the world is up with the glowing blue light that invades almost every scene?!! It is just so annoying; I can't understand why anyone would introduce such a distracting element.<br/><br/>And why don't these doctors know how to use birth control?!!<br/><br/>I'll probably continue binge-watching to the bitter end, if only to see the characters get what's coming to them.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,4.0,2 July 2017

2149,Tabula Rasa," Slow-brooding supernatural mystery. Stick around, your patience will be rewarded!","This is the second - after ""Hotel Beau Séjour"" - supernaturally themed TV-series that we are served here in Flanders (Belgium) in less than a year time! Series or films like these were practically never realized in this country before, but a new and inspired young generation of writers and directors stood up and clearly studied a lot of internationally acclaimed series for inspiration. With success, moreover, as both ""Tabula Rasa"" and ""Beau Séjour"" have been picked up by Netflix in the meantime. ""Tabula Rasa"" is perhaps not the greatest mystery/thriller series ever written, but it has a solid script with plenty of suspense and plot twists, as well as a versatile cast of intriguing characters. This is also the first, or at least to my knowledge, Belgian series that makes plenty use of great digital effects and make-up art, notably during dream sequences and hallucinations where people's faces vaporize into dust and a handful of violent death sequences in the final episodes. I was rather skeptical when I first heard the synopsis because it featured so many clichés and taboo subjects: a woman with amnesia, a mental institution, ghostly apparitions, a creepy old family mansion and a mysterious disappearance that links all these elements together. Admittedly some patience and tolerance is required at first, because the first three episodes are slow and uneventful. Around episode 4 and 5, just when you're beginning to fear that the screenplay leads to nowhere and the boring moments are becoming too numerous, the pacing shifts into a much higher gear and no less than three shocking and nearly unpredictable plot-twists occur. I read in other reviews and on forums that many viewers stopped watching halfway through the series and spread around bad publicity about ""Tabula Rasa"", but I would really encourage everyone to persist watching because especially the final three episodes are tense, adrenalin-rushing and astonishing. The very last denouement, which immediately also clarifies the until then vague title of the series, is certainly far-fetched, but also shocking and vile, and being a horror fan at heart, I really dug it! Veerle Baetens, the leading lady who also co-wrote the series, has never been my favorite Belgian actress, but she gives away a fantastic performance. Her character doesn't really evolve a lot, but she's simultaneously strong and vulnerable from begin to end. She's surrounded by a more than adequate supportive cast, including famous - in Belgium, at least - names like Peter van den Begin, Natali Broods, Gene Bervoets, Lynn Van Royen and François Beukelaers. Jonas Govaerts, another one of the writers and co-director, previously made the reputedly first Flemish backwoods horror entitled ""Welp"" (translated as ""Cub"") and that is also most definitely a film worth checking out.",29 out of 43 found this helpful.,7.0,9 January 2018

2152,Tabula Rasa, 7.5 Great Episodes,"This was SOOO close to being a thoroughly great and recommendable miniseries, but unfortunately I suffered a fatal suspension of disbelief error midway through the final episode that was just out of character with the rest of the show 's really interesting takes on memory, mental illness, parental and relationship issues, etc.<br/><br/>I don't have any problem with the resolution of the whodunit in principle, but I agree with Good-Will that the execution of of the climax as shown in the film is highly unlikely and totally out of keeping with the careful passing and ""this will all make sense in the end"" tightness of the rest of the story telling. I can't say much more without spoilers but there were definitely missed opportunities to foreshadow the end result which would have explained why the killer want recognized or why the police didn't notice forensic evidence at the original crime scene (as noted in Good -Will 'a review). But for me the biggest problem is the idea that a person as badly injured as that would be able to calmly go about researching his tormentors while staying completely hidden for nearly 2 weeks. He knows nothing about this person before the injury.. And after his research he knows he has no thing at all to feel guilty about. So yes, I get the final murder, but why is he still suicidal at the end? <br/><br/>Makes no sense.",15 out of 21 found this helpful.,7.0,10 June 2018

The story encapsulates you and the way its presented with the intertwining of dreams, memories and imaginations brings the struggle of her condition to life. But as my sympathy for several characters begins to grow my patience does the opposite.<br/><br/>Too many details and revelations were stuffed in the last couple minutes of the last episode, it doesn't fit with the very detailed and slow paced show that it was just a couple of minutes before.<br/><br/>Watching a well written, well shot psychological drama is not an punishment in any way.

2157,Tabula Rasa," Very good, but could've been great","This show is most certainly not for everyone. It is a very slow burn which will test your patience at times, but you are always interested in what happens next. There are plenty of positives in this series and few negatives, but those negatives are pretty large. 
I'll start off with the positives:
1.The acting is very top notch, it's refreshing to see unfamiliar faces that can go through various emotions successfully. Although there were a few characters I didn't care for much (Mie's mother) most of the cast had solid chemistry
2. This is a unique story in the way it all plays out. I was going into this series expecting a heavy supernatural backstory with drama thrown in here and there. In reality this turns out to be the exact opposite, which also leads to one of the negatives that i'll Get to later. 
3. There are many subtle Easter eggs referring to classic films/television that many will appreciate. For example, the wallpaper in the home that Mie moves in with her family is extremely similar to the carpet pattern in the classic movie ""The Shinning"". Also there are heavy references to twin peaks throughout the series with the ominous force in Mie's dream ""Bob"" and the surrealistic nature of the forest and everything that occurs in there
Now on to some of the negatives:
My main problem with this series is the ending. This is where the main spoilers begin. As I said earlier, I was expecting a more supernatural aspect to the show. We got hints of spirits and possessions with Romy seeming to be possessed and Mei asking the medium for help. This all really just turns out to not really matter at all because Romy has been dead the whole time but everyone pretends she is still alive for Mei, which when you find this out make some of the scenes with Romy in it seem a little off from that perspective. For example, when Mei was following Benoit to see if he was cheating, she called her mom to come pick up Romy from the parking garage, and so she shows up completely normal and takes Romy from her and leaves. I understand they wanted to make it seem like Romy was still alive, but how can she just pretend to be taking her dead granddaughter so naturally? Finding out what really happened in the accident and what really happened to Thomas is also a little underwhelming. I personally believe they should have ended it after Mei realizes that she locked Thomas in the cellar after figuring out he was the ""drunk who killed her daughter"" but instead they had to bring about a sense of retribution and forgiveness with having Mei's psychologist be Benoit's ex lover all along. This seemed to be a little cheap to me and a bit of a scapegoat. There certainly had to be a more efficient way for Benoit's ex to try to get him back than attempt to murder his wife and frame an innocent man. The ending to me just seemed a little soap opera like and didn't fill the void that some of the previous episodes created. 
All in all this is an interesting show, it's solidly produced with a mixture of flashbacks and current times that loses itself a bit towards the end but I would recommend this to those out there that are looking for something to get involved with that will keep you entertained for a bit.",25 out of 41 found this helpful.,7.0,29 March 2018
2158,Tabula Rasa, Twists on its Twists!,"I really enjoyed this series; screenplay, plot, dialogue, characters, casting, performances, location, et al! 
SPOILER ALERT!
I am, however, a bit of a stickler for continuity and just have to beg the question: Why was it preferable for Tom to cut off his hand at the wrist rather than cut through the 2"" piece of piping he was changed to? Or, for that matter, the chain's lock, even? 
I've gone back over the episode (27:11 episode #9) and reviewed it to see if there was anything preventing this, and I can't see it. You may recall Tom himself was bound with rope but his right hand was wrapped in chain and padlocked to one of two horizontal lengths of 2"" piping. After the escape a hacksaw was shown on the floor nearby.

Still they could have made it much shorter l believe.

My favourite episodes and books are still Welcome to Dead House, The Haunted Mask, Ghost Beach, The Ghost Next Door, Night of the living Dummy 2 and A Night in Terror Tower.<br/><br/>I would overall give RL Stines Goosebumps 10/10 stars as a good young person's creepy show.

Goosebumps, I had read some of the books and when I saw the TV show, I fell in love with the series. The characters are super cliché, the dialogue is delightfully cheesy, and the monsters are really cool. My favorite monsters are the horror land creatures, Slappy, the Scarecrow, and the Mummy. This is truly a classic 90s show in every way. I would watch this every weekend, and even bring the tapes to my day care.

2173,Goosebumps, Great Semi-Horror Fun,"Goosebumps was a very interesting piece of horror, in the sense that it was not scary for adults or teens but still pretty scary for 5-12-year-olds. I used to watch this while I watched over my friend's kid and I know everyone by heart, including the books. This series was made in Canada and featured a variety of semi-scary stores. These stores ranged from typical ghost in the attic, vampires, werewolves and mummies, however, there were some stories that were just plain ""out there"" (i.e. killer plants in a basement, real native American lychans). These stores were, at points, pretty suggestive for ages 7. They were pretty graphic (cutting a wrist and squeezing out green blood), pretty frightening (bug-like alien librarian eating crickets) and sometimes disturbing (Aunt and Uncle getting naked and putting on skinned werewolf skin).<br/><br/>The story usually included a teenager, boy or girl, and they would be subjected to horrible, life-changing events. The kids were good sports for this series and the acting by some of them was exceptional and some were a bit overdone/underdone. Outside of the horror fantasy problems they dealt with real life situations that I'm sure all of us could relate to in one way or the other. Ex: moving to a new neighborhood, family vacations, bullies, mom and dad issues and school problems). I think that R.L., for kids at least, did a so-so job of capturing the reality of teenagers and young adults.<br/><br/>For the most part, Goosebumps was not that scary for teens, adults and some varieties of young kids but to rate it a TV7, maybe pushing it. It was defiantly more of a TV10, though this is what I think. It was pretty scary for kids and it would be equivalent to showing a 10-year-old The Hills Have Eyes. I kind of enjoyed it when it aired on Fox Kids and I probably would watch it again, but I'm not in a hurry. I would recommend it to any young (8-12) kid who want to be a loyal horror fanatic.",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,12 October 2007
2174,Goosebumps, A show that's still holding up even in the age when all kids want to do is text,"I didn't grow up in the Nineties, I grew up in the 2000's (21st century). Unfortunately I'm eighteen and I get to be part of the cell phone texting, Family Guy-watching generation... damn, I do neither of those things but I'm so sick of seeing everyone around me doing it. My brother, sister and I aren't like kids from this generation, we're into super 8 cameras, B-movies and TV shows like Goosebumps. Goosebumps definitely isn't what I'd call scary at this time of my life, but it still has its moments.<br/><br/>Goosebumps has episodes ranging in length; some are two-part episodes and go more like watching movies. Each episode has a different horror story for kids, but unlike adult horror shows like Tales from the Crypt or Tales from the Darkside, Goosebumps is aimed at audiences of kids and teenagers and many of the episodes feature life lessons. It has mostly comical episodes, and a few that are meant to be creepy. I think the single episode that managed to be remotely scary to me was my favorite episode, Welcome to Dead House, which featured a small town where a chemical factory accident killed all the residents, and they came back to life as mutant entities that were afraid of the sunlight and plotted to murder other families that moved in. It was surprisingly depressing and dark for a children's show, and had it been developed from the POV of the parents I could picture it as a full-length horror movie. It had this atmosphere that is hard to describe, dreary and industrial and unexpected in a show for kids.<br/><br/>It's a Canadian show believe it or not, filmed in Toronto. Canada had its moments for having that dreary, dark atmosphere for horror (in the Atlantic side this country was home to the 1981 slasher film My Bloody Valentine, for example). Goosebumps had many episodes with amazing scenery for horror, and the actors, who were both Canadian and American, did an excellent job in most episodes. The series began to go bad in the last couple of seasons though, with funny but lame episodes like An Old Story that really pointed out that the series was about to end.<br/><br/>Goosebumps is a great show for kids, no question about it. It's original, it's entertaining, and it's one of those shows you can sit back and watch after school or on a rainy day and escape into for a half-hour. I also recommend watching Are You Afraid of the Dark? and The Haunting Hour, two other similar kids' horror shows that have even more to offer if you're into the more creepy side of these shows.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,30 January 2015

2177,Goosebumps, Former favorite of mine,"Back in the early to mid-'90s, I (and much of the rest of America's youth) loved R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" series, which were as popular as Harry Potter in their day.  To this day I still read them occasionally.  Even when I was a kid I never found them all that scary (and when they got to ""Series 2000"", they took a huge nosedive very quickly), but they're entertaining enough and worth reading.  When this show first came on the air, I used to watch it religiously.  I haven't seen it in a good while, but I remember it well enough to give some sort of commentary.<br/><br/>The show experienced the same problem with the novels themselves: after two very spooky seasons of ""regular Goosebumps"", we had to go to ""Ultimate Goosebumps"", which relied more on sheer weirdness than genuine scares.  A lot of the ""Ultimate Goosebumps"" eps were based off short stories from Stine's five or six ""Tales To Give You Goosebumps"" books, which each had ten stories of varying quality (""Old Story"", ""The Perfect School"", the one with the ants, and ""Click"" I can name immediately).  And the book adaptations (""Bride of the Living Dummy"", ""A Shocker On Shock Street"") were VERY loose by that point.  The older eps of the show, like ""The Haunted Mask"", ""Night of the Living Dummy II"", ""It Came From Beneath The Sink"", ""Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes"", ""The Werewolf of Fever Swamp"", etc., varied slightly from the book they were based on, but in general were very faithful to the stories. There were some later eps (""Welcome To Dead House"", ""Night of the Living Dummy III"") that were very well done, but the best eps were in the first two seasons.  The show isn't a whole lot to get worked up over (I'd recommend the original ""Are You Afraid Of The Dark?"" personally), but it isn't a bad waste of thirty minutes.  But definitely read the books, at least #1-35, if you like these kind of stories.<br/><br/>Seven stars.",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,7.0,8 August 2004

2179,Goosebumps, Great Horror Stories For Kids Six To 10!,"As per my other reviews on ""Children's Horror"" (Children's Fair) this series should NOT be compared with its adult counterparts...but, yet, it is!?!? WHY?<br/><br/>Children's shows and stories of all sorts always get trashed by adult reviewers who compare them to their own adult shows and stories. Reasonably, and, simply, you cannot compare this series (geared for little children) with the likes of ""Tales From The Crypt;"" ""The Twilight Zone;"" ""Tales From The Darkside;"" ""The X Files;"" etc. because it doesn't scare or intrigue adults! That's reasonably and simply stupid!<br/><br/>This series (""Goosebumps"") is for little kids...the others I mentioned are for older teens and adults. Anyone comparing ""Goosebumps"" to these others, and, I've read the comments, is being unfair and uneducated. I'd be nice if a seven-year-old would comment, but, it's always adults!?!? It's like comparing ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" to ""Jurassic Park"" because they both have dinosaurs; or, ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You"" to ""Cujo"" because they're both about a dog!?!? STUPID!<br/><br/>I had a girlfriend years ago whose little son watched this (and, read the books). Being curious and never hearing of the series, I asked about it. She told me that ""It's monster stories for little kids.""<br/><br/>Then, years later, when my own Son began watching this, I took a particular interest and watched with him.<br/><br/>YES! They're not at all scary nor nail-biting...for an adult. However...they're great short-stories with 'just enough' fright to interest a young child. That's a great thing!<br/><br/>I started my Son out with ""The Teletubbies"" when he was tiny (Science-Fiction for kiddies). Then came ""Scooby Doo"" (with cartoon monsters and ghosts). Then it was ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" and ""The Little Rascals"" (both have creative stories for children). Then it went to this, that, and, the other thing which eventually brought me here to ""Goosebumps.""<br/><br/>People (adults) write bad comments about ""Goosebumps"" - 'bad acting;' 'not scary;' 'terrible props;' 'lousy effects;' 'silly stories;' etc. But...do you really believe that little kids care about all of that!?!? Little kids don't see any of that, they just love the show! Does that count? It should.<br/><br/>If you're an opinionated and rotten adult (or, parent) who can't see beyond his/her own expectations and immature selfishness in lieu of a child; and, that this is a ""KIDS"" horror series and scary and exciting for them...you shouldn't even comment at all!<br/><br/>As a responsible adult, this show doesn't scare me at all, and, I give it ""SIX STARS!"" (I cannot think below a 'six-star' level when children are involved!).<br/><br/>Yet...as a Dad who gradually brought his own Son into loving horror and Science-Fiction, and, ""Goosebumps"" was one of those gradual steps, I sincerely give this series (and, the books) a solid ""TEN STARS!""<br/><br/>When adults review a children's show...review it as if you are a child, not an adult!

Then again when this was on the AIR I was watching shows like X-Files and Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine so compared to the production values of those big American shows what chance does a little cheap Canadian show made for kids have anyways.<br/><br/>This show is very very very well done with great stories and episodes. For anyone born in the 80's and early 90's it's a reminder of what life was like and what life looked like back then when we were young. It's a good show because the stories are so good. I haven't a clue if they make shows like this any more but honestly they could reboot this show for this decade and for this batch of kids and I believe it would be just as good but in HD.<br/><br/>At the time of this review you can find this show on netflix.

2181,Goosebumps, What do you expect from a child's show?,"When I was in the fourth grade the Goosebumps books became exceptionally popular.  Every month when scholastic came out almost every kid would buy the latest book.  When the TV show came out, I don't remember the excitement being at quite the same level.<br/><br/>Looking back at the show lately (I can't believe it still comes on), I can see why I wasn't such a huge fan of the show.  When you are reading the book, you can imagine the monsters, make them as scary as you want (granted the books were mediocre at best).  In the show, it was all displayed in such a banal way that the only people who can get scared are five year olds (and they probably don't get nightmares).  What do you expect? Movies that are labeled horror movies don't even scare people anymore, we are beyond that. We know what to expect.  Does anyone anticipate a children's show to break new grounds to scare us?<br/><br/>I don't know what I'm trying to conclude, but this is not a quality show and everybody knows that.  It is however a children's show, and children's shows tend to be a little shabby.  Except Arthur, now that's a good show!",15 out of 31 found this helpful.,,29 August 2003
2182,Goosebumps," Great show, loved the little thrills","The Goosebumps show has been a family favorite (among the 20-somethings and younger) since it began. Though not extremely well acted or written, it was the best spooky little show of the time. My nieces and I tried never to miss an episode, but we missed a few, unfortunately. One annoyance for my niece was that there was some discrepancy about who starred as Will Blake in the ""Werewolf of Fever Swamp"" episodes-- Amos Crawley or Michael Barry (as listed in the credits). Minor annoyances aside, we eagerly look forward to future episodes being released on DVD. I can't wait to see the ""Night of the Living Dummy"" episodes again and I'm looking forward to seeing ""One Day at Horrorland"" (apparent precursor to the Escape From Horrorland CD-ROM game) for the first time.

2183,Goosebumps," I eventually lost interest, but it was fun for a while","For several years during the 1990s, R.L. Stine wrote and published many books in his ""Goosebumps"" series. I used to like to read some of these books, when I was around ten years old, and eventually, I discovered this ""Goosebumps"" TV show, which I enjoyed watching for a while. I eventually went off both the books and the TV series (late in 1997, when I was eleven years old), but I can't deny the fact that I was once a fan.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about the plot of this show. Basically, all I can say about it is that the programme was an adaptation ""Goosebumps"" book series, so the episodes were horror stories for kids.<br/><br/>For a while, R.L. Stine would pump out ""Goosebumps"" books very quickly, so quickly not all of the stories could have been that focused. This suggested that the author was money-hungry. Some of the stories you could tell were ridiculous just by the title, such as ""The Blob That Ate Everyone"". Since this show was an adaptation of the books, the cheesiness from the books (or at least from some of them) obviously showed here. The show may have had more problems that that (it has been too long for me to be able to tell).<br/><br/>Some might consider episodes of this show bad adaptations of the books. For me, it's been a while, and I don't know exactly how the two compared. I don't have as much memory of the ""Goosebumps"" books and TV show as certain others who were fans back in the 1990s, so I can't write the most insightful review. I do, however, know that I probably wouldn't think much of the show right now (I'm not sure about some of the books). Well, the books and the show definitely deserve some credit for how many kids they entertained back in the day, but I believe that ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" was a superior show.",8 out of 16 found this helpful.,,28 August 2007
2184,Goosebumps, * *1/2 out of 4.,"Not in the same league as Nick's Snick show Are You Afraid of the Dark?, but still an entertaining, occassionally scary show made for kids. The main problem was that some of R.L. Stine's books just do not adapt very well on screen, especially Monster Blood. Some of the titles that made it out on video are: -The Haunted Mask * * * Classic premise, good set-up. Some good life lessons. -The Haunted Mask II * * * Intense, scary sequel. As good as TV shows like this can get. -Night In Terror Tower * * Dull and cheap looking. -Stay Out of The Basement * * Ripoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a poor gimmicky ending. -Welcome To The Dead House * * * Fun little chiller kind of spoofs all those zombie film of the 70's &amp; 80's. -One Day At Horror Land * *1/2 Entertaining, but somewhat bland. -Werewolf Skin * * * Neat effects, good build-up. -I believe it was called The Werewolf of Fever Swamp * *1/2 Appealing cast, some scares and a true surprise at the end.<br/><br/>Rated Y7 for some Mild Violence.",7 out of 15 found this helpful.,,19 August 2002
2185,Goosebumps, A Great Series,"I first watched ""Goosebumps"" when I was 8 years old back in 1996.  The episode I saw was called ""A Night in Terror Tower"".  It scared me and gave me nightmares.  I never wanted to watch the show again.  But I gave the show another chance and I loved it. The second episode I saw was ""The Cuckoo Clock of Doom"".  I realized that the show wasn't just scary but it was also funny.  <br/><br/>My favorite episodes were: ""One Day at Horrorland"", ""Piano Lessons Can Be Murder"", ""The Ghost Next Door"", and ""A Night in Terror Tower"".<br/><br/>""Goosebumps"" really was a good series.

2187,Goosebumps, Beware Scary Good Time,"This is an honorable mention in my personal favorite horror anthologies. This is also another of my childhood and adolescent relics when I was about eleven or twelve I was a fan of the Goosebumps books, I got into them because they reminded me of the horror anthology shows I watched like ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" but also ""Tales from the Cryptkeeper"" but for kids.<br/><br/>They really were cool, I liked the stories most of them were genuinely scary, they weren't watered down most of the stories carried within a genuine sense of danger. I even like that the protagonists are kids which isn't always common in the horror genre.<br/><br/>But also I really like the cover art on most of those books which was really cool and scary looking at the same time, which is something most horror books had in the late 60's to 90's which is something I sorely miss; because just seeing that cover art just motivated you into reading that book and expecting to be in for a horror treat.<br/><br/>I watched this TV show around the sixth grade when I was at my adolescence, when I heard about the live action TV adaptation I was psyched because I always felt the book series could be made into a TV show.<br/><br/>The only bad thing is some of the effects in an episode or two aren't up to par. But the main problem is certain stories that are fan favorites maybe missing from the series and excluded. But those things were all mainly due to budget limitations which meant access to certain proper effects tech was limited but most of all why they couldn't order up on more episodes which is why the seasons of the show were a tad short, so that's why I can let this slide.<br/><br/>But to me what really powered the episodes was the stories themselves, and even some of the kid actors in them did a good job acting wise, some maybe familiar faces which is cool, seeing some have their start in this show. The show I felt really captured the spirit of the series, if maybe not perfectly, but good enough to flow right, be entertaining, but most importantly good in their own way. I even like the theme song which is spooky and reflects the nature of the book series. I'll just state a few of my favorite episodes/tales.<br/><br/>Camp Nightmare: This episode is based on one of my favorite volumes in the series. This story is more on the suspense thriller side you could say almost like an episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" but for kids. I like how everything is just unsettling from beginning to end, as everything that is happening in camp isn't Kosher.<br/><br/>Say Cheese and Die: I really like the concept where it flipped the notion of camera's always capturing the happiest parts of life, here it's the worst. Really like the look of each of the photographs which were each disturbing as it depicted misfortune as well as bring it. Also, this tale has a young Ryan Gosling, which makes the tale even better and it was a good start for the guy.<br/><br/>Welcome to Dead House: This really is my favorite tale in both the show and book series. From beginning to end there is just suspense and tension that just continually ratchets up as the story progress. I like the look of the house and town they're in which are creepy looking as they just spell danger all over. Just like the kids you feel completely unsettled and uncomfortable because you know in the back of your mind something rotten going on in Denmark. And you hope the kids find the truth on time as their survival may depend on it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind if they did a revival of this series, but put it on a premium channel like Shutter and have a big budget so we can put some other fan favorite tales that never made it on the first show, it's a thought to consider anyway.<br/><br/>""Your in for a scary good time.""<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,9.0,31 October 2019

To this day Goosebumps is a tried and true favorite. Clever writing paired with bad child actors, hilarious 90's fashion and pop culture references make this show a 10/10.

2209,The Passage, An Abomination...,"The Passage novels by Justin Cronin have a depth to them that I have rarely found in many book of the same genre. In fact I think that the first 250 pages of the first book are some of the best writing I have ever encountered, nuanced and with an imposing sense of dread. The first episode of the Fox adaptation, by contrast, abandons all this for a ""by the numbers"" vampire tale. Familiar tropes, clumsy writing, poor visual effects. Equally disappointing are the totally unnecessary revisions to cast and characters which I can only assume were as a result of pandering to perceived quotas for gender and ethic diversity (there are already plenty of strong, positive characters of both genders and different races in the novels). The Passage deserved a large production (a la ""Game of Thrones"") approach or a multi movie deal. What it got was Saturday afternoon cable filler - appalling.
Update - In the interest of objectivity I watched all 10 episodes. If I had not read the books I would have rated it a 4 or 5 star out of 10. The problem with the show, however, is not that it is different from the books but that every 'creative' decision taken has rendered the story a weaker version of the written one. The revisions to character and plot have been taken to serve a commercial model, based on Fox's audience, revenue stream and the cable format. They have not been taken to serve the story.

What I also like is, these people are going for their money and they earn it. Given the world's current obesity epidemic, anything that promotes physical efforts to the limit of one's capabilities is not to be dissed and aside from muddy water, the contestants aren't humiliating themselves by intentionally laying in boxes of scorpions or eating 6"" long cockroaches.

Though the pilot had a few bugs (we don't know anything about the contestants and it tends to be one unknown person after the other getting soaked or hit in the groin--granted, that worked for ""AFV"") it also had some bonuses the Japanese show did not have. Namely, the comedy of former ""Talk Soup"" host John Henson (ABC is a funnier place with him on the network) and hotty Jill Wagner doing sideline reporting. Jill is not only a BABE, but pretty good at what she does, too.<br/><br/>I'm sure they will make adjustments along the way, but after seeing the first show, there's enough promise to give it a try this summer.

2219,Wipeout, A really entertaining show to watch after an exhausting day.,"So every episode features 24 going through a series of obstacle courses. The commentary isn't very funny, but some of the wipeouts are hilarious. However the Smackwall and Rumble Bridge obstacle from Season 3 are being re-used in the qualifying round which, as a regular viewer, sometimes pisses me off. However most of the stunts are incredible, such as a series of pegs in a wall that extend and retract, so contestants will have to navigate their way walking along the pegs. My 5 favourite episodes(as of 12 July 2012)- Season 3 Episode 17, Season 4 Episode 8, S4E31, S5E8, S5E11. When Jill Wagner left the show, she was replaced by Vanessa Lachey. Vanessa fails to deliver the hilarious accompaniment of Jill. Overall a wonderful show.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,12 July 2012
2220,Wipeout, One Of The Only Things I Like On Tru TV,"Boy! Is this a good show! I like to watch it when I'm sick, have had a tough day, or just when it's on. I don't know where to start, uhhhh... How about John Henson, huh? He's an interesting character. Really makes me wonder, is he really like that? I hope not. He's been on Austin and Ally on Disney Channel as Austin's dad and I think his performance on this show smashes the one on Disney. But that's just me. John Anderson, however, he seems like Henson's opposite, but they work like a specially crafted team on Wipeout. You guys probably know this, but why did Jill Wagner take a break on the show? I haven't heard about that. Personally, I like Jill more than Vanessa Lachey, even though she only had a short time as host. Anyway... They have come up with interesting nicknames for the contestants, and they made me crack up sometimes. The show starts with 24 contestants, and you don't see all of them attempt the course, but you are able to see the best performances. Just as funny and ridiculous as some of the contestants are some of the obstacles along the way. People get hurt, but not really, and it seems the body shouldn't bend that way in some instances.

My wife was rolling too, and my son almost hit a back flip because of the ridiculousness these people go through. The two commentators are a good addition to the show. The female is just a pretty face with smart remarks, but she's a kind of funny.This show is like that Japanese show MXC, but in my opinion, smarter. In some of the courses, the obstacles are manually activated, and so, when the contestants approach still obstacles, little do they know, they're in for a face full of 'Boom'.

Vanessa Lachey replaced her for a season, and just wasn't as funny as Jill.<br/><br/>While it's funny to see people get smacked in the head, it does get old. The good thing is the contestants are always new. The crazier they are the better the show. And that's the only reason to watch this after a couple of years.

2226,Wipeout," Abysmal with the hosts, passable without.","I remember MXC quite fondly because of its ability to compliment the difficult and often times surreal ""challenges"" with funny, witty, or equally surreal commentary in general. The show flowed really well, and although it was absolutely stupid television, it was stupid television that knew what it was and played off of that very effectively indeed. Wipeout, on the other hand, is much dumber television without any of the charm or self awareness its predecessor had. The show is similar in that there are contestants putting themselves through an assortment of challenges, and it's hosted by two human males, but its similarities stop there unfortunately.<br/><br/>If you're going to have a show with people talking constantly and without pause, you need to be sure those people are both entertaining, and have something relevant to say. The hosts on Wipeout have neither, and bombard the viewer with the most terrible of jokes that offer no benefit to the show whatsoever. They range from outright pathetic to mean to tasteless, which would be fine if they could be funny, but never have I heard a single thing from either of them that I felt needed to be said, or enhanced the experience in any way. I cannot stand hearing them talk, to the point that I NEED to mute the TV when it comes on, it isn't something I can tolerate even as background noise, as it does nothing but dampen my mood.<br/><br/>The one good thing I can say about this show is that they sometimes have interesting or funny contestants, such as Ariel Tweto, but this too highlights how worthless and talentless the hosts and Jill whatshername actually are. They're constantly overshadowed by the no-names that put themselves through that torture and, rather than playing off of their characters as MXC would do, they in most cases insult them or offer some obvious poorly written crack about the situation they're in.<br/><br/>This show is like a castrated, dull, tedious version of MXC, hosted by two Tom Bergeron-tier absolute existential failures. It's watchable if you mute it, but if you have a shred of human integrity, compassion, or a taste for humor outside of puns and douchebaggery, look very far away from here.",7 out of 19 found this helpful.,3.0,9 May 2013
2227,Wipeout, Dysfunctional Hosts Reflect the Wipeout.,"Instead of a show dedicated to having fun, watching people self-destruct in compromising situations is the lack of heart of this program.

2230,Wipeout, Re-make of a comically dubbed-over Japanese game show.,"I guess I probably shouldn't be too annoyed at a show that rips off another show, which is basically a comedic American re-dubbing of a Japanese show (Takeshi's Castle), but I can't watch ""Wipeout"" without immediately thinking of Spike's ""MXC: Most Extreme Challenge."" The obstacle course names, the way the announcers try to crack visual pun jokes and call all the contestants by nicknames, its all borrowing from MXC, but the show seems to lose something without the whole ""people ad-libbing over Japanese stock footage"" part. It's like if MST3K were re-made, but done ""seriously,"" and with new actors trying to replace the old B-movies that were being mocked.<br/><br/>""Wipeout"" tries to be ""MXC"" like ""Repo: The Genetic Opera"" desperately tries to be ""The Next Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" and like Repo, Wipeout is barely as good as what it attempts to copy. I've even read on Wikipedia that ABC tried to buy up the search term ""MXC"" through Google to try to re-direct traffic to their official Wipeout website. If ""MXC"" hadn't come first (and been made 5 years prior, 17 if you count the age of the source material for the re-dub), maybe I could watch this show and just take it for what it is; people competing in a crazy foam prop obstacle course for money.<br/><br/>Oh and btw, contrary to the belief of some, you didn't have to be an anime-obsessed ""weeaboo"" to enjoy the hilarity of MXC.",10 out of 47 found this helpful.,5.0,27 May 2009

2237,Emerald City, Definitely a re-telling!,"Interesting start. Episode 4 was very good. Episode 5 blew my mind.<br/><br/>Some people hate having a story re-told but for me movies and shows are just a director's version of a story and well done re-telling can be interesting. The play Wicked is a perfect example.<br/><br/>Visually appealing, smart and sexy, special effects are much better than with previous shows such as Once Upon a Time. NBC apparently wants to give the other media formats that have been eating into their subscriber base a run for the money by creating original content that has not been seen before. NBC brought in director Tarsem Singh and this is his first television project but he comes well prepared with past experience in movies such as The Cell which he also did with Vincent D'Onofrio and other well received movies. Filmed in Spain, Hungary and Croatia. <br/><br/>Based more on the original Baum books than the first movie was which covered only the first book. So far it appears there is more of a focus on having human characters and it doesn't have the magical creatures that are part of Baum's books. <br/><br/>Some twists so far:<br/><br/>Baum's flying monkeys are drone automatons that resemble golden monkeys that spy on the denizens of Oz for the Wizard. Instead of the Munchkinville we have a Tribal Free Lands. The reason for the Yellow brick road is explained. Oz is not a hard to reach area as it was in the movie. Seems like many folks are concerned about Toto being portrayed by a German Shepard but give the dog a chance. <br/><br/>More importantly the story is told more in Baum's style so Dorothy is not the focus and others get to show their involvement in the story as well. It may well be not all about Dorothy this time around.<br/><br/>I do see some open questions especially the way they started the first few minutes of the show but I am guessing like with many movies today they will be going back to answer some of those questions later in the season. <br/><br/>Key players so far are the following:<br/><br/>Witch of the West (Ana Ularu)/ Witch of the East (Florence Kasumba)/ Glinda (Joely Richardson)/ Wizard of Oz (Vincent D'Onofrio)/ Dorothy (Adria Arjona)/ Lucas (Oliver Jackson-Cohen,The Strawman)/ Eamonn (Wizard Guard/The Lion?)/Jack (Gerran Howell) /Mombi (Witch, Fiona Shaw)/ Tip (Ozama?, Daughter of the King of Oz, Jordan Loughran)/ Karen (Dorothy's birth mother, Gina Bellman)/ Anna (Counselor, Isabel Lucas)/ Princess Langwidere, Lady Ev, Princess of Ev (Stefanie Martini)(brief flashes of her so far but appears in the fourth episode)<br/><br/>NBC offers more info from their site, Oz Reimagined: The Making of Emerald City, under Sneak Peeks from http://www.nbc.com/emerald-city",60 out of 85 found this helpful.,8.0,7 January 2017

2239,Emerald City," It was promising, but too much going on.","I know I'm late to the Emerald City train. I saw the trailer sometime last year, was super excited, then forgot all about it until I re-newed my Hulu account and saw it on my feed. Anyway, overall I liked the show, however, I can see why they cancelled it.<br/><br/>First, the costumes are gooorgeous. I love Trisha Biggar's work in Star Wars I, II, &amp; III, the costumes were about the best thing from those movies, and honestly they are here too. My favorite was the Witch of the East, her flowing red gown with her black feather collar and ruby hand clasps, stunning. Too bad she was so short lived, because it would have been nice to see more of her character.<br/><br/>Second, I love Adria Adjora as Dorothy. I thought she was gorgeous and it was great to see a Latina play that part. I also liked West's casting, don't remember the actresses name, but she was very good as well.<br/><br/>Third, I love the re-imagining of the original story. I love how it's updated for modern times, I love the science vs magic dispute (even though they didn't really flesh it out much), I like that ScareCrow/Lucas was in search of his memory (clever), Tin Man/ Jack was this Frankenstein half boy, half machine (ok, i can dig it), and Cowardly Lion/ was a disgraced, solider who cowardly murdered the royal family to save his own life (dope). There's a lot of great things about the story that I liked, but those are just a few.<br/><br/>Weak Points. Where the show took a turn for the worst was near the end. There was just a lot going on, a lot of loose ends to tie, and a lot were not able to tie together nicely. The ""war"" and ""beast forever"" climax it keep building up during the show was lackluster at best. A lot of the story was very convoluted and confusing to follow. There's the Wizard of Oz who is power hungry and ruthless and big on science, even though he never uses it; Glinda, who is cold-hearted stuck up bitch who was boring as hell to watch (Except her costumes); West, who interesting enough was the strongest character of the series, is a strung out nympho who is haunted by her past (one which never made sense to me); Tip, the boy who turns into a girl, who turns into a princess, who turns into a witch, only to turn back into a boy, then BACK into a princess again (not kidding); Jack, Tip's best friend who she kills and is turned into the Tin Man; Langwidere, selfish, princess who's really a robot (eye roll). And so on. There's a host of half ass characters and plots that don't really make sense, and never really go anywhere. Either they though the show was only going to be one season so they jammed as much in or they thought they would have more seasons to flesh these characters out, either way it's a mess. Near the end I no longer cared what happened to the characters, and that's when I knew why this was cancelled.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent attempt, but it sucks the story was so sloppy, because it had A LOT of potential.",16 out of 20 found this helpful.,6.0,6 July 2017
2240,Emerald City, Too bad it's cancelled,"I can see some of the points made by other reviewers that didnt like it but they are taking them to the extreme. The show is not garbage. The set pieces and costumes are beautiful. The story line is not stupid or confusing if you know how to put 2 and 2 together without the writers spelling it all out for you.
I had the opportunity to binge watch it without commercials but I can see for anyone who was watching as it aired each week would be less forgiving of faults.
I really liked Dorothy and Lucas and their journey. Tip a.k.a. Ozma's story was interesting but I was less interested in the other storylines. That doesnt mean they were bad or without purpose, they just felt like an interruption of the story I actually cared about.
The ending of the season had very little resolution, if any at all. There is a lot more story to tell that would undoubtedly be more exciting in season 2. Like the fight against this ""beast forever"" that we've been hearing about, who Dorothy inadvertently set free from a magical prison. Dorothy and Lucas finding their way back to eachother and finding out what exactly Dorothy is. Shes obviously not just an average human born in Oz and raised in Kansas. Sadly we'll never get that.<br/><br/>There are so many shows about cops and doctors and family drama, rehabbing houses ect and so few options with in the fantasy genre that it's a bit frustrating when a decent one comes around yet isnt allowed to tell it's full story.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,7.0,11 March 2019
2241,Emerald City, Full Of Potential,"The re-imaging of the tale of Wizard Of Oz is finally here and to my surprise it's a worthy adaptation. Although, there are some major changes, it feels like the writers have put a modern spin on a classic tale. As Dorothy is carried by a twister into an unknown land where she runs into a witch, which sets off a chain of events that will lead her to the wizard himself. Even If you are familiar with the books you will be met with surprises along the way. Unlike most adaptations, Emerald City forges it's own path as the writers takes a fresh approach to a classic tale. Emerald City isn't without it's flaws, for instance; it's characters development, or to rephrase, the lack of development puts a damper on the shows atmosphere. Perhaps in time it will gain the necessary traction it needs. The scarecrow is portrayed by Oliver Jackson-Cohen, who will play a major part in the story, which begs the question of whether he will live up to the epic story that comes with the territory. Perhaps the most questionable decision the story tellers made was making Toto a German Shepherd.<br/><br/>Emerald City is full of potential and has a lot to live up to, if they can polish the rough edges, I believe NBC might just make this show worth while.",39 out of 57 found this helpful.,7.0,6 January 2017

2247,Emerald City, A Stylish Quest With Interesting Characters,"Though it contains many references to ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""Emerald City"" has its own mythology. Dorothy Gale seeks to return home, but the lessons of this story are more complex and more far-flung than ""There's no place like home"".<br/><br/>On her way to the Emerald City, Dorothy traverses strange lands and encounters many with unknown intentions.

2248,Emerald City, A very ambitious re-telling that stands up well against the 1939 film classic,"Well I surmise that the producers had a lot of confidence in this new story that they are telling on the small (TV) screen with Emerald City and as such they are guaranteed to be pleasantly surprised and rewarded with a large market audience. Please do not even try comparing it to MGM's classic 1939 black and white (transformed to color) version of The Wizard of Oz as the stories are about the same as comparing your preferred mode of transportation from point A to point B, be that mode of transportation be a car, plane, boat or train. They may all get you from point A to Point B but each of us may prefer one mode of transportation over the others for various reasons. As such I suggest you give Emerald City the attention it deserves and not have any distractions. <br/><br/>The cinematography is luscious, the story is absolutely refreshing, and I believe it will appeal to a very broad range in tastes, as well as age and gender. The acting by Dorothy (played by Adria Arjona) as she finds herself in a new OZ world surround by all kinds of magical and colorful beings captures your attention and will have you hanging on to what she will encounter next. The Wizard of Oz is played by the well known dramatic actor Vincent D'Onofrio best known for his ten (10) year role as Detective Robert Goren in Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent.<br/><br/>I only have one complaint about the pilot episode and it was that were just a few too many interruptions to allow for the commercial sponsors to hock their wares. Other than this small setback that takes away from a very interesting new TV series, I recommend you and your loved ones look out for this series and be prepared to disappear into a new land of OZ much different than one can ever imagine.",43 out of 81 found this helpful.,10.0,6 January 2017

It has action and drama and colour and magic and touches of humour that are so deft that I find myself chuckling long after the joke is over.<br/><br/>Take Eamonn, the man I assume is playing the Tin Man. Stalked by one of his own troops intent on murdering him and returning to Oz to claim the glory, blaming his death on lions, the scene cuts away just as he is about to be stabbed in the back. Later, when we return, the camera shows him strolling casually back to camp. <br/><br/>Stumbling about in the dark two of the would-be murderer's accomplices find his body, hacked apart, and take it back to camp to dump it accusingly at the feet of Eamonn. Unconcerned, Eamonn takes a bite of an apple while looking at the body, then just says one word: ""Lions.""",20 out of 34 found this helpful.,8.0,7 January 2017

2251,Emerald City, Not for me ... w/ spoilers,"I don't usually write reviews 'cause I usually think I'm not a good judge for everyone and you may agree in this case too. I don't know Game of Thrones and I don't know earlier adaptations of the Wizard of Oz story so I'm not relating this show to those. I really didn't know what to expect but my hopes were high.<br/><br/>I couldn't make it through episode one. The scenes (sets) are beautiful and captivating but I don't watch the show for that and don't care. The Dorothy character is interesting but I'm interested in the story telling... what are the writers presenting to me? Early in the show we find an elderly woman having risen from her bed being confronted by her caretaker and she is now struggling with the caretaker who has taken hold of her by the wrists. It is a physical confrontation as the woman pleads to use red fingernail polish. Why there is a physical confrontation over red fingernail polish - they never address (mystery). Why it escalated into a physical struggle or why the caretaker would not have already permitted the color red and instead allowed the situation to escalate to this unrealistic level is not explained at all and all seems seriously unrealistic and pointless. It looks like a child-writer's view of controlling the elderly in a slight state of dementia.<br/><br/>Dorothy comforts the woman but takes a bottle of prescription medication from her and hides it in her pocket. What the medication is and why Dorothy took it is never addressed (mystery). Why Dorothy needed to protect the old woman from the medication - or instead to deprive the woman of her needed prescription is never addressed (mystery). The whole scene seems pointless and unrealistic. It of course begs many other questions. Does Dorothy make a habit of stealing drugs from patients? Does Dorothy have a special need of some sort we don't know about? Was someone trying to harm the woman and Dorothy has foiled that plot? All curious and unexplained.<br/><br/>This trend continues as instance after instance with a lot of details all go unexplained. Later, the police have arrived at a crime scene. The many issues of the crime scene, how the police knew to come, what happened to the police officer, how or why things were what they were at the scene... and most importantly, why I should care about any of it - are all ignored.<br/><br/>Special effects are impressive, I guess, except I don't care about any of that when the visuals are merely some sort of technological presentation. Why are these various elements of the story being presented if they are irrelevant? Soon Dorothy is in a new land. There too, the effects and sets are impressive but the story itself makes little sense in terms of why people do what they do. Their goals, their intent, their mindset all seem to be unrelated to what they say, how they act, what they want, etc.<br/><br/>The story-telling is weak and uninteresting. The reason seems to be because there are too many convoluted details that do little to contribute to or support the foundation of the story. Dorothy is tortured over a simple misunderstanding while falling into that trap seems more a matter of bad writing than Dorothy being in any realistic danger inherent in the situation. That is, some common-sense things that she might have said to escape or extricate herself from the situation she simply doesn't say. Why? Because the writer had already planned for her capture. She was captured by the writer - not the bad guys. It's all just unrealistic. <br/><br/>There is little time spent developing the characterization. So, as Dorothy is tortured (for example), there's no reason to care. I mean, one can care in the abstract about the evil of young women being tortured, but there's no reason to care about this particular case or this particular person. We don't know her. We don't really know who she is or what she's about. Her angst or fear in the previously mentioned crime scene is another example. We don't know her or anything about it so my reaction is so what. Was I supposed to care about the police officer that disappears? Perhaps not but how is Dorothy any different?<br/><br/>Nothing seems relevant or worthy of our attention. Nothing seems important - unless everything is important and then of course we're back to the mystery of the red fingernail polish.<br/><br/>The unfolding avalanche of details without any means to distinguish relevance from pointless combined with the complete lack of character development and foundation combine to make the story much more trouble than it is worth. - I say skip it unless you're ready to focus just on scenery.<br/><br/>I gave it 3 stars due to the scenery, costumes and effects. Such things cannot combine to warrant anything more when the story-telling is so convoluted. /// Of course, all such questions may have been eventually answered with great clarity and import if I could have been more patient and lasted longer. Perhaps the fault is mine.",30 out of 57 found this helpful.,3.0,14 January 2017
2252,Emerald City, Wanted it to Be Great ... But,"Loved the premise and mash-up of original OZ with steampunk/fantasy. Sets are terrific and ideas are ambitious. Dark, gritty, and inventive. But also flat dialogue, average acting, and a storyline that needs a huge re-write. D'Onofrio can be a compelling actor, but he's coasting in this role. The city seems to be the central theme, so I get that everything doesn't center on Dorothy. Unfortunately her only believable impulse is to help others. The rest of her character is limp. <br/><br/>After the two-hour debut, I imagined the acting wouldn't improve and the story line, regardless of invention, would not hang together.

2253,Emerald City, Beautifully realised fantasy,"With Game of Thrones dominating all things fantasy (well, it does around here!), it seems to me to be pretty brave for any production company to consider the genre when they are destined to be compared. Thankfully that challenge has been taken up with Emerald City. Full of eye-popping sets, wonderful props, astounding locations, brilliant design elements and mind blowing special effects, and combining with beautiful leads, great actors all, and an evocative soundscape, as well as a modern script and original story ideas, and the wait for the next season of Game is now not so onerous. I've watched three episodes so far, having bought the dvd with some trepidation, but I've easily been won over. Vincent D'Onofrio is especially good as the Wizard, in fact, his role and its execution are likely pivotal to this show's success. Don't think he totally steals the show though, as there are many brilliant characters. And it was also brave, I think, to take on a Wizard of Oz remake.

I prefer beautiful scenery, costumes, great acting, scripts....just a wonderful feast for the eyes and ears. This take off of the Wizard of Oz is a bit dark and dusty. Gone is the technicolor of the original. But the sets are imaginative and the script and acting are good. Plot lines are unpredictable, so you never know what's about to happen next. The main attraction seems to be the growing relationship between Dorothy and Lucas. I suppose it's a romance that's going to blossom....eventually. This isn't made for kids and it's not a musical....but I'm interested to see how creative the producers will be in future episodes. I see this has been cancelled after one season. It couldn't hold my interest. I stopped watching after a few episodes. The problem for me - it's too dark and dusty with little heart.

This terrible idea needs to simply be booted, as well as the writers and show creators and whomever green-lighted it at NBC. The Scarecrow presents as a type of Christ, having been hung on a Tau cross as if he were being crucified. The wicked witch of the west is presented as not only a witch, but a slut witch, apparently working her 'charms' in what can only be described as a 'house of ill repute' to be clean about it. We definitely aren't in Kansas OR Oz anymore. Steer clear of this trash. I had to give up watching this mess as Dorothy and the Scarecrow-character approached the Emerald City and the White Queen(?) appears to have a conference with the Wizard of Oz. White Witch?

I'm a sucker for this kind of story (unexplained aliens) and the writers played it to the hilt. Also, the actors were good. I hope this show lasts for a good long while.

2259,Emergence, ABC coulda held on for another season...,"Much like Clea DuVall, Alison Tollman needs to be in a lot more than she's been given. She speaks with quirk and wit, with a rapid fire delivery only Lauren Graham used to possess. She's lovely to watch, from a beauty standard and an acting one, with an expressive face that draws you in, and keeps you captive and loving it.<br/><br/>Emergence could have been her takeoff, and it should have been. Here Tollman is in a heroic role and playing the everywoman. Her maternal motives are clear and never wavering on any moral angle. In fact, primarily the rest of the cast are to deal with the moral implications this show raises, while Tollman is driving the boat on nerve and emotion. It's such a treat!<br/><br/>The series itself, as a stand-alone season, is impressive in that it takes a concept told a hundred times and finds the other hundred ways that story could be told. This one season feels so much like three, with so much plot packed in, but the viewer is never lost or questioning why Tollman is making the decisions she is. That's a testament to the writers as well. Solid dialogue in every episode, along with great editing, keeps this jam-packed show moving at a quick pace.<br/><br/>It might only have enough for a one-day binge, and it might leave you absolutely yearning for more, or just more of Tollman, but Emergence is American science fiction done well, and done right.<br/><br/>It even goes so far as fix the Haley Joel Osment quandary from AI: how far can you stretch one child actor's wonder and innocence far enough it won't totally ruin what you're watching?<br/><br/>The answer: Tollman, and really good writing.",16 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,4 October 2020

What I like so far is that they are not trying to force feed you the plot or it's characters. From the start the flow of the show is on point, it drags you in and gives you many small parts to keep you intrigue, and then throws in a small twist and at the same time, the heroine feels real, not just placing another sex sale character in a sheriff outfit.

2269,Emergence, My review of season 1 (13 episodes),"I just finished watching episode 13 (season 1). As expected, it was the end of Act One, and there was some resolution, but there will be more to follow. Not sure I can slog through another 13. I liked the series okay--I don't generally watch anything scifi-ish, so I can't compare it to others of that genre. Here are some random comments, in no particular order:
1. I usually hate shows that have a kid as the focal point, but I gotta say that Piper was darling. Precocious, to be sure, but still enough of a kid to be endearing. Not sassy or cocky, but truly trying to figure stuff out as she went along.
2. I also appreciated that Jo's daughter Mia was polite, respectful, loving and not at all the norm for divorced female TV cops, namely, saddled with kids who are sullen, rude, withdrawn, eye-rolling PITAs. Very refreshing.
3. Also refreshing that the cute FBI guy ignored the young, skinny redhead at the office (who clearly was interested) and made out with the chubby, middle-aged, plain Jane Jo.
4. Re Jo: if she tucked her hair behind her left ear one more time, I was going to throw a rock through the TV. But she let her hair hang down in her face on the right side. WTF? Tie the whole mess back, girlfriend! And stop making those funny corkscrew movements with your mouth.
5. Even after Jo figured out that Piper had ""powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (sic),"" she still treated the kid like a 10-year old. ""You will NOT use your superpowers, do you hear! Or I'll ground you forever!"" Jo, show her some respect for Pete's sake.
6. During the last two episodes (while the crew was hiding on Plum Island), the line, ""We've gotta get outta here NOW!"" was uttered by someone approximately 784 times.
7. I liked Grandpa. The ham radio thing was clever. I guess Piper will cure his cancer next season.
8. Alex the ex was nice, too. I don't want him to move to DC, because I don't want Piper and Mia to be separated. But I didn't get any lingering chemistry between him and Jo.
9. Benny had been on The Mentalist, credibly playing an American in that series.
10. Something that bugs me about shows where weird stuff happens is that even after multiple examples of events that cannot be explained by (obvious) rational means, skepticism is still rampant. In the very last episode, Alex suggests something and Jo says, ""Are you insane?"" After EVERYTHING crazy that has happened, she still acts like it's the pilot episode. Alex correctly points out that the whole thing is insane.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,6.0,4 February 2020

2272,Emergence, Great start!,"It seems like there were very few family-type science fiction/fantasy shows released last year, which was disappointing. This show is what we've been waiting for! If you miss shows like Lost, The 4400, The Crossing, Haven, Believe, Orphan Black and Fringe...and if you currently enjoy shows like Stranger Things, Glitch, Roswell NM, Manifest and Siren, then give this show a chance. It's quite good, and as others have said, it comes with a fantastic cast!<br/><br/>Ignore the review that says this is a rip-off of stranger things. While they're both good shows, the only thing the two shows have in common is they both have a supernatural theme with a suspenseful plot that makes you want to rip your hair out when you realize you have to wait for more episodes. In Stranger things, you get a lot of supernatural with a bit of drama. In Emergence, you get a lot of drama with a bit of supernatural.<br/><br/>Off topic, but if you're in to this genre, there's a lot of potentially good tv shows coming out. They're re-doing The 4400 (which is nice given we never got to see how it ended the first time).

I actually really thought it was good and was surprised it hadn't gotten good reviews. So I want to put it my two cents.<br/><br/>Without spoiling too much, this show reminds me of stranger things, but it is absolutely a whole different game. It takes a story that is inevitably a bit complicated and plays it out over 13 episodes. The pacing in this show is some of the best, with each episode feeling like no time is wasted, and every scene we see something new or interesting.<br/><br/>It is absolutely one of ABC's best recent shows and even if there are one or two plot holes by the end the execution makes it well worth a watch.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,5 January 2021

So, I take what I can get and cross my fingers that at least 1 such show will survive.<br/><br/>But, the chances of survival for Emergence look slim. The plot is moving only slightly faster than a slug. The conversations between the characters are 90% exposition (show, don't tell).

To be honest I think the writers have really done a great job of making it such a light entertainment show, with touches of Mythology brought in for you to talk about.<br/><br/>I personally will be watching vividly and hoping the series runs for a few series. 9 out of 10 for taking me into a new world, and wonder what adventures Jason, Pythagoras and Hercules will get up to next.",103 out of 124 found this helpful.,9.0,27 December 2013
2284,Atlantis, A fun romp through not-really history,"I wasn't initially thrilled by the premiere of Atlantis. I thought the script was a bit pedantic, and the artistic license of mythical Greek history to be a bit, well, too broad. After watching it for a bit, I turned it off, disappointed and expecting it to fall off my radar.<br/><br/>BUT... it turns out I was wrong! I happened to catch a slightly later episode when there was nothing else on, and lo and behold, I actually liked it. I started to notice how well the actors played their parts, how well they worked together, and how much fun they seem to be having. I also enjoyed the little details of the sets, and how the costumes the actors wear are well thought-out.<br/><br/>I also found the stories to be clever and fulfilling. To be sure, this isn't on the same par as I, Claudius, but it is entertaining and definitely above the spate of reality show drivel that permeates the airwaves these days. The characters grow more likable with each episode, and the show as a whole keeps gaining momentum.<br/><br/>In short, Atlantis is a hit with me. It's likable characters and engaging stories have me hooked and waiting for more. It may not be the historical take that I was anticipating, but it is a lot of fun just the same.",47 out of 56 found this helpful.,9.0,24 December 2013
2285,Atlantis, I'm Enjoying It Very Much,"Anything that makes me laugh and ""takes me away"" for the 45 minute's it's playing rates a 9 in my book. I hope it stays on the air for many seasons! OK, so the acting is a bit hammy here and there, but that's what the script calls for. It's not a TV drama for heaven's sake. I like that the Actors ham it up a bit (does anyone other then me think the pairing of Mark Addy and Robert Emms came from the mind of a Laural and Hardy fan?) I think Jack Donnelly is very believable in the role as over the top good guy Jason (and very pleasing on the eyes). It's also good to see my old friend from Deep Space Nine, Alexander Siddig. Amazing how he's got to be 20 years distant from his role as the handsome doctor Bashier and yet, except for a bit of gray and the beard, he doesn't look any older. Wish I could say the same...<br/><br/>As for the plot of the show, I can hear my mom now, although, as the oracle would put it, she walks with the dead. She used to teach high school English and had an advanced class on Greek and Roman Mythology... she'd be loving this show, even as she would be picking it apart. <br/><br/>Modern man enters another realm by going through some sort of under the ocean portal and ends up in the legendary city of Atlantis. Freaky! And yet, once you get into the show, you find yourself believing that's exactly where you are and hoping that somehow Jason will be able to change their destiny and they won't end up all dead at the bottom of the sea someday. Well, at least I do, even though my mom would be laughing at me for thinking so about a TV show, for heaven's sakes.<br/><br/>God be with you mom! It's nice to be thinking about you while watching this fun new series. <br/><br/>BTW... set your DVR to tape all episodes and hopefully you'll be able to catch the first episode on rerun.. My DVR had the number's all messed up, but I did get 1, 2, and 3 and although I watched episode 2 first (as it was labeled 1) I went back and caught 1 and then watched 3 and enjoyed them all!",40 out of 48 found this helpful.,9.0,8 December 2013
2286,Atlantis," Good, old fashioned fantasy adventure.","I watched this with some trepidation, as the show it is essentially replacing, Merlin, was a little silly for my tastes and the acting skills of several of the cast were not impressive, in my view. I am always delighted for my preconceptions to be proved inaccurate and in this instance, it has proved to be the case (touch wood). The show begins weakly, with minimal background on the lead character and we are thrown in (literally) at the deep end. Having watched the whole episode, I can understand now why this is so. Obviously, the mysteries of Jason's origins are destined to be revealed over the course of the series. The sets are gorgeous, especially the scenes filmed in Morocco. The acting is almost uniformly first rate, with Mark Addy (The Full Monty) and Robert Emms in particular standing out. The excellent Alexander Siddig (Deep Space Nine, Syriana) also appears, but his role in the first episode is small. I am sure that will change in future episodes. He is too good to waste on a minor part. This is good, old fashioned swords and monsters escapism done very well. Anyone looking for deeper meanings or historical accuracy will be sorely aggrieved, but that is very far from the point. This show could be everything that Merlin promised, but ultimately failed to deliver. If the rest of the series is anywhere as much fun, I will be watching Atlantis for a long time to come. Take a look and give it 15 minutes before you give up on it. It really picks up in a big way. Well done, BBC!",115 out of 169 found this helpful.,9.0,28 September 2013
2287,Atlantis, Excellent and entertaining just like the haters,"The haters of this show are making me laugh.<br/><br/>-They mention bad acting and poor dialogue but do not elucidate further. -They mention bad plots but do not elucidate further. -They mention bad characters but do elucidate further.<br/><br/>Then we come to what is really the problem:<br/><br/>Blasphemy to Greek Mythology.<br/><br/>Seriously? This show isn't meant to be true to Greek Mythology and doesn't need to be. We've read and seen the stories of Greek Mythology a thousand times over so a retelling (basing all of the great events and heroes in Atlantis) feels fresh.<br/><br/>My favorite review comes from beef-638-121436 who starts logically looking at how fast people drew lots once, estimating that it should have taken one full week for 1,000 people to do so as opposed to the day it took in the episode. He uses this as a basis for some of his hatred against the show.<br/><br/>This is hilarious. Wake up people. This is a family-orientated show. Obviously it's not going to be bloody A Game of Thrones. The last family-orientated show attempting to be simultaneously exclusive to children and adults (Dr.Who) ending up become a massive contradiction full of plot holes which took itself too seriously when it didn't need to.<br/><br/>The people wanting an accurate retelling of the Atlantis story can watch BBC's 2011 ""Atlantis: End of a World, Birth of a Legend"" which really was bad asides from the special effects.<br/><br/>This at least is entertaining.<br/><br/>It's a BBC drama. Just like Dr.Who, it's mindless fun. People taking this seriously really need to ask themselves what's important because nitpicking over little details such as how fast 1,000 are able to draw stones is very petty.<br/><br/>Are BBC programs mainly watched by people with anal retentiveness nowadays or what?",63 out of 89 found this helpful.,,30 November 2013

To enjoy this, you have to sit back and relax and not wait for something to criticize. <br/><br/>I think it has a lot of potential. There are funny scenes, action and suspense. An interesting spin on the Greek myths and I hope it continues. <br/><br/>The actors are quite good in my opinion. I was so excited for something to finally fill the gaping hole Merlin left and I feel this is the perfect solution. <br/><br/>I'm grateful for a series with a little culture and anyone who loves mythology in general will love this exciting new angle.

2289,Atlantis," Stupid, but still fun","I decided to watch it because of Mark Addy, I didn't expect much, I suspected it would be as bad as ""Robin Hood"", and, well... Sometimes I come to think they spent all the funds for hiring him so they had nothing for special effects nor sets and locations.<br/><br/>The mythology in the show is only a loose base of names, sometimes some motives, but if you want to learn about the Greek mythology - then not from here. All the characters are just thrown into one place and time, sometimes they have something in common with the mythology, usually it's only a name. But hey, these are not historic facts, they are myths, so I guess they based an adventure fairytale on other fairy tales, right? Don't get uptight about it, it's not about truth anyway.<br/><br/>There's a lot of bad reviews here, I can see why, but most of these people haven't given the show a chance. The characters are actually not so idiotic as they seem, there's more to them than just the predictable stereotypes we get at the beginning, but they develop the way they are expected to develop, that's true. But in a world with movies like ""Fast &amp; Furious"", ""Twilight"", countless crime series about good agents and bad terrorists, you really expect every medium budget production to be of great quality?<br/><br/>To sum it all up, it's definitely not anywhere near ""Game of Thrones"" and such, but it's not so annoyingly stupid as ""Robin Hood"". It's just average, mindless entertainment.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,5.0,10 January 2014

I am going under the impression that most of the hater reviews were written after the first episode. However i do not see it fit to base a show on just the begging, you wouldn't review a film after 1/12 the way through it. Yet, although the somewhat shaky start, i can fully say the show has massively improved in performance and storyline quality. After watching the full first series i can honestly say i was throughly impressed, it has nicely filled a gap left after the final season of Merlin.

2294,Atlantis, Don't take it so seriously.,"I also actually like this take on ancient affairs. Like another reviewer I believe this is a very easy to watch fantasy. It has good humour. It sets out to be so improbable that it is actually fun to view and a bit like but in mo way as good as a Red Dwarf version of Star Trek. The acting is not wooden at all. A lovely variety of actors and Mark Addy as Hercules sums it up really. Unlike other programmes that set out to portray their own take on books or events, like the new yet hopelessly unreal version of Dracula, this knock about drama is not a serious look at Greek mythology. We have watched all the episodes and will continue to do so while the would be pundits that knock this program go and look at Dracula - now that is a 'serious' take on Draclua yet so unlike the book!",18 out of 27 found this helpful.,8.0,1 November 2013
2295,Atlantis, an abomination,"This should be a good TV show... A story about an ancient, mythical city should be fairly easy to make interesting, with plenty of scope for solid characterisations, sub-plots, adventures and twists. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Atlantis fails to deliver on all fronts. In fact it doesn't even turn up. <br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the show rushes through what should normally take an entire episode - the result is that the viewer is left with the impression the scriptwriters do not actually want to tell the story or that they are too lazy to engage the viewer in any understanding the protagonist's character. <br/><br/>The dialogue is predictable and intellectually suited only to children. To anyone more mature it is an insult that the writers thought such banality would engage them. Clichéd and unimaginative. <br/><br/>The acting is distinctly average but then again the cast doesn't have much to work with. When the script is amateur the acting can only follow suit. <br/><br/>Mythology is unashamedly violated with heavyweight Greek characters coming out of the woodwork and wasted with stupid, stereotypical idiosyncrasies which dumb down these hero's actual contributions to history or culture. We've got a gambling, drunk Hercules and a triangle obsessed Pythagoras. Wow, good work guys! Just look at these goons and tell me you can take them seriously - http://static.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AtlantisFeat.jpg<br/><br/>You can forget everything the books told you about Greek mythology because this show doesn't give a flying ****. It seems Homer, Plutarch and Pausanias' versions were simply not good enough for the writers. <br/><br/>If you are looking for the next ""Game of Thrones"", ""The Borgias"" or ""Spartacus"", you are in for a shocking disappointment. There is plenty of good TV out there - don't waste your time with this festering pile of nonsense unless you have 1 hour to kill and learn how NOT to do a TV series.",116 out of 218 found this helpful.,2.0,5 October 2013
2296,Atlantis, Could be a kids' show is not for the historical and mythological references,"Despite the unfavorable reviews I watched the pilot to the end. The script was terrible, for a prime time show. The amount of plot holes, senseless developments and ridiculous characters was way too much for any adult to accept. It could be a children's show since it did have a pleasant adventure feeling to it and the costumes were decently done. It's a shame though, that they put in so many names famous either from history or mythology. Evil god Poseidon, fat Hercules, wimpy Pythagoras all in a city called Atlantis? It seems wrong to see these characters in this setting; seeing history and mythology butchered this way, is destructive for kids in my opinion and downright insulting for adults.",75 out of 139 found this helpful.,3.0,29 September 2013
2297,Atlantis, Entertaining,"I love this show! Okay, it may not be historically accurate, but who cares? Isn't Atlantis a myth anyway? The acting is first class as are the locations. I was actually surprised to find out it was British as it is so well produced I thought it was American. Sorry British programme makers but some of them don't have the same polish as the American series. Although lately British television dramas are improving and I look forward to more excellent series to come.<br/><br/>Back to Atlantis. The plots are at times exciting and at others humorous especially Hercules. I studied ancient history and enjoy the mention of mythical and historical characters. Quite often it is only a tip of the hat to them but I like it and don't care whether they appeared in the same period of history or not - this is fiction.<br/><br/>Jack Donnelly is a good looking hero and plays his part well with a mixture of courage and vulnerability.

2298,Atlantis, Queer and idiotic trip through twisted details of mythology,"Out of curiosity I watched the first episode of this new fantasy series. Well, fantasy it is - just not very good fantasy. Firstly we see Jason survive an imploding bathyscaphe at great depth, and wake up on a beach. Then we get to watch his naked torso for about 19 seconds flat, with nothing else in view at all. I guess it must be to bait and hook teenager girls. Oh, is that what it's about? Fortunately there's a set of new, perfectly fitting clothing right next to him, so he gets dressed. Next he walks into a city (where of course all speak modern-day English) and gets attacked by a two-headed dragon (for trying to touch it) and right after, by guards. Luckily he escapes and meets Pythagoras, who is apparently in some way related to Hercules, coming in next bossing Pythagoras around.<br/><br/>This, to me, looks like a bad dream of a confused scriptwriter on acid. Patiently I wait for the moment, where all of this idiocy gets to make some sense.<br/><br/>And yes, as soon as the next scene develops, it all falls into place. Many worlds, great forces, the oracle who is probably his mother, and the hint that Jason is the son of a very important man, or perhaps-a god.<br/><br/>From here, I can dream up the rest of the story. Jason probably gets challenged a lot, meets the love of his life (which is bound to be a problematic relationship), battles the Minotaur and many other foes of ancient mythology.<br/><br/>The city has 20000 inhabitants. They are all summoned to the palace square, where they are addressed by king Minos, to draw a stone. However, there are at most 1000 persons in the square, and many of them seem to have copies all over the square. Then they line up to each take a stone. It is not very speedy, on average everybody takes 12 seconds. By this rate, it all will be over in... 20.000x12/3600= 67 hours. All attended by the king, so that would have to be stretched over 8-hour days, adding up to a full week of selecting 7 people. If I were that king, I would have thought of a somewhat shorter and less boring method to select 7 out of 20000. But hey, when the day is done all 20000 have magically passed.<br/><br/>This little insult to my intelligence is just one of many. Now, I really don't expect a series like this to be historically of mythologically correct, or scientifically accurate, but hell - the scriptwriters should know how to do basic math and not try to defy common sense. I'm feeling so much vicarious shame for them, it's almost unbearable.<br/><br/>Pythagoras gets selected, and spends a last supper with his best friends Hercules and Jason (who he has just met, so yesterday Hercules was his only friend) and for the second time Pythagoras gets stereotyped for being obsessed with triangles. Shame!<br/><br/>Ah, the princess doubts her father - clearly SHE will get to be the love interest of Jason.<br/><br/>More goofs: Jason draws a sword, and inspects it. It is clearly visible the sword has no sharp edges, just a sharp point. Still, it will do and he takes it to fight a monster. What's he gonna do, puncture the beast? All clothes and garments look unused, brand new. Nothing is dirty or worn. BBC and Urban Myth Films, why don't you go take a lesson from the original Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>But most of all, it is so wrong to have Greek mythology take place in Atlantis, first of all because Atlantis is not even a myth, it is mentioned in ONE old story which got propagated in modern times. This series feed our youth with twisted and confused stories that pretend to be the real myths. I can't help feeling a bit sick of this.

Although whilst I agree the first episode was only slightly satisfying and the acting was not great. I do not believe a review should be able to be written without watching the first season. You do not review a movie only seeing 1/12 of it do you? <br/><br/>Other than that so far this show has been picking up in speed and entertainment. <br/><br/>Anyone who has watched BBC Robin Hood will probably agree it had bad acting and effects in the first season but quickly took off. That is what I would compare it too. <br/><br/>So far having watched episode 1 to 3 they have given an good performance. I see myself looking for the next episode after the last one was done. Maybe not with the tenacity I would for a show such as Merlin or Doctor Who, but by no means is it not entertaining for me.<br/><br/>The story and lore of Atlantis, Hercules, Pythagoras, and another lady without giving away any spoilers is much different than what you would have learned from books. <br/><br/>So as the writers took the story of many other legends and made it there own, they are also doing with Greek mythology.

Most of the acting was awful but that was most probably down to the appalling script. Mark Addy was good but the main actor left a lot to be desired. Most of it was childish claptrap yet they put it on in the evening. Might have been better putting it on at teatime - kids may have liked it. For adults it was tame to say the least. What was so unrealistic was Jason's reaction to arriving in an ancient world - he hardly turned a hair. Very weird. Everything was predictable - especially when his new 'best friend' picked out the black stone. Hmmmm didn't know that was coming! Ha! We watched about half of the programme before turning it off.

You'll probably spot a few of them in the background of the coming season of Doctor Who. Where they belong to be honest.<br/><br/>The music is over the top, the script is full of jarring anachronisms such as exasperated characters saying ""Really?"" and the CGI is crap too. The rushed cuts just go to prove what an amateurish, or rather careless, production this is. In the same vein as shows like Zena this all takes place in a vague ""long ago"" period of history that doesn't even make proper use of the mythology and everything feels forced and rushed.<br/><br/>This is for BBC America (who were involved in the production), I'm surprised they even bothered showing it here. I doubt it will be a big hit abroad though because this is so poorly put together.<br/><br/>The only positive review of it you'll find in the media is from the Sunday Times who declared it ""an action packed buddy movie"" having presumably copy pasted their review from the wrong press release.<br/><br/>In short, very disappointed.",59 out of 116 found this helpful.,,1 October 2013

2308,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Older is Sometimes Better,"I was a HUGE fan of the original show. The borderline risqué and taboo humor the men (and sometimes women) showed was refreshing and allowed me to realize that not everyone is a prude when it comes to man-on-man action... albeit in humor. My favorites have always been Ryan Stiles and Collin Mochrie - when they were heavily featured, the show I felt was at its best. <br/><br/>With this newer show, I am sad to see Drew Carey missing. Understanding that he is busy hosting The Price is Right, I simply feel this newer show is lacking a bit. Aisha Tyler does not have the same chemistry with the other performers as Carey, and she simply doesn't seem to enjoy herself as much. This could change, rendering that criticism moot, but as it stands, I still prefer Carey.<br/><br/>Other than that, I strongly suggest that this show include the AUDIENCE once again and stop being so heavy to include 'guest stars' on the show. They can be entertaining, but not nearly as much as when the audience members, (at time begrudgingly) were put up on stage and forced to perform. It was entertaining, and made you realize that this REALLY is something the professionals make LOOK easy, but it's not.<br/><br/>Also, the games. I absolutely despise this new 'magic wall' game, or whatever it's called, where the performers lay on a red mat but appear to be standing up. Sure, it defies gravity on screen, but not a single one, in my opinion, have actually been funny. Adding ANYTHING to this show isn't needed... I still watch the old ones and crack up. The humor does not need to change for a new year.<br/><br/>All in all, I give this a 7 out of 10 so far. It DOES have much the same dynamic and chemistry as before, but the changes (aside from the set which I don't care about at all) aren't welcomed by me. I understand Aisha Tyler may come into her own, but this show DOES leave me preferring older shows to the newer ones.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,7.0,21 August 2013
2309,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, New Whose Line,"I LOVED the old Whose Line, the U.S version with Drew Carry.

The new host is a little annoying, but I'm just not used to her and it's very hard to beat Drew but she's not too awful, I'm we can get used to her. As for other aspects of the show, Wayne, Colin, and Ryan are still as funny as ever (though they look a bit older) their comedy is still as fresh as ever. The outline of the show has almost not been touched even when the commercials come on are almost the same, which to me is great. They added a few games, which were hilarious actually so overall I think that this is a start to another great show and I'm very excited to watch more.",17 out of 24 found this helpful.,9.0,21 July 2013
2310,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, My sides,"After many years of begging and waiting, Whose line is back on the air. Whose line is one of the funniest shows ever made and since the talk of it coming back, people have been going crazy and their expectations of the show have skyrocketed. So lets get down with the review. Most of the cast is back; Colin, Ryan, Wayne, Laura Hall and are fun 4th seater's. The new addition is Aisha who replaced Drew Carey. The transition from Drew to Aisha will be hard for most viewers but in a few episodes she'll grow on you but the thing I don't like is that she doesn't interact with the cast but if she changes that then she could be a great host. The set has changed and resembles the UK whose line a bit which will make old fans feel a bit nostalgic. Fans will be overjoyed to see some of their favorite games return and some new clever games as well. All in all, the show is as funny as ever with the same chemistry between members, great games and some fun guest members and a new host that has a lot of potential. Excited to see how the rest of the season goes.",17 out of 24 found this helpful.,9.0,17 July 2013
2311,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Aisha Tyler was a mistake,"Whose Line is one of my all time favorite shows. The old version at least. The new version is slightly less funny and much more annoying. I love Ryan, Colin, and Wayne, and their comedy level hasn't changed. I still find myself crying from laughter throughout the show. However, the new host, Aisha Tyler, isn't the least bit as funny as Drew Carey was. The whole cast was much more comfortable with each other when he was the host. Things like the ""Irish Drinking Song"" game were always my favorite when the guys would pull jokes usually making Drew Carey the butt of it. The guys are no where near comfortable enough with Aisha to make those jokes. And she isn't comfortable with them to do the same. She is more like a detached game show host than someone who could be involved in the hilarious Whose Line remake she was lucky to be a part of. Lastly, I can't stand this new celebrity guest thing they're doing. They don't actually do anything as it is and they're only there to promote their own shows which is just annoying to watch. Although I'm disappointed with the new Whose Line, I'm really glad it's back and I will gladly sit through Aisha Tyler's boring performance to see the stars, Ryan, Colin, and Wayne, do what they do best.",18 out of 26 found this helpful.,7.0,24 September 2013
2312,Whose Line Is It Anyway?," Gimmicky, Gaping Hole of Unfunny","The new incarnation of Whose Line is a reminder to everyone familiar with the old series of how much of a bore Aisha Tyler is to the series. Each episode starts with a rather tame introduction of the cast and then a long-winded explanation of how the show is set up. It gets to the point that it begins to feel that they could add an entire extra scene to the show with how much time she takes up.<br/><br/>Things just don't flow as smoothly on the show. Bringing in guest stars takes time to introduce them, but took away the audience interaction. Some of the better scenes I can recall from the Drew Carey edition was the audience sound effects. Quack Quack anyone? Instead we get dull actors to promote the shows that either you already watch, or you don't. They don't add anything to the show except the gimmick of tying in to another show.<br/><br/>The twitter hash tags are unnecessary. I want to see the show succeed after the long absence, but I don't feel we need to tweet about each skit on the show. I don't care if someone on the show caught a piece of popcorn in a skit.<br/><br/>There is no winner to the show, and no involvement for the host that it requires them to be funny or even present. Just get a voice over announcer and get on with the show.",17 out of 26 found this helpful.,3.0,28 July 2013
2313,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, It's just not like the original show,"Let me start by saying that I loved the Original show, the one with Drew Carey as the host. I have never laughed so hard at a show than I have to anything else and have watched each episode way more than once because the jokes just don't get old. I was one of the few people who was wishing Whose line to return somehow to TV once more, and it almost came as a dream come true when I heard news of a premiere episode coming up.<br/><br/>However, this show just did not feel right. Maybe, the show is just starting out, but there is a lack of chemistry between the casts. I could see Ryan, Collin, and Wayne not making jokes as they did in the original show almost as if they felt uncomfortable that the joke might be inappropriate. And there wasn't much of talk going back and forth between the casts and the host, Aisha Tyler. She felt more like an NPC just back there laughing and how the points just do not matter.<br/><br/>In an episode of the original series, there is Drew Carey and Greg Proops where they get into a fight where Drew said ""And you will be dating Greg Proops, I don't know why that would ever happen in real life."", he replies ""Yes Drew, but what's the point?"" and later on he says ""Hey f**k you, Drew."" You could see how comfortable they were and this got dragged out to be much funnier than it had to be because the casts were the ones who made it work. After their hug, Greg says ""I had Drew's ass, and now I want more"" From what I saw, I don't think neither, Ryan, Wayne, Collin or any of the guests will be comfortable enough to say ""F**k you Aisha"" for the sake of a joke. Hell, the special guests just felt like a piece of meat. (This is another problem) Candice Accola didn't do anything for god's sake. She came, danced with Wayne, and then became a prop. If she wasn't going to say a single joke why was she even there? Yes, to advertise another TV show.<br/><br/>The show also feels like a huge advertising scheme. These guests they keep bringing don't contribute anything to the comedy side of the show but to advertise other TV series like the Vampire Diaries, Glee, and Walking Dead. Wayne in one of the episodes said: ""I will be watching Vampire Diaries every day from now on."" Really?<br/><br/>Just please don't ruin my favorite show.<br/><br/>Edit: Watched a couple of more new episodes that aired today, where Kyle Richards and US swimming (Mary &amp; Mariya) were their star guests. The cast seemed much more comfortable with each other (kudos there), but Kyle Richards was pure cringe. It is too early for any videos to pop up, but later on, search for ""Kyle Richards helping hand"" and watch her stand still for three full minutes. Just get rid of this feature where you force new guests every episode, and I think we got our good quality show back.",14 out of 21 found this helpful.,5.0,24 July 2013
2314,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Whose Line: Resurrection,"Everyone who has ever seen a rerun of Whose Line has fond memories of the show. Oddly, I think it was more popular *after* it ended, once they started showing reruns all the time. That was when I got into it, and boy did it get me. More than any other program I've ever watched, Whose Line put me on the floor in fits of laughter. Ryan and Colin are two highly underrated geniuses of comedy, Wayne adds style and energy (not to mention hilarious musical comedy) where Ryan and Colin cannot, and who isn't a fan of the wonderful Laura Hall and her improvisational music? Drew Carey's biggest contribution was making the show happen, and trying to keep it going with Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza. He knew how many people loved Whose Line, and he did everything in his power to give it to us. So how well does this new show stack up against one of the funniest TV programs in American history?<br/><br/>The new show is everything we ever asked for. It's unbelievable to think that the original Whose Line started 15 years ago; aside from Colin's white hair(?), it feels just like the old show. The main difference is a new (nicer) stage, some new games like the Sideways Floor Scene, and a new host, Miss Aisha West. But the comedy is every bit as gut-busting as it was in its glory days. I made the mistake of trying to eat while watching the first two episodes. I came very close to having chicken breast come out my nose. Ryan and Colin are still in top form, Wayne hasn't lost a step, and with the cult status of Whose Line, they're getting some interesting guest stars.<br/><br/>Fans of Whose Line, our prayers have been answered.",16 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,24 July 2013
2315,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, This is what you wanted. Me too.,"This is exactly what lovers of the original Drew-hosted Whose Line want: More Whose Line.<br/><br/>There's not a whole lot to say other than address the main negative comment from viewers:<br/><br/>""No Drew Carrey, and not-so-funny-host now."" Well... boo hoo. I did notice that Aisha Tyler hasn't made me laugh as much as Drew might have, but that was because she isn't telling enough Points-Don't-Matter jokes, and jokes in general. She seems to be more or less the announcer no one truly looks forward to. But she's okay, honestly. I've never known her until Whose Line, and she's a fun person who reacts to the guys in ways that make you wanna laugh too. Drew Carrey was pretty much there for the same thing, and fat jokes. And he's no longer fat. (in short, he wasn't a particularly funny guy either, at least alone) I like Aisha. She might need to tell more jokes though, and they don't have to be original.<br/><br/>More positive criticism: I enjoy how they leave one seat open for a guest player to participate in. Having one seat open--while Colin, Ryan, and Wayne are planted on the show--allows for many different folks from various areas in the world of comedy to sit in. Back in the day, Steven Colbert was on the show, and it was awesome. Perhaps he can reunite and be in the second chair again.<br/><br/>Another note which is up for debate is about how Whose Line is now on the CW.22, and a lot of guest stars are stars from CW shows. Whose Line is becoming promotional for the Dramas comedy lovers wouldn't normally care about. I only watch CW for Whose Line. But if someone might be interested in something different while watching it, they also might love the show that Whose Line promoted, so... it's debatable. <br/><br/>Lastly, Whose Line is genuinely funny, not 'again' but 'still.' Wayne, Colin, and Ryan are all themselves still, and the show so far has made me laugh as much as the original, at a similar show intake of course. I don't expect EVERYTHING to be the same, and to those that think the show isn't the same any more...<br/><br/>Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Brady. Laura Hall, Linda Taylor. ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" ""The points don't matter,"" along with a bundle of the classic games that were played...<br/><br/>So shut up. <br/><br/>I'm excited to sit down every Tuesday for this show.

2317,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Has Potential - Let's see if they make the right calls,"I don't want to make a final judgment on the revival yet. Don't get me wrong...I love it so far, but it could do better (if you've ever seen the original series, you'll know what I'm talking about). Here's a short list of what I think they'll need if they want to bring back the magic of the original: <br/><br/>1. Aisha needs to become more comfortable with the cast and tell more jokes. I know she's new so I'll cut her a break for now, but hopefully by the end of this season all the awkwardness will be gone. For me, the biggest things are her jokes. They seem flat and safe and definitely unlike Drew's from the old show (granted, he was pretty awkward in his first season too). Haven't heard a ""...and the points don't matter. That's right, they're like (something that doesn't matter)."" Her unscripted parts (reactions, mostly) seem to be very tame too...nothing more than playful nudges (we need full-on attacks like Carey gave us in the first series). I am a hugggge Archer fan so I know Aisha is capable of being funny.<br/><br/>2. Change the ending format. I know in the first few seasons (maybe just the first) of the original series they did what this series is doing now...the ""winner"" reads the credits. This needs to stop and they need to get the ""final game with the host"" going again. This will make Aisha more comfortable with the cast and give us more jokes. Also, what's up with the no ""Irish Drinking Song""s? That, World's Worst and Props are always the best three to finish a show off with.<br/><br/>3. Stop with the lame guests and bring back Proops. Firstly, the guests are awkward and are nothing more than eye candy. OK, the Glee kid was fun, but that was the exception, not the rule. Most of them stand around, confused and shy and it just pains me to watch it. If you bring in a guest, make sure they're down like a clown Charlie Brown. Also, Greg Proops was always the funniest fourth in the original series and it will greatly sadden me if they don't use him at all in this one.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,30 July 2013
2318,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Aisha Tyler is ruining the show.,"I tried to give the reboot a chance, I really did. But I'm sorry, I cannot watch this show with Aisha Tyler as the host. It is NOT the same show. The show does not flow smoothly whatsoever and the flow is controlled by the host. We all loved to joke about how Drew did nothing on the old version of WLIIA, but that's what he did. He did nothing. He didn't get in the way, he pressed the buzzer at the right time on scenes, and joked about how useless he was. So he didn't do nothing, but he acted in such a way that made you not even notice him, but was always excellent when he was needed. That's a good host.<br/><br/>Aisha gets in the way. She presses the buzzer way too late and lets scenes drag on almost every time to the point where the scene goes from hilarious to funny to just awkward, which is a big deal. It's like if every scene in game of thrones was 20 seconds longer and the actors had to fill up time talking about the weather that day in Westeros. Ruins the entire atmosphere, takes me out of the scene.<br/><br/>The way she speaks sounds like fake enthusiasm and makes me feel like she doesn't want to be there. She also doesn't have ANY real chemistry with anyone on the show and really makes it feel like the atmosphere is tense all the time.<br/><br/>WLIIA is the type of show that absolutely requires a laid-back feeling, and Aisha robs that of the show. They need to replace her. Don't care if it would be awkward, out of place, or whatever, PLEASE get a host that the crew can make fun of and vice versa without all of this awkward tension.<br/><br/>I say all of this as a WLIIA fan and someone who really likes Aisha Tyler.

2319,Whose Line Is It Anyway?," Dull guest-list, bad changes and a horrible host.","First off, Aisha is treating this gig as a talk-show (which is just ridiculously annoying to watch.), she produces a fake, exaggerated laugh to blend in, but that doesn't hide the fact that she doesn't belong in that scenery in any way I The content-variety of the games is fantastically non existent and full of cheap, ""modern"", often totally brainless humor. The guests are only there to gain a fan-base in the newer generation and aren't close to adding value to the show, apart from, of course, cheap smiles and status. If you add the talk-show diva re-introducing the whole show every 5 minutes to that notion, you end up with an agonizingly annoying pile of crap, which is only saved by the central members of the old show.

2320,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Not nearly as Good as Original,"First off, the new host (Aisha Tyler) isn't funny, especially after what Drew Carey gave to this show. She does not come close at all to Drew. This is the main reason this show is just okay. The chemistry that they had with Drew, the jokes they made towards Drew And visa-versa will never be the same, and that was one of the funniest parts about the original US version. When Drew carey starts the show by saying ""The points don't matter, just like (blank)"" it starts the show off on a great, funny note. There is definitely a huge gaping hole of unfunny and boringness in this show because of her, and they could have gotten a much better host!<br/><br/>Ryan, Colin and Wayne are still very funny, and are the only reason this show is worth watching! They aren't as quick as they used to be, but they are still Laugh out Loud funny! <br/><br/>The ""guests"" they have on are very gimmicky not that funny, just sort of awkward to watch. It adds nothing, it just wastes time.

2321,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Decent Follow Up to the Drew Carey Series,"The new series of Whose Line Is It Anyway? is a worthy successor to the 90s Drew Carey series, although it is not as good as its predecessor. It benefits from the presence of several veterans from the previous series, as well as a new, raunchier attitude.<br/><br/>Much of the gang from the 90s series returns, including Wayne Brady, Ryan Styles, and Colin Mochrie. They obviously have a lot of experience with the format and have not lost any of their skill at improv. Furthermore, the show benefits from an edgier attitude, with much cruder jokes than the 90s series. The comedians take full advantage of the fact that, as Drew Carey would put it, they are no longer on a network owned by Disney.<br/><br/>The show does have some issues, though. Aisha Tyler will not make anyone forget Drew Carey and does not seem inclined to get involved with the comic festivities. The constant posting of hashtags on the screen seems like a blatant attempt to promote the show, and only proves distracting. Finally, the show tends to center its skits on celebrity guest stars, using themes from whatever show they're known for.

Will we get a repeat of Captain Hair, ""The Cat"", or any of the other classic bits from the Drew Carey hosted show? Probably not .. give them a chance, though, and perhaps they'll create some new memories :)<br/><br/>They also have brought some new talent into the fold, which is nice - I could do without the comedic challenged ""guest stars"" from the CW shows that they bring in from time to time.

2324,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Still as good as ever!,"The new version of whose line lives up to the original, even if it doesn't quite surpass it. I like Aisha Tyler as the host. She's much funnier than Drew was in my opinion. Drew never really seemed confident in some of his delivery but she's always confident. Don't get me wrong though, Drew was always fun.
The comedy is not quite as timeless as the original but it is still quite hysterical. It's more raunchy then the first series but I've never minded that. The presence of some of the older cast like Colin, Wayne, Greg and Ryan is fantastic. They have not skipped a beat. I also love some of the new talent. Keegan Michael Key, Johnathan Mangum and Gary Anthony Williams are so wonderfully funny and have proved that they belong on this show. The guest stars can be a bit hit and miss but every now and then you get a guest who gets the premise and does very well with it. Some new games are nice but it's at its best when they play older games like hoedown, scenes from a hat and props. No subject is off limits and I think that helps keep the show fresh. Again, it's not as great as the original, but dang it, it comes close.

I am not against political satire. I didn't understand what Eric Trump had to do with the bit this evening. It didn't make since to me.
It seems that every episode this season the comedians have taken a swipe at our President.
If it was done in the fashion of the old SNL of Ford tripping, President Bush throwing up an having a shoe thrown at him, that's comedy. Even ""Tricky Dicky"".
I don't understand the venomous attacks. There needs to be a modicum of truth for it to be humorous.

""Batwave"" is true to 21st century technology and will surely spawn fond memories in the kids getting their first taste of the Bat :) I also liked the new penguin. The added depth of the family history in my opinion give this Character more realism than I've seen in previous incarnations. That whole angry heir to the fallen fortune thing right down to the jealousy with Bruce Wayne for still possessing his family fortune and having a Pennyworth for a butler in my book counts for some very talented thought behind the storyline.<br/><br/>I must admit I stopped here and took the time to register just to write this because I was sadly disappointed after having watched this series for four seasons now to see it ripped to shreds by 20 somethings who are mad that this isn't ""their"" batman that they grew up with on Saturday morning back in the 90's.<br/><br/>This is Batman, 21st century style.. High tech gadgets.. Personal on-board computers in hand, Master criminals that are not only intelligent but can hold their own in a fight and are very well matched to this incarnation of the wealthy orphan raised by the butler that has more than his own fair share of personal issues after having lost his parents to street thugs as a small child..<br/><br/>This series really seems to bring that fact home very well but you'll need to watch it for awhile before you see the lengths to which the writers have gone in the development of the title Character.<br/><br/>You will not get that depth if you just watch a couple of episodes.<br/><br/>Granted, as one previous reviewer had mentioned I was getting a bit weary of Joker in every episode there for awhile but the writers grew out of it and have started a storyline for the kids of the 21st century that they can grow up with and be inspired by.<br/><br/>Some of them may actually get the message that I did from Batman.<br/><br/>That with self discipline, education, physical training and a little ingenuity even an ordinary human can be a superhero.<br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly so that if one choses the life of a vigilante there is a mighty fine line between hero and villain.<br/><br/>Of course the money doesn't hurt :) I really liked the way Batgirl was introduced in this series with a home made costume and home made Bat gear until she earned the respect of the big guy enough for her to be brought in as a true team member.

2335,The Batman, Another great animated Batman,"Batman is Batman - let's get that straight. Now for details - The Batman cartoon is a brand new animated incarnation of The Caped Crusader. The biggest difference between this take and Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s is that this show relishes being a cartoon, and relies on action, while the previous Batman cartoons were heavy on story content, and wanted to be taken more seriously than the average cartoon.<br/><br/>People have a right to make comparisons, but this cartoon is great in its own right. Batman/Bruce Wayne is in his late twenties, and some of his foes are younger too. Wayne Manor looks like its in Gotham City and not on the outskirts. There's no Commissioner Gordon, but there is Chief Rojas. But all of the things that define Batman are present: the costume, the Batmobile, the Batcave, etc. This time around, Batman has his own operating system - The Batwave, that powers his headquarters and vehicles. <br/><br/>Rather than downing this version of Batman because its doesn't appeal to a mature crowd, take the time to see it for yourself. You might enjoy the show.",22 out of 28 found this helpful.,,28 September 2004
2336,The Batman," Not as good as BTAS, but its original.","I've heard all kinds of insults thrown at The Batman, and its just getting tiresome. It can't be the original series because its been done and as much as I love BTAS, its time to try something new.<br/><br/>This is not the Batman of the 90's, 60's 40's whatever. What we have here is an up to date Batman in the 21'st century. New gadgets, new suit, new Batman. Bruce Wayne, he's doing what he's supposed to being, being a playboy bachelor and acting as if he hasn't got a care in the world, while as Batman he's not at his darkest yet but he's getting there. He's still the serious Batman, just hasn't been pushed to his limits yet, give it time.<br/><br/>Alfred has more to do in this series this time around, appearing more in the episodes, getting involved with some of the villains and even getting some time in sub plots. He also has changed since first season. He no longer burdens Bruce about his alternate life but rather encourages it.<br/><br/>Batgirl, though not my favorite character has an interesting introduction to the story and tends to add some simple comic relief to the story here and there but shows she's a good partner. <br/><br/>Then we have his Rouge Gallery of villains. All right, some like 'em, some don't and I won't argue with your opinions. Though as I said, this is not BTAS. To recreate a famous story, you gotta makes some changes in both the plot and characters, change outfits and looks, give them new motives, keep it original. Joker, I do miss his suit and his entire figure, but that look has been around for over 60 years. When you think of Joker you think ""insane"", right? Well you can't get anymore insane then that and the motive is still the same, he's always a thorn in Batman's side. Or is that the other way around...?. Mr. Freeze has become more hi-tech and has gone back to his earlier roots as a average thief turned into a creature with a temp. below zero (with a small hint of his former wife). Bane, with his venom is a thug for hire and more dangerous than before with his gain in hight and his intelligence. Catwomen more or less is still like her BTAS self, now sporting an outfit inspired by her 80's look. A personal favorite is Ethan Bennett, the new Clayface. ******SPOILER****** Sporting a smaller body and new attacks, he wanted to get back at Joker who was the cause of his mutation but wanted his former boss dead for his harshness and his ""Zero Tolerance for Freaks"" rule. ******SPOILER****** There's many others I could go on about, Clue Master (One shot deal, not a great bad guy), Ragdoll (haven't seen that episode yet), Poison Ivy (Cool design, and her tie in with Batgirl's interesting), and the Riddler (don't mind the design to much, though great writing and voice actor) among others but you get where I'm going with this I hope...<br/><br/>This is not trying to be BTAS, this is trying to be its own show, such as The Teen Titan's. And an anime rip off? Yeah, its inspired by the style but tell me exactly what style its ripping off. Not one I can think of I'm afraid, besides they could have had a much worse style. And the childish writing? I've seen worse, and even BTAS had a some child friendly writing (""I've Got Batman In My Basment"" and as much as I like Riddler and the episode to introduce him, ""If You're So Smart, Why Arn't You Rich?""), but lets not forget the darker and more mature story's (""Feet Of Clay/2"", ""Clock King"", ""The Man Who Killed Batman"", ""Two-face/2"", ""Perchance To Dream"", tell me when to stop). They both have some childish writing, but have some darkness throughout.<br/><br/>I don't care if its not like the comics, not like BTAS, not like the movies, was it ever trying to be? Its not the greatest thing ever, but its at least worth a look at. And even if you do despise the series, at the most give Batman vs. Dracula a chance and see how dark it can be.

2337,The Batman, A masterpiece of a new era of batman,"Dear fellow commentators(especially the bad ones) I think that you should be ashamed of yourselves how you commented on The Batman. Really, can't you people not understand the meaning of hard work to make The Batman great in its new fashion. This Batman shows a lot about Bruce's life as a young civilian. I'm not saying the older Batman series were uncool but this one is better to some and equal to other people. Why do people of the new generation behave this way. Batman has been a great legendary hero for years. Now that it has been brought to life after these long years why do people complain. How would you feel to be born since the 1930s and never get to see much of these series. The Batman series is an excellent way to display Bruce Wayne/Batman in his younger age. It also focuses on the other characters equally. This series even show where and how he got his technologies. I mean did the other Batmen before showed this quality. I've always wanted to know how Batman met Batgirl and the great attribute about this show is that the cops actually pay attention to Batman as a vigilante. The art and color are quite interesting and the music is spine chilling. The action, now This I like. I love the new Bat weapon the BatBot. This weapon's really cool. The villains are awesome especially Bane, The Joker( His jokes are funny and at least this time he puts up a fight),The Riddler and ManBat and Penguin. Now for Batwoman. Her costume looks really stupid but when you think about it she's a young kid. I mean really do you think someone who lives in an ordinary home design something like this costume. This show also portrays a lot about Bruce's past and present life. Also Alfred is now payed more attention to for once or maybe,actually twice but still. My last words are that this show is great and people should pay more attention but then again the show was made for children. 10 out of 10.

2338,The Batman, a new action style,"Batman has a more slick animation in this series that focuses more on style and snazzy moves and action rather than heavy storyline. The Clayface storyline is one villain that is more in depth as far as plot and is well done taking a few twists and turns. Most of the villains he comes across know some martial arts which make for more formidable opponents. It is a change from Batman TAS and manages to have faster paced action and a few reinterpreted villains yet still maintains Batman's struggle to fight crime yet maintain his sanity. As one that loves Batman TAS, i still find The Batman lots of fun as it focuses on the action and gadgets a lot more and i find it quit amusing to even see penguin have a few martial art tricks up his sleeve (he does have an explanation) and i like his cronies. The series later turned a more camp style with an intro that sounded like the 60s Batman TV show which i wasn't too hip on yet the series still had some excellent episodes. I say quit fighting about which animated series is better and just enjoy both for what they give.",14 out of 21 found this helpful.,8.0,11 November 2008
2339,The Batman, A Knight's Beginning,"Other than the strange character designs, I don't see why so many people are bad-mouthing this show.<br/><br/>This is the lay down: Millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (good voice work from Rino Romano) witnessed his parent's brutal murder by an unknown gunman, and vows revenge against crime by donning the scary image of a bat. This series depicts Bruce in his third year as The Batman. The police still do not recognize him as a hero, but a criminal vigilante and are trying to capture him and find out who he is.<br/><br/>The famous James Gordon has yet to appear in the picture, so the GCPD is headed by a non-nonsense police chief named Angel Rojas (played by Edward James Olmos), whose top priority is to capture Bats. Batman is also pursued by police detectives Ethan Bennet (Steve Harris) and Ellen Yin (Ming-Na). Bennet thinks Batman is a hero, but Yin thinks otherwise.<br/><br/>Since this is Batman's ""early years"" as The Dark Knight Detective, the ""costumed freaks are just now showing up. Our caped hero finds himself clashing with the likes of The Joker (brilliant voice talent from Kevin Michael Richardson), Mr. Freeze (a cold-hearted Clancy Brown), The Penguin (Tom Kenny), and Catwoman (Gina Gershon) and other familiar bad guys for the first times in his career. <br/><br/>The journey goes on as Batman struggles to elude police capture and save the city from evil rouge villains. <br/><br/>""Bring On The Batman!""",22 out of 36 found this helpful.,7.0,26 February 2005
2340,The Batman," Say what you want about ""The Batman"", it is NOT Joel Schumacher all over again","I heard a lot of you out there are hearing terrible reviews of ""The Batman"". Some of the critics here call it ""Schumacher all over again. If ""The Batman"" were Joel Schumacher all over again, this kind of stuff would be in it... 1. Nipples and arses would be on Batman's, Batgirl's and Robin's suits. 2. Mr. Freeze would be yelling out ice puns ALL THE TIME. He did a few lame one-liners in Season One, but don't let that stop you from at least renting it. 3. Robin would be super-whiny, asking for a Robin-signal in the sky, or reversing Batman &amp; Robin to Robin &amp; Batman, etc. 4. Batgirl would have been Alfred's niece. 5. Commssioner Gordon would have been a wimp. 6. Poison Ivy would do stupid things like spout one-liners while flirting with Batman. 7. Rino Romano would have played Batman gay. 8. Ther would have been giant statues of naked men ALL OVER THE PLACE! 9. Mr. Freeze would have hid in a neon-lit ice-cream factory, conducting his henchmen to sing ""I'm Mr. White Christmas, I'm Mr. Snow."" 10. Batman &amp; Batgirl would have used some pieces of shrapnel from Maximillian Zeus's ship they cut an acetylene torch with to make flying surfboards.<br/><br/>Fortunately, none of that crap happens. Let's see what we've got. 1. The batsuit is just fine, your cape-and-cowl with the tights, utility belt, and boots batsuit. Only different thing is the emblem, which in my opinion, looks pretty dang cool. Batgirl's suit resembles the 60's Batman show a little bit, save the yellow cape. It's actually cool how she used her athletic wetsuit as her batsuit. Robin's suit totally resembles B:TAS, give 'em points for the lack of short shorts. 2. Mr. Freeze seldom uses one-liners after his debut in Season One. 3. I don't really care for Robin's actor for most of Season Four, but he gets better from the Season Four finale to the very end. 4. Batgirl is the Barbara Gordon we know, and her actress is good. 5. Commissioner Gordon kicked butt in a few occasions, but he's still not a wimp. 6. Poison Ivy's about 16 in the series. Batman's overaged for her, Robin's underaged. 7. Rino Romano does not play Batman gay. He's actually a very good voice actor, and is the highlight when it comes to voice acting in this show. 8. There aren't. Thank God. 9. He doesn't hide in a freezer factory, for cryin' out loud! 10. No, they don't ever do any type of crap like that in any season.<br/><br/>On a few more notes, Kevin Michael Richardson is no Mark Hamill, but he's in-character as the Joker. Any out of character Joker is a sane Joker. Alastair Duncan is a good Alfred. Also, why so many complaints about the new designs of the villains? Isn't that what you Obama fans want now? Change? Well there's some change for you! Mr. Freeze can shoot ice from his hands. The Penguin has an awesome laugh. The Joker lacks shoes. These are changes. They wanted to be a little different. Some are good, some are lame. The Batwave isn't dumb, it makes sense! It's a computer connected to everything in Batman's equipment that was electronics or computers. If you like action scenes, get this series. They are really cool and actually put B:TAS to shame in the categories of action scenes, animation, and fighting. And I have watched B:TAS. It's really good, as long as the dozen of stupid episodes like ""I've Got Batman in My Basement"" don't count. *SPOILER ALERT* All seasons have episodes worth getting for. You wanna see a whole Bane-centric episode where he has more than 3 minutes of screen time? Get Season One. You wanna see Batman take on the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler at the same time almost without getting hurt? Get Season Two. You wanna see Batman take on a cyborg 10x as powerful in strength, speed, agility, and mind? Get Season Three. You wanna see Batman take on a vigilante that captured all the villains, then take on all the ticked off villains next? Or Batman teaming up with Martian Manhunter to stop a global alien invasion? Get Season Four. You wanna see Superman, the Flash, Hal Joran, Green Arrow, and Hawkman in action? Get Season Five.<br/><br/>This was a fun series to watch. Every time I turned it on, I enjoyed it. Can't we just sit down, kick back, relax, and enjoy this show while drinking a soda? Why can't we just quit bashing it, get into a restful state, and watch ""The Batman""? Because most of the people here are like bitter old farts who scream at youths on how they did it their day on the front porch. They want B:TAS back. I liked B:TAS once I started ordering DVDs with better episodes. But, as I have an opinion, I like ""The Batman"" better in a few ways.",24 out of 40 found this helpful.,10.0,22 October 2008
2341,The Batman, Just doesn't measure up.,"In 92 WB produced Batman the animated series. In terms of style, content and storyline it was revolutionary as far as (american) cartoons were concerned. Kevin Conroy WAS and IS the voice of Batman. It was deep, commanding and capable of great range and he has continued being the voice of Batman through all the animated incarnations of the character until this one; from the sub-par Batman Beyond (I still count Bruce as Batman even in that series) to the superb Justice League. Indeed, so strong was the style of TAS that it dictated the tone of all DCs animated heroes, again, up until this show.<br/><br/>The problem with this show from the start is their decision not to use Conroy as Batman. It speaks volumes that they did not. It says, ""we don't want this to be just like the other Batman cartoons"". And it isn't, that's the problem.<br/><br/>While I don't deny people the chance to reinvent or reimagine, there is a simple truth to storytelling which is this: the further away you stray from the core concepts of the original story and character, the less attractive and watchable that character is and the poorer the result. This show proves that.<br/><br/>A younger Batman fighting crime and meeting his signature enemies is fine, but its been done and with considerably more style. The artwork is bizarre, not necessarily a problem in and of itself, but this Batman doesn't carry the gravity he requires- he's a guy who actively tries to terrorise criminals and you don't do that with neon-glowing gadgets as the dire Schumacher Batman movies proved eloquently.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have is the characterisation, and that grates on me severely. The actual scripts are terrible, with cheesy, unfunny quips being made at every turn. Every character except Batman, Alfred and (possibly) Catwoman has been taken away from their roots, mostly so they can add some pointless fight sequences. The Joker is the biggest example, and he's been singled out many times for just this reason. The Joker is not good in a fight. He relies on henchmen and insanely well-prepared plans to achieve his ends, he does not leap around like something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The Penguin, while he sometimes fences with umbrellas is also not a hand to hand combatant. He relies on henchmen and his wits to try to stay ahead.<br/><br/>All in all, this reminds me less of Jackie Chan as others have mentioned, mostly because that looked so awful I avoided it, but of another terrible show, the new He-Man cartoon *shudder* Lots of gimmicky cuts to other scenes, a lot of empty space and bright colours and all the characters seems to spend half their time in mid-air with speed lines zooming past them. And the same three bad guys behind every single event.<br/><br/>I agree totally with others who have marked this as disappointing. It is the weakest thing to come out of the Batman franchise since the execrable Batman &amp; Robin, and while not quite on that level of crappiness, it does count against the good work that was done in Batman Begins, a film I would expect this to try and stay as close to as possible given the proximity of their release and the inherent similarity in concept.",59 out of 110 found this helpful.,,4 October 2005
2342,The Batman, Disappointing,"Argh, It's like so many people had done so much work for nothing.<br/><br/>Since the ""Batman"" TV show in the 60's, there has been an ongoing effort with comic book artists and even a couple of filmmakers to return the Dark Knight to his roots, rather than the ""Pow!, Bam!"" stereotype Howie Horwitz gave him and pretty much all comics. In such efforts, these people had brought up some of the finest pieces in fiction, the extraordinary stories by Dennis O Neal and Neal Adams, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" by Frank Miller, the first two Batman films by Tim Burton, and of course the fantastic ""Batman: the Animated Series"".<br/><br/>So now I look at the new ""The Batman"" on WB, with Adam West and Frank Gorshin as regular voices, all of the old voices and character designs thrown out in favor of the stylization from ""The Jackie Chan Adventures"" and ostentatious gadgets and vehicles that scream ""Toys Toys Toys"".<br/><br/>The methodical pace of ""TAS""(The Animated Series) has been replaced by a rapid-fire quick change motif, suiting ever increasing attention spans, I'm sure. While in TAS, physical action might sometimes take a back seat to the stories,""The Batman"" overflows with Kung Fu, Slow Motion, and Dramatic rapid-Fire Jump Cuts. <br/><br/>The Characters have been ""Updated', Batman is no longer square jawed, but has a triangle for a head, Comissioner Gordon is gone. The Batcave has gone back in time about 35 years and is complete with Batpoles and the Apple-red support beams that were prevalent in the old Adam West TV show. The Joker now sports a colorful straight jacket and hair the size of Beachball rather than his stylish purple suit of years past.<br/><br/>While the 'Extreme' approach may appease those with no exposure to engaging storytelling, I prefer TAS, which had strong, character driven stories, a cinematic style complete with orchestrated music, references to the best of all the batman representations, not just Adam West, and most importantly, looked like an actual movie, not a toy commercial.<br/><br/>'The Batman' has flashy animation, color keys that don't variate, CGI, and a ton of flashy camera techniques. But I say that it's all frosting and no cake.",81 out of 156 found this helpful.,,17 September 2004
2343,The Batman," ""And where...is The Batman? He's sitting at home, washing his tights!""","Ever since the 1992 animated series of Batman, I've watched every single appearance he's made on the TV since then. From the Animated Series to The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin, to The New Batman Adventures, and yes even Batman Beyond and the two incarnations of Justice League. I can safely say that The Batman is nowhere near the level any of those shows.<br/><br/>The problem is, even judged on its own merits, The Batman falls incredibly short. But I tried to put all that aside and remain objective about the show. I mean, it's Batman right? Nope, it's not Batman. Rather than follow in the footsteps of its predecessors, The Batman ignores all the Batman cartoons that came before it, which is well over a decade's worth of animation.<br/><br/>The series starts off with the third anniversary of Batman's birth and we are introduced to a much younger Bruce Wayne, this also marks the first confrontation between the Joker and Batman. Unfortunately, everything that should've made this a memorable first encounter is lost in favor of silly action sequences, lame dialogue, and one of the worst artistic revisions of a villain I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Another problem is that's pretty much the summary for most of the episodes, even though the series is around its third season. While the episodes have improved slightly, it's a very small evolution and a good 90% of the episodes boil down to Batman versus the villain of the day.<br/><br/>The sad part is the show actually has a bit of promise, such as a decent revisioning of the Clayface character. But otherwise, every other part of the show is weak. I'll start with the character designs. Now we can all say we'd like some new and improved designs for the characters, something we haven't seen before...but there are some things that are just sacred, for instance, the Joker.<br/><br/>There are so many ways I can describe how awful the design is, but I think I'll go with this: he looks like a rejected Street Fighter 2 design for Blanka. The first time you see the Joker your eyes will immediately hurt. Not only that, his puns are horrible, for some reason he knows kung fu (along with every other villain, even the Penguin), and his plans are pointless and silly along with a voice that doesn't fit at all.<br/><br/>The rest of the designs are just as awful including a bizarre-looking Bane and a Marilyn Manson style Riddler. Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that one out too. And Batman resembles some weird looking bird more than a bat as well as having an unsuitable voice. The characterizations are off as well, showing both Bruce Wayne and alter ego Batman as boring individuals.<br/><br/>The animation just doesn't suit the show and never gives off any kind of a dark atmosphere. And the funny thing is, there are twice as many fight scenes in The Batman versus all the other animated Batman shows, but they come off as pointless, hollow, and inexplicably boring.<br/><br/>Batman relies much less on his detective skills and more on stupid gadgets that only serve a purpose for only one or two episodes.<br/><br/>Batman: The Animated Series was the highest point of Batman's animated career, and while it's arguable which of the spin-offs will be ranked below it, I think we can all agree that The Batman will be at the very bottom. A low point for the Dark Knight that years from now when the series is over will be spoken only in hushed whispers.<br/><br/>""Oh, THAT Batman cartoon"" they will say with a disgusted tone.<br/><br/>From the animation, to the characterization, to the story lines, and even the action--The Batman fails in every regard. The series stands as a testament to the creative genius and hard work, along with superb voice acting by the likes of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, that went into the creation of Batman: The Animated Series and its subsequent follow-ups. The Batman merely serves as a brief footnote in the bat's history that dishonors all those that have come before it.",54 out of 101 found this helpful.,,16 March 2006

2345,The Batman," Started OK, got better, got worse, and then got pretty good...","It's been an interesting run for this series.<br/><br/>In the 1st season, there were maybe 3 or 4 really good episodes, a few that were OK, and a few that were just terrible. The second season did a little better about not being bad. Then, in the 3rd season, they introduced Batgirl. Incidentally, the show started to get really bad. Save for the ""Criminal Mastermind"" episode, the season was filled with disappointment.<br/><br/>Then, at the beginning of the 4th season, they introduced Robin. My initial reaction was ""considering how bad the show got when they brought in Batgirl, the introduction of Robin couldn't be good. But it was. The show started to pick up, and has become much more promising and watchable.<br/><br/>What I said about the show when it started, and I maintain I was right, was that the show needed a while to really settle into it's stride. If you watch the beginning episodes for ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" Batman and Joker start out with a slightly more playful relationship, and Batman isn't nearly as dark. This show did take a while, but it seems to have gotten to a point where they can entertain people who are old enough to remember the first show.<br/><br/>The show is really intentionally different from any other incarnations of the characters, as obviously evidenced by the Joker redesign. I thought that making the Joker the version they did was such a bold statement, and the character still works.<br/><br/>The show is so different, that a lot of die-hard fans will be disappointed. But the show has gotten better, and is less of a guilty pleasure for me to watch now.<br/><br/>7 out of 10. Shaky start, but on more solid ground.<br/><br/>P.S.

2346,The Batman," ""It's not Batman the Animated Series""","I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything. Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond good? ""Yeah, but it was no TAS."" Is Justice League good? ""It's not too bad, but it's no TAS.""<br/><br/>The Batman is certainly no TAS, either, but I won't hold that against it. It would be unfair and besides, it has plenty of other problems with it.<br/><br/>The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one, and at times the art is very nice. But all of the rest of the time, the art is worthless Americanime, and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. It is paced, written, and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits, unpredictability, and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain, there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely. And it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing, don't get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade, but the point stands. What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large, smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn.<br/><br/>It's obvious this show can't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me. The plots aren't good and they don't develop any better. They've been written for the demographic of children under twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This shouldn't be an adult show with swearing, nudity, and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages. This show misses that mark.<br/><br/>Is this show a TAS? No, of course not. The problem is it's not even a JLU.",44 out of 88 found this helpful.,3.0,3 April 2005
2347,The Batman, It's Batman from another perspective.,"One of the biggest disappointments to people is this show's animation and the radical looks of some villains (mostly Joker).<br/><br/>The animation was done very slick in a Japanese anime style to catch new audiences that are used to it these days. Let's be honest and remember that old DCAU shows changed their animation from ""The New Adventures of Batman"" to ""Justice League"" for the same reason.<br/><br/>The reason for more action is because of that stupid 65 episode rule. This gives limited time for story which I find disappointing, you can tell they were going for a story that would lead to a Dark Knight Returns kind of arc. The show seems campy at times(because of those damn rules child broadcasting has), but has more dark moments like it should. You can easily tell from the first two episodes that they had planned for a mob story-arc similar to Batman:Year One. Each season pretty much starts with a story that grows to a nice climax at the end(the same technique is done in Marvel's new series ""The Spectacular Spiderman""). If you continue to watch the show, you can see how his detective skills grow over time. Remember we're watching a young Bruce growing into the Dark Knight the city needs him to be.<br/><br/>In BTAS he's been at it as Batman for a couple of years already, he's known as a detective, and is accepted by the police. This show has him on the vigilante side and Gordon doesn't come in until later. I love how we get to see more of Bruce having a social life and protecting his alter-ego, where in BTAS how do you not know he's Batman!? Kevin Conroy's awesome but his voice doesn't seem to change in and out of the cowl. The creators of the show took their own liberties to pay respect to BTAS and the shadow it will forever cast. The use of villains is good too, I like how they use the lesser known ones.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning in the fight and chase scenes(you can tell they were pulled right out of Batman comics), sound quality is top of the line for an animated show too. You have a sense of life from Gotham too. Where in previous DCAU shows there would be so many fights in the city you'd ask yourself ""where are the people?"". I personally think Clayface was done well, but nothing beats how Dr. Hugo Strange is portrayed. I personally think this incarnation of him is used best (even better than BTAS portrayal). The fact that the villains can stand a fighting chance to Batman was always cool to me, I like how each one has their own fighting style. As a Bat-fan I disliked how the villains would do nothing but plot and you knew in the back of your head that in the end of the episode all it's gonna take is one punch from Batman to end it. Joker is always a subject of debate among people who see this show. To me not liking this Joker is like hating Heath Ledger's portrayal(his Joker was so radical that his skin wasn't even bleached), they both do a great job nonetheless. Personally I think Mark Hamill forever nailed the role.<br/><br/>Everything else was because of legal issues really. Robin appearing after Batgirl(because of Teen Titans ending), Batman not having a square chin and Kevin Conroy not doing the voice(because Justice League was still on at the time, Rino Ramano did a good job as a young Batman though), Scarecrow, Two-Face, and Ra's Al Ghul not appearing(because of them being in the new movies).<br/><br/>In a time where good cartoons are hard to find these days the creators of this show worked with what they had and did a great job at it.",12 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,11 November 2009

2349,The Batman, I liked the series.,"I'm 23 and I grew up on Batman: TAS, but I have to say: I really like The Batman. I was sad when I heard Season 5 was its last. First off, I think each series of Batman should be judged without thought of its predecessor. It isn't meant to be a copy of it, but an adaption of the comic.<br/><br/>With that in mind, my only real complaint is The Joker, but after the first couple appearances, I started to like him and saw him as a different character from the one in TAS or even his comic counterpart. I didn't really think of him as The Joker as much and it made it easier to like him, I thought.<br/><br/>The animation isn't great, but it affords a faster paced series with really nice fighting. This and Spectacular Spider-man have some of the best action sequences I've seen in an American cartoon. And I know action isn't everything, but it's pretty important when it comes to superheroes. A nice fight sets off a story quite well, especially in the superhero genre and The Batman does that nicely, so the animation is easy to forgive because it means better fight scenes.<br/><br/>The writing created a freak of the week setting, but it's nothing new in this genre and it handled other villains nicely. Mr. Freeze, while great with the tragic backstory, goes back to his Bob Kane roots in that he's just a criminal who freezes things. It was actually TAS that implemented that idea.<br/><br/>The Riddler wasn't bad. Freddy Kreuger (can't remember the actor's name) did a nice job with him, but I didn't really like the long hair look. This Riddler would be my second favorite version of him. (First being TAS version.) Penguin was his annoying self. Clayface added depth to the show in that he was a bad guy who was conflicted. He's a tragic villain.<br/><br/>I could go on, but my whole point is that the show is a lot better if you aren't always trying to compare it to other Batman versions. I know you are supposed to do that with an adaption, but it is its own show. Please treat it as such.<br/><br/>First season--7/10, Second season 9/10 (watched the episode with the Riddler several times because it's the best episode of the series, in my opinion), Third season --9/10 (I like this version of Batgirl the best, except for Cassandra Cain's in the comic) Fourth--9/10, Fifth 7/10--(Wasn't crazy about JLA added to it.) On last thing: Rino Romano did an excellent job as Batman. His voice isn't deep and dark like Kevin Conroy's, but it did give the youthfulness that the series demanded. I've really only know three actors to pull of Batman AND Bruce Wayne (rather than one or the other) and Romano is one of them. (Conroy and Bale being the other two.) Good series, I'm sad that it ended so soon. I looked forward to it every Saturday Morning and bought the DVDs so I could watch it when I wanted. Well worth the money.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars overall.",11 out of 19 found this helpful.,8.0,10 May 2008
2350,The Batman, Better than expected,"okay, so i haven't watched most of the Batman 1990's series. I've watched the movies, and the original series, the one with all the 'Wham! Bam! Shazam!' stuff. And in all honesty, i think this is the better one of all. Why do i say so ?? Mostly because the characters designs look better here than they ever did in the comics and series. Take the joker for example. In the old series, after a few minutes of analysis (for none batman fans), it was obvious that he was kinda crazy. But in this one, it takes it to another level. His looks, his style of speech, the way he dresses, etc..all make him look even crazier than most of the other series have portrayed him. Same goes for The Riddler. For those of you who don't know, he has a disorder of some sort. Obsessive compulsive disorder i think. And in this series, its shown a bit more than in the others, with his 'goth look', and his more cryptic voice. This version of the Batmobile is even better than most of the others as well. Instead of having that 'tank-like' look that the other versions had, this one has that 'extra high-tech, but still a car' look. Its like its sleek, but still an awesome weapon. <br/><br/>Sure, its a kids show. But don't let that stop you from watching the series. Its very good, the artwork is flawless, the animation is even better. I think you should give it a try before just saying 'Jackie Chan art style ?

2352,The Batman, addendum,"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a ""thumbs in the middle"" review, remarking that I'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.<br/><br/>Everything's wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br/><br/>And for God's sake...is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE?? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? Or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see ""no character development"", above).<br/><br/>And to make matters worse, every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br/><br/>1) Joker gasses people.<br/><br/>2) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br/><br/>3) Batman saves the day.<br/><br/>Pfeh.<br/><br/>There was one episode I saw that wasn't a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the ""Think Thank Thunk"" episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than ""I've Got Batman in My Basement."" <br/><br/>I can't really say what I feel this show is because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with ""B"" and rhymes with ""fastardization"". Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc. era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days.

2354,The Batman, Not BTAS...and that's a good thing,"This version of the Dark Knight is really an animated ""Ultimate Batman"" and should be regarded as such. No one loves the ""Dini/Timmverse"" more than I do, but they're gone now (fie on Warner for 86ing JLU!) and times move on. We should applaud the fact that The Batman's creators have stayed as far away as possible from BTAS in making their show, instead of churning out a cheap copy.<br/><br/>I've never been fond of the ""nitpickers"" of fandom, who harp on little trivia and ignore gross character discontinuities. For those of you who whine about Joker battling Bats on even terms physically, I refer you to his ORIGIN STORY, where he cold-cocks Batman, kicks him in the head, and pitches him into a handy river to drown. The Dark Knight himself comments on the fact that he has finally found someone who ""can give him a fight."" (Batman No. 1/2) The Clown Prince of Crime follows up on this by besting Batman in a sword-fight (Batman No. 2/1) This is just one example of the show's creators going back to basics. As for the designs, some, like the Joker's, can be annoying, other's, like the Riddler's (hey, if Bob Kane can cop Conrad Veidt (g)...) have a certain fun inspiration to them. Alfred is shown to have deductive skills like his comic-book counterpart and the decision to make Batman a true vigilante in the first 2 seasons adds an extra level of challenge to his confrontations with both the bad guys and the law. All in all, it's not a bad effort. If you really want to remind yourself of PUTRED efforts at realizing the mythos, just rent the serials and BATMAN AND ROBIN and really enjoy some ""fine"" entertainment.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,7.0,22 October 2006
2355,The Batman, Great Show!,"I am a huge fan of Batman but, this is the best series I have ever seen! From all the new character designs and voice talents, this show is awesome. I understand a lot of people don't like having people toy around with the characters designs, but come on they still have the same personality. For instance Riddler is by far the best character I have seen, I have been a fan of all versions of the Riddler and I'm not complaining. Robert Englund did a great job on the character and the episodes plots were great as well. From Joker to the rest of the characters they are all great I recommend this show because if you liked BTAS you'll, love this too, if you give it a chance.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,,10 February 2006
2356,The Batman, Liked the 1992 Batman cartoon and Batman Beyond better,"The Batman is okay but I liked the 1992 Batman cartoon and Batman Beyond better. Because this version on the other hand is totally different! Like this series is somewhat like Bruce Wayne in his younger days like in his 20's. Bruce Wayne is younger in this series and is trying to trying to establish himself as Batman, protector of Gotham City. He is in his mid-twenties, just finding his way as protector, defender and Caped Crusader, while balancing his public persona as billionaire bachelor Bruce Wayne. Living in Gotham, a metropolis where shadows run long and deep, beneath elevated train tracks, this younger Batman will confront updated takes of familiar foes - meeting each member of his classic Rogue's Gallery for the first time. From the likes of Joker, Penguin, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Riddler and Man-Bat, among others, the war on crime jumps to the next level with a new arsenal at the Dark Knight's disposal, all operated and linked by an advanced remote-controlled invention he dubs the ""Bat-Wave."" I hate the way The Joker looks in this cartoon because he looks like It the killer clown and second of all The Joker fights like Toad from X-Men! I like the old way The Joker looks which was wearing a business suit instead of dressing like a clown! The Penguin looks mostly normal except for his teeth which are sharp. Catwoman looks okay. Mr. Freeze looks pretty cool except for the thing with his ice powers coming from his hands instead of a ray-gun. Bane looks really cool! I'm not sure about the other villains yet. Rino Romano (also did the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man from Spider-Man Unlimited) is not bad at Bruce Wayne/The Batman at least he sounds rough when there are scenes where Batman is fighting crime. I wish Rino Romano could have done the same thing when he did the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in ""Spider-Man: Unlimited"". Some of the other voice actors are okay but some need to be replaced. But the animation design of all the characters are totally different compared to the 1992 cartoon. OK but the last two Batman cartoons were better.",12 out of 22 found this helpful.,6.0,25 October 2004
2357,The Batman, It's not Batman TAS but it's also not trying to be.,"The Batman follows Bruce Wayne who's in his third year of his career as masked crimefighter ""The Batman"" whose public presence is that of an urban legend. As we follow a relatively green Batman in his early days we see his first encounters with noted villains, the development of his relationship with the Gotham Police force from public enemy number one to alliance and even witness the origins of his partnerships with Batgirl and Robin.<br/><br/>Running from 2004 to 2008, The Batman was in a unique situation as it was the first Batman related show to be made that would not be related to the DC animated universe or the Kevin Conroy portrayal of Batman that had been the standard since his debut in 1992. The show featured a radical departure in art design with Jeff Matsuda of Jackie Chan adventures forgoing the traditional noir-ish art deco approach in favor of a more ""Americanime"" design that had been popularized through shows such as Jackie Chan Adventures and Cartoon Network's Teen Titans series. Needless to say The Batman sparked the ire of many fans who didn't appreciate the departure from the previous decade's standards established for the Dark Knight (ignoring the artistic departures in Batman TAS season 4, but I digress) and the show has something of a mixed reputation because of that. While I don't think the show is worthy of most of the derision it's received, I do acknowledge it has flaws that have a tendency to make themselves noticed.<br/><br/>As the show begins in its first season, it's very much a reintroduction to the characters and lore. As opposed to the Batman of Batman TAS who already had a Robin sidekick who was late high school or early college aged, the Batman of The Batman is relatively new to the world of crimefighting often having to work around the police instead of with them and avoiding media and public attention when possible. The reintroductions of various villains are where the series begins to stumble. Because the show now focuses on Bruce/Batman's ongoing growth in conjunction with typical ""villain of the week"" stories, The Batman has a tendency to truncate villain introductions and arcs for single episode storylines. Some villains don't even get an introduction such as a rather overdesigned character called Gearhead, and others seem to have undergone change simply for the sake of change. Easily the biggest downgrade of the series is the character of Mr. Freeze who in TAS was a tragic figure who spoke eloquently and conveyed a mixture of rage and despair that made him one of the most rich characters on the show. Mr. Freeze in The Batman is now a generic thuggish bankrobber who makes ice puns in a deep gravely voice and dresses like a pro wrestler. This results in Mr. Freeze being one of the most boring characters on the show and feels like it was done solely for the sake of not inviting comparisons to TAS. On the one hand I understand why they did this, but on the other they took a well-constructed character archetype and replaced it with nothing. I'm not opposed to different interpretations of the Character of Mr. Freeze. George Sander's humorous interpretation of the character from the 60s Batman show was silly but still had a level of class that made the character engaging. Here Mr. Freeze felt like one of the generic goons from the show given a voice and ice powers. Kevin Michael Richardson's Joker was also a sticking point for me (but for other reasons I'll get to). Not only do I not like the design, but Richardson's heavy voice doesn't feel like it fits with Joker's madcap delivery style and feels grating. But even taking aside my dislike for the show's interpretation of Joker, the series used Joker way too much. Of the 65 episodes made of The Batman, a little over 20 of them feature Joker or are related to Joker. In comparison TAS consisted of 85 episodes and used Joker 15 times. Joker is a good villain, but when you over rely on one particular villain it ends up leaving your show feeling very repetitive.<br/><br/>The visuals of the show are also rather mixed. While the color palette is more diverse going for a richer display of colors for Gotham than the red and black of the previous series, the show diverges from the more grounded aesthetic of TAS in favor of more exaggerated character designs. For the most part the style works reasonably well and is unintrusive, but there are notable missteps taken. Joker in The Batman doesn't have the style of the TAS Joker and instead of being a funhouse mirror interpretation of comedians like Jerry Lewis and Don Rickles, Joker in this series has an overdesigned ""deranged"" aesthetic of a straight jacket, long hair, an overly angular face, and bare feet. Riddler has a similar issue, while I like Robert Englund as the voice of Riddler his androgynous figure with a costume based heavily on Marilyn Manson just feels at odds with the voice and the character. It's not unthinkable that a Marilyn Manson inspired costume could work for some of Batman's Rogue's Gallery, but it would need to be someone like Scarecrow or Anarky who have a sense of theatricality to their characters. Riddler isn't ""theatrical"" he's a know it all who prides on ""knowing it all"" so the costuming choice doesn't mesh with the character.<br/><br/>With the criticisms out of the way, we can get to the real meat of the show which is the continuing plot threads. While Batman TAS was and remains a good show, it cannot be overlooked that the show was mainly designed in mind with the stories being (relatively) stand alone adventures that didn't require any particular viewing order. The Batman takes a different approach and while the episodes don't work as well as stand alones they do work as parts of a greater whole telling season and multi season long arcs that culminate in satisfying crescendos. Each season for the most part focuses on continuing characters and plot threads who see some level of development for a later payoff. This is where The Batman's strength lies as a TV show, it feels like there's movement of something bigger in the background even if the villain of the week doesn't lead to much satisfaction. We see Bruce/Batman grow in his relationships with his friend/mentor Alfred, see him develop relationships with members of the police during his time as a wanted fugitive laying the groundwork for cementing their partnership, and we see his taking on new partners and becoming less of a brooding figure of myth and more a symbol of un relenting justice for those who've lost hope of getting it. Even some villains (such as Clayface and Hugo Strange) are introduced better here than in TAS because they're established over several seasons worth of development which makes their payoff all the more satisfying. I think in a way this boils down to the main criticism of this show which I also think is it's biggest asset that sets it apart: The Batman is about what it says, The Batman and his growth as a person and hero and this means there's less time devoted to establishing the villains and giving them depth (at least in villain of the week format).<br/><br/>The Batman is a complicated show. It stumbles in many areas (especially in comparison to TAS), but it also succeeds in many other areas not previously explored by giving us an overarching narrative that felt like it was building characters and situations. The development wasn't always as smooth as it could've been, but the show did find a unique approach to the characters and lore that I do think makes it worth a viewing. Like pop cultures staples of James Bond, Godzilla, The Universal Monsters, and too many others to mention, with a historied character like Batman there have been many interpretations of the character and I'm sure there'll be many more to come. This isn't the ""definitive"" Batman, but it's still a unique approach that deserves to be looked at for what it is, a different approach to classic material.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,21 February 2021

The plot is very simple - two lovers struggle as they reunite after 30 years. The episodes follow them as they learn to live with and love each other again, colored by bittersweet regrets of the years they missed. The series touches nicely on the wish we all have to either fall in love, or rediscover love, without burdening us with heavy symbolism. The cast are all excellent in their ability to hold character throughout the series. There is just the right balance of silliness brought on by English character and temperament, and the seriousness that accompanies the search for love.<br/><br/>The dialog is crisp and entertaining, underplayed and natural, never going for the cheap laugh available in some of the situations created.

2368,As Time Goes By, Love it,"This is the kind of show that restores faith in drama and comedy presentations on television. The producers and director have actually produced a show for a mature audience. The people portrayed are credible and delightful, and seem to be enjoying their participation in the series. My one fear is that the series is not continuing. I'm not sure how many episodes there are beyond Lionel and Jean's marriage, by my count, there seem to be another 5 to 10. The series is so good that I know that we would just love it to continue on. This gem of a show is the sort that people don't know terribly much about as it never received much fanfare. But, everyone I know who does watch it, almost always shares our enthusiasm and like ourselves, is shocked to discover that someone else loves it as much as they do. The cast and administrators should know how well appreciated they are for this wonderful show.",15 out of 15 found this helpful.,,26 March 1999
2369,As Time Goes By, Wonderful series about late romance &amp; middle class life,"I first caught this program on Maryland Public TV in the afternoon years ago. It reminded me so much of my own parents, and sometimes my life. Jean &amp; Lionel are a wonderful old, married pair facing the usual tribulations of being old in years but young at heart. And though I've watched all the episodes dozens and dozens of times, I still enjoy them today.<br/><br/>My only complaint is with the ill-fated season 8. Some episodes just don't make much sense. Lionel selling the Country House conflicts with his decisions in Season 5 to keep it as is and protect the village from ""high flyers"". Also the Alistair/Sandy romance conflicts with her stated non-attraction in the previous 7 seasons. The viewer thinks the writer lost touch with his own characters in that season.<br/><br/>But season 9 redeems our favorite family and finally gives everyone a happy ending. (Though I do wonder who was left to run Type For You when the girls left for their happy endings.) One hopes in the fictional world, Jean &amp; Lionel have taken up the ways of their older counterparts (Rocy &amp; Madge) and traveled the world. A visit to Sandy &amp; Harry in Canada, perhaps a trip to Hawaii with Judy &amp; Alistair. Even some Mongolian trekking with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hardcastle the Senior. Then back to the Holland Park homestead for Christmastide with the grandchildren, with a weekender in Hampshire for Mrs. Bale's Christmas Party.<br/><br/>While the world has lost the great Joan Simms (Madge), her spirit and enthusiasm for life are captured in this series. May everyone share Madge &amp; Rocky's motto at 70-80 Plus... ""Rock on!""",25 out of 27 found this helpful.,,20 June 2004
2370,As Time Goes By, Why we Americans like this so much,"I've just watched the ""reunion"" show, the newest episode of the series, made in early 2005. Judi Dench in an interview said that it was the enthusiasm of the American audience that convinced the cast and creators to continue the series.<br/><br/>And why? Why do we like, even love, this show so much? First, the deft, brilliant writing, the believable situations and character interactions. It's just that the laughs come from situations that all of us can recognize. He never will answer a ringing telephone, which drives her crazy; she just can't fill the dishwasher properly, in his opinion,and that drives him bananas. We recognize this in our own situations, our own relationships. And don't count out the romance, the idea that two people lose track of each other (it turns out, due to a misunderstanding!) and, after 38 years apart, fall in love all over again. <br/><br/>Don't misunderstand: this is a sex comedy, a sexy show! But it's not in your face, it's just presented as a delicious part of life.<br/><br/>Then of course it's the way British actors play comedy, always with style and panache, never going for cheap laughs, never overstated or self-indulgent. No smutty asides and improvisations, either, as ""Method"" trained American actors tend to do, on television, stage and film, when they try to play comedy. There's a wonderful sense of generosity in the playing, too: ""We're doing this for YOU, the audience, not just for ourselves. Isn't it fun?"" <br/><br/>The newest episodes introduced a new character and left the door open for further developments. I look forward to more!",34 out of 38 found this helpful.,10.0,7 December 2005
2371,As Time Goes By, Former sweethearts Lionel Hardcastle and Jean Pargetter try to re-ignite the flame after 38 years of separation,"Viewing ""As Time Goes By"" is like visiting with family and close friends. I feel comfortable sitting in their living room, tagging along to their country home in Hampshire or having dinner with them. It makes me think I've known Lionel and Jean (played by Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench) for a very long time. I empathize as they get their long-ago derailed romance back on track, grapple with retirement and groan with the aches and pains of aging. Family and friends, wry humor and upbeat resignation seem to get them through it all.<br/><br/>Moira Brooker as Jean's hopelessly romantic, twice-divorced daughter,Judith, Jenny Funnell as the ever-sensible Sandy and Philip Bretherton as Lionel's whipper-snapper publicist make up an excellent supporting cast. They keep their characters real without making them cliché. Judith is not ditzy, Sandy has a soft side and Alistair---hey, hey---you gotta love him.

There are many laugh-out-loud laughs, as well as serious moments too. The final scene in the second episode is perfection. The series would be have been well-advised to end about two seasons before it did, but even these episodes are head-and-shoulders above most of today's television.

2373,As Time Goes By," So good I hope American TV never clones it, they'll ruin it.","As Time Goes by stars two wonderful leads -- Judi Dench (before her Oscar and Golden Globes, and Geoffrey Palmer, the definitive curmudgeon with a warm, fuzzy inside that he hides.  The timing and interplay between these two is superb, and the humor is ""comedy of manners"" as opposed to the cheap-shot and innuendo that passes for ""funny"" far too often.  It's also great to watch a show that acknowledges the existence of romance and sexuality for mature folks.<br/><br/>One must not pass lightly over the supporting players.  Moira Brooker, Jenny Funnel and Philip Bretherton are a lively and likeable ensemble, and Lionel's parents (Frank Middlemass and Joan Sims) are a riot, as is their housekeeper Mrs. Bale (Janet Henfrey).<br/><br/>There are no cookie-cutter characters here.  Even Alistair (Bretherton), who seems at first glance to be the ultimate Yuppie, has hidden depths.

I get a kick out of the different British idiom like ""bell me"", which in America we would say: Call me. Alistair Deacon is a riot! Always a fun character. At I love the straight laced Lionel, always trying to make sense of how women react and think. Jean is so spontaneous and and sweet. They play off of each other perfectly.

2382,As Time Goes By, Romantic- uh- comedy doesn't fit for me...,"I realize that this show is billed as a romantic-comedy, but I just can't quite put the comedy title on the show myself. Sure, I laugh hard at a lot of the show, but I can't believe a ""comedy"" would put tears in the eyes of an old man (and sometimes cause out-loud, though muffled, sobs to escape his lips! (Sometimes it is good that I watch TV alone.)) I am not quite sure what word should come after the ""Romantic-"" part.<br/><br/>I do believe that most of the quality of this show is centered directly on the actors (and maybe the Director). In many other shows these days, if there are characters in a scene that are just there to take up space and have no ""active"" part, the actor seems to have no idea how to play the part. If they react to the scene at all it is sometimes ahead of the dialog!<br/><br/>But in this show they always react to the scene appropriately. A glance in the right direction at the right time, a facial expression that matches the situation and does not occur until just the right amount of time AFTER the line being reacted to is delivered!<br/><br/>I hope this is not too much of a spoiler for anyone but, my favourite example of this ""inactive part"" acting is during the wedding scene. A couple of rows behind the happy couple is a woman that really seems to be only semi-interested in the wedding... I suppose she is a ""business acquaintance"" of Jean. When Lionel deliberately miss-announces his name, the reaction by this woman is priceless and in perfect relationship to the dialog. A few seconds later a man just in front of her and to the right also has the ""correct"" reaction to a piece of dialog. This typifies the quality of all the acting done on the show.<br/><br/>Excellent show!",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,27 October 2009

I suggest that Nickelodeon brings back all the shows from my childhood: Salute Your Shorts, Clarissa Explains It All, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Rocko's Modern Life, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, The Adventures of Pete and Pete, Double Dare with Marc Summers, Legends of the Hidden Temple, Guts, the old Rugrats(before they grew up and before they went to Paris), and Doug. It seems like yesterday when i heard the Patti Mayonnaise music, got extremely scared from a television show, watched Sam climb into Clarissa's window by climbing a ladder and Alex Mack turn into this liquid mercury stuff, went through the dryer at the laundromat to find Spunky, got extremely slimy with someone else's family, talked to some big rock, used a screwdriver to get out of a playpen, climbed a huge mountain, and went to summer camp.

        My favourite episode, I think, was either the one where Budnick falls for Dina, or the one with the curse of that ox skull, when the guys split from the girls and each go into a cave, when Dina and Telly are fighting at first, but then make-up, while the guys try plucking one of Ug's nosehairs out for the ""skull"" ritual.  <br/><br/>

2396,Salute Your Shorts, Camp Crazyness,"Camping in my book always was a double edged sword. On one hand it could be a wonderful and memorable experience full of fun and games as well as the beauty of the outdoors. But on the other hand it can be a living hell, form bad food, forced to bear our door discomforts, minimum technology, and worst of all boredom. This show though makes camp seem like a not so bad place to spend summer in.<br/><br/>This show is somewhat of a parody on the numerous camp films in the 80's, some good, some bad, or some so bad threat their good. It was made on a low budget but it was great because they don't rely on gimmicks to get a quick solution; it literally made those camp film a footnote compared to this show which was powered mainly by good dialog, good characters, and the oddball adventures they go on.<br/><br/>Indeed the characters are all odd and colorful, but they all despite not a great amount of depth we get to know them which makes them feel actually human. For the girls faction there's Telly an athletic overachiever, ZZ enviormentally conscientious and a bit bubble headed, and my favorite Dina Alexander a self absorbed dram queen that is too afraid to get both her hands and body dirty sometimes.<br/><br/>Then for the boys faction there's Michael whom was a straight man of the bunch though by second season he was replaced by Pinsky whom is sort of a young Fonzerilla he's cool and is able to get things going his way. Sponge is true to his name (or nickname) a brainac, Donkey Lips humble and slightly stumbling sometimes, and two of my favorites Budnick whom is a rebel of the bunch that constantly schemes to smuggle outside food and gives about everyone grief. Finally Ug a dumb as dirt camp councilor that tries to keep the kids under control but fails miserably.<br/><br/>Thhe show is loaded with memorable episodes which comply with two schools of comedy both physical humor but most of all verbal humor form small parts of the dialog to memorable quotes and one liners. Three of my favorite episodes were Capture the Flag when the characters had to go against another camp and unfortunately Budnick is a terrible commander and meets a dramatic demise (an homage to ""Platoon""). A Halloween episode where all the characters make bet with Budnick that they can actually scare him of course they all fail miserably but there's a twist in the end; but the one thing that makes the episode stand out was it actually created a memorable monster that might have given kids nightmares. And finally the third episode which was the first and only two parter the show had where Budnick admits his feelings to Dina but has to change certain things about himself to keep her. Unfortunately the change just really cramps on his identity and Dina discovers she may have preferred the old Budnick than the ideal guy she had in mind.<br/><br/>This is an ideal camp we wish really would exist.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,10.0,25 July 2012

Two things I especially remember very well the opening sequence and theme song. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. Also, the writing was very strong. The performances were top-grade, too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. Speaking of that, one of my favorite episodes is the one where Sponge (Tim Eyster) and Donkeylips (Michael Bower) sneak fast food into everyone's cabin. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I'm not sure if I've seen every episode.

Now all the shows they have on nick are boring except for like spongebob i like that show, but this show was unique about kids at a camp about real life, even though compared to the shows now there are better actors doing shows better plots but maybe thats what was good about this show that it had an old fashion to it.

2405,Salute Your Shorts, Camp Anawana or Bust. (spoilers),"Salute Your Shorts is one of the last of the great Nickelodean lineups. Shows that were geared toward older, probably early teen audiences like Clarissa Explains It All, Hey Dude, The Adventures of Pete and Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mac (which aired later than the rest of this list), and so forth. They were shows that were simply interesting because unlike network television, they were shows with a premise that were just altogether different, and when they finally went off the air, Nickelodean surely landed in the crapper (must Viacom destroy everything it buys?).<br/><br/>Camp Anawana was a perpetual summer camp, or at least, so long as the show was on, the kids were at summer camp. Looking back, the show was incredibly corny (some episodes are still available on peer-to-peer networks for the desperate searcher) as many of Nickelodean's shows were, but then again, it was for younger audiences. Nonetheless, it was great entertainment. Too bad it was only on for a year, but I guess with a plot like that, you can easily run out of ideas. <br/><br/>The show never really had a main character. It was simply about various adventures and mishaps of some of the kids (Danny Cooksey being the most memorable as misfit mullethead, Bobby Budnick and Rilo Kiley guitarist/vocalist Blake Soper/Sennet as smart ass Ronnie Pinsky who joined the cast in 1992), doofus camp counselor and butt of many jokes U.G. Lee, and the omnipresent but never visible Doctor Kahn who's voice was regularly projected on the P.A. notifying the camp of weird things oddly similar to Bill Murray's P.A. announcements in the first Meatballs movie. I can't remember all the shows, but a few of my favorites were the one where Sponge is being prepped for a radio sweepstakes question, the one where Michael and Budnick are stuck at camp after pretending to be sick, and the one that focused on baseball tryouts or something (I vaguely remember the whole thing).<br/><br/>Dang! Can't people in the television industry see that viewers are craving some original, good shows? They just have to use the early 90s as their models.

If I was given the opportunity to buy it on DVD I would jump at the chance. Nickelodeon is definitely not what it used to be, and I wish this younger generation could have the opportunity to see more of the shows that my generation was brought up with. I watched a lot of TV and movies, and as strange as it sounds, they had a big hand in shaping my perception of what life was supposed to be like. Boy was I surprised to go to high school and see that not everybody looked the cast of 90210 or Grease. Cartoons like Doug and Rugrats were my all time TV favorites, but I can't stand the newer Rugrats episodes.

2408,"Welcome Back, Kotter"," Great Early Years, Awful in Final Season","This show ranks highly among the other 1970's shows which we remember: ""All in the Family"", ""Maude"", ""Sanford and Son"", ""One Day at a Time"", and ""The Jeffersons"".  These shows dealt with issues such as racism, divorce, abortion, and being poor.  These shows had writing that was great, and characters that were even greater.  The characters, which had flaws (Archie Bunker, Fred Sanford, and George Jefferson, etc.) which we all, whether we were conservative, or liberal, or moderate, could relate to.<br/><br/>""Welcome Back, Kotter"" was about a dedicated teacher who wanted to return to his alma mater to try to deal with a bunch of remedial, misfit high school students in inner city NYC when no one else wanted to deal with them. These types of teenagers were not tackled on TV before.  The casting was perfect for the NYC setting:  from the nerd in Horshack, to the cool maverick in Barbarino, to the Latino in Epstein, to the Black male, of course, in Washington.  There is also the Principal in Mr. Woodman.  The writing was great.  The timing was awesome.  The theme song by John Sebastian is breathtaking.  The show was purely magical in its first few seasons.<br/><br/>
There were problems, as life deals us sometimes.  One was Marcia Straussman. She was very unhappy that her involvement in storylines was limited.  It was unfortunate because the show primarily dealt with life at the school. Because she played the wife of the teacher, and she was primarily at home, there was not room for her.  The act of making her a character on the show was not a good one.  The Mrs. Kotter character would have been more appropriate on recurring basis.  Another problem was differences between Gabe Kaplan and the other producers and writers.  This explains why we never saw him much during the later run of the series.<br/><br/>Gabe Kaplan's lack of involvement in the show's fourth and final season was just one of the many problems which doomed the show.  The writing in that final season was sloppy, unrealistic, unfunny, and was so amateurish.  As a teenager watching the show in reruns, I saw that something was amiss.  The actors on the show complained that the scripts were trash.  A storyline about Horshack getting married was about as bad as the writing could get, and it was that.  The E! Channel's ""E! True Hollywood Story"" about this show talks about that dismal fourth season.  Another major problem with that show in the fourth season was that the actors who played the Sweathogs.  The problem with actors playing teenagers is that they were older than teenagers when they began portraying those characters.  To prepare to portray teens, they had to learn how to be teenagers again.  It worked in the early days.<br/><br/>However, by the time the fourth season had arrived, the actors had matured and developed as adults where they were getting too old to portray teenagers anymore.  They also did not look like teenagers, either.  Let's not forget John Travolta and his blossoming as a movie star.  These factors led to the demise of the series.<br/><br/>The series was about a concept so fresh, people in this modern era can relate to it even more now than they could back in the 70's.  This concept is about misfit children.  This is why it was so popular for awhile in syndication.  However, it fizzled in syndication because when those fourth season episodes began airing, the viewing felt that the whole show was crap and stopped watching.  USA Network had it.  TV Land had it.  They both stopped showing it.<br/><br/>Even though things did not end on a good note, true fans of the show can ignore that fourth season and remember the greater moments.  It was a great show in general.",37 out of 42 found this helpful.,,8 July 2002

Between the hilarious plots and the identifiable high school situations, the show was a hit. What student in a diverse environment can't identify with ""Roses are red, violets are blue, my mom wants me to date a Puerto Rican Jew""?  My favourite episode focused upon the Sweathogs cleaning for a pregnant Mrs. Kotter, only to destroy her apartment.

2413,"Welcome Back, Kotter", The Rise And Fall Of Its Own Roman Empire,"It is a mystery to this day why this beloved sitcom has not been given the respect it so truly deserves. For one,it ranks highly among other shows of the 1970's that were so great from that decade which we truly remembered but also are still around in repeats: ""All In The Family"", ""Sanford and Son"",""The Jeffersons"",""Good Times"",""One Day At A Time"", ""Barney Miller"",""Happy Days"",""Maude"",and not to even mention ""Different Strokes"",""What's Happening"",and ""Chico And The Man"". These were the shows that we grew up watching but at the same time dealt with issues that were relevant in its day such as racism,divorce,abortion,civil rights,and unemployment not to mention being poor. The characters themselves which had their flaws whether pro or con(Archie Bunker, Fred Sanford,Maude Findley,James Evans,and George Jefferson not to mention Ann Romano)and these characters,when they had there say were either conservative,liberal,or moderate in their views of expression. And these are the characters that we can relate to upfront since during the 1970's we watch them with a candid viewpoint.<br/><br/>""Welcome Back Kotter"",was one of those shows that we can relate with since it only ran for four seasons on ABC-TV from 1975 to 1979,and it was the launching pad for John Travolta,who emerged as a superstar in his own right because of this series. However,Gabe Kaplan may have been the star of show,but lets face facts here:It was John Travolta who was bringing in the ratings and the viewers for the show's first three seasons(1975-1977). During its first three seasons,it was nominated for its brilliant writing as well as its outstanding catchy theme song from John Sebastian,from the group ""The Lovin Spoonfuls"". The theme song itself is a standardized classic since during its heyday became a top ten hit and was also Grammy nominated. It was nominated for four Emmys between 1976,1978,1979-and basically won in 1976 for Outstanding Musical Score. The producers that made that show successful were the brilliant team of its creator(Gabe Kaplan)and producer,James Komack(who was also the show's executive producer)along with the writing team of Alan Sacks,George Yanok,and Eric Cohen. However,James Komack was also behind this series and also another classic 1970's sitcom,""Chico And The Man"",which was on NBC.<br/><br/>""Welcome Back,Kotter"",was about a dedicated teacher who wanted to return to his alma mater to try to deal with a bunch of remedial,misfit bunch of high school students that no one else wanted to deal with and to put it bluntly no one really cared. The casting was perfect for the NYC setting:from the nerd Horshack(Ron Palillo),the cool maverick Barbarino(John Travolta),the hot-headed Latino Epstein(Robert Hegyes), to the cool black male,Washington(Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs). There is also the school's principal,Mr. Woodman(John Sylvester). By the way,during the show's first three seasons,John Travolta wasn't the only one that became a mega superstar in his own right. However,the show was also a launching pad for Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs as well,since he was still making movies when this series came out and continues to do so in movies and television and not to mention Broadway after the series ended. Also to point out the show made stars out of other actors as well including Vernee Watson,Debralee Scott,and Ron Palillo. The guest stars were also the focalpoint of the show including some that made their mark including a very teenage looking Michael Jackson,and not to mention others that would come on board as well. The timing during the first three seasons were awesome and purely magical and sometimes breathtaking within the first few episodes of the show. Then tragedy settles it which basically saw the decline of the show as well. <br/><br/>There were problems especially with actress Marcia Straussman,who was unhappy that her story lines on the show were limited. Another problem was the differences between Gabe Kaplan and James Komack and some of the writers on the show. The other problem was the disputes with the producers and network executives over at ABC who wanted control over the series. This led to Gabe Kaplan's lack of involvement over the show and its shows in the last two seasons of the series and some of the many problems which doomed it in which we never saw Kaplan much during the series final two seasons. In the show's final season,the episodes were silly not to mention unfunny and very sloppy. From there the actors on the show complained about the show's scripts since some of them were completely garbage. Not to mention the cast weren't teenagers anymore since they were grown adults playing adolescent kids,which goes to show they didn't looked like teenagers either. These were the factors led to the demise of the series in 1979,after producing 95 episodes. The other reason why the show demise? For one,it had to do with the leaving of John Travolta at the end of the show's third season especially when Travolta was a hot commodity in Hollywood after the huge success of the greatest disco-movie ever made,""Saturday Night Fever"". After the series ended,Gabe Kaplan was never heard from again. The Rise and Fall Of The Kotter Empire.",20 out of 30 found this helpful.,,20 September 2005

The episode where they ran a telethon from the classroom was classic.  The final season was a disappointment because the show's writers wanted to go in a different direction--attacking more serious issues.  Plus, the departure of John Travolta after he hit it big in the movies hurt ""Kotter"" as well.  It's probably all for the better that it only went four years because I think when a sitcom goes for too long, it tends to deviate from its originial concept (i.e. ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne and Shirley"").",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,31 August 2003
2417,"Welcome Back, Kotter", That 70's Show - the urban version,"Let's face it, ""Welcome Back Kotter"" was the real ""That 70's Show"" - the inner city urban version. I can't remember the last time I even saw this show in syndication on channels such as Nick at Nite that once specialized in dusting off old sitcoms unseen for years. The comic premise of the show is that Gabe Kotter, newly graduated from college and certified to teach, has returned to teach the same remedial class of high school misfits of which he was a member ten years earlier. Vice Principal Woodman, who was the object of Gabe's torments and jokes ten years earlier, is still employed at the high school and gives Gabe this job as the ultimate irony and revenge for what Gabe had put him through. Of course, this show is sugar-coated compared to the real problems and issues of a New York City public school in a poor neighborhood, but it had to be since this was a sitcom, not a drama. The show had a great cast playing great characters - there was Horshack, the class nerd with the nasal laugh; Barbarino, the cool maverick who was a little slow on the uptake; Epstein with the mixed Latino/Jewish heritage and the great excused absence notes signed by ""Epstein's mother"", and last but not least, Washington. There was a great common enemy in Mr. Woodman, who you couldn't help but feel a little sorry for. Finally, the show had a great location in Brooklyn and a memorable theme song by John Sebastian that you are much more likely to hear today than see the show from whence it came. For three wonderful seasons from 1975 to 1978 it was a comedy classic. But, alas, all things must come to an end.<br/><br/>After John Travolta starred in the back-to-back hits of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease"", he would hardly return anyone's phone calls, much less show up for work on a regular basis. Thus the fourth season not only jumped the shark, it pretty much made it over the Gulf of Mexico. What was really going on behind the scenes in 1978, if I remember correctly, was a bruising battle of the egos catalyzed by Travolta's new-found superstar status. To compensate for all the turmoil and in-fighting among the cast, Kotter is made vice-principal to explain all of Gabe Kaplan's absences, then the show added Stephen Shortridge as an entirely inadequate placeholder for Travolta. The final straw was when the show seemed to be endorsing the marriage of two high-schoolers - Horshack and Mary - and then Horshack began drinking heavily afterward.<br/><br/>The irony is that the stardom status for everyone involved instantaneously evaporated after the show that their egos destroyed was canceled in 1979. The only one to ever recover their stardom was Travolta, and then it took ten years before he could even land a job playing straight man to a talking baby in ""Look Who's Talking"". I hate to sound bitter, but it's hard not to be considering what a great show it was during the first three seasons of its all too-brief four season run.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,29 April 2010

I used to watch this a lot as a teenager and then it was removed from the afternoon line up on channel 54, this show helped to launch the career of many especially John Travolta who instantly became a super star.<br/><br/>Gabe Kotter, (Kaplan) an understanding teacher returns to his old school James Buchanan High in Brooklyn to teach a remedial class and social studies to a new generation of troublemakers called the Sweathogs. They are a group of unteachable and underachieving young men led by Vinnie Barbarino (Travolta) a funny guy with tons of insults. Juan Epstein, (Hegyes)a Puerto Rican Jew, ultra cool Freddie Boom Boom Washington (Jacobs) and big nerd Arnold Horshack (Palillo). Kotter once a sweat hog himself tries to use his own experiences to get through to his students but they're often interrupted by Mr. Woodman (White) the cranky principal.<br/><br/>By the second season Gabe and his wife Julie (Strassman) became the proud parents of twin daughters and she became a teacher at Buchanan High. At the start of season 3 Vinnie graduated from high school and a new guy Beau De Labarre (Shortridge) was introduced into the Sweathogs he too was a troublemaker.<br/><br/>Season four was a little boring without the presence of Kaplan and Travolta however the main highlight was when Arnold fell in love and married his girlfriend Mary Johnson (Arranga)at the end of the series.

2421,"Welcome Back, Kotter"," As bad as it was, it still holds a reserve in my memory.","WBC was one of those 70's shows that was only viewed by my siblings and I when there was nothing better on. There are many things to loathe about this show: Corny jokes, slow moving plot, tiresome characters and a very drab inner city school backdrop that looked like your typical living nightmare for any teacher. School sucks enough as it is, so why would anyone want to subject themselves to watching it on TV for entertainment? I understand that comedy is often rooted in pain and that is where we derive comedy in general. But Welcome Back, Kotter brings the expression ""Painful to watch"" in a whole new level. It was also very negative in how it treated people. We weren't watching anything realistic here, just a very contrived and sophomoric representation of reality. And the results are uninspiring.<br/><br/>I will say that it is memorable for a couple of reasons. First, it catapulted the career of John Travolta. Gabe Kaplan was a likable guy who seemed to skate through this depiction of a high school teacher who has good intentions while having a bug to be an amateur comedian. Some people harshly criticize the fifth Sweathog from the south during the final season. I actually thought he brought some fun originality to this progressively stale and weary Motley Crew. <br/><br/>But where I derive meaning from this lousy program was the message in the theme song. The idea of a man returning to his Alma Mater as a teacher is both depressing yet endearing.

2422,"Welcome Back, Kotter"," First Three Seasons Funny, Fourth Season Not","I really enjoyed Welcome Back, Kotter. It was a very funny show with an outstanding ensemble cast anchored by Gabe Kaplan, who brought lots of humor to the class of unteachable sweathogs with jokes and impressions. I always got a kick out of his uncle jokes in the opening and closing of each episode, including the ones when he was telling a joke to a turkey and to a computer used as an electronic teaching device. <br/><br/>As for the sweathogs, they were a riot. John Travolta catapulted his way to success as the macho, monosyllabic (""What? Where?"") Vinnie Barbarino, Robert Hegyes portrayed TV's first Puerto Rican Jew Juan (Little Juan) Epstein and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs made me crack up every time he said ""Hi there!"" But my favorite of the sweathogs was Arnold Horshack. Ron Pallilo's portrayal of one of TV's funniest nerds was so outstanding, from his nasal voice to his inimitable laugh. His laugh was the funniest on TV prior to Steve Urkel. <br/><br/>Gabe constantly got grief from vice principal (later principal) Mr. Woodman, who kept barging into his class with the same frequency Frank &amp; Marie Barone did to their son years later on Everybody Loves Raymond. Let's not forget Marcia Strassman as Gabe's wife Julie, who didn't have much to do in most of the show until the fourth season. <br/><br/>As for the fourth season, the least that can be said, the better. it was horrible without Kaplan and Travolta on the show full-time and Stephen Shortridge as Beau. It was like watching the Sanford and Son episodes a couple of years earlier without Redd Foxx. <br/><br/>I'll wrap this up by mentioning the theme song by John Sebastian that made it to No. 1 on the pop charts and resurrected his career. it was one of the best 70s TV theme songs.

I guess this was cute and iconic at the time, but even my parents' generation often remarks on how mediocre and lame it was, in reality. I guess it is just a nostalgic thing for older viewers. Nothing about it is really that funny. It is more annoying and sleep-inducing than anything else.

2424,"Welcome Back, Kotter"," Wow, how bad can a show get?","I remember a long time ago when the USA Network I believe started announcing they were going to run Kotter. My friends and I were psyched! The big day came and we got our chow and watched. What a letdown. Within five minutes of us trying to enjoy ourselves, we changed our attitude for the rest of the show and instead of embracing it, we made fun of it. And even THAT was a strain, the show was so bad.<br/><br/>It's unfathomable to think that there are some who not only enjoy the show (that's fine, I like some bad shows too) but who actually place it amongst the greatest sitcoms of all time. ""Welcome Back Kotter"" has to be (with the exception of ""Happy Days"" from the third season on) the worst popular sitcom ever made. This show is BAD. Not even ""enjoyable"" bad, just achingly painful-to-view bad.<br/><br/>The worst was when the show forced the characters to do their catchphrases every show. Horshack's ""ooh, ohh,"" Barbarino's ""what...where, etc,"" Washington's ""hi there,"" all showed such unbelievable strain, how can anyone laugh after the first time? Just like ""Happy Days"" when they went nuts with the catchphrases.<br/><br/>But the really sad thing is, most of the actors on the show were decent enough, it was the unbelievably horrid writing that really hurt the show. Ironically, easily the most untalented person involved with the show was Gabe Kaplan. His character sucked, Kaplan couldn't do comedy (this guy was a comedian?) and sure couldn't get dramatic when needed, and I believe he wrote the show, or most of it? Kaplan, the man behind the show, was the show's main detriment.<br/><br/>I did find it pretty facinating how the woman who played Kotter's wife was whining on and on about her lack of storylines on the show, when she was interviewed for some recent documentaries about ""Kotter."" She couldn't understand that her character was minor and not nearly as important to the show as most of the others? Actually, watching her whine and cry about her lack of involvement was more amusing than the show itself.<br/><br/>However, if there ever is a reunion TV movie, I'll watch it, only because it would be fun to see these characters possibly with their sons and daughters as the new Sweathogs, seeing what route a reunion movie would take.

2425,"Welcome Back, Kotter"," Not the ""classic"" I expected","Recently, TV Land ran their marathon of ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", so I watched a few episodes. What stuck out most about the show was how amazingly, astonishingly awful the acting was. The episodes still had John Travolta, so I know they came from the early years, which means they are supposed to be the ""good"" episodes. Now, the dialogue and plotting weren't bad, and some of the jokes they tried to make might have even been funny --- if anyone on the show had a sense of comic timing. There was a lot of dead time between every line of dialogue; it seemed as if the actors needed to take a second to remember their lines, or weren't sure it was their cue to speak. It was like a bad high school production. Of course, the terribly broken pacing kills the humor. After watching two episodes, I had had all I could take. It makes me wonder how the show ever became popular.",7 out of 12 found this helpful.,,22 July 2001

John Travolta and the others made high school look stupid. Horseshack and his laugh were funny for a while but now, it hurts my ears when I hear it. This show was also sexist. The female characters weren't developed and were reduced to stereotypes. His wife would have a life outside the apartment and Helaine Lembeck was a very pretty woman and should have more to do.

Gabe Kaplan really helped create a perfect balance between having a great comic show as well as dealing with some current topics such as drug abuse, teen pregnancy and gang violence. However, the show really went into sharp decline after suffering the double whammy of the departures of Kaplan and John Travolta. Also, it would have been interesting to see Vinnie, Freddie, Juan and Arnold graduate and see how they would have done in the real world as it was originally planned in the final season.

It's nothing but an endless stream of grade school-level insult humor. (Remember ""Up your nose with a rubber hose""?) There's a reason why Gabe Kaplan no longer has a career: because he's NOT funny. In fact, he's an incredibly annoying a--hole - like every other character on this show. (He's merely the worst of the bunch.)

2429,"Welcome Back, Kotter"," ""Yeah We Tease Him A Lot, Cause We Got Him On The Spot""","Though it only lasted for four seasons and the last one was pretty lame, Welcome Back Kotter left its mark especially one particular career. John Travolta got his first big break here and this series led to him starring in Saturday Night Fever while this show was still running. Unfortunately the show didn't outlast his leaving it.<br/><br/>The premise was an interesting one, a nice one about a mans who wanted to give something back to where he came from. And where he came from was a class of underachievers from this same Brooklyn high school where he is now teaching. He's assigned to teach the dregs of the school, those for whom fate has decreed they've got a lifetime of changing tires or flipping burgers. Fate decreed that for Gabe Kotter, but he believed in cheating fate and is now trying to impart that same lesson to the sweathogs of a new generation.<br/><br/>Sweathogs is the name of the group in his class and they were all New York types to the max. Robert Heyges, Laurence Hilton-Jacobs, Ron Palillo, and John Travolta were four of his students with whom he bonded with. Interestingly enough the four all very different backgrounds bonded with each other, the education system's neglect of them made them kindred spirits.<br/><br/>Gabe Kaplan starred as Kotter and he created the show as well and drew from his own background. It's probably what gave the show its success. But when Kaplan wanted out after three seasons, the producers tried to keep it going, but the heart of the show was gone. Also by that time John Travolta was a major film star and he wanted out as well. They brought Marcia Strassman to the school and she had played Kaplan's wife and Mrs. Kotter was hired as a guidance counselor. It just didn't work and the show was mercifully canceled.<br/><br/>There was one other very important element in Welcome Back Kotter. John Sylvester White played the Assistant Principal Mr. Woodman is a self serving bureaucrat who was in the school administration when Kotter was himself a sweathog. He can't believe the guy who was marked for failure could now be teaching in his school. White is frustrated every week when episode after episode Kotter gets through another crisis and doesn't quit in frustration. White is sitting around waiting to collect his pension and idealists he doesn't get if he ever was one in the first place, if he was ever young in the first place. He was a great antagonist for Kaplan as Kaplan shot zinger after zinger over this man's forehead. He never got a clue, but White created a great character. He never got enough credit for the show's success.<br/><br/>Welcome Back Kotter was a beacon of New York urban culture, seventies style.

2433,The Bob Newhart Show, One of the best sit-coms ever,"I spent WAY too many hours glued to the TV as a youngster during the 1970s. Many of the shows I thought were absolutely perfect in 1972 or 1975, I have trouble sitting through for 10 minutes today. Some, however, have stood the test of time.<br/><br/>I would have to say that The Bob Newhart Show, more than any other show, has grown in my estimation as I have matured. I enjoyed it as a kid, but love it all the much more now.<br/><br/>Mr. Newhart, simply put, was and is a comedic genius. One blank look from him can surpass a 15-minute monologue by many comedians, for laugh production. In the right setting, with the right handling, Bob Newhart was one of the funniest ever. Fortunately for us, that perfect setting came together in the 1972-78 Bob Newhart Show. This show had impeccable writing by Charlotte Brown, Dick Clair and others, great directing by Peter Baldwin and many others, as well as wonderful acting.<br/><br/>One might have doubted that the struggles of a psychologist and his patients would make good fodder for comedy. Wrong! Who can forget the obnoxious Elliot Carlton (Jack Riley), the sharp knitting needles of Mrs. Bakerman (Florida Friebus, a.k.a., Dobie Gillis' mom),  and wimpy Mr. Peterson (John Fielding, also in `12 Angry Men')? Who can forget the elevator and its frequent involvement in scenes, or Bernie Tupperman (Larry Gelman), the pudgy urinologist, or the periodic visits from `The Peeper' (Tom Poston)? And these, of course, were NOT part of the main supporting cast.<br/><br/>Suzanne Pleshette was perfect as Bob's lovely and usually supportive wife, Emily. Marcia Wallace became a household name as Carol, the perky secretary. Peter Borenz and Bill Daily, meanwhile, were absolutely delightful as Bob's two best friends, dentist Jerry Robinson and navigator Howard Borden. Daily, who was also great in `I Dream of Jeannie,' provided one of the most hilarious characters in sit-com history, as the clueless neighbor, Howard.<br/><br/>The cast of The Bob Newhart Show was so good and so deep that I have to make one confession. While I love Bob Newhart himself, I believe my favorite episode was one in which he had only a cameo appearance, phoning home from a convention somewhere. Carol, Jerry and Howard became convinced that an old flame visiting Emily while Bob was gone, spelled trouble. They spied on the two in a restaurant and the scene was possibly the most hilarious in the show's run, as Jerry wore a ridiculous fake glasses/nose combo and Howard could never seem to recognize him.<br/><br/>The Bob Newhart Show was a high-water mark for intelligent, sophisticated humor - although occasional forays into slapstick gave it an even more satisfying balance. Overall, I would call it one of the top three or four comedies ever made.",46 out of 47 found this helpful.,,12 January 2002
2434,The Bob Newhart Show, We all wanted a wife and life like Bob's.,"A masterpiece of understated adult humor, epitomized by its low-key star, Bob Newhart, who could get big laughs reading from the phone book with his trademark stammers and pauses.<br/><br/>Supporting cast was remarkable, each playing to his or her strengths, gliding smoothly along the tracks laid down by the expert writing staff. Standouts? Everybody was a standout. Peter Bonerz as Jerry, the libidinous orphaned dentist. Bill Daily as the addled Howard Borden, airline navigator, bumbling divorced dad, and meal moocher. Marcia Wallace as Carol, confident, razor-tongued receptionist extraordinaire. Jack Riley as Mr. Carlin, the funniest self-centered jerk of the modern sitcom era. And Suzanne Pleshette as Emily, Bob's gorgeous, sensible wife.<br/><br/>The trick to the show's humor was that it seemed to rise naturally from these characters who, though colorful, also resembled real people. Nobody had to push too hard for a laugh. <br/><br/>Almost three decades later I still haven't seen another TV comedy series that possessed this one's unique tone of humor, an almost indescribable mix of the usual satire and sarcasm and poking fun at our modern life and lifestyles, balanced perfectly against warm-hearted affirmation of the bonds of friendship and affection that make life bearable.

2435,The Bob Newhart Show, Saturday Night Memories,"This was part of the great CBS Saturday night line-up which included ""Mary Tyler Moore"", ""All in the Family"".  Bob Newhart's deadpan reactions to all the craziness that was going on around him was what helped to make this show special. Its surprising how it never received an Emmy, or for that matter a nomination. Maybe it was because it was part of such a legendary prime time line-up that it got lost in the shuffle. Also, maybe it was due to the fact that it had such a strong ensemble that no one particular member of the cast stood out. Besides Newhart, Suzanne Pleshette, Peter Bonnerz, Marcia Wallace and Bill Daily all made this show what it was, but the funniest character on the show had to be Elliot Carlin. He definitely was one of the most acerbic characters ever created for television.

After the sixth and final season,Bob Newhart decided to call it quits. <br/><br/>He told TV Guide that the show was ""still doing well enough.But I got very disturbed about the trends in TV....the kiddie audience seemed to be taking over the tube....I felt my type of low-key comedy-aimed an intelligent adults-was finished. So I just told MTM and CBS I wasn't coming back for the seventh season. We were not canceled. I left on my own.""<br/><br/>However,the show wasn't canceled by the network. Amazingly,the series was still in the top ten of the Nielsen ratings and was in the top five spot along with some tough competition of its day including some of the greatest shows of the decade(and this was toward the end of the 1970's) were still going strong including ""M*A*S*H"",""One Day At A Time"",""Alice"", ""All In The Family"",""The Jeffersons"",""Three's Company"",""Happy Days"",and not to mention ""The Carol Burnett Show"" which was also still in the top ten as well during its final season. When ""The Bob Newhart Show"" stopped production in April of 1978,the series and its wonderful cast of characters did not disappear from television. Instead they've taken on a second life,replete with character development and some very funny classic moments. In case some may not remember this series,about the misadventures of a Chicago psychiarist(Dr. Robert Hartley,played by Bob Newhart) who lives in a upscale Lakeshore apartment complex with his lovely wife Emily(played by Suzanne Pleshette)and their next door neighbor Howard Borden(played by Bill Daily)and a host of misunderstood characters that Bob deals with within the office complex where he works and at home. The laughs may have been okay in parts,but still it is a television classic.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE CAST:LIFE AFTER THE BOB NEWHART SHOW In the fall of 1982,Bob Newhart's second-longest running sitcom called ""Newhart"" was also a top ten hit with CBS-TV for the eight seasons that it was on the air(1982-1990).The new sitcom was set at the Stratford Inn in rural Vermont. He played innkeeper Dick Louden,who was also a how-to author and a talk show host where he kept humble residence with his beloved wife Joanna(played by Mary Frann),his handyman George Utley(Tom Poston)and a host of misunderstood characters and some of them were stranger than life. Who remembers the three woodsman,Larry,Darryl and Darryl? The series final episode in May of 1990 is vintage classic TV where most of the original cast of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" from the 1970's reappears in segments which included his other TV wife(Suzanne Pleshette). However,Bob Newhart made one more successful series as well which included the short-lived series intitled ""Bob"",which was also on CBS-TV(1993-1994)and it starred Betty White and Tom Poston. As for the the others including Marcia Wallace,Bill Daily,Peter Bonerz,and Suzanne Pleshette? They're still around especially with Peter Bonerz and Suzanne Pleshette who are now working behind the camera and are producing and directing several feature films made for television and also in theatrical films as well. Marcia Wallace made several appearances in TV shows including ""Taxi"",""Murphy Brown"",""Will and Grace"",and others. while fellow BNS actor Bill Daily is doing the club circuit these days and is frequently on the talk show range with Jay Leno,Conan O'Brien and David Letterman and is set to star in the theatrical version of the 1960's Barbara Eden TV classic ""I Dream Of Jeannie"".",28 out of 30 found this helpful.,,22 June 2004

While Archie Bunker fumbled once daughter Gloria and ""Meathead"" moved out, leaving him without a regular nemesis, ""The Bob Newhart Show"" delivered first rate comedy as dependably in its last season as it did in its first.<br/><br/>Newhart was a more mature Seinfeld in that most of the madness was provided by the supporting cast, and a terrific one it was too: Suzanne Pleshette, sassy and sexy as Bob's earthy wife, Emily; Peter Bonerz as the dentist and sarcastic ladies man, Jerry Robinson; and Bill Daley as perpetually befuddled pilot Howard Borden. Then there was Marcia Wallace as snippy receptionist Carole, the wonderful John Fiedler as mousy Mr. Peterson, and Jack Riley as the truly deranged Mr. Carlin.

Now on DVD, I am discovering it for the first time. The writing is smart and the acting is smarter than ever with Bob Newhart in the title role as a Chicago psychologist, Susan Pleshette as his wife and third grade school teacher. They are great couple on screen. Surprisingly, they don't have children in the show which is a big plus because the show works better without them. Marcia Wallace is wonderful as his secretary. The show is smart, funny, savvy, relevant, and most of all timeless. It's a classic sitcom that might be overlooked because it's not dirty or stupid like most sitcoms are today. The Bob Newhart Show and others of that era are classic and timeless and relevant to today's life. Too bad, shows like that aren't being developed for television today.

2448,The Bob Newhart Show, Delightful Sitcom.,"Bob Newhart is a clinical psychologist living with his wife, teacher Susanne Pleshette, in a Chicago high rise apartment. His neighbor is airline navigator Bill Daily. Newhart commutes daily to his office where he is on friendly terms with the dentist who has an office on the same floor, Peter Bonerz, with whom he shares a secretary, the toothy but amiable Marcia Wallace. Newhart treats various clients, none of whom are suffering very much. The most cynical and sometimes obnoxious is Jack Reilly.<br/><br/>This template allows for various forms of comedic exchanges between multiple characters and the opportunities are seized aptly.<br/><br/>The central figure is Newhart himself and he's a caution. He's always low-keyed in his responses, almost a straight man, sometimes in the grip of some loony phone conversation, his reactions usually minimal and restricted to blinks or moues.<br/><br/>The series is a constant treat if what you're looking for is understated, genteel humor. (Its opposite may be ""Married With Children."") Newhart's character is conventional in the extreme, a font of humor. He wears those 1970s loud, polyester suits and wide ties as if born in them. His apartment is disgustingly bourgeois -- lots of dark wood paneling, frilly lampshades and table cloths, a wide sliding-glass window overlooking beautiful downtown Chicago. There's no point, and no room, in giving examples of the jokes but, well, hell, I'll briefly describe one. Newhart visits the office of a minister where, unknown to Newhart, a worker upstairs has just installed an air-conditioning vent. Newhart is uncomfortable in the presence of the reverend and keeps slipping in remarks about having to answer to a higher authority and so forth. As Newhart is leaving, the worker's voice issues from the air conditioner near the ceiling, shouting, ""Dan, I'm coming DOWN now!"" Newhart blinks and exits rapidly.<br/><br/>Now, this doesn't sound funny, I admit, but that's part of my point. The humor lies in the way the situation is played. And the set-up is such that the slight variations in normal exchanges stand out vividly. It's rather like the contemporaneous ""Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" which shared the same production company and sometimes writers and directors.<br/><br/>You wouldn't want to live the ritualized existence of Newhart, his family, his friends, and his patients. ""Hi, Bob,"" is a greeting so often repeated that a generation ago it was a drinking game among college students. They watched the show and every time a character said ""Hi, Bob,"" the next kid in line would have to chug-a-lug his beer. I certainly wouldn't want to live in Newhart's Land of Cockaigne either. It's all so demoniacally clean. There's no filth, not anywhere.<br/><br/>But it must be said, it's funny as hell, in the best sitcom tradition.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,15 May 2010
2449,The Bob Newhart Show, Button down world on TV,"Bob Newhart was one of the few stand up comics whose method has rarely been imitated.<br/><br/>He began his career by being more of an actor, in essence, as part of a conversation, but the conversation would always take place on a telephone.<br/><br/>The brilliance here is that his ""straight man"" could respond so matter-of-factly, and without outrage to the unheard voice on the other end of the phone, and the comedy was in realizing what the other person was saying.<br/><br/>Most of his comedy on his famous ""Button Down"" album involved phone calls, such a with Abe Lincoln and Abner Doubleday.<br/><br/>Here, he played off real people most of the time, but kept his usual straight routine. This meant that when he finally went home to his beautiful straight woman wife, the comedy would be from his explanations of his day, and from the intrusion of the lovable neighbor played by Bill Daily, who played the charismatic friend of astronaut Tony Nelson on another show.<br/><br/>The comedy would flow very evenly, and then erupt with some hilarity usually based on something that happened earlier.<br/><br/>His group therapy provided some great laughter, and foretold the success of later TV comedy ""Dear John"". In one show, his band of patients who met in group therapy found themselves characters in a play, written by a fellow member. At first, they hated the play, then after a production, they loved it.<br/><br/>This was a very funny show, and very timeless.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,9.0,12 February 2013

I think it was a bit funnier and never got as strange as did ""Newhart"" near the end of its also very successful run. I am kind of stunned to see that it was the longer running series of the two. They both have something in common and that is Bob playing a straight man to a bunch of strange situations. His reactions are always priceless whether he is in a session because he is a psychiatrist, or he is picking up the phone and doing one of his saying things that make you really wonder what is going on, on the other end of the phone. The characters that Bob has surrounding him are great too as they are made up of his wife Emily, his next door neighbor, his secretary and his dentist friend at work. Not to mention the strange assortment of patients that frequent his office such as the always fun Mr. Carlin. Just an all around funny show that works on so many levels, a lot of real winners among the shows as well. Like the time Bob and Emily are arguing about his wanting to watch Monday Night Football or his ordering Chinese for Thanksgiving day dinner.

By the time the series was over, not only was everyone aware of the talent of Jack Riley, but Peter Bonerz, &amp; Marcia Wallace had also become known to fans. Bill Daley here just kept expanding on his role as an odd airline pilot which was a little different than being an astronaut of I Dream of Jeannie, but here Daley is more subdued &amp; fits in nicely.<br/><br/>Susanne Pleshett is Emily, a wife who fits in well too.

Long before he hit it big in TV, his LPs (remember them?) were hot sellers.

Newhart is still funny (watch him deadpan his way through Elf with Will Farrel) but his earlier TV shows really sparkled.

2470,Deep State, Decent but ruined by a lot of unbelievable events,"The show is decent but not a believable spy thriller. There are some events that ruin it<br/><br/>1.) A low-level British intelligence officer orders the murder of a French woman and her two small children. If such an action occurred and later became to light, it would cause a political crisis of extreme proportions. Why go to such extremes risks when you could have ordered your agents to sneak into the house and steal the USB drive.<br/><br/>2.) The operation in Iran is clearly an American operation, why is it a British assassination team in Iran. This is not very believable. If the team had been caught in Iran, conducting what are 'Acts-of-War', that is probably just what the British government would get is a war with Iran. It might be believable that the British might lend some support to an American team operating in Iran.<br/><br/>3.) Why is killing people the solution to every problem in the show? I suspect that orders to kill people are taken at a very high level in intelligence organizations with consultations with the political establishments. Killing foreign nationals in their home country is certainly one of the last options used. The risks are just too great.<br/><br/>4.) One of the British agents, Harry, would stick out like a sore thumb. White as can be and clean shaven.

Then, they involve the Gendarmerie Nationale as a diversion. Gendarmes arrive at the country estate where they are welcomed by UK armed henchmen.

If one studies cults and how they lure in followers, and how they manipulate them into buying into their ideas and eventually losing touch with their own sense of reality, self determinism and free-will, the Path brings all of that out into the open. Sometimes it is actually painful to watch if you have ever known someone, especially someone close to you, who has been caught in the maws of a cult. Moreover, the producers did a great job of showing just how such a cult as The Path, can hide behind the mantle of religiosity, and using peer pressure, and more importantly, peer-mentality, cover up all manner of abuses, violations of human rights and corruption. Although the characters, in some cases, appear to be extreme, it can only be said that until one has experienced the reality of life inside the inner sanctum of a cult, that it is hard to believe that people can become, literally, another person altogether once they have turned over their loyalty to the cult.

The Path begins with Eddie already suspicious of his faith, following an encounter with a defector and his own personal revelations about the group's leadership following a trip to a healing center in Peru. In the episodes that follow, a great deal of the dialogue centers on his uncertainty in relation to whether or not to defect himself. It's a big decision, to be sure, but the writing offers little in the way of nuance or original ideas each time Eddie is volleyed back and forth between the spiritual and philosophical certainty of Meyerism and the depressing yet liberating instability of ""the real world."" The Path is unfortunately content to focus on a variety of rote melodramatic byways that give little insight into the fight between faith and personal desire, or the psychological relief and societal bliss that believers expect from their chosen religions.",64 out of 92 found this helpful.,,30 March 2016
2487,The Path, Show is great when approached with a philosophical view.,"This show is great. If you just don't think of it from a religious stand point, you'll get it. Seems to be about people with moral and unmoral things that cause conflictions, major burdens, community issues, unsolved emotions and those who are insecure wanting something more to believe in more than anything. Gave it a 9, maybe would be an 10, if new episodes wouldn't show previous situations that was not envovled in last episodes. Showing new unseen footage at the beginning of new episodes as if we saw them in details previously makes for confusion. Can't wait to see what happens with Eddie in the near future. Great characters, great acting, great script and a sort of slow burner with cliffhangers. Probably better as binge worthy if impatient.",19 out of 24 found this helpful.,9.0,21 March 2017

2489,The Path, It's the little things,"Life in the cult is organic, harmonic, healthy, self-contained, and rational. The women wear simple cotton clothes, sensible footwear, and no makeup; the men are supportive. The writers and directors are doing a good job after 3 episodes of creating a world of ""Meyerists"" who use tools, workshops, sessions, incantations, programs, life on a compound, gatherings, etc. to nurture their wacky beliefs in a spiritual ""Ladder"" to ""the Garden."" <br/><br/>But while the major characters and plot lines are convincing, someone isn't trying hard enough on those throwaway scenes in any show that reflect attention to detail and a commitment to veracity and nuance. Things get eye-rollingly overt when some Meyerists wearing emblazoned t-shirts go preaching in a park and hook 3 people in a single afternoon. We see them nudge a firm-minded young woman out of her book and into their world in a few sentences. A local reporter is virtually converted on-air after a few minutes with one of the cult leaders, whose blathering wouldn't pass the smell test with anyone over the age of 12. <br/><br/>When we're introduced to the FBI, we establish the setting via two agents gossiping, literally at a water cooler (woops, it's a coffee machine, but close). ""Hey, did you hear? Snyder was transferred to Terrorism."" ""Really? Snyder was transferred to Terrorism?"" ""Yeah, Snyder was transferred to Terrorism."" ""It's too bad that Snyder was transferred to Terrorism, because Snyder isn't the brightest bulb."" The directors could benefit from watching a few episodes of ""The Office.""<br/><br/>The dinner-at-my-house scene where a 15-year-old girl tries to lure a Meyerist boy with a bite of steak (Meyerists apparently being committed vegetarians) is just annoying. ""Come on,"" the girl teases, repeatedly poking a forkful at his mouth. The mother cheerfully eggs on her rude, silly daughter, and the boy confusedly eats meat for the first time in his life. Oh, and he likes it.<br/><br/>What would real people do in these situations? How does life really look? When I was going to UCLA, the same Scientologist occupied the same corner on Westwood Boulevard all day every day for 8 years, and I never saw anyone buy his books on Dianetics or exchange two words with him. When you invite someone over to your house for dinner, do you find out what their dietary religious restrictions are and then serve that very thing? <br/><br/>There are too many examples of this sort of thing to go over here, so I'll just restate, the creators need to get on their craft and quit sacrificing psychological veracity for convenience.",65 out of 107 found this helpful.,5.0,9 April 2016
2490,The Path, Would be better just as one season,"I only want to watch full shows before I review them and that badly hurt this show. The first season was very intriguing and interesting but it drops off big time and loses it's way. It's about a family that lives on a religious complex that seems pretty cult like. Eddie (Aaron Paul) married into the family and is starting to lose his faith. He's struggling with some parts of the religion that seem a little off. It was dealing with that and the families response to his loss of faith. That was super interesting and intriguing as it seemed there were some dark secrets regarding the creating of the religion. If they would have found a good way to wrap it up it would have been great. That said they went a weird way and made Eddie the leader of the faith eventually. Then the mom is the one losing her faith and the son and everyone basically and they all flip flop back and forth. And that's basically the show for two seasons until something big does happen at the end of season 3. It was clearly cancelled as a lot of lose ends weren't tied up but they did that to themselves. Also I loved the acting in season one and it fell off big time to me, especially Aaron Paul.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,6.0,27 June 2018
2491,The Path," I've given up half way through season 2, very lazy writing.","Season 1 was OK with some brilliant moments in between. Until the end of season when there were some illogical behaviours (aka assigning an event to a character not bothering to make it believable)... But all in all it was OK.<br/><br/>Season 2 went downhill very very fast. It's become obvious that they have no idea what they are doing and how to develop characters. They are just throwing stuff at us that make no sense half the time. This in turn undoes the characters believability. The series are supposed to be a drama and all about why people does this and that... But what I see is people just doing random stuff... It's very lazy script writing and not even the actors can help it any more. They gave it a good try but there is just so much they can do with what they are given.<br/><br/>Where I left it was also very obvious they want to keep things mysterious and undefined in order to make the show last longer. It's also obvious that when they have no plot they just create some situation/conflict without giving it much thought to (try) distract and entertain (poorly) the viewer.<br/><br/>I fear they will drag on until canceled and everyone who stuck with it in hopes to reach a conclusion will be disappointed. And that's why I just gave up. I have no wish to see the characters devolve more and more into the ridiculous, knowing I'll probably never get any satisfying ending. IF this ends not being canceled and feedback about its ending is positive I MIGHT come back to it.

I find it absolutely riveting.<br/><br/>""Meyerism"" is sort of a mix of Scientology and a hippie commune. The central character is Eddie, who joined the cult when it helped to straighten out his life. He's been a star pupil, but is starting to have doubts.

2493,The Path, rocky narrative flow,"Meyerism is a new age movement founded by Dr. Stephen Meyer back in the 70's viewed by the outside world as a cult. Its main concept is to climb a ladder to the top to receive the universal truth. Cal Roberts (Hugh Dancy) is an ambitious leader of the movement. Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) is a committed Meyerist married to doubting Eddie Lane (Aaron Paul). Their teen son Hawk (Kyle Allen) struggles to find his place. Mary Cox (Emma Greenwell) is saved by the Meyerists after a tornado and becomes infatuated with Cal. There are old guards, seeds of doubt, suspicion, and deceit as the movement faces challenges from outside and within. Rockmond Dunbar is an undercover FBI agent in the first two seasons and the show is cancelled after three seasons.<br/><br/>The first season promises some interesting intrigue within a secret society. The leading trio are all terrific actors and the characters are fascinating. It starts a little rocky. There are narrative issues but the great actors are always compelling. The second season adds its own issues. I really dislike the water plot device. I appreciate the purpose of it but I don't like the side road it takes the show onto. This is a show of intriguing potential and good actors. It does struggle to maintain the narrative at times. The triad leads probably diffuses the protagonist intensity.

2494,The Path," Good, even with the flaws","As a couple who got out of a cult like scenario ourselves, my husband and I like certain aspects of this show and dislike others. Having been in a similar situation with a ""religion"", we relate to the two main characters a lot. However, there's various details about the show that irritate us on a logical level. Certain decisions characters make simply don't make sense at times if we are to believe they really are/were super into ""the movement"". Certain scenes don't make sense with the flow of the show too (especially a few of the random sex scenes in random places - and that's coming from people who are not offended by sex scenes, these ones just happened to be very weird in terms of placement in the show). Overall, the various plot lines and characters are gripping enough to carry the show and hold your attention, flaws and all. I see this as a mid to high 6 when compared to other shows we enjoy and rounded it up.

2495,The Path, Breathing and whispering,"This is a TV-series that I particularly find interesting, as I was in a cult briefly in my youth. <br/><br/>It's about the lives of the members of a religious movement, where they have a clear set of rules for their lives and rituals at certain times and places. <br/><br/>They aren't forced to stay, but if they choose to leave, they'll be shunned. <br/><br/>So for me, that's just life in a cult. <br/><br/>However. This series could be really great. It has the feel of something interesting and good. It has the secrets and odd behavior, and that's really something to build on. <br/><br/>However. The actors have a few issues, that I believe is the directors fault completely. The actors aren't bad, you know? <br/><br/>But I can tell that someone is standing there telling them to breath heavily. Some of the characters, like Cal, the evil conniving leader, seem to have a huge problem with his breathing. It's short and noisy and takes away from what he is supposed to say. And it's all the time. ALL THE TIME. It's that short gulps of air that he takes, whenever he is in a scene, no matter if he is supposed to be calm, sexy, aggressive, no matter, he breaths like a mad cow on the way to slaughter. It's taking over. <br/><br/>Some of the other actors are doing this too, so hence my conclusion that it isn't their fault, but instead the people in the side-lines. <br/><br/>And then there are the whispering voices. Again - it's way too often, that these people are talking to each other in this whispering voices. What is it with that? And the sense of urgency, in every little situation. Even in cults, people speak to each other quite normally. Normal voices, calm voices, sometimes loud and funny and a little bit crazy, no matter, people have normal voices. They do not speak with that whispering tone to each other. It makes the whole show ridiculous to me. <br/><br/>So there are three issues: 1. Heavy breathing 2. A sense of urgency which is completely weird and crazy 3. Whispering voices. <br/><br/>I wish that the director had a brain. Then this show could be awesome.",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,4.0,16 April 2017

I like that the story starts light and at first glance you will be like, OK these nice people are all living together like a hippie community, nothing wrong with that. Then the next move is watching the main character Eddie, doubt the path and slowly but surely figuring out that he is not part of a movement but rather cult. The whole story is slow but intense. I like that the series is taking it's time to show different members and how the cult function. If you are into cults and religions you will like this TV series.

BTW who nips a full joint and tosses it out the window. If I had to see one more white picket fence shot... I get it - it is the American Dream distorted.

2499,The Path," Started very well, then simply exhausted itself.","I binge-watched this from beginning to end (s02 e13). I was fascinated at the beginning, learning the story of this particular ""movement"". The entire first season developed well, was entertaining, suspenseful, and I looked forward to each new episode. Things were revealed and the actors portrayed the characters well. It was a pleasure to see Aaron Paul again; this even seemed like an adult version of Jesse Pinkman. His Eddie has a mysterious past and some of his emotional reactions reminded me of his former character. It was believable and things were moving along well.<br/><br/>Then came season 2. As it progressed, problems with the story and actors emerged. Cal was the worst, and I thought his portrayal unraveled when I noticed that he reacted the same way to every situation. A scene opens, Cal sees or learns something, and we see panic and a brain moving almost out of control. Even when he states a fact he seems to lie. I don't understand how these people could trust &amp; follow him. All his head and eye movements screamed DECEPTION, in every scene and situation. It would have been more authentic if the actor had added some variety to his character; even just a wee bit of development would have been applauded. But man, he could have seamlessly stepped from the pilot episode to the season 2 finale in the same workday. You could wind him up like a toy robot and there he would go, head jerking about, eyes avoiding &amp; searching, stammering, etc. It got real old.<br/><br/>Ditto for Eddie. At first, I understood his character and how he played him. Season 2, though, it seemed that he had the same facial reactions in just about every situation. Good news, bad news, nice conversation, threatening conversion, and we got the same thing. Opens his mouth a little, rolls his tongue into his lower cheek, turns his head, looks down, looks up, then utters some disappointing line. Episode after episode of this. You could turn it into a drinking game. Will he look up or down after sticking his tongue in his cheek and turning his head?<br/><br/>After interesting developments in season one, season two started telling us circular stories. All the main characters went through some stressing event or situation; they changed, the story turned, then somehow they're right back in their original ""configuration"". Sarah was the worst. Her motivations &amp; feelings would change almost from scene to scene. She trusts Eddie, she hates him. She trusts Cal, she can't believe what he did, trusts him again, turns to Eddie, back to Cal, etc. Some scenes I couldn't understand why she was frowning instead of smiling. I'm not spoiling anything here. It gets difficult to follow because it appears that the characters, their motivations, their subsequent actions, are almost random. Did the script writers draw all these things blindly out of a bowl? I had to consult a TV script service to make sense of certain scenes. Why, why, why? Hawks feelings toward Eddie lack logic and are on a merry-go-round. You never know what you'll get.<br/><br/>Lastly, if this is a movement based on truth, transparency, and The Light, why are people cussing so profusely? Are they members of a faith movement or drunks in a pool hall? There are so many lies among these people you'd think they were double-agents involved in counter- espionage. Why would any ""believer"" fall for their numb explanations of odd events? And it didn't get better. When the loopy lunacy mercifully ended with episode 13, I was relieved. Not because anything plot-wise was resolved or satisfied, but because I need at least a year's break before considering watching a subsequent episode.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,6.0,1 June 2017

Has to be different writers. It's like the first season writing was replaced with a team whose only experience is in bad soap operas. SO disappointing.
The premise, story line development, characters/casting/acting were all amazingly well done Season One. Totally hooked.
Then Season 2: starts to come in with too many side stories, never going back to develop/conclude/weave into the rest of the story line..then characters begin to display neuroses by alternating between their previous development and then behaving perplexingly out of character. This is NOT the same thing as developing a nuanced character; the series HAD managed to pull this off in a stellar way Season One. 
Then all the story lines became overlaid with a healthy dose of tawdry American soap opera on top of it..we the viewer left needing a pad of paper and pen to jot down all the inconsistencies, 180's, unexplained terms left hanging between characters, only to change with no explanation...UGH.

2502,The Path," Some good spots, some eye-roll","I love Aaron Paul - he is brilliant, and I think he does a good job here; sometimes he seems too intense, casting nearly everyone else into shadow. He doesn't pass muster as someone who has a 16 year old, however, because he is just too youthful.<br/><br/>Dancy is creepy, as he should be - you suspect there is something else lurking there and Monaghan is good, although her character is predictably a bit flat.<br/><br/>The show however, feels sloppy. There is a tornado in NH, (which is really rare), and it feels very staged. The woman with the wailing baby, the frenetic young woman who drinks wiper washer fluid because she craves water, but the tornado just happened, so the timing seems off. Then the young woman steps on top of a pile of boxes and planters that *happen* to be arranged like steps to the top of a shipping container. Remember, this is after a tornado, when everything else is thrown around and cars are overturned.<br/><br/>There are also some odd but important things that aren't explained. At least of the followers live off the compound,yet the cult seems insular. More than a few of the scenes, (like where the recruits are trying to convert people on the street), are overly simplistic and not believable. Paul's anguish over his vision in Peru is almost palpable; he appears like he is on the brink, and I wonder for a moment if he is sane. It's almost too much considering how average a lot of the rest of the show is.<br/><br/>Still it is interesting, and seems to combine some Scientology and Mormonism into a reasonably believable construct. I wish there was more depth, but perhaps that will come in time.

The character, Cal Roberts, is supposed to be a quasi-cult leader who is working up the ""rungs"" of the ladder. However they don't make him in to this charismatic, creepy guy. He doesn't hold me in the show as being a person who I would want to follow. He doesn't have it. In fact, ep7 is where I completely lost faith in the writers and director.<br/><br/>I'm sure the show will endure for another two or three seasons but the writers are just like every other writer today.

None of this meshed with his given back story. And the poor actress playing his police ""boss"" is not gifted enough to play his foil. I have no problem with his character being gay but come on, he practically skips &amp; chirps through some of these scenes.

2518,Instinct, couldn't finish the episode ( April 8th),"So one lone dressmaker moves a huge mirror, a fitting platform, and a white wedding dress with a train into the conference room at a police station and no ""detectives"" see her? Guess what? Police captains can take personal time during the day, and can go to the bridal shop (also the dressmaker would keep the shop open for a client to come in after hours). This is just one example of the ridiculous scenes included- supposedly so Lizzie can walk in (the door wasn't locked) and see her friend in her wedding dress and find out she isn't asking Lizzie to help with the friend's wedding planning. Then the friend can get all sensitive about the loss of Lizzie's fiancé. These episodes are written by men, or adolescent girls- adult women don't act this way. Okay- I should have known it was coming- this show is based on a James Patterson book and executive-produced by the co-author. Mr. Patterson fails.
 Then there are scenes to expound on other personal relationships, and the story gets short shrift (which it deserves- no wonder they re-used a subplot from ""Bones""- April 1st).

Cumming's and Ing's relationship comes across as genuine and caring, and with affection. I'm straight &amp; have three gay nephews, two with husbands, and I am tired of seeing their lifestyle trivialized by writers and directors who think Modern Family (I hate the show) is the model.

2520,Instinct, Terrible,"My eyes glaze over when I watch this show. I watched the first episode which was trying to promote so many politically correct agendas that it was ridiculous. Alan Cumming deserves a better show. There is a female detective, a very young female commander, and a female mayor. Cumming is a married, gay professor/ex CIA operative who is consulted by the female police detective. I guess this show wants to make all males besides Cumming inept and dumber than rocks. The first turn off was the male coroner who said there were too many stab wounds on a dead victim to count. Not because there was so much overlapping of wounds - just because there were so many! That is ludicrous. Then the female detective and Cumming make him count them. I think there were 50 in the show. That hardly qualifies as uncountable. They always count stab wounds and bullet holes in real life. Hey, let's make all the male supporting roles stupid. Next stupid male - the first detective on the scene of a crime assumes the victim is dead - he didn't want to touch her. In my city that would be grounds to be fired. Not checking and because of that not calling an ambulance? By this time I knew the show wasn't for me. There are already a lot of sitcoms making straight males look clueless. I am a female. I did watch episode two. The storyline was awful. They seem to be rushing through the murder investigations so that they have time to crowd in all these side stories. At times when Cumming was rushing to conclusions, I cringed. One side story would be okay but they seem to want multiple side stories in each episode. The writing is juvenile. It can not compare to the so- called retreads mentioned by other reviewers. I dont think it is a retread of those shows at all. That's an insult to shows like Monk and Murder She Wrote ( among others). i'm finished with it. It's boring. If I want to see people who are skilled at profiling and solving murders, I'll stick to Criminal Minds. I know Cumming has many fans which may bring in an audience for a while.

Joan suggests to Dylan that he needs to become active in the field again to regain his lost writers mojo.<br/><br/>So Dylan agrees to tag team with a young and pretty blonde detective named Lizzie Needham (Bojana Novakovic) and their on screen tag team magic is quite evident from the get go.

This particular serial killer murders each victim and at the murder scene the killer leaves one (1) of the fifty-two (52) poker playing cards to which Detective Needham and Dylan have to figure out the cards clue in solving the next murder before it happens<br/><br/>The TV series writers did more than an adequate job of keeping their audience in suspense and the on screen chemistry between actors Alan Cummings and Bojana Novakovic was very entertaining.

This show is far worse, because it copies so much of Bones, the entire production staff should be pilloried. Oddball ex-CIA paired with a less odd female detective, and I doubt either can get their shoes on the proper feet without assistance. I watched the first episode, and it was too campy for its inferior script, so I skipped episode two, and hoped by episode three it might have found its bearings. It's already been noted in another review that episode three of Instinct ripped off the plot of the murdered Amish boy, a piano prodigy, and it shamelessly plagiarizes the Bones script with a few very minor changes. I hope the screenwriters volunteered their inferior services, and the network wasn't stupid enough to actually pay for this tripe.

But she didn't do it to herself. They have some *bad* CGI effects on this show, from the house burning down in the opening sequence to the jet engine on fire to, yes, Kim Cattrall's face.

(the best scripted comedy series MTV has put out in the last four years and which I sadly suspect may be on its way off the air and into television oblivion once this new season is up).<br/><br/>Like everything else MTV, ""Faking It"" is comic, edgy trashiness of the first degree; in the 21st century, comic and edgy trashiness of the first degree is an absolute must for modern television programming, especially when it comes to MTV. And yet, like ""Awkward."" and ""Hard Times,"" there's something oddly compelling about it, even moving.<br/><br/>Because it's only the first episode, a brief synopsis should be sufficient: life-long best friends - the social-climbing, un-ironically named Karma Ashcroft (Katie Stevens) and her gal-pal, the cynical, straight-laced Amy Raudenfeld (Rita Volk) - are a pair of desperate wannabes looking to fit into their liberal-minded, open and socially accepting Austin, Texas, high school, where even they appear to be outsiders desperately looking to join in on the club.<br/><br/>Before you know it, a series of misunderstandings and innuendos unexpectedly propels both girls into the celebrity limelight, where they are mistakenly ""outed"" as, and thus decide to pretend to be, lesbians, much to the satisfaction of the openly gay king bee Shane Harvey (Michael Willett), and the detriment of their mutual nemesis and resident mean girl/wannabe queen bee Lauren Cooper (Bailey Buntain), who is also Amy's new step-sister.<br/><br/>My impression from this first episode is that ""Faking It"" looks quite promising. ""Faking It"" looks to be an inspired take on the lengths we'll go to ""fake it"" in order to just fit in, bullying, intolerance, and 21st-century political-correctness. This goes to show that like ""Awkward."" and ""The Hard Times of RJ Berger,"" and just because it's MTV, it may not be as dumb as it appears to be at first.<br/><br/>To their credit, and to our amazement, ""Faking It"" looks to do the impossible, and that is to be a scripted MTV teen comedy series that actually says something about our 21st-century perceptions of tolerance and acceptance (that it's even saying something at all is a magical feat in and of itself).<br/><br/>Things are looking good, so far...<br/><br/>8/10",36 out of 49 found this helpful.,8.0,23 April 2014

Telling a story about someone that could be unsure of their sexuality because of loving someone just not knowing exactly what type of love they have for that person it just happens to start by 2 girls pretending to be gay. Also, the main characters in the show just seem like very real very like able characters. They seem to be two teenagers going through the real life issues just like I said a few more quirky issues then the average high schooler.

2565,Faking It, Two sides of the same coin,"This series is still in its second episode and I find it quite enjoyable, but I don't know whether I should be outraged by it or not.<br/><br/>On one hand, I feel like it could be an attempt at representing the LGBTQIA community (or at least homosexuals) in a show that feels light and portrays an acceptant society; on the other, I fear it might be just exploiting an under-represented group to create humorous situations. <br/><br/>The series itself is fun, its fast pace and short episodes are quite successful at catching one's attention and the situations the characters are put in are a mix of uniqueness (due to the alternative setting they find themselves in) and typicality of teenage drama shows.<br/><br/>Considering the girls are neither actively lesbians (at the beginning, at least - Karma is probably bisexual, Amy COULD be a lesbian), nor too familiar with the queer community, the misconceptions seem to be justifiable, but it worries me that people who don't have considerable understanding of queerness might take them as true.<br/><br/>The story has a lot of potential to become an inspiration to teenagers who are struggling with their sexual identities, but it needs to be developed with caution, considering our society isn't as acceptable as the girls' school.",23 out of 34 found this helpful.,8.0,3 May 2014

2567,Faking It, Excellent!!,"Faking It is amazing at start , It's interesting funny, arousing and most off all heart warming. lesbian ruse clearly won't carry the show forever. That's okay, because other stories are also going on at this weird alt-high school. Mean girl Lauren (Bailey Buntain) gets no traction here. ""In any other school in Texas, I would rule,"" she accurately grumbles. Hester's rulers include Shane (Michael Willett), a comedy-focused version of Kurt on ""Glee."" ""Faking It'' starts off sounding gimmicky and ends up being rather sweet. In a good way. Amy (Rita Volk) and Karma (Katie Stevens) are besties at Hester High School in Austin, Tex., which rewards rebellion rather than conformity. Amy and Karma are harmlessly anonymous, a situation Karma burns to change. So when a series of offhand random remarks gets them tagged as lesbians, Karma persuades Amy to go along. They have a brand! They're popular! The plan creates a few dilemmas, of course. Like how to parlay their new popularity into, say, a boyfriend when it's contingent on their not being interested in boys. Yet many of the fundamental things still apply. Parents are oblivious and barely tolerable. Prom matters. There's still nothing like a hunky guy, in this case Liam (Gregg Sulkin). ""Faking It"" also has cartoonish moments. It is, after all, a comedy.But beyond the joke, the show's premise is encouraging: that being gay is no big deal. Besides, that isn't what ""Faking It"" is really about. The engine driving this show is female friendship, the kind strong enough I absolutely love this brand new show I hope everyone will to.",14 out of 23 found this helpful.,,23 April 2014

I think anyone who is a TV Buff should definitely just try it. The acting is fairly good too. I liked it cause it made something so unoriginal (highschool TV) original in the way it was made.

2569,Faking It, Hoping This Show's Potential Is Realized,"You know those shows about teens where every conversation is spoken with urgency, like everything is a matter of life or death? This is one of those. Not that teens don't talk like that, sometimes they do, especially when in groups. But how about when every conversation sounds like a collection of one-liners, as if the writers don't know how to tune it down? It can be tiresome. (Suburgatory"" manages to pull it off in my opinion.) And the characters can ring false when the language they use is more mature than the language of teens. In the first episode, the language seems too political, with references to communism and socialism. The anti-Republican stance of this episode was the most distracting and annoying. I am neither Republican nor Democrat, but it feels dishonest to politicize the language of teens. <br/><br/>Still, ""Faking It"" does have a certain charm. The two main characters, Amy and Karma, are likable. And they are desperate to fit in and, better yet, to be popular--a dream many can identify with. They decide to go along with the misconception that they are a lesbian couple, because that impression makes them instant celebrities. What happens when you sacrifice your integrity for popularity? Will their dishonesty come back to haunt the appropriately named Karma and her friend, Amy? <br/><br/>The comedy of the first episode does sometimes swipe at low-hanging fruit, notably the annoying nature of parents, who tend to be irrelevant and ""abnormal"". And the use of bleeping and pixelation to give the show an edge feels cheap. It would be better to air the show later and not self-censor, but that is probably not possible, so we will have to settle.<br/><br/>I am adopting a wait-and-see attitude with this show, hoping that the writers reveal some relevant and deeper truths about self-acceptance and social tolerance. And I also hope they take advantage of Karma's singing talent (Katie Stevens was on ""American Idol"") and Lauren's dance skills (Bailey Buntain was in the cast of ""Bunheads"").<br/><br/>I also hope the show takes us into the homes of these students, where they are truly themselves and not just the personas they adopt while in school. Then the characters might have depth. The writers might also want to throw in a sympathetic adult character occasionally--just for the sake of verisimilitude.",13 out of 29 found this helpful.,6.0,23 April 2014
2570,Faking It, It was violently not for me.,"I'm not sure why i watched it, i guess i thought i was giving new things a chance?<br/><br/>It ticks a fair amount of the boxes in my 'things i hate about television' area.<br/><br/>Its highly derivative, from the ""now the uncool people are actually the cool people and none of classically cool people can grasp why"" routine, which is a prevalent theme in the 2012 movie 21 jump street, to the characters which are all extremely exaggerated and defined by one loud attribute: The 'gay' guy is gay, the cute boy is a cute boy, the 'mean girls' stepsister is a 'mean girl'. They are all one-dimensional plot devices intended to push the story and humour along inorganically. <br/><br/>I honestly didn't get passed the house party 10 minutes in, maybe they drove home some deep introspective parable at the end that would validate watching people condense and simplify the complexities of teenage life into caricatures we've seen from a hundred different and less tedious sources before, but i couldn't get there. The plot is probably the most obvious of any show i've seen this year, no one notices us, they then think we're cool because of a lie, lets continue the lie and maintain our status even though its clear at some point in the future we will be ousted as frauds and face some form of backlash. <br/><br/>They are vanilla girls that are apparently unpopular despite being attractive and healthy with decent aesthetics, in the most welcome and inviting environment you can imagine, and they go to school with several thousand hipsters that manage to have a hierarchy of popularity based on not caring about your popularity, homogenising their clicks by being ""alternative"" together. <br/><br/>Let me just say, i'm not the target audience, i shouldn't have watched this show its not meant for me and i'm sure its actually pretty interesting if you're into teen highschool television, or feel like popularity is an important social factor in your lives. I'd rather squeeze lemons into a pool filled with broken glass and do a 'bomb' dive into it from a 10 meter springboard than watch this ever again, but it might be someone else's cup of tea.",27 out of 73 found this helpful.,3.0,23 April 2014
2571,Faking It, Surprised Me Pleasantly In The End (First Impression From The Pilot).,"When I first heard about this show I thought that it would be highly offensive and a bit ridiculous, having watched it I must admit that they were some sexist moments like when one of the girls stated that ""guys love lesbians"" and ""watch some porn"", but then again, some people honestly believe things like these, and I have to admit I've heard a lot of people in High School saying things pretty close to these. The whole being queer is cool sounded very stupid, and to say the least, ironic, when gay people get rejected and bullied just because of their sexuality. The world might have become more accepting, but then again to be a homosexual in High School doesn't seem like such fun. Anyway, as you probably know there are two girls, who are best friends and they desperately want to fit in and become popular, well at least one of them, blah-blah, they are mistakenly taken as a couple and all of a sudden everybody knows them, admires and worships them. It may seem like a silly teen drama, but if you really think about it people nowadays do tend to start being all accepting to show how open- minded they are... I know it sounds stupid, but if you watch this with a touch of humor and decide to look into it in a positive manner I don't think it'll leave you that disappointed in the end... After all, there is an obvious little twist which I'm sure will make things a bit more interesting.",7 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,24 April 2014

2573,Faking It, Incredibly endearing show,"MTV seems to make a business model of carving out niches. In the 90s when teen dramas were sweet, fairly straight edge affairs, MTV came out with darker, edgier content such as Beavis &amp; Butthead. Now in the age where mainstream TV studios are desperate to make shows as dark &amp; gritty as possible, MTV has gone the other way by creating incredibly sweet &amp; endearing shows such as this &amp; Awkward.<br/><br/>The show follows two teens who fake a lesbian relationship to increase their popularity / notoriety in their local school, until sparks fly when they kiss to prove the relationship is real to their peers, and one falls head over heels for the other. What follows is how she handles her unrequited feelings whilst her friend attempts to get with the popular boy in the school.

Karma is desperate to be popular and maintains the ruse. Karma is straight and pining for hunky Liam Booker (Gregg Sulkin). On the other hand, Amy is discovering her sexuality and her attraction to Karma. Opposing them is Amy's self-obsessed righteous step-sister Lauren Cooper (Bailey De Young).<br/><br/>This has an appealing young cast. The characters are fun. The premise is digging into serious issues but at times, it threatens to treat it in less-than-serious ways. The best part continues to be the friendship of Karma and Amy. Lauren is a hilarious villain until she softened her edge later on. There is a good group of friends here.

2577,Faking It, Very unexpected,"This is my first review for IMDb. <br/><br/>I started watching the series as a bit of light entertainment. I wasn't expecting much considering that it was an MTV presentation. That the characters were charming, the story compelling, and the acting excellent. Moreover there was a certain believability about it which was very surprising considering the content. The first season was fairly light hearted and I watched it a couple of times. The 20 minute episodes really helped. At first I was quite skeptical of the format, but it turns out that it suits the contents perfectly.<br/><br/>The second half of the second series basically from episode 4 onward is really TV gold. The characters come into their own. They really take control of what I'm trying to convey in this story. And compelling drama ensues...<br/><br/>And just when you thought you understood where the story was going the final episode throws a curve ball. You really have to watch it all.<br/><br/>I'm going to give it a 9/10 just because in the future they may, just may be a 20 minute short format TV drama better than this.

It's a slap in the face for anyone struggling with coming out, or just, you know, being themselves, whether straight, gay, or anything beyond that. Oh, and don't even get me started on the disgusting sexist undertones. Well, undertones would be more subtle. Is this normal for people nowadays? I'm afraid, for many, it might be. Calling women bossy, the wonderful comment about ""I don't even like looking at my own vagina"", and so on... - What kind of people write for television nowadays?

The string of murders has the police interested and they have a team trying to identify the culprit. The police investigations and drug war also put Helena in the firing line.

We should be empathetic towards Helena / Hache but while she's not a dislikeable character she is actually quite bland. There's no other characters worth supporting, except maybe the cop Vinuesa but he's also rather dull.<br/><br/>To top it off, production values are not that great.

I demand that this programme be removed from telly at once and replaced with programmes that are truly representative of the glories of British humour, such as Keeping Up Appearances and the BBC World News.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Col. Arthur von Gambolputty-Dinsdale of Ulm (deceased) <br/><br/>(Warning: This letter does not reflect the true feelings of the reviewer, who is a huge fan of Python and thinks that the above-mentioned gripes are the very reason that the show is awesome. The comedy still holds up after over 35 years, though several of the costumes and haircuts do not, and the mixture of zany oddball non sequiters, intellectual references and satires, and ingenious physical comedy makes Python something very special and unique.

Great writing that walks that fine line between genius and silly, and meshes the two.  These guys also knew when and how to start end a sketch.

2602,Monty Python's Flying Circus, Monty Python's and their unique brand of humor,"A gentleman (John Cleese) enters a pet shop and wants to register a complaint that the parrot that he had bought from that very boutique just half an hour ago was in fact a 'dead parrot'. The owner (Michael Palin) tries to convince him that the Parrot, a Norwegian Blue, was not really dead and was just resting. The argument continues and gets sillier and sillier until an army colonel (Graham Chapman) pops out of nowhere and stops the sketch abruptly because it was getting very silly. If this kind of humor doesn't interest you, read no further and plan on watching something else. But if it does and if you have not seen Monty Pythons Flying Circus you haven't seen nothing yet.<br/><br/>Monty pythons pretty much invented and perfected their unique brand of humor which can be categorized as 'surreal'. One can argue that 'the Goon Show' was the archetype for Monty pythons, which is true, but then Monty Pythons took it to territories that had never been explored before. They created a world where you can get a government grant for silly walks or buy an argument in an argument clinic. A world in which a father and son could have the age old ""romantic vs. a simple coal miner"" argument, just that in this world the son is a regular coal miner whereas it's the father whose head is full of useless novels and poems. Just like the Beatles they took something and created something completely new out of it. The comparison is valid because Monty Pythons at their peak enjoyed the status of any of the rock stars in those days (including groupies) and the Beatles, George Harrison in particular, were their biggest promoters.<br/><br/>Terri Gillian's stream of consciousness art work is pretty bizarre and holds all the sketches together. John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Terry Jones play all the characters (including women's) themselves with dead seriousness. This is insane humor at it's brilliant best.",38 out of 43 found this helpful.,,7 September 2005
2603,Monty Python's Flying Circus," even when you think you know all of what the show is about, a surprise comes round the bend","I still need to see more of Monty Python's Flying Circus to make my un-official official declamatory mandated professional amateurish stated opinion on this, but this is quite the nifty little show they put on back in merry old England. A lame joke I tried for at Python humor, but really, once you see the show, and see at least a few episodes, you'll know whether it's the right kind of intelligently un-hinged absurdity for you. I didn't warm up to it at first, I thought it was maybe too smart, in a way, through its silliness to be taken much seriously, as the jokes are not of the common kind. But after getting in through the films, and seeing many a varied skit with the guys, I'm looking forward to seeing (and being able to quote to other people) the best they got.<br/><br/>It's partly a stream-of-consciousness style show thanks to Terry Gilliam's spectacularly crude animations (through cut-outs mostly, and spoofing either classical paintings, architecture, movies, and of course dancing teeth), part social satire through various skits of people going into shops (Parrot), jobs, arguments (want to argue about an argument), the police, criminals, movies, sports, old ladies, politics, and other sorts of good diddies on all things in life. There's also the most random bits of comedy ever to come out of the 20th century, and I can only think of the basic things that might have you wanting to check it out. I love short skits, like the classic fish-slapping bit (there comes the BIG fish, heh), and over-the-top voices (Michael Palin, I think, does some of the best ones, like an introduction he does to a skit that reminded me of one of the voices in the Holy Grail trailer), and deranged costumes, and the richness of the silly dialog. Sure a skit might not hit the mark, but then I could them come back to it days later and be laughing about things not laughed at the first time around. <br/><br/>There aren't too many, if much at all, conventional punchlines- the brilliant stuff comes in the random barbs that shoot up in the lines and the deliver, in a look that Cleese or Chapman might give at one point or another, or the lack of something that ends up coming around later in the bit, or maybe not. There's absolutely no shame in how tasteless some of this can get, be it with topical issues or just the little things everyday we tend to take for granted, but a tasteless sensibility without any net to fall on that's appealing. And, of course, the Lumberjack song and ministry of silly walks and . Bottom line, if there could ever be one with Flying Circus, if you think it's just stupid little goofy gags and skits going on, watch out for how rich the words fly out (err, in Circus-like fashion) the mouths of the Pythons. It's the mightiest heap of the inspiration-turned-ludicrous comedy to be found on any TV show. Other favorite skits: 'Most Awful Family in Britain', 'Self-Defence Class', 'Word Problem', and 'Kilimanjaro Expedition' among others.",23 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,24 November 2006
2604,Monty Python's Flying Circus, The First 'Alternative Comedy' Show?,"I loved 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' as a youngster, even though, strange as it may seem now, I used to be frightened by it. Unlike say 'The Frost Report', the show was not actually about anything. Each episode had the look and feel of a nightmare; we saw terrible sights such as heads lopped off with razors, people puking their guts out, ten-ton weights falling on people, and human brains consumed with spoons. It was a brave person who stayed up late to watch this show. Characters would often cross over into different sketches, such a knight who kept hitting people with a rubber chicken, and 'The Colonel' who demanded items be terminated if they were too silly.<br/><br/>The Pythons, as if you did not know, were John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, and Eric Idle. It was an inspired collection for a comedy team; Cleese and Chapman were good at sketches in which there was lots of verbal abuse, Palin and Jones excelled at items which sent up film genres, Gilliam provided some disturbing animations, while Idle contributed well-written skits involving word play.<br/><br/>In the first season, each episode opened with a bedraggled Palin emerging either from the sea or jungle to issue the following warning: ""Its..."". Flowers would then climb the screen, their petals opening to reveal the name of the show, to the strains of 'Liberty Bell' by Souza. The very first show kicked off with a sketch in which a city gent ( Jones ) asks a Yokel farmer ( Chapman ) just what his sheep are doing up in the trees. The farmer says that they have realised that their lives consist of standing around and waiting to be eaten, so they have decided to do something about it. We then cut to two Frenchmen ( Palin and Cleese ) in berets who demonstrate the commercial possibilities of flying sheep. From the reaction of the audience, its clear they are baffled rather than amused. 'Python' took time to catch on, but when it did, the public could not get enough of it.<br/><br/>Season 2 is generally thought of as the best. 'The Ministry Of Silly Walks', 'The Spanish Inquisition', 'The Piranha Brothers', and 'The Semaphore Version Of 'Wuthering Heights' originated here. Clips of the show were regularly requested on 'Ask Aspel', a children's show hosted by Michael Aspel.<br/><br/>After two excellent seasons and a movie, plus a couple of fun German specials, 'Python' went into decline, and John Cleese's departure was the final nail in the coffin. Season 4 was the last. Fortunately, the team reunited to make movies which, if anything, were funnier than the show, particularly 'Life Of Brian' ( 1979 ). The last one - 'The Meaning Of Life' ( 1983 ) ended with a clip of the title sequence of the very first television show, taking 'Python' full circle. Chapman's death in 1989 closed the door on Python for good. A brief reunion in 1999 - 'Python Night' - was a disaster, with Eddie Izzard unwisely trying to stand-in for the deceased star.<br/><br/>I must squeeze in a quick mention of lovely Carol Cleveland, with whom I was madly in love in the early '70's.

Almost every little sketch takes such bizarre twists and turns into something completely else that you'll literally never see it coming.

Often serving as transitions, but really this is just one side-splittingly funny compilation of sheer absurdity.<br/><br/>Poking fun at just about everything that you could possibly imagine - talk shows, courts, daily life, the Spanish Inquisistion, the military, etc... - and it is all put together in a way no less random. Skits end unexpectedly, some shots are used many times, random characters appear only to speak one line, and all that makes for what is quite possibly the best crafted presentation of absurdity and chaos ever made. 10/10<br/><br/>Not Rated and suitable for most viewers, but very cautious parents will undoubtedly object to the crude humor.",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,30 September 2006
2608,Monty Python's Flying Circus, Six intellectuals who revolutionized comedy with mostly weirdo characters,"The Python group has been written about to death and their show is either seen as totally ingenious or the stupidest thing to ever be aired. My personal view is the former although some of the skits can be tedious and stretched out too long. Long before the wholesome, politically correct American sitcoms flooded European television you could actually get away with broadcasting this show which had sex, blood and violence (not graphic but more suggestive). John Cleese has often commented that very little censorship was actually enforced during previews of the show.<br/><br/>Like most fans I think the parrot sketch is hilarious but it is not really my favorite. I can't really think of a favorite sketch I have because there are so many I find hysterical. One of them is the interview of Arthur ""Two Sheds"" Jackson which is some kind of parody of those boring art shows, where the man in the chair is supposed to be really respected and everybody is supposed to praise him. The Pythons like to poke holes in those people's arrogant facade and they are especially vicious when it comes to chartered accountants and religious organizations. I could go on forever describing the ""meaning of Flying Circus"" but I think the answer is very subjective. The only way is to judge for yourself. I cannot say that all people will find the show funny and it is not really a show for people who only like toilet humor like the Farrelly Bros. films. I will close by saying that the show is such an institution that ""pythonesque"" has been included in Oxford's dictionary much to the dismay or joy to the Pythons.

2610,Monty Python's Flying Circus, Beating everything out of the meaninglessness of everything.,"It is hard to put into words how much I like the ""Flying Circus"". Born just some years after it was produced, I can still remember how my whole class at school watched a replay of it on German TV at the end of the 80s (it was fortunately not dubbed, just subtitled) and we were always re-enacting the jokes the day after... Fortunately we had teachers who were also into Monty Python, including our English teacher who let us watch their movies. Now, almost 25 years later, they continue to make me laugh. But having grown up and having become a little bit more educated now allows me to produce an even sillier interpretation of their work. The thought underlying everything they did was basically that 99,9% of the things we humans do is practically meaningless. May it be starting or following a religion (Brian), undergoing expert treatment (Confuse-a-Cat Ltd. - a brilliant sketch), politics (Silly Walks) etc. And what made them even better is that they also took on the past with WW2 (the deadly joke, Hilter in England) and their medium TV/cinema in itself. Brian kidnapped by aliens - an early parody of science-fiction, isn't it? All this combined with to-the-point acting, sharp observations and top-notch writing - they were decades ahead of their time.

2617,Monty Python's Flying Circus, And now for something completely different,"Among the many things Monty Python has anchored in the collective consciousness of late 20th century TV viewers is the perfect formula on how to make a perfect transition from one thing to the other with no logical link whatsoever - and use considerably fewer words than in this introduction. Clearly the Pythons were ahead of their time with innovations like this. Or by beginning a show at its end, leading up to a breathtaking start. Or by glorifying canned meat into something ubiquitous and inescapable by writing a song about it - the product that would give the daily shocking content of our e-mail inboxes a proper unmistakable name. Or by aborting a sketch due to exceeding silliness, by continuing after the credits have rolled or by introducing artful, however out-and-out off-wall animation as just one of the many ingredients in order to go for something completely different. Monty Python swims against the tide of the typical punchline laughs. It stands for the perfect cross between surrealism for humor's sake, for encompassing absurd comedy somewhere between triviality and existentialism, with a tad of innuendo-laden references (wink, wink, nudge nudge, say no more), functioning also because it hit a nerve back then in 1968 and hasn't lost any of its cultural relevance almost 50 years later. Nowadays, when people are reading reviews for the lack of having anything better to do, they might not expect the Spanish Inquisition to show up (nobody does!). But they just did, and that's thanks to Monty Python - the guys who also wrote the killer joke where 13 people looked at two words and had to be sent to the hospital. Dangerous stuff!<br/><br/>It's a sure bet that you'll still find people whistling Sousa's military march for no apparent reason for many years to come. Even when the members of this incomparable comedy troupe are gone to meet their maker, are pushing up the daisies, have rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. Whatever you do, the Pythons are a great reminder that the last laugh is on you. I'm sure that was what occurred to Graham Chapman as well when he participated in his own funeral and the rest of the gang just made a high caliber comedy show out of it, Python style.

2618,Monty Python's Flying Circus, So much sidesplitting humour in this classic series from an extremely talented comedy troupe!,"This is the groundbreaking BBC TV comedy series that introduced the world famous Monty Python. I first heard of the comedy team at a very early age, but wasn't too familiar with their work for a long time. I knew of a few sketches, but really started to get to know Python in 2005, when I was nineteen years old, which was when I first became familiar with all the members of the troupe, watching many episodes of this show and the movies which the comedians made afterwards, and laughing a lot! I have now seen every episode of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"", originally aired from 1969 to 1974, and some comedy may wear thin on me through time, but that most certainly hasn't been the case with the humour of this particular group! <br/><br/>This is a sketch comedy show featuring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, and Terry Jones, the six official members of the Monty Python team. It also features many parodies and bizarre concepts! Five of the group's members regularly appear in sketches, each delivering lots of silliness and insanity, while Gilliam, the British troupe's sole American member, only appears sporadically on screen but is responsible for all the bizarre animated sequences, which are featured in every episode and really fit in with the live action sketches! The show sometimes features guests for smaller roles as well, not always just the Pythons appear, and when the female characters are not played by any of the Pythons in drag, there are real women who play them, most commonly Carol Cleveland, who appears at certain points in the majority of the show's episodes and can be referred to as the seventh Python.<br/><br/>In my experience, I've found that no matter how good a sketch comedy show is, not ALL the sketches can be that great, including this show. For instance, I don't think I've ever found the tape recorder up the nose very funny. However, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" still features enough hilarious sketches to make it a masterpiece, with the man with three buttocks, the dead parrot, the homicidal barber sketch and very famous ""Lumberjack Song"" that follows it, the job interview, newlyweds trying to purchase a mattress, the Git family, the argument clinic, silly disturbances, and so many others, WAY too numerous to mention! Terry Gilliam's animated sequences can certainly be major highlights as well, and he could sure be creative with those cutouts he used for them, many of which he got from Victorian-era photographs! All official members of the Python troupe showed their amazing talent in this sketch comedy series, and I should also give credit to Carol Cleveland. Even though she wasn't an official member of the team, she kept getting roles in the show due to her comedic talent, which she certainly deserved, and is definitely worthy of the ""7th Python"" label! <br/><br/>Sadly, one of the legendary Pythons, Graham Chapman, died of throat and spinal cancer in 1989, when he was only 48 years old. This tragic death occurred the day before the 20th anniversary of the day on which the first episode of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" was originally broadcast! I was only three years old at the time of Chapman's death, so I was obviously unaware of it at the time, but finally learned about it sixteen years later, as I had just discovered how funny Monty Python was. That was when I discovered what a great comedian Chapman was, like the other Pythons, and how understandably missed he is. He contributed a lot to Python's humour with his talent, in a comedy franchise which obviously can't please everyone, as some people have been put off by the troupe's extremely silly style, but the work that the Pythons did together was very influential and has clearly made so many people from different generations laugh, and will hopefully continue to do so for generations to come!

However, Monty Python may have been the earliest of the sketch comedy shows to utilize the fact that it was being broadcast on television which pushed sketch comedy out of the constraints of the fading sensibility of Sid Caesar and Ed Sullivan.<br/><br/>In addition to their sketches which were filmed like little movies rather than on stages (and probably were not improvised), Monty Python's Flying Circus is filled with fake news broadcasts, fake commercial interruptions, spliced sequences of stock footage, and of course, the outrageously irreverent cartoons that spoofed the great art of Europe and created a surrealist python world where portraits of distinguished old men eat up the Venus de Milo -- whole! Monty Python spoofed everything, from their own BBC News, World War II to Queen Victoria who is shown in one sketch walking into a poetry reading with the coffin containing the remains of her husband saying ""My late husband and me..."" <br/><br/>Almost every zany aspect of modern society were taken prisoner and held in custody by the Pythons, including courtrooms, shopping malls, and even little old ladies who have decided to form violent street gangs! And of course the French and the Scots seem to get a little more airtime than other groups! And the final aspect I will relate is that most of these zany sketches were presented with absolutely straight faces as if the actors were seriously engaged in their ludicrous exploits. There is very little I can add about Monty Python that hasn't already been said, except, that if you have never seen it, it is almost impossible to describe. So, for God's sake, see it!

2621,Monty Python's Flying Circus, Not 'The Beatles of Comedy',"Monty Python is considered as a landmark TV comedy and in its way I suppose it is.
It's a show that I never got into the habit of watching even though I have an acute sense of comic absurdity.<br/><br/>I tried watching occasional episodes but in all honesty I found it a bit hit and miss. Sketches started okay as original and off beat, and then fell flat, that's my impression of them.<br/><br/>As an example of this I cite a strange reaction I had to a Monty Python sketch, one of the most famous the Dead Parrot sketch.
During this I made a cardinal sin of actually wondering why I was laughing, approximately half way through it. Once I'd got the notion in my bonce I couldn't dislodge it from my mind.<br/><br/>This was the only time I was stupid enough to make this mistake. But the overall effect on me was to put me off the show.<br/><br/>This attitude towards the TV program persisted regarding the Python films. Until their film Life of Brian, which is now my favourite film comedy.
Why did I change my mind over that film? Because there was so much stupid ill informed comment about it, that I had to watch it to see what all the fuss was about. I have now seen this film more times than any other film.<br/><br/>Monty Python has however managed to achieve something that British comedies have in general failed, and that is to acquire cult status in the USA.
This has had a knock on effect
of an unwarranted assumption that esoteric comedy emanates from this show. I say this as any reference to Monty Python online elicits copious comments, that illustrate this point.
A typical example being to declare of Monty Python, that they are 'The Beatles of Comedy'.
Even this side of the pond the same feeling has permeated, that any originality in comedy emanated via Monty Python.
If your knowledge of comedy is so restricted then that may seem to be the case.
But for my part I'm not surprised that Spike Milligan got put out after watching Monty Python, when he declared ""They've nicked my stuff""",8 out of 20 found this helpful.,5.0,30 October 2018
2622,Highschool of the Dead, Zombie Horror and Anime Combined With Wonderful Results,"Let's start by saying that this receives a 10 based on entertainment value. This is in no way a masterful piece of art, or a thought-provoking series. However, what it does, it does extremely well - violence, gore, keeping with what you expect from horror and anime (breasts, short skirts, profanity, etc).<br/><br/>The story is a very simple one to follow - it's the zombie apocalypse and a group of high school students and the school nurse are trying to survive. The characters are surprisingly deeper than you'd expect and the interactions are intriguing.<br/><br/>The show is completely over the top as you'd expect; chock-full of scantily clad young women, tons of f-bombs, an exorbitant amount of blood, dismemberment and did I mention a lot of fanservice and nearly naked animated girls? That much may be hard for some to take, but when you can look at this show as an over-the-top tribute to horror, mostly traditional zombies and anime targeted at young men, you can really enjoy it.<br/><br/>Let me go back to my mention of ""mostly traditional"" zombies - the zombies here are what Romero fans WANT to see. No running or smarts here; just slow walkers, flesh eaters and the undead. It's wonderful to see. There is one small twist in their zombie, but it's acceptable and helps with the pacing of the story.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of zombies, Romero or Horror and have never watched an anime series before, this is where to start. I would highly recommend this to horror fans that aren't into anime, anime fans that like zombies, or anyone into zombies for that matter.",46 out of 66 found this helpful.,10.0,13 September 2010

First off, I used to love anime when I was much, much younger, but seem to have outgrown it unfortunately. When I saw the title of this though, I figured I would give it a try. I thought it was really good. Good, or good enough, story &amp; dialogue Great animation. Good direction (was kinda like watching a non anime movie). Lots of blood &amp; violence, and of course a lot of shake'n titties &amp; panties shots. Japanese artist love some tits and ass. Any way, Great show.

2624,Highschool of the Dead, Anime + Zombies = Highschool of the Dead,"It is very rare for me to give a 10/10 to any movie or game, but Highschool of the Dead defiantly deserves the 10/10 because it's one of the top best anime I have ever seen, and I'm not just saying that because I like it, and it is better than all the other teen high school anime like Gantz, Persona, and NGE.<br/><br/>Highschool of the Dead is a perfect flawless anime that has well exceeded my high expectations in terms of story, characters, music, action and production values, based on the ongoing manga series of the same name Highschool of the Dead follows a group of Japanese high school students who witness the violent global zombie apocalypse during class time at their school, similar to the opening of Red Dawn except the Russians are replaced by flesh eating zombies from the George A Romero's of the Dead films.<br/><br/>As the story progresses the students witness World War Z first hand and are forced to fight and evade their way through the thousands of the ever growing undead as well as rescue other survivors and deal with the ones who have gone insane or crazy by the chaos of the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>The characters are all very well developed and the story is very well written and keep's you wanting to see more, the music plays on the right mood and for those who have seen 28 Weeks Later might recognize the background music that plays near the end of the first episode ;-) Highschool of the Dead is definitely an anime that is worthy of your time and I will be investing my money into the English dub when it gets released.

2625,Highschool of the Dead, It'd be Perfect if it Weren't for all the Risqué Scenes,"I'm currently watching the HOTD series which has truly grabbed hold of my attention this season. The artistry's great. The characters are developing nicely. After ten episodes, I've stopped worrying about how a series will continue on people surviving a zombie influx; I'm rather impressed how the producers have kept the whole thing entertaining. But they don't need to keep injecting cleavage (or, bouncing breasts), and the roll-in-the-hay (or bathtub) scenes they seem to relish pushing. Just when I'm getting into a twist in the plot, here comes some up-skirt shot. I've been training myself to ignore those shots - but perhaps many people like that kind of thing. I, at 47, don't need to see it constantly. But the plots and artistry keep me wanting to see what happens. If you're easily offended or put off by the PG-13 (and really pushing R-rated) snippets, please try to watch a few episodes from the beginning. For those who don't care, watch the series from episode one! Great entertainment!",37 out of 64 found this helpful.,8.0,22 September 2010
2626,Highschool of the Dead," Had potential, but replaced all the promising bits with boobs.","Do you like tits? If you're watching this anime, let's hope so, because that seems to be the main focus here. Sure, there are a lot of zombies, but you only see them in between bouncing breasts and underwear flashing out from under a skirt that's too short for any kind of modesty. Like logic? It appears occasionally, but is forgotten just as fast as it is brought up. <br/><br/>It's not all bad, though. Well, most of it is, but I have to give credit where credit is due. The dark, urban landscape of Tokyo proves to be a most haunting area for a zombie apocalypse to take place, and the animation is nothing short of wonderful. Blood splatters on walls, boobs bounce, cars screech around corners sending dust and pebbles across the street, tits jiggle, skirts fly up, boobs get groped... and these things happen a lot. Except the cars. By the way, if you haven't figured out by now, kids shouldn't be watching this.<br/><br/>So, what is wrong with this series? Well, let me ask you this: are you offended when girls are portrayed as nothing short of sex objects, whose sole purpose is to follow the men and never really do anything? Do you hate slimy characters who nobody in their right mind would trust for even an instant yet inexplicably do? Do you sometimes find yourself thinking? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this anime is not for you. None of the girls wear bras, their tits defy gravity, all the girls have the exact same personality except for one trait that separates them (one claims to be smart yet just states the obvious, one is a whiny annoying bitch, one kills things with swords, and one has BIG ASS TITTIES. Like, super huge. She literally uses them as pillows. Unfortunately, her tits seem to sap her intellect because I've never seen a more stupid character in any anime. EVER.)<br/><br/>One big flaw this series has is bringing up topics or observations that are excellent points but NEVER explained/elaborated/acted on. For example: the zombies can only hear. They cannot see, they don't seem to feel (they keep walking into objects until they hear something else), and they only react to noises. Does anybody exploit this? Hell no! As soon as zombies appear everybody who knows this fact starts shouting. It's only ever used when the author wants them to seem clever, and even then it just seems like common sense. At one point they try to distract the zombies by banging on a pipe. When the zombies ignore them, they ask 'why aren't they coming?'. Excellent question! Why aren't they?....... still waiting on that response...... aaaaaany day now.... ... ... Okay, well I'm sure they had their reasons. This isn't the only scene like this though. They have plenty but for space reasons I can't get into them all, though my favorite is when zombies somehow find them and while trying to figure out how they found them they decry 'the leaves! THEY HEARD LEAVES IN TREES RUSTLING!'. I guess their vegan zombies or something.<br/><br/>I was annoyed at this series early on, but it only took one episode for me to want to turn this off out of sheer rage. Why didn't I? I don't know, maybe i'm a masochist or something. The episode goes like this: after finding a safe house, the girls get naked, take a bath, GROPE AND FONDLE EACH OTHER, get drunk, and try to have sex with the main character (totally ignoring the only character who actually DOES something in this series and is also a male). What do the guys do? Talk about guns, how to survive the zombie apocalypse, discuss their next move... you know, all the stupid things nobody cares about, right? Now back to the tits. Oh look, now a girl is fingering herself! CLASSY!<br/><br/>Did I mention that out of the 7 characters there are only two guys? One of them is a fun character, who is only good at one thing: guns! He's fat, nerdy, and thoroughly likable. The other character is a total Mary Sue. For those that don't know, a 'Mary Sue' is a character mostly reserved to fanfics who is perfect in EVERY WAY, EVERYBODY likes, and is stronger than everybody else. All the girls want him, he's less interesting than a can of tomatoes (at least there's something INSIDE the can) and he just frustrates me. But thank God for titties, am I right?<br/><br/>If this was a comedy show these might fit, but everything else about the series takes it incredibly seriously while also focusing solely on boob and panty shots. These moments just don't fit in, and the girls often become frustrating to listen to. I find myself skipping over segments with the blond woman because I just can't stand her anymore. But if you force someone else to watch it with you, turn panty/boob shots into a drinking game, and assume the show is a comedy, you could actually have a lot of fun watching it. <br/><br/>Just remember: DO NOT WATCH WHILE SOBER.",38 out of 71 found this helpful.,2.0,9 February 2011
2627,Highschool of the Dead, Zombies in a Manga? Yeah! And it works out so well...,"When I learned about this title on Amazon, I just had to get it in my collection, so I did order it and sat through it almost immediately as it arrived.<br/><br/>What is not to like here? Manga. Zombies. And I like both, especially zombies, so I was very excited to see this series.<br/><br/>Now having seen the 12 episodes on the DVD, I can say that I am honestly very glad that I did buy this DVD, because ""High School of the Dead"" was awesome.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much as in most other zombie movies. There is an outbreak of something causing dead people to rise up, look for living people to bite and devour, and they in turn rise as zombies as well, spreading the infection. And in the midst of this chaotic outbreak is a small group of unlikely survivors who teams up and have to struggle to stay alive in a world gone to Hell.<br/><br/>Being a Manga, you will, of course, be in for some outrageous turns and twists in the storyline. And trust me, there are just that in wait.<br/><br/>I must admit that I am conflicted whether to rate ""High School of the Dead"" an 8 or a 7. I went with the 8 because it was a nicely animated movie, had a great story, and best of all; lots of zombies! What was causing me to have gone for a lower grade was the excessive urge to constantly show jiggling breasts in almost every scene. It was ridiculous and it was seriously too much. It just brought too much juvenile humor to the series. And it was a shame.<br/><br/>What irritated me about this series was episode 6. It was over the top, too much nudity, too much stupidity, and it was not working in the series at all. I was at the brink of turning it off and not finish off the last 6 episodes. However, I did, and luckily they did tone down the nudity (and just kept it at an excessive showing of over-sized, jiggling breasts everywhere). They should have opted not to have episode 6 turn out like that, or just cut it out of the series entirely.<br/><br/>One thing puzzled me was that this series was set in Japan, right? Fair enough. But did you notice the breast size of the women in here? Come on? It was ridiculous. I know it is a Manga and is an animated movie, but seriously? Those sizes were bordering on being inhuman!<br/><br/>Now, with all Japanese Manga, you need to watch it with the original language track, of course. I got the dual language (Japanese and English) DVD version, and I also gave the English version a go. And I must say that the voice cast (and voice acting) in the English version wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>""High School of the Dead"" is a must have in any collection if you like Manga and zombies.",16 out of 27 found this helpful.,8.0,5 December 2011
2628,Highschool of the Dead, Entertaining show that spoils itself with excessive ass and boobs,"I should clarify from the off - I am male, I love the female form, and I love anime. I even find myself defending most things that are deemed to have 'gratuitous' sex and nudity. But HOTD really scores an own goal with the frequency of ludicrously overdone shots of melons and buttocks jiggling. I know this is a staple of anime, but not to this extent usually, and it genuinely does distract from the story and induced a lot of eye rolling and sighing from me.<br/><br/>It's a shame because, despite not really bringing anything new to the table for zombie flicks, nor being especially thought-provoking, this is a genuinely well made work. The use of music, sound in general, and above all some excellent animation, as well as the way the story moves and the generally quite dark atmosphere...all makes for a show that is fun to sit down and watch if you're into zombie stories. To the extent that I did want there to be a second season and a completed story. Anime also seems to tackle zombies less often than it has the potential to, which does bring a uniqueness to what is happening here - so why ruin all that and the potential for a great product by injecting something so mundane and puerile over and over again?<br/><br/>If it had been scaled down to more standard anime amounts, fine. There is always going to be a certain amount of sexual tension in a post apocalyptic world, and there was nothing wrong with it being used to a lesser degree for the romantic subplots. There are moments where it is employed to genuinely humorous effect. If it had been restricted to those two things, I think this anime could have developed a far larger following.<br/><br/>It's just a pity they ruined that because they decided that, instead, the whole show should grind to halt on occasion because they have nothing more interesting to offer than foisting breasts on you. It isn't that this is a perfect show aside from this - there are some logical inconsistencies, particularly pertaining to the zombies being driven by hearing alone, and the doctor is infuriatingly vapid for a...well, doctor! But there's certainly enough entertainment and a compelling enough atmosphere to wish the show hadn't ended as prematurely as some of its more base viewers doubtless did.",13 out of 22 found this helpful.,7.0,10 January 2015
2629,Highschool of the Dead," Blood, brains and bouncing breasts!","This series may have less nudity than 'Elfen Lied' and less panty shots than 'Najica Blitz Tactics' but it is still most definitely ecchi! The story follows protagonist Takashi Komuro and a group of fellow high school students as they struggle to survive in a plague of zombies; luckily their number includes Saeko, female president of the kendo club and Kohta, a boy with a passion for firearms! As they try to get through the city to find their families they not only have frequent confrontations with the zombies but must also deal with ordinary people who are taking advantage of the situation.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this series; the characters were pretty good and there was plenty of action; much of it quite bloody. The fan service was a bit excessive though; some times the large bouncing breasts and regular views of the girls undies were a bit of a distraction! I liked the character designs and for the most part the animation was great although it did resort to a 'wobbly cam' shot of a still image to indicate frenetic action more than once. The ending did feel somewhat sudden; more like the end of the season than the grand finale; I was certainly left wanting more.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",12 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,13 September 2011
2630,Highschool of the Dead," Violence, action, up-skirt, cleavage and gore aplenty","A small band of students escape the post-zombiefication of their school to discover their families fates while battling some unsavoury survivors and zombie hordes.<br/><br/>The teen focus for the most part works, although it plays a little awkward for viewers given the abundance of up-skirt and cleavage shots. Still it's an interesting perspective. Some of the scenes granted are childish and overly comedic but these are few and those familiar with the anime style wont bat an eyelid. The interplay between the teenagers and adult protagonists are handled well and the highschoolers especially Psycho and Takashi come across older than they are.<br/><br/>There's cursing, violence, action and gore aplenty, the slow moving zombies are perfectly realised, gruesome and scary which gives the show the required edginess to hold its own. High School of the Dead is designed and drawn skilfully with the sound design and soundtrack as equally pleasing.<br/><br/>Yes, it suffers from the all zombie genres clichés and stereotypes but it's fulfilling, exciting and fun.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,10 March 2014
2631,Highschool of the Dead, Fan Service and Zombies,"Fan Service and zombies. That's all this show is. So I suppose that any review has to cover both of them. Ladies first I guess.<br/><br/>The opening titles alone has a dozen crotch and boob shots. None of them serve any purpose. Throughout the show you are constantly plastered with this given the slightest opportunity. Or even when they have to create an opportunity. The number of dialogue scenes where the camera slowly goes down to focus on their panties averages out to at least two an episode. Probably more. The worst episode by far is episode six. In it the girls all bath together, with predictable fondling and lesbianism, while the two guys sit in the other room and talk about guns. That's the whole episode right there. Oh, except for the fact that all the girls try to sleep with the main guy. I'm assuming that they got drunk somewhere in there because they all act it after the bath. Either it's just assumed or that's just how this guy thinks girls act when they let their crazy feminine emotions out.<br/><br/>This is symptomatic of the treatment of the girls in general throughout the series. All of the girls (with one exception) offer nothing but an opportunity to show off their bodies. There are four main girls. I can't be bothered to remember their names so I'll just identify them by their hair color. Pink is a total b*tch. She says she's a genius at every possible opportunity although she never demonstrates any proof of it (many of her 'facts' are wrong and the ones that are right she cannot possibly know), and she enjoys belittling people for it. The blond girl is a complete bimbo. She's the school nurse but she has giant breasts and the IQ of a five year old. She never speaks except to whine or fawn all over the main character who is I might point out, actually an underage student. I suspect she works at a high school for a very specific reason... Brown hair is also obnoxious and likes to go on about how great the guy's friend that he had to kill was. At one point she's thrown from a car and she just lies there for at least 3-4 hours (it goes from midday to sunset) while everyone else protects her. She's not hurt or anything, she just gets up and walks it off. Naturally she's the main love interest. The last girl is purple haired and she's the only semi-good one. She's a master with swords and genuinely loves killing zombies. Her competence and professionalism do not prevent her from being used as yet another sex doll for them to display. It is made quite clear that even the competent girl can do nothing without a guy to lead her. More than that the girls cannot think for themselves and constantly put everyone's lives in danger because of their uncontrolled emotions and lusts. It really is a disgustingly misogynistic and exploitative show.<br/><br/>So now the zombies. Zombies are cool right? How can they mess them up? Well first off they never call them zombies. They seem to think this makes them realistic somehow. Secondly they bind them with stupid rules and then constantly break them. These zombies are cannot see, smell or touch. The only sense they have is hearing. Sounds interesting right? So naturally they'll be quiet and sneak around to prevent the zombies from hearing them. Except they don't. They run around screaming with zombies all around and then one of them will bump into a pole, or drop a bat, or the wind in the trees will make noise and suddenly the zombies are everywhere. I want you to think hard about that last one. The wind in the trees attracted the zombies. THE WIND IN THE FRIGGIN' TREES!!!!!! So having established by the second episode that zombies need sound to hunt they then proceed to ignore it until it is convenient to the show for them to be in danger. How can there be any actual sense of danger when they ignore their own rules when it's convenient?<br/><br/>The two guys are there too. That's really all that can be said of them. The main guy is basically how the author views the perfect guy to be. He has no real flaws and is fawned over to an obscene degree by all the women. The other guy is a fat nerd and a gun buff. He's probably the most interesting character there since he's extremely competent at one thing and enjoys it immensely. Naturally he's treated with nothing but contempt by all the girls who nothing if not superficial.<br/><br/>So, the good things... ... ... I'm drawing a blank here. I suppose that technically it's an impressive film. The animation is quite good and the character designs aren't that bad. The main theme's pretty catchy too. Apart from that zip. Zilch. Nada. This show has no redeeming features whatsoever.",20 out of 47 found this helpful.,1.0,8 September 2011
2632,Highschool of the Dead, Highschool of the Brain Dead,"This is my 4/10 mangaupdates review for the source material and the anime adapts the first 4 manga volumes 1 to 1: This manga has some questionable character designs at first glance which can't deny their porn heritage and here lies the main problem of this work. The artist mostly does hentai and ""edgy"" shounen manga and it shows. Just cliché after cliché and nonsensical fanservice but sadly no character development or real story progression to speak of. The constant hiatuses also speak volumes of the quality of this work. So read The Walking Dead and the World War Z books instead. I Am a Hero (8,5/10) further proves mangaka can do a zombie apocalypse as good as anyone else so go and read it.

2633,Highschool of the Dead, Takes a certain type of person to give this a 10 out of 10...,"Okay my first review. after watching the ENTIRE series of H.O.T.D one Friday afternoon (sweet unemployment) i was certain that the time had come for me to put in the time to write my first anime review on IMDb. I will try and keep this as brief as possible, as pretty much every review below 5 stars on here says much of what i think about this show. It saddens me to see so called anime fans giving this show a 10 out of 10. The writing is cliché and sloppy, even for your typical zombie teen flick. the characters are plain awful with little depth, and are actually annoying. especially the 'doctor' with ridiculously sized boobs (that come with there very own sound effects some of you will be joyed to hear) The kind of stuff i would be embarrassed as an anime fan to watch with someone else who isn't, i imagine i would get a disapproving look like 'dude?.. THIS is anime?'. The action is probably what i enjoyed the most, but very hard to take seriously when a guy starts using a girls breasts as a riffle clamp, so after i learned to take it for what it was it was OK. Basically the best thing you can do is take it for what it is and you should have a chance of enjoying bits of it. I did laugh a lot but mostly on the parts they didn't want me to. I felt that most of the time during the action sequences and the 'heart felt' emotional scenes this show genuinely wanted me to take it seriously and then bang... animated ass and titties. Dozens of interesting rules are discovered whilst fighting with these zombies that could have been used to the writers advantage of creating exciting scenarios within the plot yet none of them are ever put into place or followed through with in future episodes, for example, the zombies cant see but find there way around by sound alone, important right?! nope... this is never exploited in their encounters with the undead. there are many more but probably the most important was that the zombies can only be killed by smashing there skull, after episode six this seems to go out the window as they start running through crowds of zombies just slicing and hacking anywhere with complete disregard of the epiphany that saved them from death in the beginning, and zombies are now dropping dead all around them. I watched this series in English, sorry American dub, im British so i found the 'relatable' American gags especially cringe worthy, like a mention of 'walmart cheetos' and a comparison to Sarah Palin all topped off with a joke about Asian women drivers... wtf?? i thought we were in japan. Finally the ending is just... well it just ends... Although i don't think H.O.T.D is as bad as some people think, it is rubbish in comparison to some of the true works of art and story telling genius that japan has given anime fans all round the world. it was worth watching though, because weather i like it or not it seems this anime is becoming some what of a cult classic, mainly to the kind of people who thrive on mind numbing blood, gore, ass and titties, and lets face it, sometimes we all do, however its those that know only that who are giving this high ratings. the reason? they are ignorant to the truly amazing anime that is out there.",11 out of 29 found this helpful.,5.0,18 November 2011
2634,Highschool of the Dead, Tremendous sexy fun,"This was a fabulous surprise when all I was hoping for was some cheap titillation. Instead, I found a well-written and thoughtfully constructed series that actually has a heart, as well as story lines intriguing enough to keep me watching through all 12 episodes and wish for more. <br/><br/>The anime is gorgeous, and the music is fitted perfectly to the action. <br/><br/>I am not a big zombie apocalypse guy, which has been done 1000 times before, but that is no matter because the zombies aren't much more than a mechanism to get rid of minor characters. Also, the fact that it is anime makes the gore more tolerable. Frankly, the only gore in this is splotches of black blood, lots of it. <br/><br/>No, what carries the series are the characters. Takashi Komuro is likable, relatable, and the perfect foil for the astounding females that make up the majority of the group. Full of self doubt from being rejected by the love of his life, he finds his confidence as he eventually becomes leader of the group. His love is Rei, the supernaturally hot, and sweet girl he's known his entire life. She has a couple of her own demons to battle, and eventually she'll find her love rekindled. Saya Takagi is an obnoxious braniac who bosses around everyone who will tolerate her. She spends much of her time abusing Kohta Hirano, the class nerd who follows her around like a smitten puppy. Harboring an unspoken crush for Komuro, she eventually will learn to appreciate Kohta as he discovers that in this new world his secret talents make him as important as anyone. Then, there is Saeko, the mysterious and ultra-sexy ninja chick who takes to this new reality like a dolphin to water. She has to come to grips with her own darkside while seducing Komuro into a love triangle with her, a girl he has more in common with, and Rei, the girl he has always loved. <br/><br/>There is also the blond doctor, Shizuka, who is more of a stock character only there for apparently 3 reasons: she is old enough to drive, comedy resulting from her stupidity, and her humongous breasts. <br/><br/>There is also a little girl for the last handful of episodes. She becomes something akin to a pet for Kohta and Shizuka.<br/><br/>As for the cheap titillation I was looking for, yes, the series has plenty of that. All the women are unnaturally proportioned and gratuitous shots of their cleavage and undergarments are aplenty, even when there seems to be no reason for it. Many reviewers apparently found this tiring or distracting from the series. I did not. From the very first scenes of the series, there is a balance struck between horror and drama, and playfulness and sexiness. The show gives you some extremely dark subject matter, but it is determined to have fun while doing so. <br/><br/>I totally dug it. The female characters are the hottest I've ever seen depicted in anime, and without them, the story completely bogs down.<br/><br/>And anyway, this is more like PG-13 stuff. There is zero sex, in fact, nothing intimate at all, with the camera panning away during any possible intimate moment. And there is nudity in only one episode, the fabulous ""In the Dead of the Night.""<br/><br/>So, yes, there is certainly more fun to be had here for guys, but this is far from the soft core porn that some prudish reviewers have suggested. The service frames the story, sets the mood, but it doesn't overwhelm the story. Any female fans able to accept that should find a very good story they can enjoy.<br/><br/>Just know what you are in for.",7 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,15 September 2011
2635,Highschool of the Dead, The story is common for a zombie series,"This the most nonsense anime I have watch. The animation is good but the story is sucks. And I thought that this anime is cool because of the fighting scene but I was wrong. The anime is like hentai. no moral value and the story has no aim. I hate the sexy scene although they don't have language violence, but the sexy scenes always annoys me. I'm still thinking why it will become one of the popular anime.<br/><br/>The story is very common. and the fighting scene is so lame. I hate how they deliver the plot of this anime. The voice acting of the Japanese character is sucks. <br/><br/>In short this anime is nonsense. I think this is the most ugliest anime in 2010.

The characters were very well drawn and what's more important the drawings matched the characters' personalities. All of the characters were so likable...except Rei Miyamoto...she was such an annoyance...I was so going to kill her. Takashi was amazing. Such a strong character.

2641,Highschool of the Dead, Great,"Ah, what an epic Zombie Apocalypse it was. Since I love Zombie Apocalypse a lot, I planned to watch it. After watching 4-5 episodes, I was like, ""Amazing, it's a total must watch."" But I had an issue. They don't need to keep injecting cleavage (or bouncing boobies), and the roll-in-the-hay (or bathtub) scenes they seem to relish pushing. Just when I'm getting into a twist in the plot, here comes some up-skirt shot. I've been training myself to ignore those shots - but perhaps many people like that kind of thing. Many people like those scenes like but I don't. It was truly boring. After watching 8-9 episodes, I started expecting a lot from this Ecchi. And yeah, I was wrong. The ending was not what I wanted. It was kinda incomplete. Still, it's great.<br/><br/>Overall, HOTD is gonna be amazing for you if you like Zombie Apocalypses and those scenes as well. But if you're not interested in those scenes, you'll start feeling bored soon.

2642,Highschool of the Dead," Had promise, but cool action shots give way to teen male stupidity","I've noticed a lot of reviews mention bouncing boobs, but please note that they're never actually shown nude. That's problem 1.<br/><br/>When this series opened, it showed some promise with some unique action art. But it quickly devolved, as it was clear that they spent 0 budget on writers. The plot was awful, had a ton of holes, and the dialogue was typical dumb teen male fantasy garbage.<br/><br/>Back to the boobs and butt shots...So I don't mind seeing cute chicks naked, but to focus episodes or story lines on boobs or butts is extremely juvenile. If it has something to do with the rest of the story, sure, go for it. But if it's made just as an opportunity to show more boobs, then it detracts from the story. If I wanted to see boobs, I could just watch porn or hentai. But if I'm watching real anime, I want more. Either a good plot, or interesting characters, or a unique story, or some dynamic action. HOTD started off well with one of these (action) but then the later episodes started skimping on action and replaced it with teen male fantasy boob stories.",8 out of 24 found this helpful.,5.0,30 September 2011

The show had its problems, from to many out of place sexual moments to a lack of depth, but if you intend to enjoy yourself for a few hours It's worth the watch. <br/><br/>This Zombie/infection Anime was more than capable of keeping me interested and left me asking... why was there only 12 episodes?

2645,Highschool of the Dead, Seemed promising but is really just primitive,"Ever since ""Berserk"", there have only been very few Anime shows I found worthwhile (namely Hellsing, Wolf's Rain and Record of Lodoss War). Based on what I saw in an AMV and because of the ratings here, I was hoping that this show would be in their class.<br/><br/>Instead, I found myself watching some quasi-Hentai nonsense with very bad writing. As my mentioned preferences indicate, I'm already not exactly a big fan of gigantic eyes. Well, besides those, EVERY female character seems to have gigantic, always jiggling boobs as well. And the stupid behavior of the characters... I had to force myself through even the first ten minutes of the first episode, constantly thinking ""maybe the whole tone will shift"". But at least in the first ten minutes, it does not and other reviews seem to confirm that it never does.<br/><br/>If this would be just some Hentai series, I would simply dismiss it and maybe even enjoy it but since is supposed to be ""serious"" entertainment, I find it highly questionable. It is one thing to fantasize about women with gigantic boobs for brief sexual pleasure but another to hammer viewers with those images in a neutral setting, making it seem as though women are just a giant set of walking, talking breasts. All of this makes me fear about what the new Berserk show will look like. I've been looking forward to it for years now but if Highschool of the Dead is a good indicator of where modern, ""mature"" Anime is headed, I will get off that ride now. (And if it is where modern Anime for kids is headed, even worse - what the hell kind of an image is that for them?!)",6 out of 19 found this helpful.,3.0,21 January 2012
2646,Highschool of the Dead," Good, but not perfect","----- MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ----- <br/><br/>First of all i like to say that I'm a big fan of anime and zombie movies. so i was VERY exited when i heard about High School of the Dead. The first few episodes got me hooked, but as the series went on i really started to lose interest in the series..<br/><br/>The positive aspects: <br/><br/><ul><li>GREAT action-scenes! the fights against hordes of zombies look spectacular and tense, you just gotta love them. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>good looking animations! the studio obviously put much work into the animations, it looks great in 1280x720 </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>promising story with several interesting characters! i haven't read the manga, but considering this, there can also be some smart plot twists and character developments</li></ul><br/><br/>The negative aspects: <br/><br/><ul><li>WAAAAY to many fan-services! I understand that sometimes you have to show a little more then necessary to keep the (male) fans entertained, but this series has way to much in it.. whats the point in running around half naked all the time? with so many dead people around it shouldn't be hard to find some clothes... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>characters are interesting, but sometimes just plain DUMB! Why do you keep fighting zombies in front of a fence for about half an hour if you could just climb over and run from them? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>little character development! Up to this point in the series the characters didn't show much development. Mostly they just stick to the stereotypical behavior that they are meant to represent. The dumb but hot school nurse is just dumb and hot all the time, the fat but smart weapon-fanatic just runs around shooting stuff and presenting facts about weapons etc.. you see where I'm going.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall i would give HOTD a 6,5 out of 10, it is an interesting concept which is presented in a never before seen way (name me another survival-zombie anime??), but it's not superior.

2650,Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists, Welcome surprise,"For whatever reason, I was quite looking forward to this PERFECTIONISTS spinoff of ""Pretty Little Liars"". I had tapped out on PLL somewhere around Season 6. It felt like dragging out drama for the sake of it. Honestly, in retrospect, it felt like they were just making stuff up from Season 2 onwards. It's like the Dr. Pepper commercial ""I'm an A, she's an A, he's an A, we're an A, wouldn't you like be an A, too?"" It become too convoluted after a while. Of course I re-visited the show in the finale to find out who the true A really was. Yeah, not worth the wait.<br/><br/>
However, this spinoff seems very promising, in large part due to the fact that it stars 2 of my favorite characters from the original series Alison DiLaurentis (played by Sasha Pieterse) and Mona Vanderwaal (played by Janel Parrish). Aria was actually my 2nd favorite behind Alison, with Mona coming in 3rd, but in fact Mona fits way better into this series than Aria would. Ali and Mona are the 2 most devious liars and it's a treat getting to see them work their magic in a new setting, the fictional university of Beacon Heights.<br/><br/>I'm really liking the new main characters as well, this time a trio of ""liars""' instead of a foursome: Caitlin Park-Lewis (confidently played by Sydney Park), Dylan Walker (earnestly played by Eli Brown) and last but not least Ava Jalali (excellently played by teen idol Sofia Carson). Caitlin envisions a political career, Dylan being a world-renowned violinist, and Ava ruling the fashion world. The writing does a fantastic job of weaving the characters' personal interests, majors, and goals into the fabric of the overarching murder mystery.<br/><br/>The victim in question is Nolan Hotchkiss (well played in the Pilot by Chris Mason) and surviving him are his older sister Taylor Hotchkiss (solidly played by Hayley Erin) and mother Claire Hotchkiss (superbly played by TV veteran Kelly Rutherford). The Hotchkiss family basically run the university and are it's biggest benefactors. Rounding out the engaging cast are Mason Gregory (good performance by Noah Gray-Cabey) and Dana Booker (craftily played by film/TV vet Klea Scott). The only characters I'm not feeling are the love interests of the main trio. They are all so dull and interchangeable and take away from the main story too much, one reason I took away 1 star from this otherwise entertaining spinoff.<br/><br/>
But overall, I'm really enjoying the mixture of murder mystery, university politics, familial power struggles, and friendship dynamic. In particular, the writing is doing an amazing job of fusing the old PLL cast with the new, while allowing both parties to have their own meaningful interactions with each other. Ali and Mona's scenes are funny and refreshing with the occasional cheeky callback to PLL. The main trio have great chemistry with each other. In particular, I'm loving the friendship between Ava and Dylan, with Caitlin being the glue that holds the group together. And Ali's scenes with the trio have a genuine mother hen quality, which is a callback to the original series where she was the leader of the group of liars. Ali always knows best! Hopefully, this refreshing, engaging series continues for several seasons.",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,9.0,6 May 2019

Kelly Rutherford (Gossip Girl/Melrose Place) shows up to bring a level of sophistication to the proceedings. New PLL Sofia Carson stands out as the composed yet wounded Ava. The show brings a darker more mature sensibility than the predecessor's early episodes.<br/><br/>Ultimately we are dealing with a murder mystery that suggests something much bigger and wilder is at hand.

I hadn't even heard about it until today and I thought I'd give it a chance. Like every teen-drama based show, the pilot has several moments that had me rolling my eyes but when the episode focused on the main story, that's when it shined. There's definitely potential here for the show to be a really interesting mystery-drama show rather than just a typical teen-drama. The characters are all quite interesting and they all have something to hide which makes them complicated at times. By the looks of it, the pilot does reference Pretty Little Liars a fair bit and when it did that, I found it hard to keep track. This is an issue that several spin-off shows have, the show needs not to rely on the original series otherwise there will be people who'll feel like they're missing something. The actors are all pretty decent, Sarah Pieterse in particular is quite good and I can see her doing even better with a better script. The script isn't the strongest link of the pilot, hopefully this is something they focus on improving but as of right now, it's not too good.

I was never bored, and watching alliances form and dissolve over the years, and the rotating cast of villains and heroes, was all done with the finesse of a skilled juggler. It wasn't the greatest tv show ever, but boy was it suspenseful, and every episode featured a mystery within a mystery.<br/><br/>There's something seriously lacking in this updated version, it's not nearly as intense, the characters aren't engaging or interesting, and it's hard to care about any of them or their problems. The only bright spots are when Janel Parrish as Mona shows up, her rapid-fire delivery and pushy attitude are welcome antidotes to the rest of the beige cast. The number one problem I have with this show is this: I understood how the detective in PLL could be made to be a villain, the girls had to keep their secrets in fear for their lives, but in this show, there is no clear reason for the in-house detective to be made out as a villain, she's trying to help the students and yet none of them are cooperating with her.

The series unfolds at Beacon Heights University and the surrounding town for which it was named. Everything is always perfect in Beacon Heights - at least it is supposed to be, but that very drive for perfection has deadly consequences. The story centers on three college friends - Ava (Carson), Caitlin (Park), and Dylan (Brown) - known as the Perfectionists. A trendsetting blogger, Ava has designs on being known as a fashionista. Caitlin is the daughter of two ideal mothers and intends to live up to the standard they've set. A type-A personality, she aspires to serve in the Senate. Dylan, meanwhile, is a talented cellist. Now that he's shaken off the dust of his judgmental small hometown, he intends to succeed at everything he tries. He is as devoted to his boyfriend as he is to music. Then there is the matriarch of a powerful Beacon Heights family, Claire Hotchkiss (Rutherford), responsible for founding Hotchkiss Industries and the university. She too strives for perfection at any cost. When the town's high-pressured environment proves too much, someone loses it and kills someone.

I became apart of the family when I came running home from school and plop down in front of the TV and tune in. I really wish that I could have lived there in Springfield and have a family like the Andersons. To me they were the epitomie of the way a family was supposed to be. I actually learned some ""habits"" and values that I stole from the series. To this day, working as a teacher in my mid 40's, I find myself whistling the theme song between classes, at lunch, etc. I remember thinking about some of the situations that Bud and his sisters would get into and how they would resolve them. I would then apply to my own life. Maybe that is why I probably have had a 'wonderful life'.

2674,Father Knows Best, Best of the 1950s comedies,"I was born the year after this series began and remember it very very fondly. Unlike a program like Leave it to Beaver or even Ozzie and Harriet, this program was both more moralistic and more sentimental - the heartstrings were pulled every program. I watched three episodes the other night (although I was supposed to leave for a train) and was so thrilled by the warmth of it - the sentimentality, the pathos. This family had such an effect on me growing up - neither adult really lost his/her temper, small problems were treated with immense attention.<br/><br/>I just LOVED it - and am sure any non-cynic would.",40 out of 44 found this helpful.,,13 May 2002
2675,Father Knows Best," My favorite show from the 50's, happy to finally see an episode on TV land","I was so pleased today, being a baby boomer, to turn on TV land and see three hours of 50's television.  From 9am to 12pm I saw, Burns and Allen, the Honeymooners, an hour episode of the Lucy-Desi comedy hour, Hazel, and last but not least an episode of Father Knows Best.  Kudos to TV land for this three hour bonus which is supposedly going to happen every sunday morning all summer long.  Why does it only have to happen on Sunday mornings?  I want more of these shows from my childhood. <br/><br/>
Father knows Best was one of my favorites.  As has already been said by others, the show had wonderful values, laughter and pathos.  Jane Wyatt was always my favorite TV mother.  Why has she never been included in specials about favorite tv moms?  Yes, she always dressed nice and wore pearls but I remember the particular episode when she was wearing a long shirt and pants to clean the house and she had a smudge of dirt on her face.  That was when Jim was bringing home a women who was a famous author, someone he had been friends with.  You never would have seen June Cleaver with a smudge of dirt on HER face.  Jane (Margaret) was always there for her kids but she was so very human too.  She lost her temper several times and once told her kids that they were brats.  She made faces behind their backs once when she wanted to clobber them. She did what I never saw any other tv mother do, but what our own real mothers would do.<br/><br/>The whole cast was pretty wonderful.  Bring back this show to tv again. There are plenty of baby boomers who would like to see it again and maybe it would be nice for it to get a whole new audience of a new generation.",27 out of 29 found this helpful.,,2 June 2002
2676,Father Knows Best, One of the Best,"Critics of this type of show are quick to point out how ""unrealistic"" it was. After all no episode dealt with drug addiction, teen pregnancy,dropping out of school, or any of the other ""relevant"" topics that pass for entertainment today. Instead this program concentrated on the, now passe, issues of family love, warmth, charity, and decency. I challenge any parent, of whatever generation, to contrast an episode of this show with any ""Married with Children"" or the majority of today's teen oriented sitcoms and decide which world view they would wish for their children. Perhaps this show and others of its era (e.g. Andy Griffith) was overly hopeful in its portrayal of family and community, but isn't it better to aspire to the values of Father Knows Best than succumb to the spirit of the age we live in?",63 out of 73 found this helpful.,,30 March 2001
2677,Father Knows Best, American Values,"It's ironic that culture commentators today, including many teachers, who seem never to have seen a single episode of this series, will refer to it as a frightening illustration of fifties complacency, patriarchal dominance, and even racism.  In fact many of the episodes explore issues of male egotism, parental arrogance, and conformist nastiness in an effective way. Of course, it all ends well because it is a comic drama about a tolerant and loving family with solid values (and Father was often the one who had to be reminded of this).  Robert Young in frustration complained that it was never meant to be a sermon or sociology lesson  -- but this carefully written and popular series was bound to tell us something about our values, and despite current malcontents, the values illustrated by Father Knows Best were generally very good.",40 out of 46 found this helpful.,,23 December 2001
2678,Father Knows Best, One of the Finest Family Sitcoms,"Having long been a fan of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, I recently decided to become acquainted with FATHER KNOWS BEST. I am glad I did. FATHER and BEAVER represent the best of the '50s family sitcom genre, and they do have similarities as well as significant differences. FATHER had a richer range of family relationships, since the Anderson clan had three children of widely varying ages, including two girls. Jim Anderson (Robert Young) was the model of a thoughtful, principled, self-reflective father of that era. Margaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt) was also a pillar of strength and virtue as the mother of the family, while the three children (Betty, Bud and Kathy) braved the struggles of childhood and adolescence under the guidance of their parents. Betty was ambitious, smart, spirited, in some ways a prototype of the independent woman. (Her look in the show also, I believe, became the model for the popular image of the ""50's teenage girl."") Bud was an easygoing guy prone to mistakes due to hubris or selfishness but able to learn from those mistakes. And then there was little Kathy - impish, mischievous and cute as a kitten (which was Jim's nickname for her, in fact). Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin filled their roles perfectly; Gray in particular showed great physical flair and agility as Bud.<br/><br/>FATHER differed from BEAVER also in the darker tone of some of the plots, dealing with topics like business ethics and the meaning of success and focusing on the parents just as much as the children. The cinematography fit this darker tone, using light and shadow in a way reminiscent of film noir. The show was often innovative in terms of structure, with dream or fantasy sequences serving as a complement to the plot. Two episodes of this type are ""Mr. Beal Meets His Match"" (in which Jim Anderson meets the devil!) and ""Formula for Happiness."" <br/><br/>I could go on about this fine show, but talking is no substitute for watching - which, thanks to the DVDs from Shout Factory, it is now easy to do. If you haven't seen FATHER KNOWS BEST, treat yourself to one of the greatest family shows ever created.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,4 June 2018
2679,Father Knows Best, One of the best.,"Some people criticize shows from the '50s for being too clean cut and unrealistic, they think they don't really represent what life was like back then, and often dwell on misogynist themes - and while I don't disagree that there could be tones of that present in shows from that era, I don't think it's fair to dump a show like Father Knows Best into that category. On the surface it looks like any other show from that time, but when you actually dive in and invest some thought into the series, you realize that the stories are rich with morals - morals that still apply to us just as much now as they did then, and characters that are far more one dimensional than they may seem at first. You find a father who truly loves his family, and does everything he can to make sure they have a good life. He may quite often save the day with his wisdom, but his wife is just as smart, and has just as much power when it comes to running the household as he does. They seem like equals, and quite often it's pointed out that her job is far more rough than his. Robert Young and Jane Wyatt played their roles beautifully, and deserve a lot of praise. The young actors who played the children deserve a lot of credit as well, because they really seem genuine and believable. Instead of looking like they're struggling to deliver scripted lines, they have emotion and an honesty to them that make you feel like this is a real family you're watching. There are a few episodes where they may have gotten a touch stereotypical with their characters, but it was often rounded out by showing that they possess all the good qualities of their parents, and are well on their way to becoming well rounded adults. Is this show perfect? No. Again, there are a few episodes where it's a little frustrating just how stuck in the '50s some of their thinking really was, but I feel like even those episodes can be forgiven when you realize how honest the writing was. Overall it's a wonderful show with great writing and great actors, that manages to teach you something special in every single episode.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,9 June 2016
2680,Father Knows Best," The 1950s were a simpler time, and this father always knew best.","I wasn't quite 9 years old when ""Father Knows Best"" made its move to TV, so I didn't get to see any of the first episodes because we didn't get our first TV until a year later. But I vividly remember watching many episodes over its 10-year run. Robert Young as James 'Jim' Anderson, Sr. was written as the almost ""perfect"" father, and Jane Wyatt as Margaret Anderson was written as the almost ""perfect"" mother. More than anything else, thinking back, this was a series written as a model for what was generally considered the correct way for a family to live and interact back in the 1950s. Some viewers today might scoff at that notion, but coming just a few years after the big war, and running during much of the ""cold war"", as a youngster it was reassuring to see peace and harmony. We didn't have the big national news networks back then reporting everything that was bad, in gory detail, and today I see that as a blessing. Elinor Donahue as Betty Anderson, Billy Gray as 'Bud' Anderson, Jr., and Lauren Chapin as 'Kitten' Anderson completed the family. It is always fun to occasionally catch an old episode or two.

2681,Father Knows Best, A Grand Portrayal of family values in 1950's Americana,"The series ""Father Knows Best"" started out on radio in 1949 on NBC and from there it remained one of the top radio programs of its day which lasted five years on radio until 1954,when it was produced for television by Eugene B. Rodney and its star,Robert Young,under the production company,Rodney-Young Productions. It wasn't until 1954,when NBC introduced this series based on the radio plays that were developed for television and it became one of the biggest hits of the era,right up there with some of the greatest family comedies of their day,""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"",""Leave It To Beaver"",and right besides classics of that era including ""I Love Lucy"", and ""The Honeymooners"".<br/><br/>""Father Knows Best"",made it astounding premiere on NBC-TV on October 3,1954 and from the first episode was a surprise hit. It also during its run on NBC,was one of the top ten shows of its day,making it one of the most watched shows during the network's impressive run. It ran on NBC from 1954 until 1958,and then went to CBS from 1958-1960,with the last episode of the series that ended on February 29,1960. It ran for six seasons(1954-1960) producing 203 episodes all in classic black and white and was produced by Rodney-Young productions in association with Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures Television. However,it aired again in repeated episodes on CBS from 1960-1965 and again in repeats in daytime television for ABC from 1965-1967 and from there episodes were aired again in daytime syndication until 1980. The series was produced by not only Eugene B. Rodney but also under the production values of Peter Tewksbury and William D. Russell. Tewksbury after his stint on ""Father Knows Best"" would go on to produced other great family shows like ""My Three Sons"",and ""Nanny and the Professor"",and also would serve as executive producer of ""How To Marry A Millionaire"",television series based on the classic motion picture starring Marliyn Monroe. William D. Russell would go on to become the head producer for a number of Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures television shows including ""Dennis The Menace"",""Hazel"",""Bewitched"",""The Flying Nun"",""Gidget"",and ""The Donna Reed Show"",not to mention ""The Farmer's Daughter"",while serving as executive producer for other shows outside as well including the family shows,""The Eve Arden Show"",and ""Family Affair"",and ""Bachelor Father"",not to mention the riveting courtroom drama,""Perry Mason"",for which he was also one of the writers for Raymond Burr's classic series.<br/><br/>""Father Knows Best"" was a grand portrait of family values in 1950's America. Jim Anderson(Robert Young),was an insurance salesman for a large company,who was the breadwinner in the home,while his lovely wife Margaret Anderson(Jane Wyatt),was basically the stay-at-home mom who took care of the kids and the household while Mr. Anderson was at work. The Anderson children of course consisted of the oldest daughter Betty ""Princess"" Anderson(Elinor Donahue)and the son,James ""Bud"" Anderson,Jr. (Billy Gray),and the baby of the family,the youngest of the Anderson clan,Kathy ""Kitten"" Anderson(Lauren Chaplin). They all lived in a nice double style house in a residential quiet neighborhood in fictional Springfield,USA which was a small town but was never told about the state or the setting of the show from which the Anderson's live. Maybe either in Ohio or Indiana or Iowa in the heart of Midwestern America. In each and every episode there was some situation that came about and from there it was up to the father to solve to crises before it got out of hand. In perspective,this was a caring loving clan who were their for each other in times of crises and knew how to take care of their situations as well since this was a family-oriented show that ran for about an half-hour. The kids themselves had the normal 1950's problems of a white-middle class family with the oldest son ""Bud"" or sometimes the baby girl ""Kitten"" get into a situation or two when the father is not around. Everyday problems were handled in a caring and sensitive manner. There was never in any of the episode where the parents lost their temper to the children since the problems were treated with immense attention. It may have been corny in parts,but don't you wish it was the family we wanted but could never had?<br/><br/>Robert Young's character as the patriarch,Jim Anderson was magnificent to watch and it shows in the number of Emmys this show received during its six year-run on network television along with his co-star Jane Wyatt as well as understanding and sometimes caring and lovable mother who was there in times of trouble the children were having. Jim Anderson (Robert Young) showed an understanding that not only appreciated by the rest of the family,but by the viewers too who tuned in each week. He is right up there with some of the TV's best dads including Andy Taylor(Andy Griffith),Ward Cleaver(Hugh Beaumont),Steve Douglas(Fred MacMurray),and Ozzie Nelson(Ozzie Nelson),not to mention Ben Cartwright(Lorne Greene)as the fathers America loved at the time. This was a show that was brought back to television in later years after its repeats ended in syndication in 1980,were brought back on cable television in the mid-1980's on Nick-At-Nite and again most recently on TV Land. Also to note it has been picked up for the American Life TV Channel as well. Worth seeing it again if the powers that be at Sony-Columbia Pictures Home Video get the chance to bring this show on DVD to relive the golden age of the 1950's.

2683,Father Knows Best, *Like a rediscovered first love*,"When tuning into FETV last week, it's hard to describe the utter joy I felt when the theme music from a distant memory came up. Racing into the living room to see what show it was, I saw the title ""Father Knows Best"" on the screen and literally cheered. THANK YOU FETV! :) <br/><br/>Every person who bitterly trashes this show is doing so as a scapegoat for unresolved emotional issues in his/her own life. When I was a young adult in the 1970s, I remember it became fashionable for foul-mouthed, angry Baby Boomer writers to accuse FKB--as well as other wholesome 50's shows--of actively promoting every social ill known to man. Don't believe the lie. FKB inspired us to hold fast to the basics of decency in love of God, country and family. Those who hate this show hate the values it entails, plain and simple. They would have been more comfortable if we'd heard more toilets flushing &amp; profanity in the Anderson home than the prayers said around the kitchen table.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,24 July 2017
2684,Father Knows Best, The first rule of listening,"At the time it was first broadcast, ""Father Knows Best"" was the quintessential American dream family life that was the fulfillment of what had been denied during the Depression of the 1930s (when everyone wished for financial security) and the World War II years of the 1940s (when everyone fantasized what life would be like in the ""post-war"" years of peace and prosperity). The Anderson family had that ideal life in Springfield in the 1950s. 
In the 1970s,1980s, and 1990s the American dream shows of the fifties (Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, et al) were, in hindsight, criticized for presenting week after week an ideal family that caused so much of real America to feel inferior and mal-ajusted. Seminars with titles such as ""The Way We Never Were"" were conducted to assure real life Americans that they were, in fact, ""normal,"" even if they didn't come from a nuclear family of two never-been-divorced, heterosexual parents, two or three children, a college educated, white collar father, a stay-at-home mom, and dog in the back yard surrounded by a picket fence. Decades after the show had run its course, Billy Gray apologized in interviews to the American public for causing mothers all across America to ask their teenage sons ""Why can't you be like Bud?"" In those interviews Billy Gray declared, ""I was just playing the part of Bud as written for the show. Even I wasn't like Bud."" 
However, what I find quite ironic now when watching ""Father Knows Best"" 60 years later, is that both Father and Mother in ""Father Knows Best"" week after week violated the first rule of listening to children. Instead of putting down his newspaper, listening, and appropriately responding to his 7 year old daughter, Jim Anderson shrugs, ""Not now, Kitten, I'm reading the paper."" The other members of the Anderson similarly, week after week, ran in and out of rooms not really listening to each other and giving sarcastic responses to questions and situations. The scripts provided the resulting confusion that caused the comic problems that Father eventually resolved at the end of the show. When seen now in the year 2018, ""Father Knows Best"" is an object lesson in the value of passive listening that I found opened up a treasure of father-son relationships when I raised my son in the 1970s and a treasure of relationships that I now have with my granddaughter.

2685,Father Knows Best, A True Classic; Emotionally Satisfying; a Situation Comedy Based on Selfhood,"Whatever its faults, the"" Father Knows Best""show's scriptwriters and producers operated on a level of adult self-responsibility and contexted ideas; since hardly any of other TV series' creators bother to create an ethical normative rather than an obsessive as a central character, there really can be no comparison. In a single sentence, its creators tried to make fiction; others shows' writers milk laughs. For 7 years, William D. Russell and Peter Tewsbury directed half-hour- long story after story that told of the daily adventures of James and Margaret Anderson and their three children--Elizabeth (Betty), knows also as the Princess, James Jr. (Bud), and Kathy, also called ""Kitten"". The family lived in a large house on Maple Drive in the town of Springfield. The town, presented over seven years, was Middle Western, inhabited by non- practicing Christians, and of a size that was altered to fit the needs of the story-lines. It could be large enough to support a charter bus service, a major state park, a country-club set, complete with mink coats, a lake suitable for fishing, a junior college. Yet its student population could also attend a single high school, and its citizens could leave town by a single bus station and fight city hall where they knew the Mayor to talk to but reserved their approbation only for a mystic thing called ""the national government"". The charm of the show I suggest came from the fact that its producers expected self-management of individuals; and it was this retrospective and nostalgic view of unimpeded individual progress, responsibility and self-assertive purpose that set the series apart from almost all others. As Jim Anderson, Robert Young was lively, wise and intelligent; he denied being a philosopher but used ideas most effectively unless a religious issue was raised. His wife, Margaret, a contented nest- maker, seldom needed outside stimuli to relieve her of the duties of raising three lively children; played by Jane Wyatt, she was self-effacing, quietly determined and mostly realistic. Lauren Chapin played Kathy as cute, clueless and a source of non-sequiturs; fortunately, she was given little to do. As Bud, Billy Gray was frequently believable; but much of his world consisted of false and explodable ideas about how to act, relate and take responsibility, making him a fine foil for comedic exchanges with his more-experienced middle-of-the-road father. As Betty, Elinor Donahue was radiantly lovely, eager and timid by turns, intelligent and only occasionally too-perfect. The stories featuring her I found were frequently a bit overdone but never boring. whether she was winning a hundred yard dash, being crowned homecoming queen, trying not to disappoint her parents by wanting to go to junior college or fending off boyfriends. There were a few semi-regulars to augment the Andersons-- Fronk, the Hispanic gardener (Natividad Vacio), Vivi Janiss and Robert Foulk as neighbors, Jimmy Bates, Sarah Selby, Yvonne Lime and Paul Wallace. But the real stars of the underfunded B/W half-hour series were its writers--Roswell Rogers, Dorothy Cooper, Ed James, Sumner Long and John Elliotte. The cast only left Sprigngield on a few occasions, and somehow always in pairs and groups. Art direction by George Brooks and Ross Bellah was surprisingly good in my judgment; there were many fine interiors, decorated by William F. Calvert or Louis Diage, serviceable stock music and attractively dense cinematography. My favorite episodes include Betty's winning a look-alike contest and a trip to Hollywood, the Anderson' parents visit to a big city, Bud's first job, the Founders' Day reenactment, Betty's graduation from high school, Bud's trying too hard to impress a new girl in town and Margaret's secret attempt to master flycasting. Whether Bud was calling Kathy ""shrimp"" or he was yelling up the stairs to report a phone call, or Betty was trying to befriend a standoffish tennis star or cliquish college types, the attempt was made by all concerned to stand for something, finally. And guest stars, including Henry Jones, Wright King, Wallce Ford, Bartlett Robinson, Duke Snider, Katahrine Bard, Tamar Cooper, Roger Smith and Dick York frequently were used very well to make ethical points. This is often great comedy, not to be missed.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,7.0,8 September 2005
2686,Father Knows Best," This wonderful sitcom was one of the ""Best""","Like many family sitcoms of the 50's and 60's, Father Knows Best was intended to be simple, fun family entertainment. I think some people ""miss the point,"" feeling they must share cynical, bitter, and jaded opinions. The saddest part of this is that it is easy to end up being unable to simply enjoy a TV show for what it was meant to be...""simple, fun entertainment."" As those who watched those family sitcoms will know, most shows endeavored to interweave into their story lines a message of hope, morality or truth, and I find this a GOOD thing (although some observers have unkind and contemptible things to say about these classic shows and mores). As IMDb points out, it's one thing to say you ""disliked"" a show; it's another altogether to rant on and decry a show for personal, emotional reasons.<br/><br/>Compared to today's shows  where every possible innuendo, every chance of rudeness, crudeness or being offensive is seldom missed  the shows from the 50's and early 60's were excellent family fare, and most families (believe it or not) enjoyed them and were better for it. I know I am, and that's not to say that I'm just some old ""fuddy-duddy"" who can't enjoy the ""new, hip"" shows of today, because I can and I do (but let's be honest, most shows today ""push the outside of the envelope,"" and now even commercials are doing it!).<br/><br/>In the 50's (and I was a kid then), the choice of ANY kind of show was ""slim pickin's,"" to be sure, but even so it does not mean they were bad or even poorly-made shows. Oddly enough, of all the family sitcoms of that era, the only one I ever had a problem with as a child was the very well-made and highly popular ""I Love Lucy Show,"" and this was simply because of her open disregard for her own husband. She constantly lied, snuck around, tricked, connived, hid from, embarrassed, and openly defied him, and  as young as I was  this bothered me. There was just something contrary and contradictory about it. Of course, I know that show is an icon, but I had real problems with it and never enjoyed it, even though my family watched it. (NOTE: for those who may wonder about underlying prejudiceseven as a youngster, it never even occurred to me that Ricky was ""different"", ""a Latino,"" and ""of another culture,"" so put your judging sticks down. Nor was I ever troubled on any TV show when or if two people slept in the same bed, so there's no prejudice there either.) <br/><br/>On the other hand, Father Knows Best had a fairly typical, upper middle-class husband, wife, son and daughter, each one playing a role that seemed fair and accurate, not only then but now (unlike my own very dysfunctional and disparate family). For someone who blatantly suggested that Father Knows Best ""is just another piece of crap"" that fostered the dishonoring of women and family and other such tripe, I can only say, ""I am truly sorry that somewhere along Life's Journey people can be hurt so badly and became so bitter and cynical."" It's truly sad to see anyone become bitter and cynical, especially about something as benign as a TV show, and especially such an ""innocent"" 50's family sitcom. Some reviews and some comments in the Message Boards (on various shows and movies) are downright scary and disheartening. I say this, because I believe the true purpose of some movies or TV shows is often entirely missed (they are meant to entertain and uplift, i.e. ""Seventh Heaven"" of today).<br/><br/>Anyone who watched Father Knows Best quickly realizes that Father did NOT ""always know best,"" and sometimes he had to play it close to the vest or fly by the seat of his pants until the dust settled. Then, as any ""good"" father, he would own up to any misunderstanding or mistake and make it right, but the show always ended on a note of love and/or reconciliation (albeit sometimes with resistance, especially from Bud or Kitten). Is this kind of family behavior ""real"" and ""honest""? Maybe not in your life, and surely not in mine, but it did not detract from the meaning and purpose of the show. Even though my own father was hateful and prejudiced, I STILL loved to watch this TV show, even if only to ""live vicariously"" through the kind, loving, conciliatory Anderson family.<br/><br/>I should also point out that Mom (Margaret) was always loving and patient with her husband and kids (and oftentimes quietly and patiently one step ahead of dear ole Dad). Betty was your typical older, somewhat serious sister who had her own friends and her own life, and she never really enjoyed having her two younger siblings involved in her high school mattersbut she always came to their aid when needed. Bud was the typical, coming-of-age teenager, and (with all due respect to LTB's Eddie Haskell) he was one of the best near-rebels and on-the-edge youths of his time. Kathy (""Kitten,"" to Dad) was the youngest, the quickest to get into a predicament, the first to taunt either Betty or Bud, and usually the one to challenge most authority, but never to her great harm(the family always saw to that).<br/><br/>In this, as well as most other family sitcoms of the 50's and 60's, I cannot recall any one family member ever being overly mean or unduly harsh or cruel or disrespectful, and, if there ever was a misstep, it was clearly and decisively met with some kind of fair punishment, followed by a peaceful, reconciling conclusion. In short, this kind, loving family and this wonderful sitcom was one of the ""Best,"" and I heartily recommend it as a ten-out-of-ten Classic TV Show!",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,12 October 2006

2689,Father Knows Best, A SERIES WITH THE VALUES WE SHOULD STILL HAVE,"In an age of tawdry and cynical TV sitcoms filled with double-entendres and self-absorption, this was one of the best of the Fifties family shows. Billy Gray later became bitter that when he was arrested as an adult on some marijuana charge no one from the show helped him (assuming they knew). But that says more about Gray's own family's problems. Of course they were actors; Elinor Donahue was married and divorced in real life while the series was still running. ""Kitten"" had a dismal real life as an adult that has been well-accounted. But so what? The values of responsible behavior, caring for others, and consideration were there for all to see. I remember the exhausted father one black and rainy night searching with a flashlight for a doll ""Kitten"" had lost. He found it. The family love was always there. Robert Young eventually quit the show as he had been doing it for a decade including the radio version; he was tired of the role. But it remained very popular into many reruns throughout the Sixties and a few ""reunions"", the first in 1975. Why is there so much rudeness, lack of civility, and self-concern today? In part because shows like this were replaced by the smutty, cruel, dreck on so much of TV today.",16 out of 21 found this helpful.,,13 August 1999
2690,Father Knows Best, This was my favorite series as a child! I have the best memories about this series! As an elementary school child this series taught me good values that I still remember!,"I was raised abroad and watched it when the series was shown abroad, translations and all, long after its American release in 1954.  In France it was shown in 1960. I am sure I also saw it about that time. I always looked forward to that half an hour to watch  ""Father Knows Best."" Our entire family would tear up learning from Robert Young,  the dad. Actually the reason I liked that series so much is because I always thought that my parents knew best!  That was until I became a teenager, of course! Later I went back to my original opinion: that mom and dad  indeed knew best for me. I do not remember specific episodes but I remember the theme song.  Jim Anderson,  dad, played by Robert Young , was an insurance salesman. Margaret Anderson played the mom and she also looked very pretty and dressed up for just staying home.  Then there were Betty (princess)  Bud, and Kathy (Kitty).  They lived in Springfield.  Mom and dad slept in separate beds. That I could not get because my parents slept in the same bed. But I have the great memories about the show. ""Father Knows Best"" had family values, good moral ethics,  and valuable lessons were taught in every show. I would like for the series to be released  in video in its entirety because I would like to see it again!",14 out of 18 found this helpful.,,25 March 1999

2692,Father Knows Best, The Best Family Comedy-Drama Television Has Ever Produced,"I was born the year ""Father Knows Best"" premiered. But it, along with ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Honeymooners"" and ""Leave It To Beaver,"" figure quite prominently in my memory. In the case of ""Father..."", it ran into the early '60s, and was possibly the only series that ran for at least one, if not two seasons--reruns only--in prime time, AFTER they had finished filming the last episode! So I remember it very well, and can say that I grew up watching it, learning from it, and loving it. It seemed everyone in America loved this show when it was on. It was initially a sitcom, but it grew like so many long-running series have done. It matured into a thing that was still quite funny at times, but quite dramatic at others. Robert Young had made movies for years before this, and I've since seen several of them. Oh, he was a good enough actor back then I suppose, but in ""Father Knows Best,"" he was like my second father when I was growing up, and when I see one of his older movies nowadays, it's always a disappointment, simply because he's not Jim Anderson in them! The rest of the cast was fine, but it was Young who really made the show. <br/><br/>I suppose the final comment here should be something like, ""yeah, why IS it that 'Father Knows Best' hasn't ever been rerun on Nick or TV Land?"" 'Tis a real pity, that. Well, since I wrote that, I've seen that the show was indeed played on TV Land. But a bigger pity nowadays is that the series has yet to be available on DVD! What's up with that???<br/><br/>Of course, as of 2014, the entire series has been released on DVD. I am the happy boy!!",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,10 January 2002

When 2002 came in the rumors started to spread that the people were begging either Nick at Nite or TV Land, to put the show on the air. Before father's day, they had a mini marathon on TV Land, and struggled to find a time slot and it's on during the week, and I only watch it on Saturday and Sunday. I really loved this show.

2694,Father Knows Best, Doesn't get the credit it deserves,"As I watched it in the 1970 s as a teenager I didn't think much of it. Having just binged watch it in a month , it was very well written with great stories lines. Robert Young of course is the star and is very good playing Jim as a understanding and fair , even tempered Dad. But it the kids Betty , Bud and annoying Kathy that truly make the show. Elinor and Billy are very good and underrated , Elinor is a wonderful dancer "" Betty makes a choice "" shows her talent there. Billy will make you laugh and cry , never seen a guy bounce off of walls , trip walk into walls , do back flips , handsprings and he's great with his dead pan face , now Kathy is another story. Most of the time I feel like locking her up in the closet or chaining her up to the radiator ( I never seen one in the show ) when she starts up and has to get all the attention. She must be a great actress because I believe she is really like that in real life, knowing what has happened to her ( addiction, prostitution ect ) I believe in playing Kathy that it was so easy for her because she was really like that in life. She was just playing herself. She never listen always cause trouble for everyone, was very jealous of her brother and sister. She always had to get her way. And her parents added to the problem by spoiling her "" Kathy , girl executive "" and "" No Partiality "" is prime examples. Sometimes the show is written so corney. I liked her a lot in season 1 when she was small she could get away with being a brat as she grew and got bigger is wasn't as cute anymore , it became anoying. As for Margret , she belonged in a convent as a mother superior. She was too uptight , needed to loosen up a little , she belongs teaching 3rd grade and ordering them around , If I have to hear ""Children I'm ASHAMED of you"" for the 500 time , I'll go crazy . Those dresses had to go. She looked better in long pants , but she was a good mother , she cooked , cleaned, sowed, ironed, painted the fence, even fixed the plumbing pipe.
Overall is a great show. If your a baby boomer and sick in bed I recommend that you bing watch it.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,9 November 2019

Most of the time, by the end of the episode, I'm wiping away tears because it brings back memories of a more peaceful and happy time. I'm sorry that the children of today can't experience the carefree times of those bygone days.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,12 January 2019
2696,Father Knows Best, A Warm Vision Of Family Life,"As a family-centric sitcom, ""Father Knows Best"" (and other shows, like ""Leave it to Beaver"") helped document and/or establish norms of family behavior in the 1950s. Television shows reflect the values of their times, and it's a pleasure to revisit the styles and behavioral standards of Springfield and its seminal family, the Andersons.<br/><br/>The title of the series should not be taken literally, though Jim Anderson (Robert Young) is considered the leader of the family. One episode even makes fun of the phrase. Still, Jim strives to be the breadwinner, the ultimate authority, and a font of wisdom, much as Judge Hardy was in the movies.<br/><br/>Post-war America enjoyed a prosperity that was reflected in the show. Margaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt) is a housewife and caregiver, expected to keep the household neat and running smoothly. The challenge to traditional gender roles that began during WWII is only nascent in 1950s television.<br/><br/>The series began as a radio show in 1949, also starring Robert Young. The father was more sarcastic and all the characters were more caricatured. Young himself said he wanted the television series to have more warmth. You can actually see the tone of the series change throughout its run, much like other shows that find their voice. The earliest episodes of ""Father Knows Best"" feel more frenzied and overly dramatic---probably a holdover from the radio version---and they play with fantasy and dream sequences. Later episodes feel more relaxed and secure in their voice, having greater warmth and a more genuine feel, eventually feeling like a real family awash in love and comfortable in their roles.<br/><br/>Those viewers nostalgic for the values inherent in the series probably recognize its emphases on individual responsibility and respect for all people. These are values central to the U.S. Constitution and most religions.<br/><br/>Sixty years later, some might disagree with my opinion that respect for all people is still a core principle in American life. However, I feel that the concept of individual responsibility has been eroded by various influences; a longing for that diminished principle may be a factor in some viewer's enjoyment of the series.<br/><br/>Like other shows of its time, the central theme is the priority of the family unit. Home is a dependable place of unconditional love and acceptance, where you belong. This universal virtue is a key reason for its appeal.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,8.0,8 November 2019
2697,Speechless, Has Yet to Disappoint,"Season 2 is almost over and this show continues to deliver. Speechless masterfully takes a difficult and potentially isolating health issue and shows the world stubborn love, camaraderie and strength all while making you smile. The characters all have their own ""extreme"" traits - Maya's brazen outlook for one - and it works beautifully in this hilarious symphony of a family supporting each other no matter what comes their way. Also, I'd be remiss not to mention the amazing job JJ's character does at reminding the world that there's so much more to a person than what you see. This show is first class.

Also any one with some degree of discapacity will find identificated with the situations in the comedy (i do). I lived a lot of the scenes in the chapter (for example get stop by the police -not doing anything wrong-, asked to get down of the car and when they see me i have no legs they just let me go.

2699,Speechless, The representation was amazing!,"I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a show where the main character was a wheelchair user played by an actor who actually uses a wheelchair. This alone makes the show a must-see. Admittedly there are the typical ABC-sitcom tropes: the corniness, the less-than-ideal acting, etc. But it's all worth it to see the way they tackle disabilities with an actor who experiences everything first-hand. As a viewer in a wheelchair, it was genuinely incredible. I cannot wait to see where the show goes in the future. I hope that this is one that sticks. If you don't care about it, chances are that you have never been disabled or affected by someone with a disability. (Which is disappointing as the messages in the show are aimed at you.) And if you are disabled, I would definitely recommend checking it out.",53 out of 76 found this helpful.,10.0,21 September 2016
2700,Speechless, Genuinely funny and it never victimizes its main character,"Speechless has a ton of heart and the family under the monarchy of Minnie Driver has a feelgood chemistry. I don't think her British origin has ever actually been explained in the show (that I can recall), so it's somewhat offputting at first getting adjusted to an all American family with the matriarch being the lone Brit. It's not a common situation in a domestic sitcom, but neither is much else common about Speechless. From the lead character JJ DiMeo suffering from Cerebral Palsy and his silky-voiced partner Kenneth to their quirky dog Pepper, the entire main cast shines through--each member offering their own form of delivery (deadpan, self-deprecating, etc)--giving the viewer a buffet of all the different shades of comedy available. It's also refreshing that there's no canned laughter--ABC's better comedies tend to share that trait.<br/><br/>Another great thing about ""Speechless"" is that it never tries to make you feel bad for JJ. The show does a great job at showcasing JJ's humanity rather than his disability, and his personality takes front-and-center stage. JJ and Kenneth have great chemistry and they remind me of a mix of Shawn and Gus from ""Psych"" and Adrian and Sharona from ""Monk"".<br/><br/>If you like Speechless,. check out the show ""Single Parents"" too.<br/><br/>EDIT: Speechless has been cancelled and will not be back for a 4th season. RIP to an amazing show. I'm sad that we won't get to see JJ try to navigate life away from home as a student dorming at NYU but at least the show didn't end with a cliffhanger.

Nothing is perfect here and ins't that spectacular. Kinda like the way most of us live.

2703,Speechless, Something different,"This show, seems to be, something different from the usual sitcom fare. So I am going to try something different in this review. I am going to give my opinion and not present it as undeniable fact. I won't say that the show is funny, but I will admit that I found it funny. I personally enjoyed it more than the Goldbergs, though I do watch that show regularly and for the most part enjoy it. I missed the pilot of Speechless and base this opinion on the second episode. I found the acting to be fine, even the children. All of the kids made me laugh at one point or another. I think the actor cast as the new aid is perfect and shows a real chemistry with the special needs son he is charged with assisting. I understand that there will be negative reviews for just about any show, I just recommend you use them for what they are. Some stranger's opinion who, if you read them, seems to think that their opinion is fact. And if someone really thinks that if they don't laugh, then it's not funny period, then they don't understand what a sense of humor is.",17 out of 27 found this helpful.,9.0,28 September 2016

2705,Speechless, J.J. Is A Firework,"Prime Time T.V. shows coming out try to be funny and original. This T.V. show is both, and it shows us how awesome and normal a kid with disabilities can be!! My title is an allusion to Katy Perry's song Firework. You'll feel that same way about J.J.<br/><br/>So about this show being original, it helps us get to know a family and a teen with cerebral palsy. He can't walk, and gets around in a wheelchair. He also can't speak, but he's not deaf. He doesn't communicate with sign language, but he uses his head gear with a laser where he points to a board, and everybody around him always seems to immediately know what he's trying to say? <br/><br/>We have J.J.'s Mom, Maya. She speaks in a British accent, which alone makes the character more interesting. Maya loves J.J. so much, and will do anything for him. She and the family frequently can get away with things when they use having a disabled son as an excuse. But, Maya fights for everything to get her son involved in regular activities in school and feel as normal as the other kids, not just because he's disabled. She's also into giving J.J. anything he wants, even if she doesn't like it.<br/><br/>We have J.J.'s caretaker Kenneth. Kenneth is a big older black guy, who lives in his own apartment away from the Dimeo family, but he really feels like he's part of their family. He almost always is with them when we see the family together. Kenneth is a funny man, and feels like he is doing something with his life helping out J.J. We occasionally hear some of his backstory prior to helping J.J. and other things he does aside from assisting J.J.<br/><br/>We have the other characters: Dylan, Jimmie, and Ray. I don't find these characters as interesting. They don't get as much attention as J.J. does, but they are all very supportive of J.J. and would do anything for him. Ray is a dorky guy trying to fit in, and the voice of reason. Dylan is a tough girl that seems real smart in her responses. Jimmie seems a little whacko and doesn't take things seriously. He reminds me of the Dad in Modern Family.<br/><br/>We also have their house and big van. The house is an older house small, and not the nicest looking house. It's a mess and disorganized as this family mostly shows to be disorganized. We have the big van which holds a wheelchair and Maya can get away with speeding.<br/><br/>Anyway, this T.V. show is really funny and can get me laughing. This T.V. show brings prime-time into teaching how awesome and normal a kid with a disability can be. This isn't like Sesame Street having a character in the main cast not speak and use sign language. Or, this isn't like a discovery show you'll see on T.V. talking about kids with disabilities. This is prime-time, comedy. We see a whacko family and funny caretaker doing the best to live their lives and take care of a disabled family member. J.J. is a character we'll like. He really shows his personality, and the things he wants in life. Even though he can't speak or walk, he seems pretty normal aside from that. He isn't an annoying kid with disabilities that you won't like. For example, the only other acting role the actor that plays J.J. Micah Fowler has been in is a movie called Labor Day. For the brief scene he was in, he seemed to be portrayed like an annoying disabled kid. But, in this T.V. show he really is somebody we care for and who doesn't seem annoying. A Prime-Time show can show how inspiring a disabled kid can be through comedy, which makes it more entertaining than trying to teach the same lesson through a Discovery Show, or kids education show. <br/><br/>I'm so happy this T.V. show made it to a second season. I hope it lasts many more seasons. I'm sure it will inspire kids who are disabled through comedy!!",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,12 October 2017
2706,Speechless, Funniest sitcom of the season; Minnie Driver is terrific,"This terrifically funny sitcom has a rather odd structure. It's similar to shows like Fresh Off the Boat and the Real O'Neals, except that since the character the series is built around can't speak, his brother fills the role of POV character. <br/><br/>At the same time, neither of the brothers really powers the series. Instead, Minnie Driver's brilliant performance as their force-of-nature pushes everything forward. She is a complicated character, stubborn, guilt-ridden, neglectful of her other children yet wildly noble in her unstinting efforts to protect her neediest child. <br/><br/>In similar series, the family is often a generic backdrop to the kids, but here, the family itself is quite interesting; a rather bohemian group that functions as their own traveling circus.<br/><br/>When I first heard about a series centered around a disabled kid, I thought, that sounds depressing, but this series is anything but. JJ is severely disabled, but he's likable and funny, and the series does a good job of making disability seem like something you have to deal with rather than something that defines you. It's a series that takes something very serious and makes it fun without making fun of it.",10 out of 18 found this helpful.,8.0,30 November 2016

I couldn't believe any of the characters. Everyone looked and felt like they were saying and acting the parts. I believe Cynic comes from a real place of pain and they all seemed like they had happy and easy lives. It felt Disney trying to be Amazon, HBO... The show also looked like it was shot in LA but they did a good job making everyone ""white"" east coast, middle-class, wonder bread and so boring. The whole show revolves around a family putting the special needs kid as the most important thing in their life, as well as the town accepting the disabled kid without much trials. I guess the problem starts with the concept because that in itself doesn't seem believable to me. Moving a whole family around with middle-school aged kids constantly, ruining their chance at going to college anda chance at a decent life for one special needs kid.

I appreciate that they are trying to appeal to an audience that few shows go after, but this thing is pitiful. I couldn't even muster a smile at any of it, though admittedly I only made it through the first 15 minutes. It reminds me of the last vehicle Robin Williams was part of, at least in terms of the complete lack of humor even though the cast tried like the dickens to make it funny.

2720,Speechless," Clichéd and unfunny, despite what should have been a good cast.","Having a couple of people with challenges in my own family, I was initially looking forward to how the network would handle this topic. Instead, I found this program so cringe-worthy, I could not get through it. I don't even think there was any working ""chemistry"" amongst the characters and did not find any of them particularly likable. I wasn't sure why the Mother was British, unless the creators felt she might be able to save the show from its mediocrity. And the ancillary characters were downright grating.<br/><br/>I'm sure the Brits would have done a much better job of creating a series like this.<br/><br/>The reality show, ""Push Girls"" was a true depiction of the challenges facing the disabled and might have given the creators some guidelines to follow.",13 out of 39 found this helpful.,1.0,22 September 2016
2721,Speechless, This show has great potential!,"While the creating team of this new program packed an awful lot into the very first episode, I don't remember ever seeing a show that not only had me hooked within the first ten minutes the way this one did, but had me loving it more and more as it progressed and evolved. Admittedly many of the characters outside of the family, especially those in the school, were way over the top in the way they treated, mistreated, or mostly over-compensated for the ""disabled"" new kid (the teacher's and students' welcome when he first enters the classroom?), his reactions to all of them were hilarious. And Dina Spybey-Waters, whose character was crazy enough years ago in ""Six Feet Under,"" was just as hilarious as his ""voice."" As others have stated on the message boards, all this kid wants is to be treated like anyone else. Not to mention he is witty and sarcastic as all get out.<br/><br/>And while his mother may be fighting a little (well, actually a lot) too hard for his rights and for him to be treated equally rather than special (trash or person?), the same as we gays have always wanted to be, and already has a reputation for going overboard at several other schools, I'm sure that her past experiences have caused her behavior to become more and more aggressive with each new neighborhood and school like this one with which she has had to deal with this kind of nonsense.<br/><br/>However, the initial conflict within the family unit and the way it was resolved in the end was truly heartwarming. The mom's admission of her over-protection of her wheelchair-bound son at the cost of neglecting her other son's needs and her left-handed apology to him wrapped up the whole episode like a warm fuzzy blanket. Corny? Maybe. But true enough.<br/><br/>The father and daughter characters have yet to be fully developed, but I believe that given enough time they'll be a big contribution to the show. But all around the writing and acting were all top-notch. And special mention must be made to Cedric Yarbrough's character as well as his portrayal. I love the way he confronted the defensive mother with his own experiences of being treated differently, but loved even more the way he and the kid bonded at the end, and I hope that he does end up being his ""voice."" They would make a great team.<br/><br/>Overall, I already adore this show and hope that it doesn't get cancelled the way other great but quirky shows on ABC like ""Eli Stone"" and ""Better Off Ted"" did years ago. It had me laughing and tearing up as well, and to me, that is a satisfying half hour of TV viewing that I look forward to each week. But alas, shows like the Kartrashians and other such ilk garner more of the American viewing public these days than wonderful shows like this, so I'm not getting my hopes up.",6 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,26 September 2016
2722,Dance Moms, A new low from Abby Lee,"I've watched this show from the start and Abby Lee Miller has always been something of a tutelage monster, but a line got crossed in the April 9th (2013) episode where she pitted Maddie and Chloe against each other in solo dances. She's done that before, but she will never realize that a clear winner really can never be found between Maddie and Chloe as long as Abby does the choreography for both girls because she always favors Maddie. If Abby really wanted a fair contest between the two girls, she'd get a neutral choreographer. However, what made Abby nastier than usual is that she had the moms and the other kids vote for which girl they felt did the best.<br/><br/>Abby, her copious hand leaning on the voting box, stood there as each child and mom placed their votes in the box. If you were a little girl and knew Maddie was Abby's favorite and Chloe was the girl she treated like a red-headed stepchild, who would you vote for if you feared Abby standing their lurking over the voting box would know who you were voting for? We weren't shown how 'private' the voting process was. Two of the voters were 7 years old. Did they write down their votes? Were they given both names already printed out and then placed one of them in the 'heavily' guarded voting box? The moms are worse. They vote the way Abby wants because they don't want their child treated with disfavor and Abby will take her loathing for a mom out on the child. It's a lose/lose for all involved.<br/><br/>So, if Maddie wins and Chloe loses (she had been 'benched' by Abby, so she wasn't exactly getting practice), i.e. Abby gets what she wants, why does she keep attacking Chloe? Simple, Chloe won a national championship that Abby wanted Maddie to win and it is stuck deep in Abby's craw. To be honest, Chloe is the child most likely to grow up to be a recognized dancer. Her dancing doesn't rely on the Maddie-style of melodrama. She's tall and will get taller. She has a dancer's body, but she has a spiteful teacher who wants to hold her back. If Chloe's mom really wants her daughter to be a dancer, take her to a real teacher who believes in her.",27 out of 30 found this helpful.,1.0,13 April 2013
2723,Dance Moms, Stop Watching it For Their Sake,"It's been called a guilty pleasure, as we seem to take pleasure in watching people worse than ourselves. It's also been called child abuse for the way it exploits girls already getting everything from tween sexualization to vicious insults (against which their own mothers may or may not come to their defense) pushed on them. Now, I'm nowhere near what people would call conservative. I'm not bothered by gore or nudity in movies, and crude humor can entertain me. But the issues here go straight to questions of basic morality. This show is despicable, and to recommend it on any level is to promote some of the worst competitive values still held today, as well as add just a little more damage to its helpless cast of girls. <br/><br/>The most common defense of the show's dance instructor, Abby, is that she cannot be faulted for being ""strict"" and ""short-tempered"", and since she ""works hard"" and is ""an expert instructor"", she is at least respectable. She's not. An instructor who places high expectations on someone relative to their abilities and doesn't tolerate mistakes is strict. Abby bases her approval around the place her team takes in a competition and blows up when they lose to someone she wanted to beat. The only time she seems to care about how much of an achievement their performances are by themselves is when they are poor enough to make her angry. For example, when she entered her team in the same competition as a rival studio, she preached nothing but the need to beat said studio to her team every moment she was on camera. When her team placed 5th, the lowest place recognized, she celebrated joyously because the other studio had not placed. <br/><br/>Eventually, her actions all blend together into one long line of self-promotion. When she ""corrects"" mistakes, the message is not that the girls are capable of doing better; it's that Abby has a need to throw tantrums when they fail. When the mothers wish something else for their daughters than what Abbey has chosen, Abbey does not hesitate to insult them in front of the girls. And when one of her dancers does well, she gives speeches about how she is the one who ""made"" that girl. (Not so when the same girl loses of course. According to Abby, she can ""just blame that"" all on said girl.) We always hear at least something from her about the reputation her studio has, and her need for her dancers to win seems more and more like a need to use their talent for advertising her business.<br/><br/>The moms are perhaps not as appalling as Abbey, but they come across as even more petty. Often, it seems the reason they place such value on their daughters' dancing is a need to swipe the spotlight and bask in their girls' reflected glory. They attempt to act as important coaches in matters they are clearly less knowledgeable about, and constantly refer to their daughters' achievements in ways that group themselves in. They argue with Abbey over the right approach when they want more glory, but when they think they might lose that particular argument, they'll bow their heads and wait for the lecture to end, even if she insults their daughter. The girls, by far the most physically capable and impressive people on the show, are given the most discouraging treatment.<br/><br/>Note: One ""defence"" I've been hearing for the show is that it corrects the formula of Toddlers in Tiaras by featuring older girls and a more tasteful competitive activity, which is sort of like saying that slave labor is okay if they use strong slaves and have them build roads instead of statues celebrating the people in charge. The toddlers might at least be too young to understand or care about all the sexualization they receive.",50 out of 60 found this helpful.,1.0,10 August 2012
2724,Dance Moms, Whose Really Dancing?,"Set in Pittsburg, PA, Dance Moms is a television show that airs on Lifetime Network Tuesday nights at 8:00 central time. Local mothers apply their daughters for a spot in the Abby Lee Dance Company as young as five and six years old. Because of the extensive work and exclusivity of the dance company, mothers dream of the chance to make their daughters dance stars. After one season of avoiding what appeared to be a disgrace of a television show, I finally gave in and watched an episode with my roommates.<br/><br/>Abbey Lee Miller is the owner and director of the Abby Lee Dance Company. Running a very strict and exclusive dance company, Miller, and the company, has become one of the most sought after dance institutions in the United States, and especially in Pennsylvania. As understood from the title, this show is not about the dancing or the company, but instead it revolves around the mothers. What sells television more than drama and competition? Nothing, and this is why Dance Moms has become one of Lifetime's highest rated television series.<br/><br/>Growing up a dancer myself, I enjoyed watching the routines and competitions of these young girls. The dance aspect is what initially caught my attention. This show not only broadcasts Miller's company but also contains segments of the competition's routines. What also surprised me is how this show seems to not affect the bias of the judges involved in the weekly competitions.<br/><br/>Although I enjoy the dance aspect, the drama involved with a little girl's dancing blows my mind. Who knew that mothers could stoop as low as caring if their daughter is the point of a formation? I had always heard of parents living vicariously through their children's lives, but this show takes that theory to a whole new level. <br/><br/>If the drama between the mothers, or between mother and instructor, could be taken out of the production, I think this show could emit a more positive light. Maybe I am biased because of the way I was raised, but I hope I never act the way these mothers act about my child's hobby. Little girls dancing as young as age five, in little to no clothing, and discussing their future ""stardom"" rubs me the wrong way. Dancing is a great hobby for little girls. Making dance a career before they hit double digits, no thank you. <br/><br/>For those viewers out there who enjoy the ins and out of drama, this show is waiting for you to sink your teeth into it. For those who are baffled by selfish parenting, this show is nowhere close to entertainment. I watched Dance Moms for two consecutive episodes, and do not think I will waste time watching it again. It is a mindless show. One thing I did seem to learn from my experience of watching Dance Moms is how I feel like I know what I will and will not do as a parent.",29 out of 34 found this helpful.,5.0,7 September 2012
2725,Dance Moms, the dance teacher from hell,"I am from Canada and started at 4 years old doing tap, jazz, and ballet until I 20. <br/><br/>I started with a small company where there was no body image issues or focused on. You could choose competitive, non competitive and with ballet I always had chances to move up grades with demonstrative exams. <br/><br/>I was in the Nutcracker ( I had to compete against a lot of girls throughout my province) and danced it for 6 years straight. <br/><br/>At 14, I was invited on full scholarships to the Royal Winnipeg in Canada too, a major ballet dance company. This school was intense but I was never demeaned or told I wasn't good enough<br/><br/>I left because of injury doing pointe ballet to my knee and retired at 20. <br/><br/>In my experience I have NEVER encountered all the negativity that gets spewed out this show. The adults are appalling and the teacher as well.<br/><br/>There will always be competition in the world of dance, but all my instructors would wear dance apparel and would actually do hands on teaching without pitting students against each other and constantly being yelled at. <br/><br/>Cool your heels lady, you're going break these young girls spirits and eventually they will lose their love of dance!",39 out of 47 found this helpful.,2.0,17 December 2013

That would be even cheaper than paying this woman.<br/><br/>They are doing a disservice to the dance teacher and everyone else by this editing technique- by featuring her standing and yelling, doing nothing, they minimize the students and the moms.

Whether it be one of their many awful depictions of a female character who falls in love with a ""man"" that turns into a serial killer, Dance Moms gives Lifetime another chance to entertain their all female audience with a cast of awful women they can look down at. The star of this disgrace is a large wilder beast. She yells at a group of underage girls to be perfect. I find it ironic that this fat woman is telling skinny girls how to dance. These girls aim for perfection but end up becoming jaded as they cry and fall apart when they fall short and lose a competition. On the sidelines stand their out of shape, unattractive and talent- less mothers who agree with the abuse. Sometimes these failed parents complain as they grand stand for being somehow more moral than the rest. The 200+ pound dinosaur is justified for her actions when she wins the girls countless competitions that most people have never heard of. Do a google search and you will see hundreds of competitions (dance) in this saturated market that makes millions of dollars from young girls and their idiot mothers. This is not an example of Whiplash where students are being pushed to perfection for the sake of Art. This is nothing more than a Train wreck of a spectacle.

2740,Dance Moms, My Re-Do Review,"Dance Moms is set in The Abby Lee Dance Company and is a drama based show focusing on the mothers and the dance instructor Abby.The show is on it's third season and currently a ratings goldmine. So what makes this show so addictive? Well its the characters and relationships. Abby is the instructor who has little patience for any mistakes and the mothers constant prying. She is not the main source of the problem but a big one (no pun intended). She has yelled, demeaned and even caused the girls to cry but at the same time she does seem to care. She has shown some level of love for her students and seems to want them to succeed in their ventures.<br/><br/>The moms are rather high privileged women with a great deal of hatefulness for the dance instructor. One in particular named Kelly has got up and quit before and even came back because her daughters didn't want to leave their friends. Jill is quite fickle at times. She will tell Abby of the things the moms do and then turn around to call Abby names. She wants her child to be the best but her way of proving it is showering Abby with gifts.<br/><br/>The girls while not the main focus should be since sometimes the show paints them as unintelligent girls who are just pretty.<br/><br/>However Cathy is the one that seems to be the catalyst for all the hate on the show. Cathy has hit, spit poured water down the heads of the moms and insulted the girls. She has very little patience for failing and is one sore loser. She is known for using her money for everything such hiring other dance instructors to do her job for her and even paying for ridiculous costumes.

2744,Dance Moms," Guilty pleasure, but I have a bunch of theories about Abby","I originally watched the Dance Moms Collection and the latest episode on YouTube.<br/><br/>My first theory is that I think that Abby may be a little jealous of the moms and maybe of the little girls who can dance. While they are all in their forties and married with children, Abby is single and her whole life is in that dance studio and she is very overweight and out of shape. <br/><br/>Does anyone ever notice that whenever anyone ever confronts Abby about her behavior that she changes the subject? <br/><br/>Anyway, sometimes I do think that Abby has to keep the dancer's moms in line. It is her studio and the moms need to understand that their daughters can't get a solo every week. The moms can be a little petty too.<br/><br/>At the same time, Abby screams at the girls until they cry, makes them feel bad if they don't get first every time, and openly plays favorites. She also has the girls dress and dance way too mature for their ages and has them making her political statements. All of these things are disturbing.<br/><br/>These moms get carried away too. My daughter is in dance class once a week for an hour. I wouldn't spend $10K a year for dance lessons for her. I also wouldn't invest tons of time on something she probably won't do when she is an adult. Fame doesn't last, even movie stars have to do something else once their time in the spotlight is over.<br/><br/>As far as Abby favoring Maddie, I think it is only natural for adults to like certain kids more than others. If I were Christi, I wouldn't continue putting my kid in that dance class if I felt my daughter wouldn't be getting a fair chance. I don't understand why the moms keep putting their kids through all that.<br/><br/>The last episode with Abby throwing a tantrum over a parking space in LA and not showing up to a competition---I saw a lot of changes. Most of the original dancers on the show are no longer there---no surprise. Abby only got one casting call for those girls---hmm...maybe Abby has developed a bad rep in LA and no one wants to give her a chance. <br/><br/>Here is my last theory. Without Kelly and Christi and possibly Holly leaving, there is not much to the show anymore. The only thing that might be entertaining is watching Jojo annoy Abby. This show will die out.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,1.0,19 February 2015
2745,Dance Moms, Neurotic moms &amp; gifted kids,"The children on this show are exceptionally talented due, in part to their teacher, Abby Lee. Unfortunately, the endless focus on the kids' neurotic and unstable moms take the focus away from what we really want to see: how the many hours, days, months, and years of practice ultimately culminate in beautiful, amazing, and occasionally weird dance performances. Ms Lee has often been compared to a remorseless dictator, whose only concern is the prestige of her company. She does, in fact, adore her kids. Hopefully, there will be less focus on the crazy moms and MORE focus on the kids, their progress, and most important of all - their performances! I recommend that children under age 12 not watch this show, given the constant 'bleeps' when the moms bicker, fight, and drink with each other.",14 out of 25 found this helpful.,7.0,10 September 2012

I've literally watched 30 min of season 2 ep 1 and think that the dance teacher is one of the worst human beings I've ever witnessed. How DARE she criticise and hound those poor little girls in the way she does. When its clear due to her beached whale status she would never even be able to dream of doing what they can. She is a total bully and the mothers on the show should have realised the psychological trauma that they were subjecting their little girls to (whilst they watched on and saw trophy's) this is disgusting.

2747,Co-Ed Confidential," Kitschy, funny, sexy and lacking any pretension to be anything more than it is","Network: Cinemax; Genre: Skinamax Comedy; Content Rating: TV-MA (for simulated sex, full frontal nudity, profanity); Perspective: Contemporary (star range: 1- 4); <br/><br/>Seasons Reviewed: 3 seasons (aka Co-Ed Confidential, Co-Ed Confidential: Sophmores, Co-Ed Confidential: Spring Break) <br/><br/>Deep down in the bowls of television obscurity lies a little Cinemax After Dark series called ""Co-Ed Confidential"". Amongst the rest of the soft core, late night sex shows that have given Skinemax it's reputation, ""Confidential"" is a damn near mind-blowing creation. Half porn, half sitcom. It's the closest thing the network has ever come to a real show- and a fun one at that.<br/><br/>The thing about porn, is that the traditional standards and rules don't apply. As long as there are half-way decent sex scenes (which ""Confidential"" has plenty of) , it can get away with anything. Bad acting, terrible writing, hapless directing. ""Confidential"" appears to know this and has a lot of fun with it, resulting in acting and writing that is better than anything else in the genre.<br/><br/>""Confidential"" is a take-off on the usual college fraternity comedy. The characters (with a largely rotating cast) are as minimalist as they should be, streamlined into one-note traits. Normally something I decry in a show, but the rules are different here and characters as deep as ""the nerd"", ""the jock"", ""the party animal"" are exactly what is required. It works because the performances are actually pretty good, in that they are perfectly in line with the material. James (Kevin Patrick) is the Van Wilder, the frat boy who has permanently set up shop at the Omega house and becomes the custodian of a group of incoming freshman who due to a wacky mix-up don't otherwise have residence. Residents include party girl Karen (Michelle Maylene), geek Larry (Bradley Joseph), Freddy (Andre Boyer) and Lisa (Sandra Luesse), whose trait as the virgin makes her a short-lived character despite being the best looking in the cast. The stories and drama center around ladies man James' on-again-off-again relationship with Ophelia (Hanna Harper), well played by both.<br/><br/>""Confidential"" is refreshing and surprisingly funny, both intentionally and unintentionally (though I suspect the unintentional kitschy moments may be jokes on us). Watch the show and you're going to get a fun mix of not-so-subtle pop culture references, movie quotes and lines to the effect of ""If we don't raise enough money to keep Double D's bar open, Dick Johnson will buy it and take over"". From the fights with the stiff campus Dean to James' loud, wacky shirts to the natural improbability of all the sex scenes and the drama of Ophelia and James break-ups, ""Confidential"" is the type of show that acknowledges cliché and can only be enjoyed by those that can revel it its absurdity. I can't decide if this is a surprise or not given the state of most TV, but in its own charming slap-dash sort of way, ""Co-Ed Confidential"" is actually funnier than a lot of the lame sitcoms on network TV. Given how clinically over-sexed most network sitcoms are – and given their inability to pay the sexual tension off- I'm willing to bet there are legions of shows that wish they were ""Co-Ed Confidential"". Plus, I'd put this show up against ANY of the endless National Lampoon or American Pie direct-to-DVD college movies.<br/><br/>My favorite episode of the series is ""Rolling Royce"" in which James' battle with Ophelia's fiancé Royce (Eric Aston) explodes in a class presidential election between the two in which James launched a ""Vote with your C**k"" campaign. Given that it aired in an election year, the sitcom/porn hybrid reached into a little political satire. I can honestly say I've never, ever, seen anything like that.<br/><br/>I've underplayed the soft-core aspect of the show, because frankly, that's actually not its strength. That's the surreal thing about it. Yet, the sex scenes in ""Confidential"" are actually fun. A stark contrast to the low-lit, melodramatic scenes you'll find in other shows which are limited to women finding their soul mates and making beautiful love to them while soft music croons over it. Oh please. Where fem-porn has taken over the soft-core genre, ""Confidential"" steps up to deliver for both genders. Yes, believe it or not, men actually watch soft-core porn too.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, in and out of the sex scenes, pops with punk, rock themes. I dare anyone not to watch the show and not rummage around the internet for a copy of ""Better than Me"", the show's ending theme.<br/><br/>Kitschy, funny, sexy, lacking any pretension to be anything more than it is, ""Co-Ed Confidential"" is a marriage of several familiar elements in a way that makes them all fresh and original again. I never thought I've be seeing a porn/sitcom hybrid. And even at that, what are the odds it will be as much pure fun as ""Co-Ed Confidential"". It's the first porn series strong enough with characters and story to deserve a mainstream DVD release. If you have Cinemax and aren't watching this show you're wasting your money.<br/><br/>* * * / 4",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,,12 April 2009
2748,Co-Ed Confidential, pretty good,"There is more of a story line than most porn, but there is also a lot of nudity and sex. The cool thing about it is that it's available on regular channels, so if you're looking for something quick and halfway decent it works. A lot of the episodes are really funny and portray an aspect of college life that is real, but that high schools and parents definitely wouldn't mention. It's funny, and there are romances that do and do not end well. The original story line, of how they all got into the house together, is pretty unrealistic- as, quite frankly, is the amount of sex- but a lot of the other aspects are true to life. I definitely loved the show. It was interesting and easy to get into, even after I'd missed the first couple of episodes.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,4 October 2008
2749,Co-Ed Confidential, Co-Ed Confidential,"""Co-Ed Confidential"" must be considered unique in the sense that it is one of the few pornos where the writers actually put effort into writing the screenplay. Normally, porn directors and writers simply hire several attractive girls, pay them to have sex with less attractive males (of course, you really need a bisexual to make an accurate determination on that point) and arrange for boring dialogue in between. The assumption, of course, is that the porno will be profitable, because of the graphic sex scenes.<br/><br/>But like ""Dream On"" (another series that comes to mind which is similar to the one reviewed here), this series is witty, amusing and original. For instance, I like the scene where Lisa (Sandra Luesse) tries to join a nunnery to safeguard her virginity. The joke here is an inside one because the head nun is played by a porn star well known in the 1990s. Another scene at the end has Karen's father remarking on how innocent and virtuous his daughter is -- he really has no idea that she is sexually uninhibited. And even the banter that occurs between the characters can be really interesting.<br/><br/>However, I do fault the series for a few things. Some of the sexual humor is base and the sex scenes can sometimes be quite boring. Most of the actors are average, which is not surprising since it is hard to find good actors in the porn industry. But Kevin Patrick, as James, really steals the show as the cool guy running the frathouse. He successfully portrays a character that is amusing, interesting and bit too clever for his own good.",11 out of 14 found this helpful.,7.0,5 May 2009
2750,Co-Ed Confidential, Comedy and Porn mix:,"It's actually an interesting mix when comedy and I guess porn mix, truly I never found it actually exciting, I can honestly say I watched it after the first episode because of the story and comedy value. Basically this premiered as a late night show on Cinemax around 6 months ago, about 6 college students living together and the various hijinks they cause and the experiences they go through. <br/><br/>If your looking for porn this might not be for you. If you don't mind an OK story and really college hijinks and problems that a person can relate to as a college student, I'd suggest it.<br/><br/>Just don't go into this expecting porn or anything along those lines, it's much closer to a comedy/drama with the occasionally sex scene mixed in advancing the overall story. <br/><br/>I Rate it high not because of the sex, but mostly because the story had me laughing the whole time.",16 out of 24 found this helpful.,9.0,25 March 2008

The cast couldn't be better because it features sexy young actors that have performed very well previously on this kind of cinema.<br/><br/>The humor is pretty good and could be compared to the one used in popular movie comedies such as ""American Pie"".

Mixing genres of comedy and sex is what started the sex movie industry in the 1960s--and was proven to be a doomed trend to fill theaters.

2753,Lexx, A Classic Cult Series,"I didn't like Lexx at first. This was mainly due to the fact that, like many other negative reviews I see here, I only caught odd episodes here and there. Not surprisingly, the story and characters made absolutely no sense whatsoever to me. As a result, I ignored this show for a long time. Luckily for me, I gave it another shot, from start to finish, and I can honestly say I enjoyed every episode (well....nearly every one....there were a few stinkers).<br/><br/>If you are thinking of giving it a go, make sure you see the initial four mini-movie episodes (the first season). Without the background on the characters and universe, much of what follows will be meaningless. I'll try and summarise the important parts below.<br/><br/>The plot centres mainly around Kai, last of the Brunnen-Gee, a dead assassin who is prophesied to bring about the destruction of His Divine Shadow (bad guy Emperor of the universe). Kai can be reanimated for brief periods of time to perform various tasks (mostly killing people). Unlike other shows such as Star Trek, the crew of the Lexx (giant, biological insect spacecraft) do not get along that well most of the time. In particular, 790 (a disembodied robot head) is particularly hateful of the male crew because of his love of Zev (a female love slave) who is another crewmember. The Lexx is captained by Stanley H Tweedle (a big coward) who has designs on Zev of his own. However, Zev only has eyes for Kai (the dead guy), so there is a weird love triangle thing going on there. Along the way, the crew gets joined by Lieka, a plant woman who likes Stan.<br/><br/>The show is very camp and played for laughs more often than not. As with most such shows, the plot and situations become less important with time. Instead the way the characters react and deal with the situations they find themselves in are far more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The mini-movies featured guest stars such as Tim Curry and Malcolm McDowell and were perhaps the better produced of all the series. Season 2 (the first proper series) focused on a new nemesis - Mantrid - and his designs on the universe. Season 3 is essentially one long episode cut into chunks, a formula that was recently copied by season 3 of Enterprise. And season 4 takes the crew to Earth, giving them the opportunity to interact with the 20th century in all its hideous glory.<br/><br/>Each season had its merits and pitfalls, just like each episode did. One of the interesting quirks was the limited cast list of extras. Actors reappeared from one episode (or season) to the next, playing different characters or in seasons 3 and 4, alternate versions of their previous characters. There is an explanation for this, but you'll have to watch the show to find out.<br/><br/>My favourite episode, ironically, is one of the least sensible. Entitled Brigadoom, it's a musical episode. Much of Kai's past is revealed through song and even now it brings a smile to my lips as I write, just thinking about it.<br/><br/>If you watch Lexx expecting to see Babylon 5, you'll be bitterly disappointed. It's pure fun, campy entertainment at its best. Treat it as such and you'll find it growing on you rapidly.",127 out of 134 found this helpful.,,8 December 2004
2754,Lexx," A weird, twisted, totally enjoyable experience","The Lexx series is the next step in (d)evolution for those of us who love and miss Dr. Who and Red Dwarf.  It contains all the quintessential characters, the cowardly and low-minded everyman, the aloof and mysterious dead guy that every girl *must* have, the beautiful and fierce heroine for the guys, and the biting wit of their robot companion.  Not to mention the Lexx itself, most powerful ship in the Light or Dark Universe.  Although often dismissed as hoky and low-budget (and it can be both), the Lexx series has strong characterizations, good solid writing with multiple story lines that always seem to come together seamlessly at the end (and that is NOT easy), and plenty of eye candy.  I highly recommend it.",30 out of 30 found this helpful.,,7 December 2000
2755,Lexx, Unlike anything you've seen before,"The unlikely paring of Germany and Canada resulted in ""Lexx: the dark zone stories"" four telemovies which spawned the hit cult TV series simply named ""Lexx"". The movies themselves remain pinacles of the alternative sci-fi genre. The first episode sees Stanley H Tweedle (A security guard who accidently destroyed 94 reform planets, played to perfection by Brian Downey), Zev Belringer of B3k (A young woman who was transformed into a love slave for<br/><br/>failing to perform her wifely duties, a freak accident occured during her transformation leaving her part Cluster lizard; portrayed in her first incarnation by Eva Habermann), Kai (an emotionless undead assasin, played by Michael McManus) and 790 (the robot who worked on Zev was decapitated and it's head given the ""falling-in-love"" part of the transformation thus 790 fell madly in love with his subject; voiced to perfection by series writer Jeffery Hirschfield) unite by chance on ""The Cluster"" the planet ruled by almost eternal His Divine shadow who rules the universe, and accidently steal the LEXX (a 10 kilometre long dragonfly, also the most powerful weapon ever built/grown). After their intial escape from the Orwellin-like rule of His Shadow the ""crew"" escape into the dark zone, a paraell uinverse of chaos. The show is not only well designed, written and acted it also manages to combine genres such as horror, comedy, sci-fi and fantasy all at once. The regluar cast perform wonderfully in one hell of a love triangle: Stan wants Zev, Zev wants Kai but Kai is dead and wants nothing. While 790 wants to kill Stan (and any other living male Zev comes in contact with) find a body and have Zev all to himself. So if you want some thing a bit diffrent to Star-trek, something a bit more on the edge you'll find it and a whole lot more in Lexx. Check out the series where things become a whole lot more weird!",41 out of 42 found this helpful.,10.0,19 May 2001
2756,Lexx," Strange, But Endearing","Most science fiction deals with characters who are altruistic or malevolent, and have stories that are simple, with good guys defending against bad guys.  ""Lexx"" is different, in that it explores the amoral side of humanity not by showing these usually undesirable traits not just in minor characters, but in the main characters, in the crew of the Lexx itself.  There is a Dark Man, an unemotional and undead assassin, defender of the crew.  But then there are the half-lizard nymphomaniac, the unintelligent ""dirty old man"" (who somehow became the Captain of the Lexx through an accident), the robot head driven by love-psychosis, and the sentient, organic Lexx itself, a living ship and slave to the Captain who, if unchecked, would be content in destroying or feeding on organic life in the form of other space ships or entire planets.<br/><br/>The questionable desires of the crew are usually left unfulfilled in the episodes, and morality and good win out in the end over immorality and evil, but not before a thorough exploration of self-indulgent natures and evil.<br/><br/>True, the low-budget nature of the series may make it ideal for viewing in late night hours as an alternative to infomercials, but the series is nothing if not imaginative.  Other series have cropped up since, with similar themes of a powerful space ship crewed by fools and lechers, but ""Lexx"" is definitely unique in that its flawed characters are so familiar that they become endearing.",54 out of 60 found this helpful.,,3 April 2004

2758,Lexx, The American Red Dwarf ... Made By Canadians and Germans,"My husband and I first caught Lexx during a marathon on the Sci-Fi channel in 2000. Up until that point, Sci-Fi's ad campaign was so wretched that neither of us bothered to watch the show. Although the episodes in the marathon didn't make a lot of sense (Sci-Fi aired the Season 2 episodes out of order) we were hooked by the black humor, the funky music, and the show's overall stylishness.<br/><br/>I think the show was a lot smarter than most people realize.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Lexx is the American Red Dwarf. Fans of Red Dwarf know that the British creators once tried to sell the show to a US network ... and failed. Attempts at Americanizing Red Dwarf included adding more sex and ""adventure"" to the show while keeping the jokes and action squeaky clean. It didn't work. But Lexx succeeded where Red Dwarf failed by being hip and gritty.<br/><br/>Of the first four Lexx movies only the first and fourth are truly must-see material. The middle episodes feature fun cameos but don't really advance the plot ... they've always felt like filler designed to stretch out the production budget. But the first and last movies are sci-fi gems. Funny, sick, and slick all at the same time, they really solidified the mood of the show.<br/><br/>Episode for episode, Season 2 IS the heart of Lexx. The season offers up the most spot-on humor and the most interesting plots. The season bore a few misses (the hillbilly episodes mainly) but the shows are consistently enjoyable if you appreciate the bizarre. The running gag in which every new character introduced dies by the end of each episode never turns stale. The main characters grow with the plot throughout the season. There's even a thoroughly enjoyable MUSICAL episode toward the end (my favorite Lexx episode).<br/><br/>Season 3 was a complete misfire. I'm surprised Lexx survived to see a fourth season ... that how weak Season 3 is. A plot that should have lasted two episodes is stretched into an entire season. All of the character growth seen in Season 2 is tossed out the window. The episodes drag out via poor pacing, asinine logic, and de-emphasized humor. And the season only got worse as it went along. I didn't enjoy Season 3 when it aired, and it still sucks on DVD ... especially when compared to every other incarnation of Lexx.<br/><br/>Season 4 was a worthy successor to Season 2 and a return to form. It's a shame that the fourth season based several plot threads on the third season because, ideally, viewers should be able to skip Season 3 altogether. While the fourth season isn't as strong as the second, it comes pretty damned close. I was skeptical about the ""Lexx comes to modern earth"" theme... but through creativity and a keen sense of satire, Lexx's creative team pulled off a plot device that no other Sci-fi show has been able to successfully tackle (re: Battlestar Galactica 1980). There are some episodes that go nowhere (sadly the prison episode, which employs two actors from Red Dwarf, is one of the most disposable episodes) and the characters go through the exact same growth pattern seen in Season 2. But I give the creators props for having the balls to inject caustic anti-American sentiments into the season ... given the post 9-11 culture in which they were released AND the fact that it was the first incarnation of Lexx to be heavily promoted in the US. Sometimes the anti-American elements are too heavy-handed and belie a superficial grasp of US culture, but that's OK. It works more than it doesn't. The creators did a much better job at managing a continuing storyline than they did in previous seasons ... culminating in a truly rousing and tragic conclusion.<br/><br/>I also applaud the creators for ending their pet project decisively. Sure, there MIGHT be another Lexx someday, but the conclusion of Season 4 didn't leave any loose ends or nagging issues.<br/><br/>Warts and all, Lexx stands as one of the most interesting and innovative sci-fi shows ever attempted. I have a feeling that this show will grow more popular with the passage of time.",105 out of 128 found this helpful.,,21 February 2004

2760,Lexx, This is absolutely brilliant and so funny!,"No, you have never seen anything like that! The most vivid, merry, cynical, kinky, bizarre, crooked and wry TV show made a mini film. And, this is just awesome. If you have no sense of humor, or if you take the space films too seriously, then this is not for you. Instead, if you are open-minded and do not mind the unimaginably crooked and even slightly perverse sense of humor, then this is for you. The very idea is just a hilarious space farce. A group of the most mismatched fugitives enter the board of Lexx, the semi-dragonfly, semi-spaceship, which is the most dangerous weapon of X distraction in both Universes. And the crew is unbearably bad for each other - well, all of the members could have never made it at all, be it not for the time and space. Stanley H. Tweedle is a chance captain of the Lexx, and he is small, cowardly, lascivious, cunning and cautious man, who is never fit for such a grand job. He always is hungry, both in his stomach and sexually. But all his tries on Xev Bellinger, a stunning blonde sexy beauty, are a failure. And she loves Kai, the last of the mysterious race Brunnen Gee, but he is 2000-years dead and he is a Divine Shadow's Killer. Then, there is a talking robot head 790, who is madly in love with Xev, and thus this impossibly funny team travels all throughout the universe, trying to get a new home. Everything in this film is funny. There are jaw-dropping situations connected with sex, there are extremely funny planets that they visit... and all the time, your stomach is just achy of laughter.

2762,Lexx," ""The dead don't poo.""","The quote in my title, from Season 3, should be enough for you to rush out and find a copy of this great series. ""Lexx"" is the perfect embodiment of the 90s--the overlooked stepchild of the 80s--blending deadpan humor, dark themes, playful if not gratuitous sexuality, a healthy dose of cynicism, and some surpisingly deep &amp; challenging themes of morality, all wrapped up with a childish grasp of fantasy &amp; some of the coolest steampunk contraptions you've seen since HG Welles The Time Machine.<br/><br/>If you've seen any posters, you've probably realized that the major draw is the eye candy: the drop dead gorgeous Xenia Seeberg (""Xev"") who in at least 1 episode saves an entire planet by asphyxiating someone with her bosooms (now that's the kind of feminism we can all appreciate), but if you swing the other way there's also the beefcakey Michael McManus (""Kai"") who's a cross between Edward Scissorhands, Spock and a Navy Seal because he can kill you with a toothpick. Rounding out the troupe is their captain ""Stanley H. Tweedle"" (Brian Downey) who is the goofiest, most unqualified captain since Cap'n Crunch. There is also a hilarious disembodied robot head ""790"" suffering from considerable gender confusion.<br/><br/>But if you're expecting just a brainless, campy romp, you'll be surprised to see that a lot of these episodes pack some deep, philosophical and artistic power. I caught frequent allusions to classic films and art, such as the Season 3 episode ""Gondola"" which is a loving nod to the 1944 Hitchcock film ""Lifeboat"". In another episode, ""Tunnels"", art fans may recognize sets that are recreations of M.C. Escher (the artist known for drawing impossible figures). And the season 2 episode ""Lafftrak"" is the greatest (and I'm pretty sure the only) scifi homage to Three's Company, General Hospital &amp; possibly a Van Halen video (Hot for Teacher?). Another fantastic episode to watch for is Season 2 ""Brigadoom"" which is a MUSICAL based on (any guesses?) Zeigfeld's 1947 ""Brigadoon"". And that's not all; there are some great scenes when the action, comedy and campiness take a break and we get some fascinating dialogue on spirituality, reincarnation, fatalism and the meaning of life. And of course the novel concept of the antihero (a ship full of outcasts who are either amoral, immoral or just plain zombies) was beautifully and charmingly presented here.<br/><br/>Also don't be fooled by the dated 90s cgi. Although the computer special effects may sometimes seem cheezy by today's standards, the actual sets and locations are impressive. A co-production between Canada &amp; Germany, ""Lexx"" flew all around the world to find the right locations such as the deserts of Namibia, locations in Thailand, and of course the companies' home bases in Nova Scotia and Berlin.<br/><br/>This series had everything. Good stories, good action, great eye candy, surprisingly excellent acting, and just the perfect vibe of the 90s. As we entered the new millennium, our taste for scifi &amp; fantasy turned to more serious, disturbing dramas like Battlestar Galactica and Lost. I consider ""Lexx"" to be the last and most potent dose of 90s awesomeness before the end of an era.<br/><br/>A final note: if you're on the hunt for the best copy of Lexx (which unfortunately is not available on blu-ray as of today 20 years later), look for the original Canadian DVD release on Acorn Media (2002) or Alliance (2012). Newer releases by Echo Bridge appear to be squashed down to fit on fewer discs and that sorta kills the video quality which is already in need of remastering. The entire 4-season series should span 19 discs, so beware of squashed cut versions that cram the whole show onto 9 or fewer. Also I've read that there's censorship on the American releases, Echo Bridge &amp; Syfy (sexual jokes and some totally gratuitous but much appreciated nudity). Jeepers, someone needs to release this on blu-ray already! I've been petitioning The Criterion Collection to get their butts in gear but they just keep telling me to get a life. Pfft. One way or another, get your hands on this series and have a blast.",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,23 February 2020
2763,Lexx, I love this show. It is Science fiction for adults.,"I love this show.  It is Science Fiction for adults.  By that I mean that it has a sense of humor, which can be appreciated by adults.  It is sexy, in a nice way, not pornographic.  Xenia Seeberg is terrific as Zev Bellringer. Her facial expressions are priceless and show that she is a truly talented actress, not just another pretty face (and body).  The rest of the cast is superb.  Kai has the coolness of a Mr. Spock, and Stanley Tweedle is all that the name would imply.  The special effects can be spectacularly elaborate or comically cheesy when appropriate.  LEXX, the most powerful weapon of destruction in the two universes, is the most entertaining Science Fiction program on the planet.",37 out of 45 found this helpful.,,24 April 2000
2764,Lexx," No doubt, this is great!","This serial is equal in the sense of humor to Labyrinth with David Bowie or Jim Henson's Muppet Show, as the crooked, wry and acerbic irony here is just overwhelming. The very story is just hilariously cool, as we see the talking spaceship, Lexx, which is in fact a living insect, but a huge one and unbearably droopy and always praising Stanley Tweedle, an unlikely hero, who owns it and is always willing Xev. Xev is a nice sweet space woman, and then there is Kai, the last of the dead people race, and he is cool, handsome and never shows any sense of humor or irony, but can help hapless Stan whenever he is in deep trouble. There is also a talking robot head that wants have some sex with Kai, but no one can imagine how on earth. This story has everything turned upside down - we see the planet of some terrible bureaucrats, then the planet of fire and the planet of water. Then, we see the adventures of Kai when he has to be keep in the soil to keep him well, or the story of Xev when she turns to a lizard or some other unearthly monster... The first season is very specific, with 4 larger series, each looking more like a real full movie. And here we see the impossible corrupt and terribly mean Divine Order of His Divine Shadow, and then there are the courageous space heretics who try to steal the Lexx, then there is Stan who by a mere chance gets the key to the Lexx and escapes with Xev and Kai and 790. Here, in the 1 season, we come across the cameo appearance of Ruthger Hauer and Malcolm McDowell, and the series are very strong and thrilling. The second season is mostly a collection of shorter mini series, about Lexx's team long wanderings in space, looking for some good planet, some food and some sex for Stan and Zev. We see the Nook - planet of men only and then we are worried by impossibly evil Mantrid who seeks Lexx all the time, and then we laugh heartily when the whole series is a Opera show. The third season is mostly Fire and Water planets' adventure, with evil Prince, likewise terrible Fifi taking part, then with sweet and nice Bunny and Stan even going to Hell. The last fourth season takes us to Earth and this is a wry anti-US critics, a clear farce and a great bunch of hearty laughs. We meet all the old staff - Lyekka, Bunny, Prince among many, we see the impossibly silly President Priest and many other earthly creatures who are so freaky that seem worse than any of the extra-mundane objects in previous seasons... Watch all of them - you will never be sorry! It is impossible to convey the unreal cool and superb humor, the adult jokes and the impossibly funny situations there. This is a serial for adult but also for very clever watchers. Watch it by all means, as you have never seen anything like this and will hardly see any other.",32 out of 39 found this helpful.,10.0,1 September 2006
2765,Lexx, While not the most exciting it will appeal greatly to sci fi fetishists and lovers of the obscure,"The series is enjoyable for its darkly entertaining sci-fi themed fetishist nature. It isn't meant to be deeply thought provoking in the normal sense, it is designed to be outside the box and provide an alternative to Kevin Sorbo firing blasts at everything. I enjoy it thoroughly for the mere fact that it does not follow normal conventions for a science fiction show and it dares to write story lines that appeal to the subcultures of sci-fidom. The plot is not the most inventive, but the banter and atmospheric situation of the show makes for a very enjoyable watch, especially late night when it normally airs. i highly recommend it to people who like science fiction that thinks outside normal sci-fi convention.",31 out of 38 found this helpful.,,30 March 2005
2766,Lexx, The best ever,"This series is simply the best ever to grace the TV screens of our little planet. It has the coolest characters, great special effects and shots, plus the most absolutely evil characters ever created, that put your typical bond villain to shame. The comedy is at times extremely dark, involving all sorts of gore and cool stuff like that. Eva Habermann as Zev is one of the most luscious looking characters ever, she was better than Xenia Seeberg (no disrespect to Xenia), Kai is so cool, and 790 is a love crazed robot head.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also brilliant, especially the 2 mercenaries, who add an extra touch of dark humor. If you have a chance to see it, you must. You would never be able to live with yourself if you missed out.

2767,Lexx, COOL MINI-SERIES!,"This is my favourite TV sci-fi to date! Totally different to your usual Star Trek, this tv programme doesn't take itself seriously Star Trek fashion and the humour is entertaining.<br/><br/>What makes this so great is its originality. This is the virtually the opposite of every cliche you see in sci fi. For example....<br/><br/>1) Stanley Tweedle. He is a coward, but oddly endearing in a way, you have to feel sorry for him. His antics are also ridiculous! He is also the commander of the Lexx and he's definitely no cowboy Captain Kirk.<br/><br/>2) The Lexx. No flash chrome coloured starship, but a gigantic, insect spaceship that eats its prey! It also behaves as though its alive - because it is!<br/><br/>3) 790 robot head. Has more of a personality than Data, in love with Zev, how's that for originality???<br/><br/>4) Kai, the 2000 year old dead Brunnen G 'anti-hero'. His attitude toward Zev is completely the opposite of how a 'normal' hero would behave toward her! And also Zev, being part cluster lizard...<br/><br/>Having only recently found out there is a Lexx series on the net, we've yet to see it here in NZ.

2768,Lexx, Refreshingly original,"After so many other scifi shows that can't ever seem to get away from earth-based humans as the main backdrop, we have a completely new and original universe with a refreshing lack of moral conviction as a basis for plot building. In fact, the twisted irony of cosmic justice never quite prevails in the coolest blend of both tragedy and comedy I've ever witnessed. Of course the graphics are awesome, makes American made Trek look pretty pale, and the bad guy beats Vadar fingernails down. Theater students will find this show particularly appealing, especially as the series develops. The makeup, costuming, and set design are as refreshingly original as the story. Music students will be captivated by the soundtrack, which manages to sound entirely alien (from humans) in a lonely and hostile universe without sounding anything like the typical human interpretation of alien. I'm also fond of warship/spaceship construction-- I would LOVE to have a Lexx of my own! One more thing: inventing an entirely new and different cultural history is no small feat, and the energy that went into this film only comes from the best of the best. An entire universe hangs on the coolest twist of ironic fate, not on some slick protocol in a bureaucratic federation or an enraged teen with a lightsaber. And a lot of it is subtle. It's not all patly spelled out for you. Enjoy the ride!",36 out of 47 found this helpful.,,4 November 2004
2769,Lexx, Totally underrated!,"When I first saw this show about a year ago I thought it was just weird. But as I found out the more I watched it, there are to kinds of weird shows. The ones that at just weird and stupid (step forward, Dr Who) and the ones that are weird and interesting, like this one. It's a really refreshing alternative to the more ""serious"" sci-fi-shows out there (like Star Trek and so on, although a absolutely adore DS9), and has some really fascinating plots and characters. I started watching in the middle of the seasons, and only later discovered, in my eyes, my favorite sci-fi-actress of all time (Eva Habermann). She is the only reason I gave Lexx a rating of 8. If she'd been on the whole show it would have been a 10. All in all, a great show and well worth a look.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,24 February 2012
2770,Lexx, Brilliantly bizarre,"Lexx has to be the craziest, strangest, and most bizarre shows in TV history.<br/><br/>It's about 4 characters: <br/><br/>Zev/Xev is a love slave. Stan is level 4 security guard. Kai is the last of his kind, a dead assassin. 790, is a robot head.<br/><br/>Mixed together, they make probably the most ineffective team in history of TV. But that's one of the things that gives this series flavor: it is always fun to see how they interact with each other and things around them. And also, their bond grows stronger progressively in the series, even if they don't notice it and refuse to acknowledge it.<br/><br/>Then, there is the all-present sexual frustration. This series is never afraid to deal with sex, In fact, one could say that the story is driven by sex. But, don't make that mistake; this show deals with love, pain, suffering, romance, evil, good, society... And it's one of the most intelligent ones out there!<br/><br/>This is one of the best series ever made. But i must warn you, it's not for everyone. I'm recommending this only to the open-minded people, who are not afraid to deal with sexual themes, or other bizarre stories this show has.<br/><br/>Also, it's not for you if you're seeking pure sci-fi.

2771,Lexx, Weird / Sexy / Funny,"Oh, I love this show so much. Originally, I saw Season 1 and part of Season 2 back in the day on the Sci-Fi channel. I can't remember why exactly that I didn't see any more but I was left pining for more.<br/><br/>It's a show I've often thought about since then and occasionally searched for an affordable way of watching the whole run. And then I got the DVD set for my birthday and my wife and I watched the whole lot in a couple of months. Bliss.<br/><br/>On the whole, I love it. It has some pretty major flaws though but these only add to it's greatness for me. I love it's quirks and imperfections, they really add to it: there are moments of occasional awfulness. But then of sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>The show features four seasons and the story does conclude at the end of season 4. Each season is different from the others in style and story. And particularly seasons 3 and 4 have strong story arcs that sometimes have kind-of-chapters of a few episodes until the main story moves on. This works really well.<br/><br/>At the heart of this show there is a light-heartedness and strong comedic values. Although themes can be pretty heavy sometimes, they are mostly appropriate to the story and the writing doesn't allow for the show to take itself too seriously. Apart from the comedy, sexual themes feature very heavily on Lexx, it's in most episodes and a strong motivational force for the characters and drives some of the story lines. It's done well, and grounds the characters rather than fetishises them, makes them more human. Still, this might still put some off.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent all the way through the show. It's great to see actors cast from Europe as well as North America, it's so refreshing and gives the Lexx a unique feel. The main cast really are their characters and grow into people you really care about, or despise. And there are many strong performances from supporting actors too, it's a shame they don't remain for longer.<br/><br/>Lexx is science fiction at it's sexiest, funniest and most certainly weirdest. There probably won't be anything quite like it again. Unique in it's over-the-top, bizarre stories and characters; it revels in itself, celebrates it's characters for their weaknesses, and is totally in love with itself.

2772,Lexx, Paul Donovan's masterpiece,"The Donovan brothers have tried hard to keep a industry in the Maritimes. Michael Donovan has produced a number of hits with Rick Mercer. However, although Paul Donovan has made some popular movies such as Life With Billy and Buried on Sunday, he hasn't had anything really critically acclaimed up to this. Even watching Paint Cans you cannot tell this was made by the same person.    Paul Donovan, with the help of Lex Gigeroff and Jeffrey Herschfeild, has created not only one whole Universe parrellel to our own, but a whole new unknown universe in which we reside in 9though it is not until the show that we figure out which is which).     Brian Downey could replace Gordon Pinsent as the great actor from Newfoundland. He's been settling for small roles for far too long. He's very talented and one reason alone to watch the mini-series. Michael McManus as Kai is just as good. Even though I perfer Xenia Seeberg as Xev because she's funnier, Eva Habberman has more of that fierce energetic quality about her that Xev doesn't. A whole different twisted universe that is worth seeing even if you're not a fan of the show.

Even then, its quirkiness made it watchable.<br/><br/>Now, with full knowledge of the overlying plot and background I must say this is probably the most impressive sci-fi epic I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I had no idea the tale itself was so captivating, the background history of the universes involved so superbly imagined.<br/><br/>It's adult, dark, violent and frequently tongue-in-cheek.<br/><br/>It reminds me of the groundbreaking sci-fi comic book epics of the 2000ad comic back in the 70s and 80s - genuine enthusiasm and love put into developing the tale and characters; nothing done by committee nor with an eye on sell-thru merchandising.<br/><br/>So the story itself is deserving of praise before the execution, limited by TV budgets and tech available at the time, can be considered.<br/><br/>The effects overall are pretty decent given the former, the sets and acting above TV average - more than convincing in its entirety for you to suspend disbelief and invest time in a truly memorable bit of sci-fi.<br/><br/>Truly, though, it is the epic story - the most crucial fundament - which carries the day; so worthy that it would still deserve praise had the whole thing been played out only with hand puppets.<br/><br/>If half the integrity and belief had been invested into the Star Wars franchise it would have avoided its ultimate descent into deserved derision.<br/><br/>Lexx is the Star Wars they never made but should have; the more deserving, more adult and more talented sibling that will only take the limelight and plaudits in retrospect.<br/><br/>There is, however, still plenty time to give us the big-budget movie version.

After watching this series I expected every casting director and agent in America beating her door down with offers.  A breakout role for her, as Zev Bellringer, this series is the tale of a small band of rebels fighting through and fleeing from the evil leader ""His Shadow"" and his followers.  This fantasy has all the elements of a good flick; Action, adventure, suspense, comedy and creative thinking by the writers.  My favorite, never-before-seen, concept was the use of half insect/half machine spacecraft.  With all Lexx (Tales From a Parallel Universe in the US)has to offer, my interest was held fast by Eva.  I was smitten.  I can't remember seeing a sexier, more refreshing female on the screen.  She is a much needed breath of fresh air.  Don't just take my word for it.  See it for yourself.

I thought it so original, unique and quite mesmerising, and I never missed an episode. I felt that it was almost like an ""other worldly"" production, quite unrecognizable I'm sure, to the average Star Wars/Star Trek fan. No disrespect intended, its just I feel that those progs had values and morals, based squarely around earthly and, dare I say it, American models, projected to you. Happy endings are not always the most satisfying! Due to career pressures I had to move to another part of the country, where, I kid you not, Ch 5 could not be received!

2777,Lexx, I sorely miss Lexx...,"I don't remember exactly when I first got hooked on ""Lexx"". It must have been 1998 or 1999. I just remember thinking, ""Wow, they would never do that on 'Star Trek!"" I grew up watching ""Star Trek"" and other less popular sci-fi shows, also all of the Trek spin-offs. I have also seen all of the ""Star Wars"" movies. I must admit, even though I love Trek, I got sick of the way everything was so polite and proper. And the ""Star Wars"" movies seemed too juvenile and unsophisticated. Also, in both Trek and Wars, where were the hot chicks? Well, Lexx certainly had that covered, and it was also wildly original and almost cliché-free.<br/><br/>It's basically about a fugitive coward who accidentally gets control of the most powerful and destructive space ship in the known universe: a planet destroying, living insectoid starship. His small crew is basically made up of a half- man eating worm, half love-slave and an undead assassin who reminds me of a tall, gaunt Robert Smith of the Cure. Also there is a whiny, insulting robot head called 790 who is in love with the love slave. He provides most of the humor in his biting insults. He is also pretty hilarious looking. I can't help but crack up at the way he looks and sounds! <br/><br/>Well, this show was really strange and bizarre, with moments of brutality, sexuality, and dark humor absent in most sci-fi series. It also avoided most of the lame cliché's a lot of shows like ""Babylon 5"", ""Farscape"", and ""Andromeda"" had, mainly silly looking aliens, square-jawed heroes, laser battles, etc. etc. The Lexx universe is cruel, and very strange looking. It reminds me of ""Dune"", the books, not the movie. In Lexx, no one is completely good, and most are selfish.<br/><br/>Also, the series finale was great, and could lead to a series continuation. Unfortunately, the Sci-Fi channels doesn't show re-runs! They are too busy showing stupid monster movies, ""Stargate"", and re-running the same 3 mini- series.

2778,Horrible Histories, One of the best children's TV programmes ever written!,"'Horrible Histories' is a show comprising sketches and songs based around a range of different historical periods such as Measly Middle Ages, Slimy Stuarts, Terrible Tudors and Savage Stone Age, often focusing on British history but also covering the history of other nations and peoples such as Groovy Greeks, Rotten Romans and Incredible Incas. The show is based on the hugely popular books by Terry Deary (who plays the occasional cameo!) and features animations by Martin Brown.<br/><br/>The whole show from start to finish is just hilarious. I became addicted earlier this year watching repeats of the first series, and was overjoyed when the second series was aired a few months later. The sketches are incredibly clever - many of them are take-offs of popular shows such as Wife Swap, Ready Steady Cook and This Is Your Life. There's even a catchy, cleverly-written song in each episode which you'll find yourself humming about the house for days afterwards! It's great that the episodes are so funny but also of course it gets kids (and adults!) learning more about history which is no bad thing! And even though it is primarily aimed at children, it's obvious it's meant to entertain the grown-ups just as much! I think there's so many children's series that have come out over the years which are peddled as 'comdedy' for children but they just end up patronising them with 'gags' that they can see coming a mile off and are rarely funny at all - 'HH' credits its young viewers with a lot more intelligence I think.<br/><br/>But I must mention that even though the writing, structure and general concept of the show are inspired, what really makes the show what it is is its fantastic cast, many of whom contribute to the writing. Mathew Baynton, Martha Howe-Douglas, Jim Howick, Ben Willbond, Laurence Rickard and Sarah Hadland (as well as a whole host of others) are all brilliant in their countless roles - they seem to put a lot of thought into maximising the hilarity of each sketch and basically just do their job really well! My favourite moments are too many to list although I particularly like the medieval paramedics, the Will Somers sketch, Mathew Baynton's parody of a certain TV fashion makeover guru and the Franciso Pizzaro Rough Guide. I also love the Boudica, Charles II, four King Georges and Spartan High School Musical songs (the last just seems to get funnier with each viewing!). Just catch the repeats on CBBC or buy the DVD if you've yet to see it - if you have kids they'll love it, and even if you don't, you should like it anyway!",34 out of 36 found this helpful.,9.0,9 September 2010

I was searching for funny shows to watch in the evenings to help me decompress after a hard days work, and this show does the job. <br/><br/>I don't know how accurate it is; For example, the costumes for the Incas and Aztecs are almost identical and in some cases, the backdrop and props look more like something you'd see in a South Pacific village rather than Mezo America. But that's okay because the show is wonderfully funny. I watch it solely for its comical merit and not historical accuracy. <br/><br/>The humor is intelligent, sharply witty and sometimes grossly juvenile; reminiscent of The Monty Python skits from back in the day.

My favourites have to be Simon Farnaby, Jim Howick &amp; Lawrence Lewin.<br/><br/>You learn the most interesting things, how Hitler would be in such a Paddy if he was awoken from his sleep, How they identified who was guilty and who was innocent in the middle ages by eating a piece of cake! Diogenes would pee on you if you insulted him! Other sketches to consider are, The prisoner of War, life in the trenches.<br/><br/>They Also mimic other TV shows and use it for some hilarious gags, for example Wife Swap, Hisorical Masterchef, Apprentice, Eastenders, Gok Wans Fashion Fix (minus the Gok Wan) Ready Steady Feast and many more. I wouldn't spend a second of my time watching these shows if they were on TV, but i have watched the horrible histories versions again &amp; again and still laugh as hard as i did when i first watched it.<br/><br/>My favourite character has to be Caligula, and i wish there were more of him, he reminds me of Pontious Pilate in Monty Pythons Life of Brian, but a bit more crazier, he seriously reduces me to tears of laughter, him, his speech impediment &amp; his mallet who he lovingly names Wackus Bonkus.<br/><br/>There are so many other sketches, the accents are spot on and make me laugh too, and the way they give random Era's a different accent, who would think King Pepi of ancient Egypt had a southern American accent?? Well he didn't, but it made me laugh all too hard.<br/><br/>This sketch show is the new Monty Python, and i hope one day The Monty Python Clan &amp; The Horrible Historie Clan collaborate to make the ultimate sketch show.<br/><br/>The newer series feature more songs, which are all rooted from popular cult classics, but the lyrics changed. Although i do not watch these and try to avoid them (not my style!) i will admit they are a fantastic way to help children memorise crucial information.<br/><br/>And the winner of Two Bafta Awards two years in a row, the show must be fantastically hilarious and amazing!

2783,Horrible Histories, The Best Way To Learn History,"Horrible Histories is one of the best shows on children's television; with catchy songs and entertaining jokes, this show really is the best way to learn about history.<br/><br/>When this show first aired I was starting high school and hated history, I couldn't remember anything and was getting bottom marks in every test. This show saved my grades, every episode meant that a large amount of information became lodged in my head. From Vikings to King Charles II to the Civil Rights Movement, this show covers a lot with coherence and clarity even being clever enough to make spoofs of popular shows and TV adverts ('we buy any monk.com!') that ring true to modern British culture. This should not, however, restrict its audience though since it is an easily accessible show that has something for everyone. <br/><br/>Now what truly makes Horrible Histories special are the amazing covers of popular songs. After six years I still find myself singing to 'Born To Rule' and 'My Name Is Charles'. The catchy lyrics will get stuck in your head faster than the Flash can run and will help you learn. The one downside is that you may get weird looks if you start to sing out loud to the songs in public (Trust me on this!). Everyday life has never been the same, but my friends and I have had great fun trying and failing to sing our favourite songs in tune.<br/><br/>Overall this show is a must watch, especially if you like history or comedy.

However, I am not sure if the other reviewers have fully cottoned on to the exquisite way in which the work can at times rise to being both funny and moving at the same time. Cases in point are the ""We fighter pilots..."" song (about the Battle of Britain), and now recently the Magna Carta song (produced in time for the 800th anniversary thereof). Both songs are attractive visually, catchy as musical creations, funny, informative and ... distinctly moving! That's a nice and clever and unusual trick if you can pull it off, and these guys certainly can! Much-deserved congratulations to them, therefore. Their world-beating work fusing education with entertainment offers us yet another reason to be ""proud to be British"".",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,,26 June 2015
2785,Horrible Histories, Season 6 - New Cast a Dud :(,"We're really not liking it. It doesn't have that flow. The old cast had a good rapport &amp; worked so well together. This new cast is very wooden. It's like they're playing their role, but not living it. The old cast really looked like they were having FUN! <br/><br/>I don't know why CBBC decided to do this. It's completely turned my family off the series. Perhaps it's the writing The episodes are just too disjointed to hold a child's attention. Each episode is focused on something specific in history - Napoleon, the Magna Carta, Henry VII. It looks like it should flow, rather than the old method of skits of many different historical facts, but it doesn't. It's too dry and not jaunty enough. The cast just looks so uncomfortable and out of place.<br/><br/>Very sad to see the series go like this.

It is so cleverly scripted and acted, the cast are phenomenal and the new cast doesn't even compare they are so unnatural - as Netflix has realised as they only have the original seasons. I am constantly singing the songs and this has taught me so much more history than school.

2796,Horrible Histories, Fantastic! It broke the mold on children's television,"for years, I've cringed at TV programming for children. Either the content is boring, politically correct or has no educational value. Horrible Histories is educational, funny and takes risks. It's also wonderful to see great representation by men and women in a balanced way (it's almost unheard of ... Although I'm turning a blind eye to the sexist ""girl power"" song that never should have been included - if you're not willing to say boy power, don't do girl power: you just demoralize young boys by doing so). The acting and writing is excellent. The historical facts are both fascinating and humorous. As a parent, my 10 year old squirmed through a number of gags (which is good - it is ""horrible"" after all). I often had to explain how things were mis-represented (eg. Caligula wasn't an idiot - he was very dangerous. People would have taken his lunatic ideas seriously for fear of death). Another example was the ""take a seat"" gag for the Stone Age sketches. I felt the need to dispel the fallacy that Stone Age means stupid. That's simply modern arrogance that we are only smart today. I was very happy to see a later episode showed Stone Age as not-so-stupid. Also, the show harps on about Vikings killing monks - it got very repetitive after the same point was repeated continually. But, don't let these small details put you off. The acting and writing is brilliant. It gets kids interested in history. It challenges our understanding of our ancestors. It's very entertaining for young and old. If you love Monty Python, you'll almost certainly love Horrible Histories. Keep an eye out for Master Chef, Tudors and Ancient Greece.

2803,Cheyenne," ""The Lonely Gunfighter: The Legacy of Cheyenne""","Running 107 episodes, from 1955 through 1963, ""Cheyenne"" was one of the first ""television"" productions from the Warner Brothers film studio. Clint Walker plays the title character, an ex-frontier scout who was raised by Cheyenne Indians after his parents were killed. <br/><br/>Cheyenne Bodie roams the West in the days after the Civil War, having adventures and helping folks out. The tall laconic hero would eventually become television's quintessential loner but actually started out with a sidekick named Smitty (L.Q. Jones) who was a mapmaker. Cheyenne and Smitty do mapping work for the Army and in this occupation stumble across the people who make up each episode's story. <br/><br/>The current DVD set covers the 15 episodes from Season One and includes a recent interview with Clint Walker called ""The Lonely Gunfighter: The Legacy of Cheyenne"". The reason there are only 15 episodes is because ""Cheyenne"" was only broadcast every third week, being part of an anthology series called ""Warner Brothers Presents"" which also included ""Casablanca"" (with Marcel Dalio) and ""King's Row"" (with Robert Horton and Jack Kelly). In subsequent seasons the anthology would feature shows like ""Conflict"", ""Sugarfoot"", and ""Bronco Lane"". <br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief, the episodes on the 1st season DVD have not been abbreviated. Although they run less that the normal 50 minutes (60 minutes minus commercials) it is because the original broadcasts took some additional minutes for Warner Brothers to use in promoting their coming attractions; with a behind the scenes look at one of their soon to be released features. <br/><br/>Also unique to the first season was an attempt to add scale to the stories by inserting a lot of stock footage of cattle drives, Indian attacks, and huge wagon trains. In general they did a better job than most ""B"" westerns of matching this footage to the back lot and sound stage stuff featuring the actual cast of each episode. But this technique and the busy schedule was a nightmare for the editors. The first episode ""Mountain Fortress"" includes a particularly amusing continuity issue. Watch how the sergeant and the trooper are killed early in an Indian attack, then magically reappear in a subsequent group shot. Most likely the editors noticed the problem but there was not time to re-shoot the scene with the correct cast. <br/><br/>At least two episodes take actual movie plots and retell them in a Western setting. ""Fury at Rio Hondo"" is a retelling of ""To Have and to Have Not"" with Peggy Castle outstanding in the Lauren Bacall role. ""The Argonaunts"" is a retelling of ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and features Rod Taylor.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know?

2804,Cheyenne, One wonderful western,"How wonderful to see the re-runs now of ""Cheyenne"". Clint Walker was my mother's favourite western actor. She loved the way he looked and the way he talked and his soft-spokeness. I don't think she would have cared if Mr. Walker could even act because he was so 'gorgeous' to her. Fortunately, he was terrific in his role and we never missed an episode. Those were the days of real television..the 'Golden' days, I think they call them and you can see why. Families could sit down and watch such great shows together and not worry about bad language or overt violence. Since I was growing up in England, I learned a lot about America and the old western days. It was fascinating and gave me the courage to come over and see it,years later.

2805,Cheyenne, The Warner Brothers Produced Westerns,"In commerating the Golden 50th Anniversary of this program,the series ""Cheyenne"" was one of the first television series produced by a major film studio of the era,and one of five western-adventure shows from Warner Brothers,and a couple dozen of other shows they did for the studio,which not only made Warners a household name,but also was the pinnacle status of the success of the American Broadcasting Company(that MADE that network)from the mid 1950's to the early 1960's under the stewardship of Executive Producer William T. Orr and the creative genius of Roy Huggins,who were also later on the driving force behind the Warner Brothers detective shows(in which all were on the same network)during that same period.<br/><br/>""Cheyenne"" was the first TV-western produced by the studio,and it is the most fondly remembered of TV's ""Golden Age Of Westerns"",and it was the driving force behind this show that Warners produced four more Westerns after the success of ""Cheyenne"". This show was a huge hit for ABC-TV at the time mostly because of its star,Clint Walker as the title character. It also brought out other westerns as well that followed including James Garner as ""Maverick"" which premiered in 1957,and continued through 1962,producing 124 episodes. Then that same year Will Hutchins star as ""Sugarfoot""(1957-1961),which produced 61 episodes,then afterwards in 1958 came Ty Hardin as ""Bronco""(1958-1962), which produced 68 episodes,not to mention the action-adventure short-lived series titled ""The Alaskans"" with Roger Moore,which ran from 1959 through 1960,producing 37 episodes. There were other Westerns as well that Warners produced during the mid-1960's as well especially with the Western satire spoof ""F-Troop"" which premiered in 1965 producing 37 episodes which ran until 1967,and the last of Warner Brothers Westerns came that same year in 1965 with Christopher Jones in ""The Legend of Jesse James"",which lasted one season. It is to note here that out of all the Warner Brothers produced Westerns that had the longest-running stanza out of all of them,""Cheyenne"" remained on ABC-TV for eight seasons,producing 108 episodes running from its debut in 1955 to the final episode of the series in 1963. Only ""Maverick"" became the second longest-running Western for the studio,which debut in 1957 and ended in 1962,withstood a five-year run.<br/><br/>What set ""Cheyenne"" apart from other TV-westerns of their day? First off,there were different sets of elements that were found of other shows but this one was totally the opposite and above the competition in which lay the foundation for the casting of Clint Walker as Cheyenne Brodie. Clint Walker's character was a good-looking fellow with a 48-inch chest(which seems to get bared at least once in every episode)who didn't succeed just on his acting ability,which was passable.The only thing that was successful was the action scenes in which Cheyenne would be fighting ruthless outlaws,savage Indians,and even deadly gunslingers who may have there way with him,but Cheyenne didn't back down from any fight,and because of his massive size,he could tackle any man while still have the aura of a ""gentle giant"". Even with the ""beefcake"" scenes had an non-threatening quality about them since television and what was to be shown on television had to go through the censors was about as riveting as they could get,but lets face it,""Cheyenne"" delivered the goods and then some with more Westerb action and adventure then it could handle thanks to the starring presence of Clint Walker especially with the unique qualities that he brought to this series.<br/><br/>""Cheyenne"" also brought out some of the most special guest stars ever assembled and some of them,like per se James Garner,would go on to make a name for himself years later on his own WB-produced series, ""Maverick"". And not to mention others like Micheal Landon,Peter Graves, and others that were on the adventure set each week.

2806,Cheyenne, A drifter (Clint Walker) wanders the wild west.,"Cheyenne was one of the original three (along with Gunsmoke and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp) 'adult' westerns to hit TV in the fall of 1955, kicking off a trend that would dominate all three networks for the next five or six years, until the once original concept turned to formula and all the fun went out of the genre owing to overexposure. In truth, there was no one quite like Clint Walker - to say that he was tall in the saddle is to understate the case. Like Fess Parker as Davy Crockett (on the same network, ABC) one year earlier, his huge physical stature but gentle country voice won him instant stardom and, adult western or no, the hero of every kid in America. Actually, Cheyenne wasn't a series in the true sense during its first season, but broadcast one out of every three weeks as part of an anthology called WARNER BROS. PRESENTS. The other two entries were King's Row with Robert Horton and Jack Kelly (soon to reappear on Wagon Train and Maverick) and Casablanca, a take off on the old Bogart movie of that name. Immediately, the ratings for Cheyenne went through the roof while the other two just sat there. By mid-season they were gone and Cheyenne was seen on reruns every week through the summer. Two things about that first season: though the show ran an hour, each episode was not a normal hour length installment (50 mins.) but between five and ten minutes less than that, owing to 'behind the scenes' previews of upcoming WB movies. Also, this was the only season when Cheyenne had a sidekick, played by L.Q. Jones, later a regular in the Sam Peckinpah stock company. One last thing about the opening season - the episodes were far more spectacular than any to follow, as WB actually did mini remakes of big budget western films, using the stock footage from them and simply replacing whoever had starred with Clint. So the feature film Charge at Feather River with Guy Madison became West of the River with Clint. The Indian charge is identical in both. Most of us didn't know anything about stock footage then and were under the impression (for a while) that WB was knocking out a major league western for TV every three weeks. When Cheyenne came back in 1956, it was a full hour, no sidekick, and ran every other week, alternating with CONFLICT, mostly composed of pilots for possible future WB shows. the next year, Conflict was gone and Sugarfoot with Will Hutchins became the rotating item with Cheyenne, this western also quickly becoming a hit. The following year, Cheyenne was on the air but Clint wasn't. He'd left WB in a salary dispute. So the weirdest thing happen - Cheyenne ran with no Cheyenne in sight, rather Ty Hardin as Bronco Lane. When Walker returned the following fall, Cheyenne shifted to Monday (often, it ran weekly now) with Bronco and Sugarfoot rotating on Tuesdays. By this time, the western was playing out, so both Sugarfoot and Bronco were absorbed into Cheyenne, the package now called ""The Cheyenne Show,"" each of the three seen once every three weeks. In one episode, all three were together. Then Sugarfoot was dropped and Cheyenne and Bronco rotated. By this time, the heyday of the western was over. Warner Bros. replaced Cheyenne late in 1963 with another western, Badlands, which lasted less than half a year. And, in truth, during its final two or three seasons, Cheyenne was awfully routine, in terms of scripting, direction, etc. But that first season was a real winner, and the next two or three were strong too. Worth catching again at least those heyday episodes.",57 out of 61 found this helpful.,,20 March 2006

2808,Cheyenne," ""My name's Cheyenne Bodie.""","When ""Cheyenne"" debuted on 9/20/1955, ""The Lone Ranger"" had already been running for six seasons and had two more to go. Warner Brothers, specifically Jack Warner, tapped Clint Walker to be it's first TV Western hero, and raised the bar a considerable notch over the series made famous by Clayton Moore (and John Hart for one season). Walker was a no nonsense but laid back hero, almost droll by comparison with 'B' movie Western stars that preceded him, and that almost certainly added to his fame and popularity as Cheyenne.<br/><br/>The Season I DVD compilation includes all fifteen episodes of the series' first season 1955/56. Series guest star James Garner appeared in three of them, as many as L.Q. Jones, who portrayed Cheyenne's map making sidekick Smitty in three of the first four shows. Garner's character was different each time out. Other notable guests in the first season included Myron Healey, Dennis Hopper, Barton MacLane, and even a young Michael Landon in an uncredited appearance.<br/><br/>One of the interesting things about that first season is that two of the episodes were direct lifts of movies starring Humphrey Bogart. 'The Argonauts' (#1.3) swipes scenes and dialog from ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" in a similar story of greedy gold prospectors, but at least credits B. Traven as the author of the novel on which both were based. However 'Fury at Rio Hondo' (#1.12) credits James Gunn with writing that story, but nowhere mentions Ernest Hemingway as the author of ""To Have And Have Not"". Once again, the story's plot and characters parallel the Bogart film; the Lauren Bacall role is handled by Peggie Castle, but she doesn't quite cut it as the sexy nineteen year old Bacall did in the original movie. For his part, Bodie was no Bogey.<br/><br/>On that score, Clint Walker was competent as the laconic drifter Cheyenne Bodie, but like George Reeves in ""The Adventures of Superman"" TV series, he didn't have a lot to work with, and didn't rise much above the material, unless you consider his six and a half foot stature. Don't get me wrong, I like both Walker and ""Cheyenne"" and enjoy the shows, but if you consider the acting, the best you can say is that it was uneven. And the episodes, some were almost comical trying to be serious. Consider Episode #1.11, 'Quicksand', in which Cheyenne challenges a Comanche Chief in a battle to the death in a bed of muck. They start out standing upright, and slowly start to sink inch by inch until each proves the point that they would rather die than be proved a coward. Then, when the Comanche chief mounts his horse to ride away, he's no longer covered by mud!<br/><br/>As big as Walker was, it's interesting to see him cast opposite actors who came close to him in size; Don Megowan comes to mind from Episode #1.13 - 'Star in the Dust', as a sheriff who hires Cheyenne on as a deputy. That's one example, but it happened with some regularity. Kind of makes you wonder where all those big bad guys came from in the Old West.<br/><br/>The Season I DVD set contains a nice 'Legacy of Cheyenne' feature in which the seventy nine year old Walker talks about his early life and 'discovery' by Van Johnson, who put him in touch with an agent. That contact eventually led to a role as a Sardinian Captain of the Guard in ""The Ten Commandments"". Warner Brothers took an interest based on that role, and bought his contract from producer Hal Wallis with the Cheyenne role in mind. Originally, the show aired as part of an anthology series on the ABC network; other posters on this board have done a nice job of outlining that history.<br/><br/>My favorite show of the series - Episode #7.1, debuting the 1962 season, titled ""The Durango Brothers"". Mama Hortense Durango (Ellen Corby) enlists her three renegade sons (Jack Elam, Charlie Briggs, and Mickey Simpson) to kidnap Cheyenne in order to marry him off to sister Lottie (Sally Kellerman!!!) - it's hilarious! Needless to say, Cheyenne finishes the show, the season and the series still single.<br/><br/>""Cheyenne"" began a great Western tradition at ABC, to be followed not only by that network, but CBS and NBC as well. Not many though, could ride as tall in the saddle as the original, and Clint Walker can rest easy knowing that there aren't many TV heroes that are admired as much as Cheyenne Bodie.<br/><br/>*Addendum - posted 12/13/09 - From Episode #64, Season 4 - ""Gold, Glory and Custer, Requiem"" - Cheyenne Bodie's Indian name from the Southern Cheyenne is revealed to be 'Touch the Sky'.

2809,Cheyenne, Its success rested on broad shoulders,"If ""Cheyenne"" is one of the most fondly-remembered shows from TV's ""Golden Age of Westerns,"" it probably isn't due to such factors as writing or direction, since these elements were probably no better than those found on a number of other TV westerns. What set ""Cheyenne"" apart and a bit above most of its competition lay in the casting of Clint Walker as its title character.<br/><br/>While Clint was a good-looking fellow with a 48-inch chest,  (which seemed to get bared at least once on every episode), he didn't succeed just on his physical appearance or on his acting ability which, while passable, didn't qualify for any awards. No, what probably made Clint such an enduring icon of the 1950's was his surprisingly quiet, mild-mannered personality which at first seemed at odds with his massive size. This personality gave Clint an approachable, almost vulnerable quality which lent him the aura of a ""gentle giant.""<br/><br/>Even his ""beefcake"" scenes had a wholesome, non-threatening quality about them as opposed to, say, the sly sexuality of Robert Conrad's frequent bare-chest poses in ""The Wild Wild West.""<br/><br/>Perhaps the episode best reflecting Clint's unique qualities aired on 12-18-56. Titled ""The Trap,"" this episode had Clint unjustly sentenced to work in a silver mine. Having Clint push those loaded mine-cars out of the mine and along a track under a blistering-hot desert sun not only gave ample opportunities to display that hairy chest gleaming with sweat, but the atmosphere of cruelty and bondage effectively played on the notion that audiences like to see the masochistic sufferings of an uncomplaining strongman.",52 out of 59 found this helpful.,,25 October 2000
2810,Cheyenne, Clint Walker website,"Cheyenne fans should check out Clint's website. He has lots of photos for sale and will autograph them as well. The series was great in that Cheyenne's dedication to fairness and truth never waivered. It was a good example for kids unlike today's shows. Clint Walker deserves a lot of credit for making this show a well deserved hit. It was interesting that the producers never provided him with a ""named"" horse like was done in a few other westerns. He always rode ""a horse."" He sometimes traded them or lost them, just never named them or seemed to care much about them. I was disappointed the show didn't provide him that opportunity; guess there were so many shows the writers couldn't be distracted with a single horse story line. In any event, it's a small complaint about a truly great TV western.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,22 March 2009
2811,Cheyenne, Horrifying violent western with a heroic nonactor star.,"I haven't seen an episode of Cheyenne since I was nine years old, and I'm well over fifty now. Mostly what I remember about it was its horrendous violence: shootings, beatings, hangings, Indian tortures, and any amount of deliberate mayhem. This was very strong stuff, and every bit as violent as modern TV shows.<br/><br/>What this show had going for it was Clint Walker, who may well have been the most astonishing looking human being ever to appear in front of a camera. I have seen very few professional athletes who were bigger and stronger, but none who were as handsome. Walker, whom I've seen in other movies, was also at least competent as an actor, even though he was hired on the basis of his striking good looks. He was at least as good as the young Clint Eastwood, and far superior to the truly appalling Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>An interesting fact about Walker is that he once fell on an upturned ski pole, whose point pierced his heart. He pulled the pole from his chest and walked down the ski hill. He survived and is still alive in 2006. You couldn't invent somebody like this in a movie and have people believe it.",42 out of 65 found this helpful.,,30 April 2006

Studios.<br/><br/>A loner, a drifter, and a jack-of-all-trades, Cheyenne Bodie was not a man of many words, but he was known to be fair-minded and just - And, as an added bonus, this husky dude was certainly quite capable of settling scores with his fists as well as with a gun.<br/><br/>Always towering over everyone else in the cast, Clint Walker easily ranks right up there as one of my favorite TV cowboys of all time.<br/><br/>To a total cowboy-junkie, like myself, Clint Walker, as Cheyenne Bodie, was ""the right stuff"" - A man that Western legends are made of.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,18 September 2013
2815,Cheyenne, Cheyenne - A Legendary Western Hero Who Roamed the West,"I was 5 years old when Cheyenne premiered in 1955. My parents and I were glued to the screen every week. Clint Walker was a mountain of a man. He was 6'6"" tall with broad shoulders, big chest and a tapered waist that made him look like an Adonis like figure. He had the Hollywood good looks that were rivaled by few in any western. His character could be rough when necessary, quick on the draw and yet gentle, kind and forthright in other situations. His moral compass never wavered, as he always did the right thing in life, despite the perils in front of him from others who were only concerned with themselves and person gain. Cheyenne was polite to women, kind to children and a great role model for many in life. His character was a drifter for the most part by design as he explored the west and held a variety of jobs: Marshall, deputy sheriff, cattle foreman, military scout, mapmaker, wagon train guide, to name a few. I have been watching reruns of Cheyenne for the past year and it brought back memories of why I loved the show during my youth. I was also tickled to find out that Clint Walker turned 89 in 2016, as to me he is a western icon and a gentle and kind human being.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,14 February 2017

2818,Cheyenne, When Westerns were much of our wholesome entertainment,"The TV series, ""Cheyenne,"" was one of several Western themed weekly programs on television in 1950s America. Its success and that of so many others like it in that decade seemed almost assured. Many children of the 1940s grew up with Western matinée movies at local theaters. Those were the days before TV took off five years after the end of World War II. <br/><br/>I recall vividly my frequent Saturday bicycle rides with my brother or neighborhood friends to the Swan Theater in Columbus, NE. Those kids' matinees cost just nine cents, and that left a penny out of our dime for a bag of popcorn. <br/><br/>Most of the matinée movies we saw weren't new. They were films from the past decade or more that we probably hadn't seen. When a new Western movie came out we might get to see it at an evening showing at the bigger Columbus Theater. Of course, the price there was 20 cents and popcorn cost a nickel. But we kids were happy with the matinees following the adventures of Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, John Wayne, the Cisco Kid, Lash Larue and the Lone Ranger. <br/><br/>With the rapid rise of TV at the start of the 1950s, the movie houses began to see a steady decline in audience numbers. And, those daytime Western entertainers of the past were getting into the new medium as well. The Gene Autry show aired from 1950 to 1955, and the Roy Rogers show ran from 1951 to 1957. Hopalong Cassidy had a TV series from 1952-54, and the Cisco Kid was a favorite TV series from 1950-56 starring Duncan Renaldo. The Lone Ranger, who was played by different actors in movies, as was The Cisco Kid, had a long-running TV series from 1949-57, with a 30-minute weekly show that starred Clayton Moore. It ran for 221 episodes. Moore also starred in the 1956 feature length film, ""The Lone Ranger.""<br/><br/>With Westerns so firmly established among the viewing public, it's no wonder that new Western series would become very popular on TV. But, the new series and heroes took on a little more mature look. Now they appealed as much to adults as to kids. Indeed, many of the latter were now the adults themselves. <br/><br/>""Cheyenne"" was one of the favorites among the many long-running Western TV serials. It ran from 1955 to 1962 and starred Clint Walker. It was second in popularity only to ""Gunsmoke,"" which became the longest running live action TV series in history, airing from 1955 to 1975. And, the enduring popularity of Westerns would continue in the movies and on TV through the 1970s. ""Maverick"" aired from 1957 to 1962, ""Have Gun – Will Travel"" ran from 1957 to 1963, and ""Wagon Train"" ran from 1957 to 1965. Even before these faded out, other series were born. ""The Rifleman"" aired from 1958 to 1963,""Rawhide"" ran from 1959 to 1965 and ""Bonanza"" ran from 1959 to 1973. <br/><br/>More Western series' were born as some of the earlier ones faded. ""The Wild Wild West"" and ""The Big Valley"" both ran from 1965-69, and ""How the West Was Won,"" aired from 1976 to 1979.<br/><br/>Those were times and a type of wholesome entertainment that the whole family could enjoy. Few of today's theater offerings or TV programs fit that category. And, today's $5 and $10 theater popcorn is a far cry from the five or 10 cents one paid in 1950 — even adjusted for inflation. Top movie stars in the 1940s might make $100,000 for a single movie. Today they get $5 to $10 million or more. Inflation in the movie industry appears to be about 500 to 1,000 percent greater than for the American economy overall. That may be one reason why so many more people stay home and watch TV instead of going to the movies.",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,7.0,18 June 2016
2819,Cheyenne," The great wanderer, a jack of all western trades","Lots of TV westerns had a wanderer as the protagonist hero. You could write a limitless variety of stories that way. Cheyenne with its laconic hero Cheyenne Bodie was the first of many westerns that Warner Brothers produced for television. Clint Walker, all 6'7"" inches of him was an ideal cowboy hero. Unlikely he'd ever be cast with John Wayne because the Duke liked looking up to nobody.<br/><br/>Walker was in fact more suggestive of Gary Cooper than Wayne. If he had been born 20 years earlier he would have been a great B picture cowboy hero. In fact it was Warner Brothers who realized that the B western did not die, but moved to television. Cheyenne was the first of a dozen or so westerns that Warner Brothers did for television. The most successful of which was Maverick because it's star James Garner had the biggest career undoubtedly. <br/><br/>When Cheyenne ended its run Walker found that westerns on the big screen were in eclipse. Possibly he should have looked for another television series. His best known big screen movie role was one of The Dirty Dozen. <br/><br/>Too bad Cheyenne was not done in color. It would get a lot of run on the TV nostalgia channels. As for Walker his Cheyenne Bodie was a jack of all western trades and did them all in Cheyenne's run.<br/><br/>Clint Walker was a model cowboy hero and deserves to be remembered as such.",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,7.0,30 May 2016
2820,Cheyenne, Prototype for Strong &amp; Silent Type,"WHEN THIS SERIES hit the airwaves, it was about the biggest thing around. Everyone watched. Everybody knew who this new star was. An adult Western had come to the American Broadcasting Company. CHEYENNE was indeed ABC's answer to the CBS Saturday night centerpiece, GUNSMOKE.<br/><br/>THE MAIN CHARACTER, as portrayed by star, Clint Walker, was a sort of mysterious in origin; but was definitely a sort of benevolent drifter. His drifting all around the West, changing jobs and interacting with various townsfolk guaranteed that there would be a broad spectrum of story lines with which to nourish and nurture the series. As we recall, it never seemed to be monotonous or boring; as a healthy balance was struck between Gunplay, Horseplay and Screenplay.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH GOOD WRITING, characterization and generous helping of the well established Horse Opera tradition greatly contributed to the series' successful run, one other puzzle part also played a lion's share in rounding up the great audience that it did have.<br/><br/>THAT OTHER ELEMENT was Mr. Clint Walker, himself.<br/><br/>AS A RELATIVE NEWCOMER, he had to have learned much of his skills as an actor as a sort of ""on the job trainee."" His height (6'6""), powerful &amp; athletic physique, natural good looks and richly tonal voice all were definite advantages in his early career; but he cultivated the persona of ""the strong &amp; silent type."" This type of leading man had served others well; with the names of John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Randolph Scott being prime examples.<br/><br/>INSTEAD OF DISPLAYING excessive physical and vocal energy, the production team and Clint went for underplaying of the role. That too greatly contributed to the longevity it had on the TV schedule.<br/><br/>BITTER DISPUTES OVER contractual matters caused there to be an unexpected hiatus for the tall horseman as both Management and Labor, in the persons of Warner Brothers Pictures and star Clint Walker argued over some restrictive clauses in the stars contract. In it, he was verboten to accept any other roles and would not be used by the studio outside of the Cheyenne part he originated.<br/><br/>WHILE THIS PAPER war was raging, Jack Warner &amp; cohorts managed to keep this hour long slot in their possession. The ""CHREYENNE"" hour was supplanted by the alternate presentation of the Western, BRONCO (with Ty Hardin) and Western Comedy SUGARFOOT (with Will Hutchins).<br/><br/>AFTER PEACE BETWEEN Walker and the Warners had been declared, the reinstatement of a now movie star Clint Walker and CHEYENNE came to pass. But the peace treaty did have certain provisions that altered the schedule radically. After that conflict was concluded, there was established a three way ""Starting Rotation"" with episodes of CHEYRENNE, BRONCO and SUGARFOOT being presented on successive weeks.<br/><br/>NO ONE SEEMED to care about this troika of an arrangement; not Clint Walker, not Warner Brothers, not us either, right Schultz?",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,7.0,5 August 2014

2822,Cheyenne," A solid Western, but...","Cheyenne is a solid western series, but it is problematic in certain ways. One problem is a complete lack of internal logic.

Custer was asking for him to help scout in the Black Hills. Huh? Custer died the season before! Also, Bode had way too many jobs for any one man. This series was supposed to take place in the 1870s, 80s, and maybe 90s. But Bode was a sheriff one week, a Mexican freight man another, a cattle drover, in another, back to being a sheriff in a completely different town the next, then a cattle drover again, and even an Army spy several times... seriously. This guy had every job in the west in those tiny few number of years. There is no way he could have been elected sheriff in half a dozen towns, yet also spent a year driving cattle half a dozen times, AND been a drifter, and hired hand half a dozen other times in just 20 or so years.

Some, like A Christmas CAROL and THE WIZARD OF OZ, made a yearly appearance.<br/><br/>The writers must have felt very repressed, if they had any talent at all, because the episodes were pretty much clones of the films.

2842,Two Sentence Horror Stories, Interesting premises are undermined by amateurish craftsmanship (Season 1),"The idea of short horror stories is intriguing, but the direction, editing and unfortunately also the script feel like a first semester's film school project: they worked with ambition, but without craftsmanship. While the acting is completely ok, the stories don't give you anything. After the first five minutes you regularly think ""yes, that might be quite exciting"", but then you quickly realize that the rhythm of the stories is just not right, that the editor only has a vague idea of how to create suspense and that the director is simply unable to shape the sloppy script into a coherent whole. There are thousands of horror stories in literature that are only a few pages long, but whose stories leave an impression you will remember years later. That's not the case in any episode here.

I thought the show had a decent production value and so so acting at first but it went steadily downhill after episode 3. I thought the stories were weak but hoped that they would get better but that never happened it got more and more torturous until our exasperated eye rolling and laughs began to decrease as we had to face the fact that each story grew worst than the last. Watching a stuffed animal go down a demon's throat in horrendous CGI was......wow.....I grew angry at the wasted time the wasted money and the audacity of this to be available to the public. I don't mind different or unusual movies however most of the stories lacked a plot and was terribly predictable. This wouldn't scare a 4 year old.,7 out of 11 found this helpful.,3.0,4 October 2019

I decided to give it another go and watch the next episode, and to my surprise, it was better. Not much better, but more entertaining than the first. So I think maybe they get better as they go. Then I watched episode 3. What on earth is that? I was actually laughing throughout the episode because of how silly it was. Was the son or whatever supposed to be like Freddy Krueger or something?<br/><br/>The stories are over exaggerated, the acting is absolutely ridiculous, and the editing/filming of it makes it have the feel of a fan made project meant for YouTube or something.

2850,The Partridge Family, One of the best 70s sitcoms.,"The Partridge Family premiered in 1970. Sure, it was sort of corny. But most TV shows back then were. It was a more innocent era then, and so was television. It revolved around the misadventures of a squeaky-clean, middle-class family, who decided to form a band and make records. It was based on the real-life rock-n-roll family, the Cowsills. David Cassidy, who was a teen heart-throb on the show, played the eldest brother, Keith Partridge. Laurie Partridge, played by Susan Dey, was his cover-girl-pretty younger sibling, and tended to annoy Keith on a frequent basis. His other siblings were cute, precocious-types, especially Danny Partridge (who was the 10-year-old financial wizard).<br/><br/>The family was headed by widow, and cool mom, Shirley Partridge (played by David Cassidy's real-life step-mom, Shirley Jones). The cast was rounded-out by their hapless Manager, Reuben Kincaid (played by rubber-faced comic Dave Madden), who always made a perfect comic-foil for Danny. The whole family sang and played instruments. They cut several albums during the course of the series, that spawned some hit singles. Their songs to me, were really quite good, especially if you like soft-rock and love ballads.<br/><br/>I could identify with the Partridge's suburban life-style, having grown-up in a solid middle-American, middle-class suburb myself. Some of the kids on the show were my age, and some were the same ages as my own siblings.<br/><br/>This show came on ABC on Friday night, following another family sitcom with several kids, the Brady Bunch. The Partridge Family even had many episodes that were so similar to some Brady Bunch episodes, they could only be called shameless rip-offs. Still, it was a gentle, family-oriented show, with good music and good acting by the cast. I always looked forward to Friday nights back then, just so I could enjoy the Partridge Family on TV.",26 out of 27 found this helpful.,10.0,21 December 2007
2851,The Partridge Family, Brings Back Great Memories!,"I was 5 years old when this show debuted, and can remember the popularity of it unlike any other show to date.  The bubble gum cards, the records, teen magazines-everything to do with ""The Partridge Family"" was a hot commodity! ""I Think I Love You"" was the first song I ever knew all the lyrics to.  This was due to my friends and I piling onto the swingset in my backyard, which included a 4 seater lawn swing which we made fit 8 kids, and sing ""I Think I Love You"" over and over again while pumping the lawn swing way into the air. Some of my friends would take the end cones off and sing through the top bar to get a reverb effect!  Seeing the show in reruns throughout the '70s &amp; '80s, it still had it's charm.  It wasn't mean't to be an emmy award winner, but it served it's purpose-to be lighthearted and funny.  The music showcased on the show was memorable too.  Try watching an episode, and not have their songs replay in your head long after watching it.

2855,The Partridge Family, More remarkable than it first appears...,"Amusing to see VH-1 staging a minor-scale ""American Idol"" to find the ""new Partridge Family"" (with judges who base their scores on, among other things, physical likeness to the original line-up). It's nice see Shirley Jones and David Cassidy involved (as for Danny Bonaduce, well...he'd appear at the opening of an envelope). But the really funny part is the fact that VH-1 does not air reruns of ""The Partridge Family', so how do these young kids auditioning even know who Keith Partridge is (and what he meant to TV viewers and teenyboppers all over the world from 1970-1974). It's bound to flop, as did the remake of ""Family Affair"", simply because you can't get lightning to strike twice. ""The Partridge Family"" came along at the right time, when people needed it--needed to BELIEVE IN IT--and record producer Wes Ferrell and the editors at 16 Magazine and Tiger Beat made millions off the show (exploiting David Cassidy's manufactured wholesome image of the boy-singer-next-door). There were better shows of this period (and the laugh-track just screams at the sometimes corny humor), but the show does have great appeal, and the familial relationships have a lived-in feel (when Laurie and Danny kid Keith about his non-existent bald spot, they wink at each other as Keith goes mad with the hairbrush, and mom Shirley watches from the sidelines, no doubt enjoying the prank). They have tried unsuccessfully to reunite this group of actors for specials, and aside from a David-Danny-Shirley reunion on ""Arsenio"", they've failed. If you can't reunite the originals, why then is VH-1 betting on the success of duplicates? Maybe people need to believe again, or maybe Hollywood has really run dry of ideas.",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,8.0,18 September 2004

It's aged much better than most of the TV shows of that era (even given the changes in tastes -- hair-styles, clothes, music, etc). Really great ""ensemble"" acting with everyone contributing to the show's success (well, almost everyone -- little red-headed Tracy came across as a zombie with no musical ability, and mostly just stood around staring blankly into space!). Shirley Jones was the cement that held it all together -- a cool, hip mother, but one that didn't let her kids run rough-shod over her. Susan Day looked great and could spin off one-liners with the best of them (generally at Keith's expense). And the comic interplay between Reuben, Keith, and Danny was truly priceless. Even little Chris added a certain appeal (especially the cute Jeremy Gelbwaks, who played Chris during the first season -- gorgeous big blue eyes!).

Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, Danny Bonaduce, Dave Madden and Susan Dey all contributed to the show's success, and had a good chemistry between them. The interplay especially between Keith, Danny, and Reuben is priceless. I liked the first season best because of the freshness of the concept, and cause I think Jeremy Gelbwaks was the better (and cuter) Chris Partridge. Never seen such enormous blue eyes as Jeremy's! Tracy was definitely stiff in the part and couldn't seem to bang a tambourine in sync with the music, but fortunately her role in the show was minimal. I laughed reading the other poster's comments about Jeremy Gelbwaks leaving, cause I remember those silly rumors myself, such as that he'd died (even at the hands of David Cassidy!). The truth is much more mundane: his dad got a job transfer with his employer from Los Angeles to Virginia right after the end of the first season. Jeremy's alive and well, making a living as a systems programmer in New Orleans (and has been pitching in to clean up that unfortunate city after Hurricane Katrina struck). The latest I've heard on Dave Madden is that he's still around, too. He continued comic work on the nightclub circuit after the Partridge Family was canceled, and was especially in demand for voice-overs in commercials.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,16 January 2007

Where are you?<br/><br/>The cast - Shirley Jones is great.  She's the perfect, wholesome mom.  David Cassidy is great and I'm not just saying that because he can really belt out those songs, but because he's such the innocent teenager of the family. Susan Dey is enjoyable as is Danny Bonaduce.  So he's a little annoying; that's okay with me.<br/><br/>I'm not too crazy about the writing itself, but thanks to the ""terrific"" performances from the cast, I've learned to like the different episodes.<br/><br/>

2862,The Partridge Family, A great show with great music,"Many people love to dismiss ""The Partridge Family"" very quickly for some reason, while the truth is this is a pretty decent show which featured some great music during its run.<br/><br/>Of course, David Cassidy is the star, very good looking and talented with a great voice and lovable screen presence. The rest of the cast is also strong for the most part. Shirley Jones plays a great and caring mom, Susan Day is good as Laurie, and of course Danny Bonaduce is fantastic as the money-hungry Danny. The Ruben dude is good as is the second Chris, but the Tracy girl really is kind of stiff. <br/><br/>The stories were a lot of fun, especially the ones that revolved around their performing somewhere. How cool was it that they performed on TOP of the bus that one time? The show was innocent and showed good morals in the stories. <br/><br/>The show has a lot of future stars appearing, among my favorites are Mark Hamill, Rob Reiner (GREAT as ""Snake,"" remember that funky music every time he appeared on screen?) and Tony Geary, who would later find megafame as Luke Spencer (""Luke and Laura"") of General Hospital.<br/><br/>The bus was great. I always wondered who did the ""roadie"" work? Did David carry all the equipment? And if the band had all these big hits, how come every gig was seemingly at a dinner theater in front of 60 people? But that's just some of the fun stuff to think about.<br/><br/>The kids actually got pretty good at faking the playing, even the second Chris doing the drums like the record often. <br/><br/>Now, the music. This is not ""The Brady Bunch"" here. These songs are great songs, and there's a lot of them. Forget the TV show for a minute, just concentrating on the music. Those first four albums especially are incredible, with the album ""Sound Magazine"" from 1972 probably being one of the greatest pop music albums ever made. That album contains gem after gem, classic after classic, and is nothing less than a pop music masterpiece, perfect from start to finish.<br/><br/>My personal Partridge Family song is ""I Would Have Loved You Anyway,"" written by Tony Romeo, who wrote most of the band's greatest songs (including ""I Think I Love You""). I spoke to Tony Romeo once a long time ago and it was a blast, he was telling me how he and others in the studio would have to teach David Cassidy the songs right on the spot because David had such an incredible touring schedule on days he wasn't filming.<br/><br/>""Summer Days,"" ""Rainmaker,"" Together We're Better,"" ""Hello Hello,"" ""I'll Meet You Halfway,"" ""Brand New Me,"" ""One Night Stand,"" the list of great songs just goes on and on.<br/><br/>This is a show that REALLY needs to be on DVD. And when it does, I really hope the disks have a feature where they can play the ""music videos"" only, and the set gets to at least the third season so we can have those music sequences on disk.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,,14 September 2004
2863,The Partridge Family," aka ""Family Business"" or ""The Shirley Jones Show""","This show was one of the most sugarcoated series of the 1970's. Not only did it rise beyond the Nielsen ratings,but also launched a mega superstar during the bubblegum era of family oriented shows.<br/><br/>The Partridge Family was that show. This show went toe to toe with its competitors at the time,The Brady Bunch,which were on the same network, both shows were on different time slots(one came on Friday Nights,and the other was shown on Saturday nights at the 8:00 hour),had a array of special guest stars and went off the air the same year,1974 with the exception that ""The Brady Bunch"" premiered a year before this show did and it was also was the competition to not only for family viewing but for bragging rights at the height of the groovy-bubblegum decade of family oriented shows of the late 1960's and early 1970's. The show made its debut on ABC-TV in September of 1970 and from there the show itself was in the top-ten of the Nielsens for its first two seasons(1970-1972). The show ended its run after four seasons in September of 1974.<br/><br/>The show was inspired by another family oriented musical group,""The Cowsills""(remember them from back in the day?)whom this show was based upon and was produced by the same individuals whom were behind the hit shows like ""Bewitched"",""The Flying Nun"",""I Dream Of Jeannie"",and so forth,under the eyes of executive producers Harry Ackerman and Bob Claver.<br/><br/>As far as the characters were concerned,this show has it all and then some as the family went through the day to day activities of a normal family life as musicians,but first off,the characters...............<br/><br/>For one,you had the ring leader and the mother Shirley Partridge(played by Broadway sensation and Oscar winning actress Shirley Jones) who was not only the head of the household but also acted as the mother and road manager.<br/><br/>Then,you had Keith(David Cassidy),who was the lead singer of the group,and the heartthrob of young women everywhere who were constantly following him around everywhere he went,and he was just that...the hottie every girl wanted!!!! By the way,it was Keith that was bringing in the family business,and soaring record sales and every pop-charting Billboard hit during the 1970's! Oh yes,The Partridge Family had several top-ten hits that went straight to Number One on the Billboard charts during the early part of the 1970's.<br/><br/>Also,you had Laurie(Susan Dey),Keith's kid sister who was just as sweet and innocent as she can be but held her own within the family business. Notice in some of the episodes that Susan Dey's talents went beyond her acting abilities as well,since she had a great singing voice too!<br/><br/>Then,you had Danny(Danny Bonaduce),Keith's younger brother,who was a constant pain in the neck in some of the episodes and one of the most annoyingest characters in the series....believe me,watch some of the episodes and you see why this kid didn't know the meaning of stay out of grown folks business and for once just shut up....Danny had a smart mouth too,every time and didn't know when to just shut-up when around grown folks,especially if it meant adult affairs,which meant if grown folks are talking,Danny,stay out of the way.There was one episode,where Danny said the wrong thing at the wrong time especially when it dealt with important matters pertaining to family issues and of course guests that would come by the house for visits,and Mrs. Partridge didn't do anything to keep him quiet? This kid was a total nuisance! The 70's version of Dennis The Menace! I wish there were times when she would just smack him across the mouth for being so disrespectful and close his smart-mouth,which most of the time got him into some very serious trouble....watch the episodes!!!<br/><br/>Then,you had the man who does the bookings for the group and more,and has the hots for Mrs. Partridge,Reuben(Dave Madden),who keeps Danny in line most of the time and the rest of the crew,and finally you had the two cute ones,who in some of the segments were so out of space they didn't know what to do.<br/><br/>As for the musical numbers,they were memorable and nowadays some of the Partridge songs are considered standard classics and these days you can hear them on several oldies stations,especially if they play them constantly...songs like,""Hey,I think I love you"",and so forth were one of the groups biggest hits. The songs they have were million sellers and launched the musical career of David Cassidy,whom after his associated with the Partridge Family,went solo and from there self-destruct himself into an abyss of mayhem after the series was over...the same can be said for actor Danny Bonaduce too who was out of control,and almost destroyed his career after the show went off the air. Susan Dey went on to become a brilliant actress and went on to star in several TV series...including L.A. Law. This was the only actress from the series that kept her head career path straight and didn't end up like the others. <br/><br/>Whatever happened to Dave Madden? That is a mystery to this day.<br/><br/>The sitcom also launched a sorry animated cartoon(""The Space Partridges"",which was produced by Hanna-Barbera),and a variety hour series which lasted one season and from there the Partridge's were never heard from since.

So those of us who were a bit older thought we were too cool to count ourselves as fans. What a shame!<br/><br/>THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY was a really funny sitcom that did not resort to scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas. At least not for the first three seasons. Yet, the writers did stick their necks out a bit, taking risks by tackling some of the issues of the time, such as women's rights, racial discrimination (with Richard Prior guest starring), even the ecology.<br/><br/>The chemistry was perfect. Dave Madden, comic veteran from CAMP RUNAMUCK and LAUGH- IN, playing the frustrated manager, Rueben Kincaid, who loved money as much as he disliked children, is forever matching wits with Danny, the 10-year old financial wizard. This alone is enough to make a great sit-com. Add Keith, whose interest in girls and Laurie, the feminist who wants to change the world to the cast along with 2 younger siblings and a nervous mother who is trying to make order out of chaos. And you have a hit show!<br/><br/>The music was great as well. But what do you expect when it is produced by Wes Farrel for Coral Rock Productions., which has also produced a lot of great '60s rock groups. With the best writers along with the best session musicians hired to provide the music, what else would you expect?. Give the music a listen and you will hear Beach Boys inspired harmonies and other musical influences from the great rock and roll acts.

Back when the Bell Telephone Hour was broadcast from NBC's Brooklyn Studio live, I met Shirley Jones a couple of times, on one occasion she autographed my cast album of Oklahoma. I still have memories about how gracious and nice she was to any and all fans who hung around out there.<br/><br/>It wasn't her kind of music that was featured on this show however. She co-stars as a widowed mother who forms a family rock band with her five kids. The two youngest barely had any dialog and just didn't count. The other three had distinct personalities. <br/><br/>Danny Bonaduce was the middle child and the eternal schemer who caused quite a bit of the mischief involved. Susan Dey was the pretty teenage daughter who went on to have a nice substantial career in adult roles. But the reason people watched the show was for the oldest boy played by Jones's real life stepson, David Cassidy.<br/><br/>During the early Seventies David Cassidy was the bubble gum teenage idol and The Partridge Family became his venue to get his music sold to the public. A whole lot like Ricky Nelson did with Ozzie and Harriet.<br/><br/>Cassidy had the most interesting part, the teenage idol who backstage was quite the goofball. Of course the character had no foundation in reality whatsoever, but I've a sneaking suspicion that the producer's if they had made a real teenage idol, he might very well have come across arrogant. Making him lovably dumb, softened our potential jealousies.<br/><br/>I can't remember the plot of a single show because very quickly the show was more a venue for Cassidy's singing than anything else and after a while it didn't pretend to be anything else. I hope David Cassidy saved his money and can live good now, the life of a teenage idol isn't long.<br/><br/>His singing was pleasant and easy to listen to and the cast had a nice chemistry as well. We've seen worse on television.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,6.0,22 July 2009
2868,The Partridge Family, Memories of The Partridge Family,"Like many others of my era, I too reached my junior high and high school years watching the Partridge Family. This show was what galvanized me (and several friends) to form a band, and yes, we covered more than a few Partridge tunes. Like their earlier counterparts, The Monkees, their tunes have, for the most part, stood the test of time well.<br/><br/>It would not be until the movie ""That Thing You Do!"" would I again feel the emotion that reminded me how much fun it was to be in a band.<br/><br/>The soaring music was pure bubblegum, but it was fun, full or sunshine, and for the most part, still brings back the wonderful memories of the show and that time in my life.<br/><br/>And I agree that the ""New Partridge Family"" on VH-1 may not make it, let's give it a chance. Remember that the same thing was said about ""Star Trek - The Next Generation"" and it ran for more seasons than the original. Let's at least give the show a fair chance before we judge it.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,,1 November 2004
2869,The Partridge Family, Better than I remembered,"I hadn't seen this show since it first came out, but I caught an episode on Antenna TV and now I'm DVRing it every Saturday and Sunday.<br/><br/>I'm not sure which season Antenna TV is showing now, of the four that were aired. It must be the second or third, because these episodes feature ""Chris #2"" but Ricky Segall hasn't made his entrance yet. The dialog is more mature than I remembered it. Of course, when the show first came out I was maybe 7 years old, so I didn't catch most of the ""adult"" jokes back then.<br/><br/>There are also contemporary references here and there, such as mentioning the recent breakup of the Beatles, that make the show an interesting window on American pop culture in the early seventies.<br/><br/>Throw in a few cameos (Ray Bolger as Shirley Partridge's dad, Meredith Baxter as a roaming hippie chick, Bert Convy as a research scientist at the Aquarium, etc), and, like I said ... better than I remembered.<br/><br/>Just don't pay too close attention to the music sequences, especially in the earlier episodes. David Cassidy always looked like he knew how to play, and some of the others (most notably Brian Forster, aka ""Chris #2"") got better at faking it, at least, as time went on. On the other hand, the producers were up front (in the end credits) about the fact that studio musicians and singers ""augmented"" the family's performances. I think it was more of a case of David Cassidy and Shirley Jones augmenting the studio musicians' performances, but for the early seventies, the end-credit admission passed as truth in advertising.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,8.0,3 August 2014
2870,The Partridge Family, Great First Season,"This was a fun family show and was at its best in the first season. It was refreshing to see a family sitcom without the treacle of The Brady Bunch. Unfortunately, like many sitcoms, it ran for more seasons than it should have. (Ricky Segal, arrgh! What were they thinking??)<br/><br/>I would like to respectfully correct the review posted here by Siobhan from Chicago: Barry Gibb did not write ""Dirty Work"" -- it was written by the two members of Steely Dan, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. Matter of fact, as far as I know, it never appeared on a Partridge Family album. David Cassidy recorded it in 1979, and it was released on a 1991 compilation, ""Best of David Cassidy.""",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,,15 June 2005
2871,The Partridge Family, Danny Bonaduce was such a great talent,"The snappy script, the excellent premise of a single Mom trying to make a living with a family band and the brilliant casting helped make this sitcom a big winner.<br/><br/>Whoever wrote for Danny Bonaduce, playing the middle Partridge son, must have relished it. Although he was very young, Bonaduce just had the knack of playing the wisecracker. He was like a stand up comedian. I'm not entirely sure whether the lines were too old for him, and whether he truly understood them, however.<br/><br/>Shirley Jones, who made her name playing sweet female leads in musicals, here plays a more down to Earth though still loving mother. It's a role that fits her like a glove. The actor playing Reuben Kincaid, the manager, plays the henpecked male very well, and riffs off both Bonaduce, and David Cassidy.<br/><br/>Cassidy, like Bonaduce, was a natural comedian who also played a bit of the hassled teenager; he had a real vulnerability that came across well.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,8.0,1 April 2021

The Partridge Family was geared for my 5 to 8 year old mind. There was a problem ie Danny's voice change, Danny claiming Keith stealing his ideas, guy vs girls, etc. A sixties/early 70's feel to it. The time Keith has to face a bully and refuses to fight. Well there was a problem ( a hook for the audience) a resolution then some humor with a song. The peace and love music of early 70's, one could see the boredom mounting from the music with the push for 80's showman ship metal heading for the music industry. Every show had the usual Ruben we got a show in 2 hours everyone get ready jump on the hippy bus, which kind of looked like something from the Manson family. Watching The Partridge Family now we see a different time where suburbia was so different from today; the ethnic community meant the Italians section of town with the pizzeria. Suburbia hippy feel of your okay I am okay moral relativism of the times.

It is probably a bit younger than you'd expect for a Lifetime show, but based on the pilot, I'll be watching the next episode. The acting is good enough for the characters (I don't expect Emmy nominations though). I was glad to see Julia Ormond again, and I think Jenna Dewan Tatum is perfect for the role. The story seems to be set up nicely so that there will be some depth and twists to look forward to. We'll definitely have flashbacks and perilous situations to look forward to.

With very charmed-like characters and an immediate fondness for the protagonists, my intrigue was surely hooked.<br/><br/>Alongside the endearing and oh-so-steamy cast is a thorough and well developed story-line of family, betrayal and of course, magic! Gone are the days where you will underwhelmed by low budget special effects shaping shiny blue lights and glitter that falls from the sky. From what we have seen so far they have really implemented intelligent and effective directing to encapsulate the thrills associated with magic and bring some justice back to this witchy genre. <br/><br/>All in all, this series is worth keeping an eye on, I'm seeing some good things here and cant wait for the series to continue even further.",50 out of 66 found this helpful.,10.0,20 October 2013

The actors are, well let's just say some are better than others.<br/><br/>The show is essentially fluff but it didn't bug me. But I'm not sure who the target audience is because the pilot seemed to swing awkwardly from youngsters to adults.

If they go the Sabrina route they better hire some comedy writers.<br/><br/>Frankly I think it will probably crash and burn ... which is unfortunate because, did I mention, it has Julia Ormand in it.",32 out of 55 found this helpful.,6.0,10 October 2013

The show has very attractive actors and the storyline gives that normal ole ""Family feel"" vibe to it.

Its the story where everyone has 40,000 secrets and each secret is being revealed every episode while it progressively gets worst revealing stronger and badder villains as it does. Just like the vampire diaries, there is a woman torn between two brothers who don't like each other. One is a upholding citizen/caring and thoughtful while the other is miserable, broken, and misunderstood. Once again another woman came in between them in their past lives that made them separated in the first place. <br/><br/>I would only recommend this show if you enjoy the pacing, writing, and turns of shows like Vampire Diaries, The Originals, The secret circle etc.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,4.0,12 July 2015

One struggles with feeling attraction for another man while being engaged to someone, another struggles with being a mother and balancing that around her various issues (in this case magical). <br/><br/>Nothing here that you have to see.

2902,Wanderlust, Great drama about real life,"I am not normally moved to review on IMDB but this drama is really good. Unfortunately this was hyped by the programme makers and the media to be about sex and open marriages; however that is not the core of the story at all. It is about relationships at all different levels and across generations. It explores what works and what doesn't, how relationships can improve and fall apart, how first impressions definitely don't always count. <br/><br/>I think the script writing was very well crafted; each episode actually had a different pace to it that kept it interesting and watchable. It showed the difference between a proper serialised drama - where each episode can stand alone - and a drawn out epic where a story is told over 10 hours that could really be a 2 hour film.<br/><br/>Yes - as the poor reviews say the sex scenes are uncomfortable; but that is real life!! Lots of sexual relationships are entirely uncomfortable and not as typically portrayed in Hollywood. It makes this programme come across all the more convincing. <br/><br/>As for the comments on episode 5 - just watch it and make your own minds up.

I've admired everything that Toni Collette has done. She is funny, vibrant and can bring a tear to the eye. Not in this series. She seems to struggle with dull lines to deliver, not giving us a character with whom we can easily identify. The show does pick up from the anemic first episode but not enough to keep me intrigued. I realize I'm not the intended audience but when you aim your product at a specific group of people, you risk alienating the rest of us. The reviews here on IMDB are predominantly glowing so perhaps this is just not my cup of tea. But the writers should have done a better job of infusing humanity into the characters and situations.

And oh so very charming they brief their children about their arrangement. Because we all live in an uber modern and liberated world. And they can both find partners oh so easily and simultaneously so no one feels left out. 
And then the writers decide to go down the morality route. Jealousy starts creeping in, society starts judging, one gets more serious with the extra marital thing, whereas the other is more superfluous about it like a teenager. The teenagers surprisingly are more adults than the parents, but anyway.

2925,Jeopardy!, The Greatest Quiz Show of All Time!,"Over the course of more than 50 years of television history, there have been many game shows.  Some of them very good and some really awful. ""Jeopardy"" stands head and shoulders above any other game show ever made!<br/><br/>The reason I like Jeopardy is that it challenges the contestants both in the studio and watching at home.  The questions are very intelligent and require some thought.  I consider myself pretty smart and well-educated and I find it challenging.  And it's very entertaining.  It does not ""talk down"" to any viewer.<br/><br/>I don't get to watch Jeopardy very often because I'm so busy and don't watch a lot of TV. But we have had the home game for many years -- first as the board game, then as the DOS version computer game and now as the CD-ROM Windows 98/NT/2000 version with all the special effects.  I have played this game with my children who are now teenagers and find it very educational. Without trying you can actually learn things about history, geography, music, art, and many, many other topics.<br/><br/>I like the college Jeopardy because it is geared for a younger generation and it is very challenging to the contestants. Middle aged folks like myself may not know all the new hip music and movies.  The only variant I don't like is Celebrity Jeopardy because, like ""Hollywood Squares"" they can be just too cute to stomach.  The ""Saturday Night Live"" parodies are a hoot!<br/><br/>
Alex has been criticized by some of the other viewers but he keeps the show on track and on time, not an easy task.<br/><br/>I don't think I'd have the nerve to personally be a contestant on the real TV show, but I enjoy blurting out the answers at home with my family, and I play the home game.<br/><br/>Too many television shows are aimed at the ""Lowest Common Denominator"" of viewer, but Jeopardy is both entertaining and challenging to people even who have above average intelligence and education.

True to form Alex jokingly said ""Truth told, I have to! Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host Jeopardy! For three more years! So help me. Keep the faith and we'll win. We'll get it done.""<br/><br/>Jeopardy is one of those unique TV quiz shows that the contestants did not have to dress up in silly costumes to compete, but rather accept the fact that they may be dressed down by a question that most of the TV audience knew was a part of history and/or celebrity nostalgia. Jeopardy seemed to reach higher than normal TV audiences when a game show contestant was on a seemingly unbeatable day to day win streak such as with the recent Jeopardy special series titled ""Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time"" starring the top three past Jeopardy winners, Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter and James Holzhauer.<br/><br/>This series was watched by tens of millions of viewers decade after decade, and how many TV shows can state this record of longevity? I hope the producers entrust the continuation of Jeopardy! As a homage to the late great quizmaster Alex Trebek by replacing him with a worthy new host such as Ken Jennings maybe?<br/><br/>Trivia: Alex hosted an earlier quiz show in the 1960's targeted at high school aged students titled ""Reach For the Top"" which challenged two (2) high schools competing with a team of four (4) students per team and answering skilled questions under rapid fire, somewhat similar to the format of Jeopardy!<br/><br/>I give Jeopardy a 9 out of 10 but I rated it a 10 IMDB rating purely for the classy and loveable host Alex Trebek whose angels wings await him at heavens gates.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,8 November 2020

2931,Jeopardy!, Best Game Show Ever,"Jeopardy is arguably the best game show around today. Tougher and more competitive than Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, it is at once entertaining and educational. Alex Trebek is a classic game show host, whose mere presence adds to the show.<br/><br/>Whereas Millionaire has one set of questions that the player must go through one by one, Jeopardy adds an element of choice to the game, as players have to pick the category and prize level of their question. This element requires strategy on the part of the competitors, particularly when confronted with Daily Doubles where one can bet all one's winnings.<br/><br/>The questions (or answers as the case may be) are also crafted well. Whereas other quiz shows rely heavily on trivia for the most part, Jeopardy requires an expansive knowledge of obscure topics, with heavy doses of literary obscurities and arcane history. It is one of the few shows on today that should be required viewing for school children.<br/><br/>The show has slipped somewhat in recent years. The addition of the ""Clue Crew"" was a definite misstep, while the extensive use of video clues seems to be something of a distraction. Luckily, the producers seem to have gotten the message, and have cut down on the Crew considerably.

Science, History, Geography, Politics, these were the kind of categories that would come up to test the minds of the contestants. The new program has become all-too-much a test of how much pop junk info you've got in your head, what celebrity married whom, which Shakespeare play has a redheaded man who wears black shoes and brown socks, which sports team did such and such or which athlete lost or won what contest. I was talking to one of my brothers the other day, and he summed it up that today's society has got to place too high a value on useless information, and become too little concerned about teaching young people things that will benefit them throughout their lives. If it would be of absolutely ZERO value to you if you were marooned on a desert island, you might be less brilliant, and more of the other kind of ""maroon"" à la Bugs Bunny, to know the latest about the Kardashians, Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears; who killed Roger Rabbit?, and which country won the most medals for synchronized swimming at the 2004 Olympics (were there Olympics in 2004?); than if you know the significance 3.14159, that there are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram, 5,280 feet in a mile, that -40C = -40F, that the USA is a Constitutional Republic and not a Democracy, what the Federal Reserve System is, or other actually useful information. Shame on those who have taken a great and classic game show, and dumbed it down. I've also noticed that, historically, men were much, MUCH more likely to win the game than women; and have heard recently that there are or were allegations that Jeopardy! altered the clues in some way to favor female contestants. I don't know if they did, or didn't, but there have been an increasing number of women winning on Jeopardy, with certain characteristics in common. Finally, I also have a problem with the change that allows a winner to keep being a winner, for days, weeks, even longer if he/she is ""good"" enough. Think what it would be like, you've waited two and a half years for your chance to get on the show. You've paid for your airfare out to Los Angeles, you're in a hotel, you've got your good clothes all dry-cleaned, and it isn't even until the fourth day you've reported to the studio that you get your chance, and you go out onto the set only to find yourself facing a champion who has been on the show for three weeks and has got the method of buzzing in down pat. You don't stand much of a chance. You wind up in third place, and get $1,000.00 for your appearance.

2948,Jeopardy!," Definitive of the ""good old days""","Jeopardy, the game show, is definitive of the ""good old days"".<br/><br/>It's no ""frills or fakes"", ""no models walking across the floor"". It was made to be a true game show. To win, you had to know real facts.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be smart enough to win, unless I played a couple of IMDb posters, in which case I'd be a shoo in.<br/><br/>There is a ""Jeopardy of the past"" and a ""Jeopardy of Today"". Sad to say, that's why the ""good old days"" truly were better.<br/><br/>In the past, you had to be knowledgeable about many subjects which required something besides pop culture or reading tabloids. In the past, the contestant who won ""earned"" a win. Only ""Wheel of Fortune"" can make the same boast. The other game shows were either sheer luck (spin a wheel, roll a dice, choose a curtain), sheer dorkiness (knowing each Hollywod celebrity's marital status), or sheer obvious cheating (Name That Tune-contestants naming a song in one or two notes, played by a band that sounded nothing like the original song. You do know there are only 13 notes? Only 13 combinations for one note, and only 169 for two notes, yet out of the tens of thousands of songs, contestants would name the right song-yeah, it was fixed).<br/><br/>But Jeopardy, you would score yourself at home, and lose, but you didn't feel bad, because you knew the winner ""earned"" it. The winner knew about Chemistry, Math, World History, American History, Sports, Drama, even the Arts, all in a nice proportion.<br/><br/>Then came the ""clue crew"", and it was shot to Hell. No longer could you feel you were beaten by someone more outstanding. Now, the winner had to be a superdork. Whereas before a tenth of the questions might be for dorks to get some scores, questions about the latest pop singer's vacation, about the latest movie's star's real name...now, 90% of the questions were for the dorks, and the nerds now have no chance.<br/><br/>I don't mind losing to a nerd. They have some degree of intellect. Losing to some dork just because the dork knows how many Coen brothers there are, but not how many great lakes there are, that would be unforgivable.<br/><br/>The ""clue crew"" ruined it in other ways. Jeopardy was once as much audio as visual. Now, if you have a small screen, you can't see what they are pointing to, and they can't enunciate, so you don't understand what they are saying.<br/><br/>The rating of 6 is a balance of ""10"" for Jeopardy before this date, ""6"" on this date, and ""2"" for today.",3 out of 8 found this helpful.,3.0,11 September 2012
2949,Jeopardy!," Today's Final Jeopardy Category is: ""Ahl-ex Spakes Fronch""! Translation: ""Alex Speaks French!""","""JEOPARDY"" had been a very good TV Quiz Show program 1964-75. Pleasant and properly ""High Brow"" Art Fleming, an Actor by trade, was the Host/Emcee for the length of the show's run. The show was slotted as part of NBC's Daytime Line-Up. It was abruptly canceled in 1975. After all of its success, it got the ax, anyway.<br/><br/>Well, wouldn't you know it, but after this 9 year hiatus, ""JEOPARDY"" was back. It seems that the American Televiewing Audience was ready for ready for a Round 2 in this bout. And after a slow start, it sure looks like this may well be a Championship Bout, with a return bout or two.<br/><br/>This time around, we had the mustachioed Mr. Alex Trebek, installed in the all-important Host/M.C. position. Amiable, knowledgeable (Hell, He's got the Answer Cards!) and possessing a commanding Stage Presence, the Canadian-born Mr. Trebek had gotten his earlier broadcast experience with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a Newsman. Then he did some Game Shows on the CBC before coming south across the World's Longest unfortified border to the U.S. of A. and the National Broadcasting Company for a gig on a forgotten game show called ""THE WIZARD OF ODDS"".(1973-74) This got Alex's then long haired and Kaiser Wilhelm mustached countenance out in front, where his talents and abilities took over, keeping him continually in the public spotlight (a prime requisite in this Network Game Show Host Racket).<br/><br/>So, by that Orwellian Watershed year of 1984, Alex was ready to get in front of the camera as well as doing a share of the Producer chores on the retooled ""JEOPARDY"" This time the show would not have to put the decision of its life or death into the hands, and at the whim of any Network ""Suits"". Creator Merv Griffin, Columbia-Tri Star TV (later known as Sony Pictures Television) and Alex all gambled on putting all their eggs into the 'Basket' called Syndication. The risk seems to have been a big one, but one that sure paid dividends as it all worked out.<br/><br/>That it was highly successful is now strictly academic! The proof is most definitely in the pudding. And this pudding has been around now for some 23 broadcast seasons in syndication and counting. So now they've more than doubled the run of the original series' run and they continue to add to their own record! You see now just what the international co-operation of these 2 North American Giants can accomplish! Canada, represented by Mr. Alex Trebek, and the United States, represented by the Late Mr. Merv Griffin, can both stand tall, brave and free; even they are both definitely in ""JEOPARDY!""",2 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,10 November 2007
2950,The Cleveland Show, I gave it a chance...,"When I first heard that there was going to be this show, my first thought was, ""What? A show centered around a somewhat bland supporting character from FAMILY GUY?"" But I decided I would give the show a chance. After all, there have been stranger premises that have worked.<br/><br/>Later, I found out that the character of Cleveland Jr. had been changed from a (hilarious) hyperactive young boy into a fat and slow teenager. But I decided I would still give the show a chance. Maybe this revised character would be funny.<br/><br/>A day before the show first aired, I was surfing the Internet and came across a selection of reviews of the show. They were almost all negative. But I was still willing to give the show a chance. Sometimes critics are wrong.<br/><br/>The next day, I watched the pilot episode. It was terrible. But I decided I would still give the show a chance. Sometimes writers need time to polish their writing for a new show.<br/><br/>As I write this, I've watched some more episodes of the show. And I think I can say now that this show simply doesn't work. It's not very funny - it seems to be written by teenaged fans of FAMILY GUY who have no professional writing experience. Not only that, the show is cursed by some characters that are a major turn-off. They are not only written to be annoying, they have some of the worst voice acting I've heard in a cartoon series.<br/><br/>This show will get no more chances from me.",127 out of 203 found this helpful.,,12 October 2009

2954,The Cleveland Show, We Are Watching The Decline Of The Animated Sitcom Unfold,"From the producers of Family Guy, well what do you expect from them. They pushed the envelope for censors on television with some of the most racy material seen on national television with that show. Which is somewhat funny at moments. Though its essentially a guilty pleasure to laugh at even those jokes when watching the whole show. Thats a compliment for such an overly sexual,and politicized show that uses toilet humor and cultural references as their substance.<br/><br/>This new show their packaging without any doubt is overtly shallow because the Family Guy team tries to expand their market with the humorless Cleveland character by making this race based Family Guy-Brady-Bunch hybrid. Though it also shows the decline of animated sitcom's as tasteless, uninspired, and stagnant. We saw Sit Down, Shut Up and recent Simpsons episodes as major disappointments obviously this show doesn't help.<br/><br/>The cast seems to have been thought up without much thought or development just a group of Caucasian Family Guy producers guessing on how the normal African American family works, using The Jeffersons and The Cosby show as references. It seems to be more of a sad attempt at trying to create a wholesome but very stereotypical black animated sitcom while retaining all the edginess of Family Guy. The family is created very stereotypically for an African American family a daughter that wants to do things on her own terms. A five year old son who peeps at women. A mother that needs a man to help out. Then the main character that uses low-tasteless catchphrases.<br/><br/>Also neighbors consist of a group of immigrant bears which is surreal just by me mentioning it. A Redneck so the producers can racially profile the south as still racist. Also finally a 21st century hipster named Holt. All of whom aid Cleveland on this joke of a show.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the show yet your in for the painful reality of how this show is a sign that Fox's Golden Age as the dominant animated sitcom provider is long gone. Watching the opening is a clear sign of what your in for the next 30 minutes pointless, shallow, stereotypical unadulterated crap. You don't need to take it from me that this show sucks just compare it with a strong television concept and there's no contest. You will clearly see how stupid Family Guy producers were to create this. This is even low for them.",84 out of 146 found this helpful.,1.0,29 September 2009

No it isn't to die for funny but it will make you genuinely laugh hard plenty of times.<br/><br/>The show failed because too many characters were complete disasters. Tim, Lester, and Holt are God awful. Tim's whole gimmick is sounding like a muppet and being a bear, Lesters whole gimmick is being a moronic redneck, and Holt's whole gimmick is being an unfunny dwarf. Cleveland and Junior are on par with Peter as far as their comedic value. They tone it way down in the Family Guy episodes and I wish I knew why. Cleveland is incredibly relatable and he and Donna are a perfect comedy duo. (WAY better than Peter and Lois as a couple but not funnier than Peter)<br/><br/>Rallo and Roberta are just alright. They're not actually terrible as side characters. Meg and Chris are not funny. I don't care who disagrees. An episode of Family Guy will never focus on them because they are not interesting enough to be more than side characters. We're pretty much getting the same thing with Rallo and Roberta. Junior however is pretty funny.<br/><br/>I wish this show wasn't cancelled but changed instead.

2957,The Cleveland Show," Very, Very, Very Funny.","I was extremely shocked to see the overall rating of this show. It is highly misunderstood. In my opinion, I think people just tend to blow it off because they assume it's a get get rich cheap quick cartoon from Seth MacFarlane. <br/><br/>They are wrong, it has some of the funniest humor I have ever seen in it. I'll even admit it, I did not give this show a chance in the least until it arrived on Netflix. I originally watched the season premiere, got a few laughs, then stopped watching because I had better things to do or watch. I was mistaken.<br/><br/>Yes, at times it may make you feel as if you're on acid or shrooms, or high in general.. but that's one of it's qualities. Very spontaneous, clever, and packed full of hilarious jokes. Joke after joke after joke, yet they still manage to connect at an emotional level, oddly enough, or I may just be crazy with part. You can decide that.<br/><br/>I've noticed when I introduce to people to the show, they are always kind of skeptical, sort of like, ""I don't like this show, it's not that funny. Let's just watch Family Guy."" Then I show them a few choice episodes and they instantly fall in love. For example, the episode where Cleveland Jr. and Kenny West (Kanye West), get in a rap battle. (*Brotherly Love.) It had us crying of laughter. Also, the magical walrus that will appear at random times, always just in time, to save Cleveland, his family, or him and his friends. Cleveland always manages to crack us up with his random one liners, too.<br/><br/>I think the show is a hidden gem and you should give it a chance. You will most likely warm up to it and absolutely love it. It always manages to put me in a good mood.

The whole 'black show' thing seemed doomed to failure by simply being insulting to the audience it might also be trying to appeal to. It didn't make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>So I didn't watch it.<br/><br/>However, I don't know what happened in-between, but I watched a couple episodes the other day which were perfectly good! I don't know how late in the series they were (which was canceled after 88 episodes) but it looks like the show got comfortable with its characters and learned how to use them right. Perhaps the show suffered from its early poor image and never recovered, hence it being canceled.<br/><br/>I therefore recommend to you and myself to give later seasons a try.

I'm thinking maybe people are giving this negative reviews because they aren't quite relating to the show as well... or perhaps they're having trouble with a pretty regular character from Family Guy completely removed from that show? I don't know, but this is a great addition to Seth's work.<br/><br/>The bears are just hilarious (I love their inexplicable accents) and the redneck neighbors are great. The dynamics between Cleveland and his new family and neighbors are still developing, but I think it's already making for a good show. I personally would rate American Dad as number one, then Family Guy, and then the Cleveland Show, but they are all deliciously funny and well done. Definitely give this show a chance.

Boy was I wrong..<br/><br/>For starters the rewrite of Cleveland Jr was a bad decision. The original concept would've been much better then what they created.<br/><br/>Secondly Cleveland's charter has been completely ruined. His appeal in Family Guy stems largely from from the abuse he takes from Loretta. The transition to and the new family dynamic the writers created is just plain idiotic.<br/><br/>Even worse the writers seem bent on making this a show entirely about race.

Whilst the family guy complete randomness and cut away scenes are a lot of fun it does sometimes seem like they don't have a plot at all any more. That;s not necessarily a bad thing though sometimes a sitcom with a central plot to each episode is nice.<br/><br/>The Cleveland show is just a traditional sitcom structure (though it does have a couple of cutaway scenes). <br/><br/>I don't really want to spoil it for people but if you liked family guy and didn't like American dad you probably won't like this either.

In fact, The Cleveland Show is one of my least favourite shows ever, animated or not. I have nothing against animation whatsoever, some of my favourite films and shows are animated, but this show is awful in my opinion and a disservice to this fine art.<br/><br/>Family Guy and American Dad may not have impressed me that much, but they actually did have moments of solid animation, voice acting and writing, more when they started than now. The Cleveland Show has none of those things and never did. The show is for me not that good animation wise. The characters are poorly drawn, and the backgrounds and colours are so flat it's painful. The voice acting is annoying on the whole, Seth McFarlane is usually terrific but even he sounds bored here.<br/><br/>The stories are also predictable and contrived, with constant moments of lethargic pacing and lazy direction. But what really hurts The Cleveland Show are the humour and characters. The writing is terrible, it is hugely unfunny and borders on offensive, while the jokes rely too much on pop culture which I think will date quite quickly. I also hate the characters, none of them are likable and they are little more than stereotypes(quite insensitive ones at that). Cleveland did have his likable and funny moments on Family Guy, but he isn't a strong enough character to warrant his own show, and that is a big part of the problem.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I love animation but I really hate this show. 1/10 Bethany Cox",20 out of 36 found this helpful.,1.0,24 February 2011

Sadly, FOX renewed it for season 2, and it will probably last at least 4 seasons.",20 out of 37 found this helpful.,1.0,15 April 2010
2972,The Cleveland Show, So this is what replaced King of the Hill?,"I don't know why FOX was so quick to canceling King of the Hill without second thoughts, granted King of the Hill wasn't a groundbreaking masterpiece, but it did have a wholesome plot that dealt with a lot of morals and realism, lovable characters,&amp; offered plenty of laughs. WHICH IS WAAYYY MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR THIS POINTLESS TRIPE!!!<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I don't hate Cleveland Brown, in fact, I kinda liked him but I can't see how Seth can devote an entire show to him and result in being a good show especially considering the sad fact that a show with a cast fully consisting of African Americans rarely works out. However I went to see it anyways because I will admit to being somewhat a fan of Family Guy and boy was that mistake I will forever regret, the plot lines are ridiculously stupid,&amp; not only that, it offers NOTHING new to the plate, everything in this show you've seen before, even the concept(Man loses house to wife but keeps the son, goes back to his hometown and marries his high school sweetheart; Correct me if I'm wrong but it feels like the concept was done many times before). The characterization is lousy too, Cleveland's new family are nothing more than a stereotypical African American household, I mean you have the sassy, attractive, big-booty wife(Donna Tubbs), the bratty, self-centered, first-born daughter(Roberta Tubbs), they changed Cleveland Jr. to the typical nerdy, momma's boy middle child - Still to this day I question why they did that,&amp; lastly, we have the typical rambunctious youngest child(Rallo Tubbs). As for Cleveland himself, he's pretty much been reduced to being a black Peter Griffin. There are other characters as well, like Cleveland's old and new friends but I really don't care for any of them,&amp; out of all of them, I really hate the Bear the most, he's just there for comedic effect, he has no depth whatsoever. The humor is the same as Family Guy's, only 100x dumber. Fortunely for the Cleveland show the animation is decent, the voice-acting is good although shoddy at times however the music is forgettable, I really hate the theme song, it's like a stereotypical 80's theme and it reminds me of how much they ruined Cleveland's character.<br/><br/>Verdict: <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, even the most die-hard Family Guy fans shouldn't subject themselves to suffering from this dreck.",18 out of 34 found this helpful.,2.0,24 June 2011

2974,The Cleveland Show, Possibly the Worst of All Time,"Shortly after the second episode, I sat down to write a scathingly bad review, but, there were so many others that I thought it a waste of time to share my views about a soon-to-be-canceled show. Also, like trying to fairly judge a new restaurant on opening night, I thought that my negative opinion may have been premature. I have since recorded and attempted to watch portions of several other episodes. Last evenings Christmas show absolutely crossed the line and established a new personal definition of ""awful"". I am a huge ""Family Guy"" fan and near-famous for my warped, sick and twisted sense of humor. I just find nothing funny in a constant and disgusting reference to genitalia and perverted sex. The attempted African American humor is lame, racist, and sexist to an almost criminal degree.

2975,Shark Tank, Terrific Concept And Great Learning Tool,"As an entrepreneur myself, I've dealt with investors and VC's, and I can honestly say that the Sharks are a great representation of real-life. They come across as harsh, money-grubbing, and greedy most of the time. But the kicker is that in the world of investing, you have to be this way and more, or else you get railroaded by the guys willing to go the extra mile. Often times I feel the Sharks do a great job of rooting out the good businesses from the ones that likely will crash and burn. I've observed that they'll usually ask for a majority percentage in the company if the presenter is somebody who hasn't really proved themselves in the wide market. To me this is absolutely fair, because the return is that the presenter has the opportunity to work with a partner who's made millions or billions of dollars, and provides a wealth of knowledge and experience. In short, if you're a start-up or recent start-up, you might not want to go on this show, because you'll likely give up more of your company than you want to. If you have a tried and true product, and need extra cash to expand or market yourself, this is a great opportunity. For viewers with interests in business or who want to learn more about business, I highly recommend Shark Tank. It's educational, smart, creative, and ultimately worthy of your time.",61 out of 68 found this helpful.,10.0,21 October 2012
2976,Shark Tank," Fascinating, hilarious, and engrossing show about entrepreneurship.","Shark Tank isn't your average reality show. It isn't your average show period, because Shark Tank offers a lot more than contestants asking the Sharks for money and making deals. That is the plot essentially, basically the American Idol for struggling entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs make a pitch for an investment, the Sharks decide whether or not to invest, and if they do, they may have a Shark fight and try to outbid each other, sometimes aggressively so. But the beautiful thing is the wide variety of entrepreneurs there are on the show. There have been things pitched from action movies to fart-resistant underwear to surgically implantable bluetooth into your ear, and everything in between. <br/><br/>Many people's stories are touching, some even evoking an emotional response from me which is quite difficult. On the flip side, some are horrifically bad and hilarity ensues watching the Sharks rip them to shreds. The greatest thing about the show is how real it is. You can tell that the Sharks have genuine personalities and as you get to know them, their interactions become a lot funnier and a lot more personal. The show didn't have a consistent group of Sharks until season 3-4, but it's been fairly consistent since then, and their chemistry is absolutely perfect. Especially when a brilliant entrepreneur comes along with an amazing product and every Shark wants in. That's when things get explosive and at one point so intense that 3 of them walked off set.<br/><br/>It's also a phenomenal learning experience. Now, I know nothing about business. At least I didn't prior to watching Shark Tank, and the learning curve is quite simple. Once you understand the concept of valuation and risk assessment it's pretty easy to follow the mathematics of it. So for example, if someone came in asking for $100k for 10% equity in the company, they're valuing the company at $1 million because it would take 10 times the growth in order to pay back the investor. That's how the Sharks think, so understandably when people come in asking for $500k for 5% equity in their company ($10 million valuation), the Sharks expect some damn good sales to back that up. Since the show is entirely based around the Sharks, I figured I'd go down the list and express how I feel about them individually.<br/><br/>Robert Herjavec - A cyber security genius, Robert is the most likable guy on planet Earth. He's unmatched in his kindness, fondness for animals and his blind willingness to try out any entrepreneur's idea. He's a father with the heart of a child, and most importantly he's an excellent businessman. Being the nicest Shark, it's really fun watching Robert get down and dirty which does happen occasionally between fellow Sharks and entrepreneurs alike, and he can definitely hold his own against some of the other, bigger Sharks.<br/><br/>Lori Greiner - Queen of QVC bombshell Lori Greiner proves to be one of the more passive-aggressive and manipulative Sharks. Her charming persona is easy bait for entrepreneurs, especially paired with her humble smile, welcoming voice, and undeniable good looks. She's also an intelligent investor, using her TV leverage to score a lot of deals. She appears to be warm and fuzzy on the outside, but she definitely has a mischievous underbelly to her that sparks many unforgettable arguments amongst the Sharks.<br/><br/>Barbara Corcoran - Real estate mogul and a cunning snake when it comes to business. It's lovely watching the enjoyment she gets out of screwing over the other Sharks, and it's a testament to her marketing skills because she is a phenomenal salesperson. You can tell that she's actually a great person at heart, constantly looking after her entrepreneurs and taking them under her wing. Also, her altercations with Mr. O'Leary are unmatched. Speaking of...<br/><br/>Kevin O'Leary a.k.a. Mr. Wonderful - The Sharkiest of Sharks, this man lives and breathes money. He's a wine connoisseur and knows everything about everything. He's the epitome of both a venture capitalist and a wine snob. He's blunt, he's rude, unforgiving, ruthless, but most of all, he's hilarious. I can't count the times I got stomach pains from laughing at the things Kevin says. Whether it's about complaining about his tastevin (which is a story in itself) or blatant dry sarcasm, everything this man says is pure gold. He's also a brilliant salesman and an aggressive investor, known for his infamous royalty deals.<br/><br/>Daymond John - This laid-back fashion guru can be quiet and unassuming one minute but eloquent and aggressive the next. He's very smart and chooses his investments wisely. He's truly an interesting character because he's insightful and understanding of entrepreneurs, going so far as to follow one out of the Tank to convince he and his wife that he wants the best for their family.<br/><br/>Mark Cuban - The Big Kahuna, Mavericks owner, tech king, down-to-earth billionaire. This man is one of the hardest workers and smartest people on the planet. He's a listener first and foremost, speaking only when he needs information or when something needs to be said. He also causes the most controversy between the Sharks because his net worth ($3 billion) is far higher than anyone else's so he has the freedom to jump into someone's deal last minute and steal it right from under their nose. He has the money to spare, and while some of his investments are crapshoots, his thought process on getting to his conclusions are truly fascinating. He gives the show character, as every Shark does, and the chemistry between them all is incredible.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say. I've learned so much by watching this show, and as is said many times in the show, Shark Tank is proof that the American dream is still alive and well.",39 out of 46 found this helpful.,9.0,6 October 2015
2977,Shark Tank, Good learning vehicle if you can gloss over the bad manners,"""Sharks"" is an interesting concept. It's a ""reality TV show"" and the reality is that budding entrepreneurs come before a collection of 5 experienced entrepreneurs and make a pitch, hoping to attract dollars and guidance from one or more of the so-called sharks. The sharks change from time to time, but the main ones are Robert Herjavec, Daymond John, and Kevin O'Leary. Barbara Corcoran alternates with Lori Greiner as the token woman. Kevin Harrington was an early contributor but lately Mark Cuban has been the 5th member.<br/><br/><ul><li>Herjavec (1963) is from Canada and made his money in internet security. - John (1969) is from NYC and made his money through FUBU clothing line. - O'Leary (1954) is a Canadian and made his money inventing SoftKey and later The Learning Company. he usually plays ""the bad guy"" - Corcoran (1949) is from New Jersey and made her money in the NYC real estate market - Greiner is called ""The Queen of QVC"" where she created more than 400 products. She is often the ""sweet one"" - Cuban (1958) is from Pittsburg and owns the NBA Dallas Mavericks and Landmark Pictures. - Harrington (1957) is famous for creating the first ""infomercial""</li></ul><br/><br/>Each episode, guests pitch their products and generally speaking, they are critiqued by the sharks often in a hostile and demeaning manner. That's part of the ""show biz"" flare, but many people will find it objectionable.<br/><br/>As a learning vehicle, the show offers some good examples of how to (and how not to) present their ideas. It's well worth viewing for anyone interested in business and anyone who thinks that at some time they may have to pitch their own ideas.",18 out of 26 found this helpful.,8.0,24 June 2013

Identical concept, almost identical execution.<br/><br/>The things that are different are all improvements; the title is better - makes more sense to westerners. There is no annoying presenter doing pieces to camera. The dragons... sorry, sharks are billionaires, and every investment that they make results in multi-million dollar revenue for the entrepreneurs, and the amounts that they invest are often way bigger too, making the whole thing a higher stakes proposition than the humbler British version, and thus more entertaining.<br/><br/>Also, the sharks switch around, so it's not always the same five, but over the course of a season you get to know them all, so it's still comfortably familiar. And they're mostly likeable (like the British ones) but way ruder and a bit funnier.<br/><br/>Overall, it's Dragon's Den, but better.",10 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,8 July 2018

2980,Shark Tank, overall a good show,"Even though I do agree with the other reviews that the sharks can be a little hard on some of the people making their sales pitches, I have to disagree with the fact that this would be enough of a reason to not watch the show to begin with. Some of the people who do have legitimately good ideas do not get any offers. This seems to be for rather obvious reasons some times, the people don't want to let the sharks in on the entire business, they over estimate the value of their ideas, etc. But on the other hand, even if these people walk away with out a deal, they do get something of great value having been on the show. They get national attention which can (and has) led to other investors for their ideas. I like to watch the show just to see all the creative ideas people pitch to the sharks.",13 out of 21 found this helpful.,9.0,7 April 2012
2981,Shark Tank, How much arrogance can you show deliver?,"I used to like this show, I really did. However the incredible arrogance shown by the sharks is sometimes just hard to watch. I realize that the arrogance goes with the territory of who they are and some of it can be expected but it just gets to be too much. I just watched an episode with a salesman whom ALL of the sharks believed had a good idea and the guy was great. Mark decided he didn't want to make the deal only for the fact that the salesman didn't jump at his offer immediately. He then goes on to scold the man for not ""closing"" the deal as a salesman should and of course said no. This happens often on the show. They claim that its not personal and its only business, however, when the sharks feel slighted or the people don't jump on their offers immediately, they scold and berate their ""selling"" abilities. It has gotten more and more hypocritical and for that reason alone, I'm not watching anymore. It's just my personal opinion and I'm sure many others feel differently, but I felt deeply enough about it to write this.",33 out of 70 found this helpful.,4.0,20 February 2012
2982,Shark Tank, Great Show about Business for up and coming entrepreneurs but arrogance...,"This is a pretty good show. There are five sharks, each of whom are successful business men.

There are some fantastic ideas and fantastic ways that the people first got the money to start their business that are inspiring. However the sharks... Mark Cuban is in my opinion the best shark. When a product is BS, he knows it and tells them he's out. But sometimes, he further demeans them in a way which is almost painful to watch. Same with Daymond sometimes. Kevin O' Leary is truly the worst. He keeps making awful analogies about how his money is his soldiers and other stupid stuff like that.

2984,Shark Tank, Shark tank has gone bad!!!!,"To begin I feel the pull of the show has gone sour. I feel that the cast and all that they stand for has become so...messed up toward each other as well as the viewers and I believe it's lost everything it had going for it. They once upon a time were kind to the seller and to each other but in late episodes they have become so stuck on themselves and superior to the other sharks as well as to the seller. They have become for a lack of a better word. A- holes. All of them. They think of themselves as gods when in reality they have not as much money as a lot of the wealthier people in the u.s. let me just start by saying ""Look sharks, if your out, then shut it!!"" and stop saying stupid mean repulsive things about the shark giving the offer? Why do you have to open your mouth...remember?...your out so shut up!!! Because I'm very sure in one episode you offended a 13 yr old girl by saying what you said. YOU ARE NOT GODS' and need to stop acting as if you are so superior to your watchers and to the people needing help because ALL of you were at some point in their shoes so who are you to act superior to them? All of the sharks now cause me not to watch the show because of how they all act toward the seller. It's not something I want to watch. Even if what they have is a bad idea you do NOT have to act like they are stupid or ignorant and like you are so far ahead of them. To end this I will say I used to like the show, back when they would let every shark make an offer but now it's as if you don't take my offer right after I give it then ""I'm out"" which is extremely ridiculous. Grow up children. That is the reason they are on the show. They want the best deal and offer they don't want to hear one crappy shark offer a crappy deal and feel like they have to take it because if they don't then that shark is out no matter what. I would never go on your show because of just that. Also, I will never watch the show again because of that. Why would anyone go on the show I wonder, when all it would do is make them feel like crap about themselves and feel like they have got to take the first, worst offer, or that stupid childish shark, is out. He/she is out because of a pity party they have for themselves because they lost to another shark.

2987,Shark Tank, This review fell through after I wrote it,"I know I know, shows like this are light entertainment. They are no business school. That said, they show very clearly how America got into a terrible recession, now lessons were not learnt and how not to do business.<br/><br/>It launched with the mission to be an antidote to the recession, to show how business can boom and flourish in tough times. However it fails to learn from the mistakes and instead dives straight back into the sort of behaviour that caused the crisis in the first place.<br/><br/>The sharks make for fun TV, and vary from respectful to hateful. Kevin is one of the worst for denigrating guests but weirdly having watched three seasons he is one of the most sensible and if you read through the bluster there is some decency. But decency is few and far between.<br/><br/><ul><li>The sharks want it ALL. Equity stakes of up to 80% sometimes (100% even offered). They don't want to partner and encourage entrepreneurs, they want to take control and reduce any drive from the pitchers.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They are bullies. They often zero respect for fellow humans and business people. Yes you have more money - but that doesn't remove common decency. Frequent tantrums like withdrawing their offer as the guest didn't answer quick enough (this is people's lives that they are deciding under the spotlights) or placing arbitrary time limits to rush decision making are completely unacceptable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The pitchers spend SO much money before they even hit the den. Hundreds of thousands on development and patents before they've even tested the market. This is a dangerous lesson that is perpetuated in America - and lines the pockets of patents lawyers. Hence they come into the tank indebted and desperate before they've even sold a product.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Most deals fall through. Having read up all the pitches, deals tend to fall through - as once the TV excitement has gone the sharks lose interest (and in fairness, sometimes the pitchers too). What's really bad is sometimes a shark will outbid another shark in a fit of arrogance - only to then let it drop after the show. The other investor may have added value but they take the view of ""If it can't be mine, it can't be anyone's"".</li></ul><br/><br/>And - the big test of time - most of the companies have disappeared from the first three seasons. Investment or not, they nearly all die. Which is a damning assessment of the influence of the sharks, the power of TV advertising and the spirit that the show is trying to portray.<br/><br/>Yes there's been a couple of big hits, but given the amount of product pitches I'd say it's probably below average for the normal business success rate. Shark Tanks is almost a place where products gone to die.<br/><br/>Really it's a lesson how not to do business: become indebted, treat people like dirt, bully people, push out other investors for the hell of it... but it makes for okay TV.

2991,Shark Tank, more embarrassing to the sharks than to the minnows,"This show is a disgrace. One initially approaches it from the perspective that one might--just might--learn something about business: after all, fantastically wealthy people (who presumably earned their money through ingenuity and razor-sharp judgment) are--on live {as it were} TV, no less--making life-or-death decisions about real companies.<br/><br/>So much for the hype. Now comes the reality . . .<br/><br/>One shark is ruder than the next. Each shark can scarcely wait for the next opportunity to tell the world how astute, accomplished, and demonically brilliant he is. I wonder how they would feel if Bill Gates showed up and--with pocket change--bought and sold these clowns and sent them to the poorhouse on a remote planet. Their behavior is monstrous: they seem interested only in squeezing the gonads of everyone who comes before them, offering pennies on the dollar despite legitimate valuations.<br/><br/>(Since, admittedly, many of the would-be entrepreneurs' ideas are beyond poor, I wonder why the sharks would even invite them onto the show in the first place--unless to provide themselves even cheaper, easier fodder {they don't want to risk insulting someone with a brain, as that may backfire}--but I digress . . .)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, few and far between are the entrepreneurs who have the guts to put the sharks in their place . . . for, it is also true that the ability to suck backside can, after all, be an important ingredient in garnering success. But, IMHO, most of the minnows could--and should--do far better than to trot their wares before these abject buffoons who specialize in self-embarrassment, showcasing the very worst that entrepreneurial America has to offer.<br/><br/>I find myself considering the true entrepreneurs of the past--the likes of Andrew Carnegie and Theodore Roosevelt, who recognized from the tenderest of physical ages that their tremendous wealth carried with it an equally tremendous responsibility and obligation toward society . . . and I cry for these rapacious ne'er-do-wells who perform on my TV screen much as monkeys at the zoo will happily play with their own feces for the amusement of the crowds.",33 out of 140 found this helpful.,3.0,5 October 2012

2997,Shark Tank, A Complete SHAME to the Country,"I started watching this show not expecting to develop a very low opinion of the series but that is what happened after watching it for a few months with family members in the living room. At best, I think the sharks on the show only have the right to be called complete selfish idiots and their behavior is not only harming many of society's victims in domestic abuse, workplace management, and even ongoing violent white collar crime, they actually are harming their own image as you can document with the synopsis of Robert Herjavec's attempted suicide publication that he himself discussed in interviews. It certainly does not surprise me that people at petty and disgusting as those on this show could think they have nothing left to live for with all their money. They are 100% giving many monsters the needed impetus to beat their wives, sicken their children, and ultimately fire good employees that they like to bash, leaving many horribly unemployed even with families. <br/><br/>The reality is in this country shows like this are somehow applauded and not recognized for sick, lame, and pathetic. When you watch this show for a long time, you see that the contests look like they are sick to their stomachs, and not just obviously very uncomfortable. It's like watching a show from another era with a nasty dictator who will look at the kindest and complete people and decide to shame them for not even what could be wrong with anything about them, but just whatever the dictator wants to say that often is not even based in reality. The saddest part of the show is when you feel horrified for the latest insult someone said, like when Kevin O'Leary told someone with a dog nutrition bar that it is ""poop on a stick"" or when he told a completely blind man with a visor, ""you are not dead but you are not really alive,"" or even when he said to one of the most competent presenters according to Barbara and Mark Cuban on the show, ""What if the bigger companies squash you like the cockroach that you are?"" and then realize that the other sharks actually are not being sincere when they start to apologize for the behavior of the comments of Leary or someone else and then say something even more sick or ridiculous to the presenter to show they actually aren't giving a crap about their behavior either and are totally faking feeling mortified for the sharks who act insanely. There is just no redemption in watching a show about American circus clowns feeding off the work and pride of well meaning entrepreneurs who sadly never have the nerve to put the sharks in their place. The unknown statistics that this show is creating in the American circus of murder, violence, and workplace racism and total insanity will forever be unknown. For now, I hope the sharks lose as many professional credits and lasting friendships for being such utter classless and monstrous participants in siphoning off the faith and good will of American workers and families watching the show. I hope everyone watching the show can learn that no matter how much money you have, you still ultimately only have how much value you put into your own self as these clowns ultimately display as an important lesson when they feel personally threatened enough by intellect or looks of the participants to need to try to humiliate them despite being so wealthy. I also hope watchers of the show begin to research how bogus not only the lack of employee rights are in this country compared to almost all of Europe and even major Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, but really we have no rights in our medical field even as an off shoot of catering to sick, psychopaths like this and it is 100% true that everyone in this country who gets terminal diseases such as cancer will never once be told that there was a Nobel Peace Prize given in 1931 for oxygen's ability to stop the growth of cancer so fake ""professionals"" like the show's sharks can continuing ""professionally"" ruining all American life and further dreams. That's what the show's mentality is supporting--low level murder and then ultimately the loss of all rights in this corporate system like medical freedom for even the wealthiest of doctors trying to help anyone or their patients. In this country that likes shows like this, doctors will lose their medical license if they even mention ""Otto Warbug and the Nobel Peace Prize for the halt of the growth of cancer cells"" because clowns like this control the entire medical practice and think that like the pons they insult, reality can be reduced to crap as the sharks so often praise discussing.",10 out of 40 found this helpful.,1.0,19 February 2016
2998,Shark Tank, This show is a terrible insult to sharks.,Sharks kill to eat as all animals do. These people are just vicious school yard greedy bullies. These people are wealthy because they're thieves. They are the lowest of the low. Lower than slugs. They just pounce on people who are just trying make a buck and they just devour them mercilessly. How can they be that way is beyond me. The worst of them is the billionaire Mark Cuban. He has no conscience. There is an honored place in hell just waiting for him. Few humans are as vicious as he is. Thought I'd watch the show to learn how to make some money to improve my life. I rather be a beggar than be like one of those people.

Every episode, I hope that this show has ""grown up"" in its appreciation of women's leadership. And every time I watch, I am disappointed.
The men on this show continue to interrupt the women, leaving the women waiting for an opportunity to speak.

3000,Bizaardvark, What did kids do to deserve this?,"In iCarly's season 2, episode 21, Carly and Sam learns that a network called Dingo Channel is running a show called ""Totally Ten"" that steals ideas from iCarly. For instance, they have ""Random Jumping"" instead of ""Random Dancing"", etc. Just change the name of Dingo to Disney and ""Totally Ten"" to ""Bizaardvark"" and voila, you have another Disney ""original"" series. After watching two episodes (and I will watch no more), I can only say one thing: please, don't recommend this show to the kids, the eighth amendment does not permit to inflict such a cruel and unusual punishment. By the way, in that iCarly episode I mentioned, all the plagiarism finishes when Freddy and Spencer threatens to show the frozen head of Dingo's founder in the web. Well, that's curious, because a well known urban legend says that Walt Disney's body is cryogenically frozen somewhere. Maybe somebody should take old Walt from wherever he is and prevent this show from being renewed for a second season.",45 out of 64 found this helpful.,2.0,26 August 2016
3001,Bizaardvark, Save Your Brain Cells!,"This show has to be one of the worst that Disney has ever created. Not only is it a blatant ripoff of iCarly (even the ""Trivia"" section here says so!), it isn't even *funny.* Please recheck your definition of ""comedy,"" Disney. I could go on, but it would be rather pointless. You all get the idea. <br/><br/>The YouTube ads are also probably the worst that I've ever seen insofar as drawing in potential viewers. I was forced to sit through a 1:15 ad – my ad skipper that day was nonfunctional – and the only thought that I could muster was that I would never want to watch this, kid or no. Most of the ad was of various people either screaming ""BIZAARDVARK!"" or doing ridiculous, unrelated things like jumping over another person's shoulders. Really? At the end of it, I still had no sense of what this show was even supposed to be about. I predict that this show won't be on air for very long at all. <br/><br/>And the latest episode about the girls trying to find the person behind all their hate mail? Well, I can't blame the person. Who in their right mind would want to watch these girls do anything, whether in YouTube or on TV? <br/><br/>Horrendous, in a word.",48 out of 76 found this helpful.,1.0,20 July 2016
3002,Bizaardvark, Freaking Terrible,"This show is a piece of trash, and one of the worst Disney Channel shows in the last ten years. Disney channel is obsessed with making shows mainly about teenage girls that are best friends. Some other examples would be Shake It Up, Liv and Maddie, Girl Meets World and Best Friends Whenever. Shake It Up was not popular enough, and Liv and Maddie was over rated. Like this show BFW is garbage, they are both knockoffs of Girl Meets World. Girl Meets World was one of Disney's best shows, and I think that BFW and Bizaardvark were the reason for GMW's cancellation. This show is basically another Disney show about best friends, except this ripped off Icarly big time. Disney needs to get their act together again and come up with better shows than this show, BFW and that horrible Jessie spin off Bunk'd. Disney channel will probably stop making shows if they can't come up with anything, because Stuck in the Middle and KC Undercover are the only good shows on anymore. I think if they were smart they would never got rid of GMW or made these awful shows ever, It's like they want us to really hate them.",28 out of 45 found this helpful.,1.0,30 March 2017
3003,Bizaardvark," Flawed, But Tons of Fun!","I'm almost 20 years old now, so my taste in television has changed over the years. I still enjoy most of the shows I loved as a child (mostly cartoons from Nick and Cartoon Network) and I still enjoy a lot of sitcoms my mom showed me when I was younger (Friends, Fraiser, Seinfeld, etc). But my love for television remains with shows such as Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, and Halt &amp; Catch Fire. But I do like to tap in to my inner-child every once and awhile. I saw a promo for this show when I was watching an episodes of Star Wars: Rebels. I had NO idea what to make of it and I didn't care. But I was so bored one day and they were giving an episode of this show. The episode in question was Frankie Has a Hater. My only reaction was surprise, because of how many times I laughed. Here are some of the aspects of the show that work and don't work.<br/><br/>Work: 1. Madison Hu as Frankie Wong: Madison Hu (at least in my eyes) as a future in Hollywood. She's cute, talented, and incredibly funny. A large portion of the show's success and enjoyment comes from Hu's performance. The perfect cross between subtle, stoic nuances and a crazy and incredibly relatable outbursts, Madison Hu's Frankie Wong is one of the most memorable characters in recent Disney Channel history.<br/><br/>2. Paige &amp; Amelia: While Madison Hu is the show's brightest show, the series' 2 other main actresses are also enjoyable. Oliva Rodrigo as Paige Olvera and DeVore Ledridge as Amelia Duckworth can best be described as teenage girl versions of Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth and Portia De Rossi's Lindsay Bluth from Arrested Development. One is more sarcastic and relies on her interactions with her environment and other characters. While the other is more self-involved, concerned with her looks, kinda mean, but never gets on your nerves. I also love that Amelia isn't your stereotypical dumb hot blond.<br/><br/>3. The Chemistry Between the Actors: All the actors (while not all great) all work very well together. Hu and Rodrigo especially.<br/><br/>4. No Over-Reliance on Social Media trends: The series could have easily just have been ""LOOK, SOCIAL MEDIA TRENDS! LOOK HOW HIP WE ARE!!!!"". Instead they use SM as a way to show you how all the characters are different.<br/><br/>5. It's Just Plain Fun: The show isn't smart, original, or even great. But I'm glad that this show isn't just mindless or annoying. The show isn't concerned with teaching the audience a lesson (watch Girl Meets World and Andi Mack for that) but it is concerned with making you laugh. And if that was the show's sole goal, well they accomplished it.<br/><br/>Don't Work: 1. Jake Paul as Dirk Mann: This show would be EONS better if Jake Paul wasn't on this show. The difference between him and the 4 other series regulars is that Jake Paul sticks out like a sore thumb. Hu, Rodrigo, Ledridge, and Wacker are all ACTORS. Jake Paul was a viner, not an actor, and there are not the same thing. Paul only works when he doesn't talk. He gets on your nerves, he over does it, and sinks the show's quality very very very low. He should have stayed with Vine. Oh wait...<br/><br/>2. Ethan Wacker as Bernie Schotz: Wacker is not bad in the show, in fact he's actually quite funny. It's just that I hate the treatment of the character.<br/><br/>3. The Treatment of Male Characters: In traditional Disney Channel tradition (even from shows of my youth) the male characters are treated as idiots and jerks. Surprise surprise.<br/><br/>4. The Music: The Bizaardvark songs take up too much time and most of them aren't even funny. Some are, but most of them aren't.<br/><br/>5. A Severe Lack of Memorable (Or Good) Recurring Characters: When it comes to ANY sitcom (or even all kinds of TV shows) you need a memorable cast of characters. Not only series regulars, but recurring characters as well. This show has a few (Belissa, Liam, and others) but the problem is that NONE of them are memorable or even that good. They come and go without any sort of impact on the viewer. Hopefully this changes in Season 2 or in Season 3.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: The show isn't perfect and has a lot of problems, but it has a lot of problems that can be easily fixed. With great lead actresses, interesting humor, and a relatable cast of characters, Bizaardvark is some of the most fun I've had on TV in a long time.

3004,Bizaardvark, Why all the haters?,"My daughter really likes this show. It is funny. The songs are clever. I have never seen iCarly so I don't care if it is a ripoff. We need fun, lighthearted shows that don't center around teenage dating angst and instead focus on smart creative girls and kids who support each other.",30 out of 49 found this helpful.,8.0,21 February 2018
3005,Bizaardvark, It has some flaws but it's better than the other stuff,"First of all, I think the writers did a terrible job with trying to make this show modern and relatable. They're so out of touch, they have little understanding of what YouTube is really like. First of all, everyone in ""Vuuuuuuuugle"" seems to have only one purpose, like their channel is only devoted to one thing that's so ridiculous that no YouTuber would never actually do it (like horse face guy) There don't seem to be any normal video makers, no vloggers, no gaming channels, no comedy channels, none of that. Everyone on here seems to be saying that it's a ripoff of iCarly, but the only thing they share is the whole ""video"" aspect. Literally nothing else.<br/><br/>But, when it all comes down to the big picture, this show isn't THAT bad. I really enjoyed the first episode, but I absolutely hated episodes 2-4. The next 10 or so episodes were nothing special, they were okay. But around the end of of the season I actually started enjoying the show more. At least it doesn't have that stupid ""we have a secret that nobody can find out about"" plot that's been beaten dead by now, and at least it has okay humor, and it's not all just gross fart jokes and juvenile humor like that. And lastly, the characters aren't stereotypical. The main character, an Asian, isn't a typical smart Asian which all the jokes revolve around. All the characters have their own personalities, which most shows can't seem to do nowadays.",21 out of 33 found this helpful.,8.0,26 July 2017
3006,Bizaardvark, iCarly for the new decade of youtube,"I am honestly confused by the negative reviews for this show.<br/><br/>Just about every one of the actors are talented (with the exception of Jake Paul who only works because he's basically doing an impersonation of himself), the characters all have real chemistry, they actually grow from episode to episode, and the main characters are two smart girls who are having fun doing something that they love and have a believable friendship. It helps that the story of each episode comes first. The plot lines aren't written around a single joke.<br/><br/>What I really love is that each character falls into a trope, but those tropes are often tweaked to make these characters feel real.<br/><br/>Paige is sweet and always wants to do the right thing (even if it's what only she thinks is right), but she's not always stardust and sunshine--she is capable of being annoyed and snippy and she doesn't let people walk all over her.<br/><br/>Frankie is sarcastic and skeptical of everything and everyone, but she still has a heart and wants the best for the world around her, even if it means doing or allowing something that she doesn't like in order to make someone else happy.<br/><br/>Amelia is the girlie-girl who loves makeup and fashion, she can be self-centered and shallow, but she's not entirely unaware of her own faults or how she effects the people around her. There's even an episode where she realizes that her being shallow can influence the young girls who watch her to not care about school or their own intelligence, so she tries to change that by pretending to care about those things herself. Does she go about in the absolute wrong way? Yes, but that's what comedy is.<br/><br/>Even Bernie and Dirk, who are admittedly the weakest characters on the show, have their moments of being human rather than walking tropes.<br/><br/>For the reviewers saying that the show is unrealistic, SO WAS iCARLY. Do you really think a teenage girl who lives with her older brother who is stuck in adolescence could afford a that level of a studio in their...what was that space even? An apartment attic? With all the latest hightech gear? No.<br/><br/>So what if Bizaardvark has a building where all the ""youtubers"" hang out and the girls make unrealistically high quality videos. The writers make up for it by being surprisingly aware of what it takes to be on youtube and then work those things into a reality that is entertaining to kids. There's a whole episode about collaborating with other youtubers and how it can either hurt or help your channel. There's an episode about Frankie and Page being upset because the content that takes such little work and creativity is the most popular, while the content that does take those things is often overlooked. There's an episode where Page and Frankie accidentally pander to children and become popular, but have to decide if they want to be popular doing something they hate or invisible doing something that they love. Even within the voogle building, perks are given to the channels based on how many subscribers they have just like on youtube. This show isn't mindless key jingling for kids to rot their brain to. There's actual thought and care behind it that I personally don't think I've seen in one of Disney's live action shows since Wizards of Waverly Place.<br/><br/>Yes, the basic premise is like iCarly, but, honestly, if you watch more than one episode, it's very clear that it's not at all a ""rip off"" of it. Though, it doesn't matter anyways, iCarly came out in 2007 just after youtube first started. Youtube was an entirely different place at the time: Fred was the most popular channel, Shane Dawson was still doing skits, very few people knew what it was and very few people thought they could make anything out of it. Bizaardvark is the iCarly for today's youtube. Every one of the people yelling about it on here just sound like the old farts who are afraid of change and who can't keep up with ""those damn kids.""<br/><br/>Seriously, lighten up and stop trashing a show that WASN'T MADE FOR YOU.",20 out of 32 found this helpful.,8.0,24 July 2018

The jokes aren't funny and Disney isn't taking a step forward with this..........they're falling down flights of steps with it. It's so pathetic, it is Bizarre. Even the theme song is just so bland and stupid. Back to the jokes for a second.......They repeat them over and over! Like this. ""Hey guys"" *bump into each other*. *bump into each other again and again.* The Blobfish song?? THAT ISN'T FUNNY. We don't care if you have a crush on a blobfish. It is exactly like that trash show ""School of Rock"" or ""iCarly"" on Nickelodeon. NOT FUNNY. It already has lots of rants on YouTube from like 8 YEAR OLDS. That's Disney's targeted audience.

You have a stereotypical bitchy fashion guru and a stereotypical dumb daredevil. Not to mention, the jokes are just revoltingly unfunny. I couldn't sit through the beginning without cringing. <br/><br/>All of the ""funny"" moments are just jokes that could have been funny in 2010! And what is with the introduction? It's annoying. Am I suppose to laugh? the one thing I'm confused about is how these writers think of these concepts that even a 9yr old could write. Even if this show has good reviews, these writers are eventually going to run out of ideas. The first episode is so rushed! It would have been better if they actually tried and show more development instead of ""funny"" jokes with a laugh track played every 5 seconds. Also the whole plot with this show is just a scatter. They are hosting a live show? What?<br/><br/>Overall, this show is going to flop. I'm not going to be surprised if they decide to take it off after 10 episodes.

3013,Bizaardvark, So Far Quite Impressive,"It's called ""Bizaardvark"" and involves the video production efforts of two teenage girls whose straight-laced school with its standardized uniforms and robotic student body does not get them. Lacking a creative outlet at school they have turned to online videos to express themselves, discover their identities, and maintain some level of sanity.<br/><br/>This unapologetic ""iCarly"" clone is of interest because it amps up the script sophistication while dialing down the gross-out infantile humor of that series; all the while taking a gentler tone. On its face this would appear illogical as it seems to be contradictory, saying goodbye to the ""basket of deplorables"" portion of the ""iCarly"" demographic while trying to attract some younger viewers and at the same time a more sophisticated audience segment.<br/><br/>Amazingly they seem to have succeeded in both, mostly by vastly improving on""iCarly"" four main characters, while adding a hilarious Southern Belle version of Caroline Sunshine's ""Shake-It-Up"" character. As you become familiar with the series you begin to realize that it is closer in spirit to ""Victorious"" than to ""ICarly"", with much the same undercurrent of healthy subversion.<br/><br/>All five of these actors are easy to take. Olivia Rodrigo and Madison Hu bring a lot of effortless charm to Paige and Frankie. Jack Paul's and Ethan Wacker's characters grow on you after watching and re-watching several episodes. And DeVore Ledridge's Amelia is an absolute gem. The show might be derivative but Amelia breaks conventions by defying stereotypes, she is in effect a parody of herself beneath which one finds that she has considerable dimensionality.<br/><br/>Amelia best illustrates the unifying theme of the show, which is all about Paige and Frankie discovering that the cost of rushing to define and dismiss people is failure to discover important depth and dimensionality in each one of them. They already know this from how they are treated at school but are learning that it applies universally.<br/><br/>The videos each character creates for their respective internet audiences represent them living in their imaginations. And it is at this point that the link to ""Victorious"" becomes most obvious:<br/><br/>'Cause you know that if you live in your imagination, Tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know?

3016,Bizaardvark, A rehash of other terrible Disney Shows...,"Where do I even begin? Watching the first episode, I knew this show would be another obnoxious school-setting show with the most irritating characters. The main characters (already forgot their names, not even worth looking up) are very cliché, bland characters. The supporting characters are just as bland. Very little is going on for them. I cannot see them making more than one season of this show, as the concept can't be looked into any further; it's just a school with ""famous"" web stars. It is literally a rehash of ""A.N.T. Farm,"" which was an absolute disaster. I think Disney should just stick to animated features, as most of their live action shows just don't cut it.",21 out of 45 found this helpful.,1.0,14 July 2016

It's also about the interaction between other channels and content creators within Vuuugle, not just interacting with neighbors.

They are both very physical characters, and they pull it off with the same martial arts-type zeal of actors in any serious crime drama. They are sexy, funny, smart, and compelling. The other characters are equally as interesting; their parts well acted - and they all mesh into a very entertaining show. A show I look forward to watching every week.

Scott Foley is charming, funny and believable. No stranger to action, he leans in to the better side of humanity. Lauren Cohen is the exact opposite. She thinks the worst, expects the worst and goes in hard. Unlike her role in the Walking Dead, Lauren channels the ""tough as nails CIA feel-nothing Clint Eastwood"" vibe.

Something you dont see much of anymore Spring Byington,as the somewhat flustered Aunt Daisy, was an anchor. A kind of ditzy but loving MOM figure.

3051,Laramie, Zealously Guarding Home And Hearth,"Before Laramie became infamously known as the location of Matthew Shepard's murder it was best known as the title of a western set there in old west Wyoming. The premise was young Slim Sherman as played by John Smith and his younger brother Andy (Robert Crawford, Jr.) trying to hang on to the family ranch after their father had been murdered by a cattle baron trying to grab the land.<br/><br/>It was a tough go for the Sherman Brothers and the family cook Jonesy who was played by Hoagy Carmichael. But in that pilot episode a lone Shane like gunfighter Jess Harper showed up. The Shermans took him in and he became a family member with roots at the ranch. After that only fools messed with the Shermans especially if they knew that they had Robert Fuller to mess with as Jess Harper.<br/><br/>Laramie was one of many towns founded as a rail depot of the Union Pacific. But into the hinterlands of Wyoming still one of our most rural states you got some place on horseback or by stage. And the Shermans had a franchise way station at their ranch which I'm sure supplemented their income during a lean year for cattle. It allowed for a whole range of stories combining the stagecoach way station with the ranch.<br/><br/>Laramie had a respectable run of four years. Carmichael and Crawford dropped out and housekeeper Spring Byington and orphan Dennis Holmes joined the Sherman ranch. Bob Fuller went on to a good career, a stint on Wagon Train after Laramie was canceled and later a long run on the Jack Webb produced Emergency.<br/><br/>John Smith had done a few films before Laramie and got a second lead in the John Wayne film Circus World. He dropped out of sight after that and some thirty years later I read in an obituary that he had died of cirrhosis of the liver. There's probably one awfully tragic story there.<br/><br/>But I prefer to remember John Smith as Slim Sherman zealously guarding home and hearth with Jess Harper to back him up.

3052,Laramie, The very best of the Revue Studios produced Westerns that introduce audiences to Robert Fuller who became a huge star in the series Laramie,"Out of all the great TV Westerns that were all over the place during the late-1950's and early-1960's,""Laramie"" turned out to be one of the very best of the Revue Studios produced Westerns,the same production company behind ""Wagon Train"". When ""Laramie"" first premiered in 1959, the series had potential but was shaping up to be something a bit different from the monotonous world of TV Westerns that were popping up during that period. In that same year, 28 different Western-based prime-time shows premiered on all three major television networks with the exception of ""Bonanza"" which was the first prime-time adult Western that was produced and filmed in color. The other Westerns that premiered that same year were produced and filmed in classic black and white ranging from ""Riverboat"", ""The Rebel"",""The Alaskans"",""Wichita Town"",""The Law of the Plainsman"",along with ""Johnny Ringo"",""Shotgun Slade"",""The Deputy starring Henry Fonda"",and ""The Man From Blackhawk"" just to name a few. Most of these Westerns that premiered in 1959 had more or less degenerated into endless shows about either a loner or a couple of buddies shooting it out with bad guys and riding off into the West. Most of these shows lasted a mere two or more seasons with the exception of ""Bonanza"" which lasted an astounding 14-seasons on the air at NBC.<br/><br/>""Laramie"" when it premiered in 1959 attempted to do something far more intriguing: the series focus on two brothers in the Wyoming territory in the mid-1800's that consisted of young Slim (John Smith)who was the lead,and his confused kid brother(Robert Crawford,Jr. whose younger brother Johnny Crawford played Chuck Connors son Mark on ""The Rifleman""). Their relationship was unheard of and not quite like anything else on a Western series at that time with lead to many unexpected and intriguing plots throughout the series entire run. Also that made this show stand out was the two other main characters one of them was Jess Harper(Robert Fuller)who was the unpleasant loner that wanders in the area and was accepted,with qualifications,as part of the group even though the brothers couldn't quite understand his personality whom they first thought of him as a notorious gunslinger at first,but came to accept him as part of the family. Also added in was the secondhand assistant(Hoagy Carmichael)who was part of the operations. During its first season the show didn't quite take off,but only had mediocre ratings as NBC had the decision to either canceled it or ""reimagine"" it. If they have done this the other way, the overall status of ""Laramie"" would have not survived due to competition from the other networks. Instead, NBC kept it on the air but made major changes that included everything that made this show special. By the show's third season,the overall changes were done and this time around the series would be produced and filmed in color. Gone were Robert Crawford,Jr. and Hoagy Carmichael but kept John Smith and Robert Fuller as the two leads. Added to the cast were Spring Byington and Dennis Holmes. Byington's character was portrayed as the sweet old lady who cared for them and Holmes was added in as the young orphan permitted to live with them on the Sherman Ranch.<br/><br/>""Laramie"" premiered on NBC's prime-time schedule on September 15, 1959 and lasted four seasons on the network until the final episode on May 21, 1963. Out of the 124 episodes that this series produced, a total of 64 episodes of the series were in black and white from September 15, 1959 until June 13, 1961. A total of 60 episodes were produced and filmed in color for its final two seasons from September 26, 1961 until May 21, 1963. ""Laramie"" was Robert Fuller's first foray into series television and this was the series that made him a major star. Out of all the cast members that were associated with this series, only two actors Robert Fuller and John Smith were the only two cast members that stayed on throughout its entire run. Robert Crawford was in Season 1 and midway through Season 3(as a guest star). Spring Byington and Dennis Holmes were with the series through Seasons 3 and 4 only. Hoagy Carmichael appeared in Season 1 of the series while actors Stuart Randall and Eddy Waller(who was the stagecoach driver in 19 episodes)appeared during Seasons 1 thru 3 only. The guest star roster who appeared on ""Laramie"" consisted of some Hollywood heavyweights and newcomers ranging from Brian Keith, Dan Duryea, Adam West, Everett Sloane, Anita Sands, Warren Stevens, Thomas Mitchell, Arthur Hunnicutt, to Harry Dean Stanton, R.G. Armstrong, L.Q Jones, Morgan Woodward, to Claude Akins(who appeared four times in various episodes), Julie London, Vera Miles, Ernest Borgnine, John Anderson, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Denny Miller, Rod Cameron(who appeared six times in various episodes),Ron Harper, Jan Merlin, John Lupton, Gregory Walcott, Edgar Buchanan, Dennis Patrick, Lee Van Cleef, Russell Johnson, Gary Clarke, Harry Lauter, George Macready, Alex Cord, Joanne Linville, Lloyd Nolan, Ellen Burstyn, Parley Baer, Ray Danton, Carolyn Jones, Richard Devon, to future Star Trek DeForest Kelley, Lottie Harris, Ed Nelson, to also another future Star Trek Leonard Nimoy, and future Hogan's Heroes Ivan Dixon,and future Green Acres Eddie Albert not to mention future Dallas star Jim Davis and future Dukes of Hazzard Denver Pyle not to mention future Tarzan Jock Mahoney along with future teen heartthrob Tommy Sands.<br/><br/>After the success of ""Laramie"" actor Robert Fuller went on to star in ""Wagon Train"",but his biggest success was yet to come in 1972 when he starred opposite Julie London, Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe in one of the most successful television dramas of the 1970's ""Emergency!"" that was produced by Jack Webb.",19 out of 22 found this helpful.,9.0,30 June 2015
3053,Laramie," Real, true, Americana; no apologies. Bravo!","We recently dumped cable; so much useless and never watched programming for too much dough. My wife installed (had it installed) an antenna and to my delight, through wafting around with the remote, I happened on a Laramie show in progress. I had never seen one. When all those westerns were popular, I was a teen and really didn't watch much TV then, and watched even less western type fare. Anyway, when I saw it recently, I was quickly riveted. I could not believe the verisimilitude of the show. All the little details of farm and ranch implements, the whole layout, including the period dress of the actors, the scenery, was perfect. Most of all, though, was the deep and gripping nostalgia for a time-and I remember it well- when the progeny of the people who conquered this land and made it fruitful, were portrayed without apology as the moral, strong, and brave souls they actually were. That time will come again, I'm sure, though I won't be here to see it, most likely. Laramie was neither Right nor Left. It was dramatized history, and done very very well. I receive it on a network called Gritz. I hope it stays on as long as possible. Hoagy Carmichael, a semi-regular on the show, apparently, wrote ""Stardust,"" one of the most recorded songs ever.

It never skimped on the violence when it came to depicting the many hardships that were encountered by those pioneers who faithfully strove to tame the wildness of the great, old west.<br/><br/>Filmed in b&amp;w (with each episode running approx. 50 minutes), Laramie is definitely a show that I highly recommend to anyone who really appreciates a superb TV Western that stands tall above all the rest.",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,15 September 2013
3055,Laramie," Two brothers (John Smith &amp; Robert Crawford) run a ranch near Laramie, Wyoming.","When it first premiered in 1959, Laramie seemed to be shaping up as something a bit different in what had become (quite quickly) the monotonous world of TV westerns, which had more or less degenerated into endless shows about either a loner or a couple of buddies riding the west. Here was an attempt to do something far more intriguing: a focus on two brothers, young Slim (John Smith), the nearest thing that the show had to a conventional lead, and confused kid brother (Robert Crawford, Jr., whose brother Johnny played Chuck Connors' son on the long-run Rifleman series). Their relationship was believable and complex and not quite like anything else on a western at that time, leading to many unexpected and intriguing plots. Also impressive were the two other main characters - Robert Fuller as a rather unpleasant loner who wandered in to the area and was accepted, with qualifications, as part of the group, though the brothers couldn't quite understand his melancholy personality, and Hoagy Charmichael, that wonderful musical star from the big band era, as a strangely cynical and always ironic Greek chorus-like commentator on the action. The show didn't quite take off, had only mediocre ratings, and NBC had to decide to either cancel it or 'reimagine' it. If they had done the latter, this might be recalled as one of those great one-season classics that was too 'different' to survive. Instead, NBC decided to keep it on the air but remove everything that made the show special. So gone were both the little brother and Hoagy; Slim, the conventional lead, was relatively unchanged, and Robert Fuller's ""anger"" was ""toned down"" to the point that it didn't really add up to anything any more. The show, now in color, was one more ordinary series about two cool guys riding the west together. If there was anything at all different about it now, that was the addition of Spring Byington as a sweet old lady who cared for them, like the aunt who oversees Batman and Robin in the mansion, though this only brought a 'December Bride' sentimentality to the series. Wouldn't you know it - the moment that the show became more conventional, it picked up in the ratings quite considerably and ran for three more mostly mediocre years.",31 out of 42 found this helpful.,,20 March 2006
3056,Laramie, must see series,too bad we cannot get the old real good series that used to be.  we have stations that claim to be western channels but none of the series are ever on.  why?  this was one of the greats like WAGON TRAIN.  Better than gunsmoke.  if you ever get a chance watch it.,27 out of 37 found this helpful.,,8 September 2002
3057,Laramie, Galloping Across the Screen,"I can remember quite clearly the opening of ""Laramie"" where the characters Slim and Jesse are seem galloping across the plains of Wyoming. Even all these years later the scene, backed by the inspiring music, makes me feel happy. Slim and Jesse operate a stagecoach depot on the route between Denver and Laramie. I did like the characters of Jonesy and Andy as well. Jonesy added some comic relief to the brutality of the old west. I think Slim and Jesse had perfect chemistry as partners. I did enjoy the episodes that featured them both rather than the ones where they rode alone as solos. I try to watch ""Laramie"" every day when I get home from work.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,16 September 2016
3058,Laramie, Nostalgia is a good thing!,"The rocky friendship between the two, Slim and Jess gives the series a cohesiveness that could only produce sparks one moment and an easy going working relationship the next. I really enjoy seeing the show 60 years later.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,18 September 2018
3059,Laramie, Laramie/Robert Fuller,"OK, from the very first episode I was I love with Robert Fuller and the series. I spent my youth (omg) watching every western ever made for TV. I find now that I still watch Laramie reruns on GRIT and STARZEncore . To my amazement I find the same people show up as ""villains or have small roles"" anywhere from one to five times a season. This I never noticed before, probably because I didn't care then. Other than Laramie I now watch John Wayne westerns. Oh well, there really isn't much on TV anymore anyway. My granddaughter got the IMDb icon for my iPad so I could look information for myself. It really is very helpful and I like it. She got tired of having to look up everything for me and I couldn't read her phone anyway.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,16 January 2017
3060,Laramie, JESS my true love from Laramie!,"We Agree With You About LARAMIE &amp; Jess Harper. In my youth I didn't take notice of John Smith until he came to Laramie. My family wasn't the kind to go out to movies, so catching up on some of those oldies is fabulous................................. You really can't compare them as one better than another. I think seeing Bob more discussed and talked about on his group has us pretty much in mode of admiring his work more because we have not all seen more of the stuff out there done by John Smith. There is one western on the western channel that runs quite often. I have it on DVD, but every time it's on, I have to sit and watch it (especially the saloon fight scene-Mary knows the one). Like Bob, John was very talented and could play good guy or bad guy equally well. And in many of the ""draw"" scenes, he was very proficient with the gun, as well. When he and Bob draw together, they are almost timed equally. If that was done by direction or by their natural talents, I can't say, but seeing John drawing on his own, he was very comfortable in doing a fast gun role. It's hard to believe that Slim was that fast with a gun, not being raised to be a gun fighter, to be a rancher. But back then, it was probably an asset to know you could hold your own.<br/><br/>Looking back at both in other movies or TV shows, it seems that John was more able to be a different person for each role. Bob put a lot of Jess in so many of the characters he played. Even as a doctor, he had a few rough edges (apparently from his boyhood) and could stand up to a fight. Yes, he did play each character differently, but I always saw a little Jess in him, even those movies before there was a Jess. I think it's just Bob putting Bob into every role, really, and like he says, he's really Jess :)<br/><br/>Both of our heroes were equally talented and did things somewhat differently, but both portrayed the characters they were playing to the hilt, both equally believable in their roles.<br/><br/>I wish back then the censors weren't so radical. Okay, they're too loose now, but a little more use of their talents, there could have been some really hot scenes! You could see it in the scenes where they were limited to showing much fire. Could you imagine Laramie today? I wonder if we would appreciate it as much? It might have been those censors that helped keep it a quality show, maybe a bit too tame, but always pointing toward a good lesson learned.<br/><br/>I was attracted to the superficial aspects of Laramie as a child. I was just going into my teens and I guess I was at that stage where girls go through liking ""the bad boy"" and Jess sure fit my bill. He was a good, bad boy. If you have to fall for a bad boy, it's great that he has some redeeming characteristics, Jess had that. I think I pretty much identified with Andy at the time. Admired Jess and felt Slim as more like a big brother. And yes, Slim was so very handsome. I'm sure I noticed back then, but my eyes were only for Jess at the time.<br/><br/>Yeah, I have to say, trying to make a comparison of both of their abilities, they played their roles in their own particular ways, neither one better than the other, just different.<br/><br/>Okay, I babbled long enough. I think I need a Laramie fix.",13 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,3 November 2008
3061,Laramie, great series,"The cast and story line was near perfect ... robert fuller never lived up to his potential in this tv battle of guns and minds ... jess kept defering to slim as the hero probably for the sake of the younger brother and respect for matt... anyway, fuller went on to bigger ambitions while john smith rode off into the sunset ...i liked the color versions better than the b&amp;w",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,4 June 2018
3062,Laramie, First heartthrobs....,I was checking out the free TV shows on Xfinity cable and came across the series LARAMIE which was the first Western (and probably the first American TV show) I remember and LOVED as a child of 6 or 7 yrs old In Scotland. I guess LASSIE was its competition and then I went on to love RAWHIDE .... I am thrilled to watch it again after all these years as I have waited and waited for it to show up in RE-runs somewhere. I can remember the great theme tune and score like it was yesterday and the stories are as enjoyable today as they were back then. Always full of family values and a good moral each tale. So well cast and interesting to read that the roles were originally reversed .. which wouldn't have worked nearly as good.,1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,5 September 2020
3063,Laramie, Plot Cycle Quite Short,"Got back into watching it after 60 year hiatus. Realize now that the same ol' plot was rehashed many times. Jess is mistaken for a horrible outlaw, Slim is mistaken for a horrible outlaw, Slim, as acting sheriff has ID, badge stolen, and you guessed it, mistaken for outlaw. Jess, as stand in deputy gets ID stolen and is mistaken for nuclear scientist, er.... a..no..no... outlaw. With all the erroneous posters with each of the two guys as wanted men in various shows it's a wonder they have lived past 25. Bad writing gets 'em 5 stars.",0 out of 2 found this helpful.,7.0,9 June 2020
3064,Laramie, Guests,"Did Randolph Scott ever make a guest appearance on Laramie? If not, there was an actor who strongly resembled Mr. Scott.
